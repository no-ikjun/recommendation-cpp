 = Tupolev Tu @-@ 85 = 
 The Tupolev Tu @-@ 85 ( USAF / DoD reporting name ' Type 31 ' , NATO reporting name Barge ) was a Soviet prototype strategic bomber based on the Tu @-@ 4 , an unlicensed reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress . It was the ultimate development of the B @-@ 29 family , being over 50 % heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range . Only two prototypes were built before the program was canceled in favor of the Tupolev Tu @-@ 95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range . 
 = = Development = = 
 Neither the Tu @-@ 4 nor the Tupolev Tu @-@ 80 was a true intercontinental strategic bomber as they both lacked the range to attack the United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return . The Tu @-@ 85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel @-@ efficient engines , a redesigned wing to increase the lift / drag ratio and the addition of more fuel . A large number of engines were considered before settling on the 4 @,@ 500 @-@ horsepower ( 3 @,@ 400 kW ) Shvetsov ASh @-@ 2K , essentially two air @-@ cooled ASh @-@ 82 radial engines paired together and the liquid @-@ cooled 4 @,@ 300 @-@ horsepower ( 3 @,@ 200 kW ) Dobrynin VD @-@ 4K six @-@ bank inline engine , similar in configuration to the failed German Junkers Jumo 222 . Both engines were given turbochargers and power @-@ recovery turbines which converted them into turbo @-@ compound engines . The Shvetsov design was preferred , but was not yet mature enough for use , and the VD @-@ 4K was selected . A lot of effort was put into refining the design of the wing in collaboration with TsAGI . It had an aspect ratio of 11 @.@ 745 and a taper of 2 @.@ 93 for optimum lift at high @-@ altitudes . The Tu @-@ 85 carried 63 @,@ 600 litres ( 16 @,@ 800 US gal ) of fuel in 48 flexible tanks . 
 Much of the armament and equipment was derived from those of the late @-@ model Tu @-@ 4 , including the four remotely controlled dorsal and ventral turrets and the tail turret , each with two 23 mm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) Nudelman @-@ Rikhter NR @-@ 23 cannon . But the Tu @-@ 85 's tail turret had an Argon ranging radar and each of the two bomb bays was enlarged to hold a 9 @,@ 000 kg ( 20 @,@ 000 lb ) FAB @-@ 9000 bomb . 
 Actual design work began in August 1949 and was ratified by a directive from the Council of Ministers dated 16 September that required the first prototype to be ready for manufacturer 's tests in December 1950 . Construction of the first aircraft began in July 1950 and was completed in September . It first flew on 9 January 1951 and the manufacturer 's tests lasted until October 1951 . On 12 September the first prototype flew 9 @,@ 020 km ( 5 @,@ 600 mi ) with a bomb load of 5 @,@ 000 kg ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) and landed with enough fuel remaining to have covered 12 @,@ 018 km ( 7 @,@ 468 mi ) . The second prototype , sometimes referred to as the <unk> ( Russian : <unk> ) or 85 / 2 , incorporated the lessons learned from the first aircraft , including revision and reinforcement of the airframe and a variety of changes to its equipment and systems . It was first flown on 28 June 1951 and its trials lasted until November 1951 . Series production was approved on 23 March 1951 at three factories where it would succeed the Tu @-@ 4 on the production line , but this was reversed later in the year and the program was cancelled : in the Korean War Soviet MiG @-@ 15s brought down many US B @-@ 29 bombers , showing that there was no future for piston aircraft in combat use . Priority was given to the higher performance turboprop Tu @-@ 95 ' Bear ' , as its own turboprop powerplants , the TV @-@ 12 prototype series for the Kuznetsov NK @-@ 12 turboprops that power the Tu @-@ 95 to this day , was already generating 12 @,@ 000 shp as early as 1951 .

 = Pennsylvania Route 183 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 183 ( PA 183 ) is a 31 @.@ 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 51 @.@ 0 km ) route that runs north to south in southeastern Pennsylvania . The southern terminus is at U.S. Route 422 Business ( US 422 Bus . ) in Reading in Berks County . Its northern terminus is at PA 61 near Schuylkill Haven in Schuylkill County . The road passes through developed areas near Reading before continuing north through rural areas , crossing from Berks County into Schuylkill County at Blue Mountain . PA 183 serves the communities of Bernville , Strausstown , and Cressona . 
 Much of what is now PA 183 was originally designated as part of Pennsylvania Route 83 in 1927 , a route that ran from US 30 / PA 1 in Devon northwest to US 120 / PA 42 ( now PA 61 ) near Schuylkill Haven . PA 83 was realigned to a more direct route in northern Berks County by 1960 , bypassing a jog to the west through Rehrersburg . By 1966 , PA 83 was renumbered to PA 183 to avoid duplication with Interstate 83 ( I @-@ 83 ) and the southern terminus was cut back to its current location in Reading . The alignment of PA 83 between Devon and Reading became a part of other state routes , with some portions becoming unnumbered .

 PA 183 begins at US 422 Bus. in the downtown area of Reading in Berks County . The northbound direction begins at the intersection of North 3rd Street and Franklin Street and heads west concurrent with westbound US 422 Bus. on one @-@ way Washington Street , carrying three lanes of traffic . Southbound PA 183 ends at the intersection of 2nd Street and Penn Street , following US 422 Bus. westbound south on North 2nd Street , a one @-@ way street with four lanes of traffic . Past the concurrency with US 422 Bus . , PA 183 heads west on the two @-@ lane undivided Washington Street , passing to the north of Reading Area Community College . The route passes through commercial areas before turning north onto Front Street and entering residential areas . At the intersection with Walnut Street , PA 183 splits into a one @-@ way pair that carries two lanes in each direction , with the northbound direction remaining along Front Street and the southbound direction following Schuylkill Avenue . Front Street heads north while Schuylkill Avenue angles northwest , with the one @-@ way pair continuing through areas of homes and passing over Norfolk Southern 's Harrisburg Line . Schuylkill Avenue becomes a two @-@ way , two @-@ lane road at the Green Street intersection . Northbound PA 183 turns west on two @-@ way , two @-@ lane Windsor Street to rejoin southbound PA 183 on four @-@ lane undivided Schuylkill Avenue . Along this one @-@ way pair , northbound PA 183 is city @-@ maintained . The highway heads northwest , passing over a Norfolk Southern railroad line and the Schuylkill River on a bridge . 
 The roadway passes commercial establishments before coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern 's Reading Line , at which point it enters residential areas . PA 183 comes to an interchange with the PA 12 freeway ( Warren Street Bypass ) that is connected via local streets . Here , the roadway narrows to two lanes . A short distance later , the route enters Bern Township and becomes Bernville Road , passing through a golf course before heading past a mix of homes and businesses in Greenfield Manor . The road passes to the south of Reading Regional Airport , gaining a center left @-@ turn lane before heading past industrial parks and St. Joseph Medical Center . PA 183 widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway as it comes to an interchange with the US 222 freeway . 
 Past the US 222 interchange , the route narrows back into a two @-@ lane undivided road and passes businesses and homes in the community of <unk> . Farther northwest , the roadway heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with development . PA 183 heads west and crosses into Penn Township , continuing through more rural areas with some homes . The route passes through Pleasant Valley and passes to the north of Blue Marsh Lake , curving to the northwest . The road continues through wooded areas and fields with some residences as it continues along the northeastern side of the lake . Past Blue Marsh Lake , PA 183 enters Bernville and passes to the west of residential and commercial development in the town . The road leaves Bernville , at which point it briefly passes through Jefferson Township and Penn Township again before continuing back into Jefferson Township . The route passes through agricultural areas with some trees and development , curving to the north . 
 PA 183 enters Upper Tulpehocken Township and heads northwest again through more rural areas of farms and woods as an unnamed road . Farther northwest , the roadway passes along the northeastern border of Strausstown , at which point it crosses Old Route 22 . Continuing through more of Upper Tulpehocken Township , the route comes to an interchange with I @-@ 78 / US 22 . Past this interchange , PA 183 passes through more areas of farmland and development before curving west into forested areas and entering Bethel Township , where it comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 419 . Following this , the road heads north and ascends Blue Mountain .

 At the summit of Blue Mountain , PA 183 widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway , crossing the Appalachian Trail and entering Wayne Township in Schuylkill County , The route descends the mountain and becomes a three @-@ lane undivided road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane . The road narrows to two lanes and continues north through wooded areas with some farm fields and residences , coming to an intersection with PA 895 . The route heads through more rural areas with some homes , passing through <unk> . PA 183 comes to a junction with PA 443 and heads northeast through more farms , woods , and homes . The route crosses into North Manheim Township and becomes Chestnut Street , where it curves to the east . The road passes through more rural areas , becoming the border between Cressona to the north and North Manheim Township to the south before fully entering Cressona . 
 At this point , PA 183 heads into residential areas before coming to a bridge under a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line . A short distance before passing under the railroad , PA 183 Truck splits to the north to bypass the low @-@ clearance underpass .

 When Pennsylvania designated legislative routes in 1911 , what is now PA 183 was not given a legislative number . In 1927 , PA 83 was designated to run from US 30 / PA 1 in Devon northwest to US 120 / PA 42 ( now PA 61 ) near Schuylkill Haven . The route headed north from Devon to Valley Forge on Devon State Road , where it continued northwest concurrent with PA 23 through Phoenixville . Northwest of here , PA 83 headed northwest parallel to the Schuylkill River to Reading , where it turned north to follow Poplar Neck Road and 9th Street before heading west along US 22 / PA 3 on Penn Street . From Reading , PA 83 followed the current alignment of PA 183 to northwest of Bernville , where it headed to the west to Rehrersburg before heading north . In Schubert , the route continued north along the current alignment of PA 183 to Schuylkill Haven . PA 83 followed the alignment of Legislative Route 201 between Valley Forge and North Coventry Township and Legislative Route 147 between North Coventry Township and Reading . The route had a total length of about 72 miles ( 116 km ) . 
 When first designated , all of PA 83 was paved except the portion between Rehrersburg and the intersection with PA 443 . The remaining unpaved portion was paved by 1940 . PA 83 was split into a one @-@ way pair in downtown Reading by 1953 , being rerouted from following US 422 on Penn Street to following Chestnut Street westbound and Franklin Street eastbound , where it ran concurrent with US 422 Alt . By 1960 , PA 83 was realigned to a more direct alignment between Bernville and Schubert , passing through Strausstown . PA 83 was renumbered to PA 183 by 1966 to avoid conflict with I @-@ 83 , which was located in South Central Pennsylvania . Also , the southern terminus was cut back to US 422 Bus. in Reading . The former alignment of PA 83 between Devon and Reading became an unnumbered road between Devon and the intersection with PA 252 , PA 252 between there and Valley Forge , solely PA 23 between Valley Forge and Phoenixville , PA 724 between Phoenixville and southeast of Reading , and an unnumbered road between there and Reading . The PA 83 designation is not currently used in Pennsylvania .

 = John Keats 's 1819 odes = 
 In 1819 , John Keats composed six odes , which are among his most famous and well @-@ regarded poems . Keats wrote the first five poems , " Ode on a Grecian Urn " , " Ode on Indolence " , " Ode on Melancholy " , " Ode to a Nightingale " , and " Ode to Psyche " in quick succession during the spring , and he composed " To Autumn " in September . While the exact order in which Keats composed the poems is unknown , some critics contend that they form a thematic whole if arranged in sequence . As a whole , the odes represent Keats 's attempt to create a new type of short lyrical poem , which influenced later generations . 
 = = Background = = 
 Early in 1819 , Keats left his poorly paid position as dresser ( or assistant house surgeon ) at Guy 's Hospital , Southwark , London to completely devote himself to a career in poetry . In the past , he had relied on his brother George for financial assistance from time to time , but now , when his brother appealed to him for the same aid , the cash @-@ strapped poet was unable to help and was overwhelmed with guilt and despair . He decided to forsake the life of a poet for a more lucrative career – but not before allowing himself a few months of poetic indulgence . 
 It was during the months of spring 1819 that he wrote many of his major odes . Following the month of May 1819 , he began to tackle other forms of poetry , including a play , some longer pieces , and a return to his unfinished epic , Hyperion . His brother 's financial woes continued to loom over him , and , as a result , Keats had little energy or inclination for composition , but , on 19 September 1819 , he managed to squeeze out To Autumn , his last major work and the one that rang the curtain down on his career as a poet . 
 = = Structure = = 
 After writing " Ode to Psyche " , Keats sent the poem to his brother and explained his new ode form : " I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet stanza than we have . The legitimate does not suit the language well , from the pouncing rhymes ; the other appears too elegiac , and the couplet at the end of it has seldom a pleasing effect . I do not pretend to have succeeded . It will explain itself . " 
 Writing these poems had a particular influence on Keats , as Walter Jackson Bate explains : 
 However felicitous he may have been in writing them , these short poems of one of the greatest of English <unk> are the by @-@ product of other efforts ; and those habits of both ideal and practice left him more dissatisfied than he would otherwise have been with the pressure of most lyric forms toward quick , neat solution [ ... ] The new ode form appealed also because it was sufficiently confining to challenge his conscience as a craftsman . Finally , the union of amplitude and formal challenge offered unique opportunities as well for the concentrated intensity and concreteness of idiom that he had begun to master in Hyperion 
 In " Ode to Psyche " , Keats incorporated a narrative structure that sets the scene , gives background information , and then ends with a conclusion . Of these structural elements , the preface was discontinued in his next odes and the setting is reduced within the other odes until the scene is merely implied . 
 = = Poems = = 
 The exact chronological and interpretive orders of the six 1819 poems are unknown , but " Ode to Psyche " was probably written first and " To Autumn " last . Keats simply dated the others May 1819 . However , he worked on the spring poems together , and they form a sequence within their structures . 
 = = = Ode on a Grecian Urn = = = 
 " Ode on a Grecian Urn " is a lyric ode with five stanzas containing 10 lines each . The first stanza begins with the narrator addressing an ancient urn as " Thou still unravished bride of quietness ! " , initiating a conversation between the poet and the object , which the reader is allowed to observe from a third @-@ person point of view . By describing the object as a " foster @-@ child of silence and slow time " , the poet describes the urn as both a silent object , a theme which <unk> throughout the poem , and a stone object that resists change . 
 Throughout the first two stanzas , the speaker addresses the urn as a single object , taking note of its silence at several points as he discusses unheard melodies and tunes heard not by the sensual ear ( line 13 ) . In Keats , Narrative , and Audience , Andrew Bennett suggests that the discussion between the poet and the urn at the beginning of the poem leaves the reader to examine more than just the relationship between the two but also his place as a third @-@ party observer . With line 17 , the second stanza begins to change tone as the poet shifts his focus from the urn as a whole to the individuals represented in the artwork . The two lovers , whose image the unknown artist has created through his craftsmanship , appear to the poet as a couple who cannot kiss yet do not grow old . Again the narrator discusses the urn in terms of its <unk> qualities by saying , " She cannot fade , though thou hast not thy bliss " ( line 19 ) , but he also focuses on the inability of the lovers to ever obtain sensual pleasure due to their static nature . 
 As the poem comes to a close , the narrator once again addresses the urn as a single object . However , his tone becomes sharper as he seeks answers from the work of art that it appears unable to answer . In the final couplet , the poet provides a line for the urn , which complicates the narrative and has generated a multitude of critical responses as to the author 's intent : " Beauty is truth — truth beauty / that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know " ( lines 49 – 50 ) . 
 = = = Ode on Indolence = = = 
 " Ode on Indolence " comprises six stanzas containing ten lines each . The poem discusses a morning of laziness on the part of the narrator , during which his attention becomes captivated by three figures he sees in a vision . Beginning with an epitaph taken from Matthew 6 : 28 , the poet introduces the theme of indolence through an excerpt of Jesus 's suggestion that God provides for the lilies of the field without making them toil . The poem describes the three figures as wearing " placid sandals " and " white robes " , which alludes to the Grecian mythology that commonly appears in the 1819 odes . The images pass the narrator three times , which causes him to compare them to images on a spinning urn ( line 7 ) . In line 10 , the narrator uses the word " <unk> " again as a reference to the Elgin marbles , whose creation was thought to have been overseen by Phidias , a Grecian artist . As the poem progresses , the narrator begins to discuss the intrusion upon his indolence by the figures of Love , Ambition , and Poesy , and he suggests that the images have come to " steal away " his idle days . In the final stanzas , the figure of Poesy is described as a daemon which Helen Vendler suggests poses a direct threat to the idleness the poet wishes to retain . In the final lines , the poet once again rejects the three images : " Vanish , ye phantoms , from my idle <unk> , / Into the clouds , and never more return ! " ( lines 39 – 40 ) with the intention of once again enjoying the laziness from which the poem obtains its title . 
 = = = Ode on Melancholy = = = 
 " Ode on Melancholy " is the shortest of the 1819 spring odes at three stanzas of 10 lines . Originally , the poem contained four stanzas , but the original first stanza was removed before publication in 1820 for stylistic reasons . The poem describes the narrator 's opinions on melancholy and is addressed specifically to the reader , unlike the narrative of many of the other odes . The lyric nature of the poem allows the poet to describe the onset of melancholy and then provides the reader with different methods of dealing with the emotions involved . Using personification , the poem creates characters out of Joy , Pleasure , Delight , and Beauty , and allows them to interact with two other characters which take the shape of a male and his female mistress mentioned ( line 17 ) . Keats himself fails to appear as a character in the poem , as there is no mention of the poet himself suffering from melancholy . In the final stanza , the poet describes the mistress as dwelling in Beauty , but modifies the beauty by saying that it " must die " ( line 21 ) . Harold Bloom suggests that this provides the poem with a hint of Keats 's philosophy of negative capability , as only the beauty that will die meets the poem 's standard of true beauty . The image of the bursting of Joy 's grape ( line 28 ) gives the poem a theme of sexuality . According to critics , the bursting of the grape alludes to the passing from the moment of ultimate sexual pleasure to the decreased pleasure of a post @-@ orgasmic state . 
 = = = Ode to a Nightingale = = = 
 " Ode to a Nightingale " is the longest of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas containing 10 lines each . The poem begins by describing the state of the poet , using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet 's physical state such as " <unk> pains " and " not through envy of thy happy lot " ( lines 1 – 5 ) . While the ode is written " to a Nightingale " , the emphasis of the first line is placed upon the narrator rather than the bird , and Helen Vendler suggests that the negation of the reader as a party in the discourse happens just as the song of the nightingale becomes the " voice of pure self @-@ expression " . In the third stanza , the poet asks the nightingale to " Fade far away " , casting it off just as the narrator in " Ode to Indolence " rejects the Love , Ambition , and Poesy and the poet in " Ode on a Grecian Urn " banishes the figures on the urn to silence . In the fourth stanza , the poet states that he will fly to the nightingale rather than it to him , moving upon the " wings of Poesy " , which leaves Walter Jackson Bate to believe that while the poet intends to identify with the bird by describing the poem as being " to " it , the real identification in the narrative exists between the poet and his perceptions of the nightingale 's song . In its closing , the poem questions whether the bird 's song has been real or part of a dream : " Was it a vision , or a waking dream ? / Fled is that music : — do I wake or sleep ? " ( lines 79 – 80 ) , and the theme of imagination once again arises as the poet appears , according to Timothy Hilton , unable to distinguish between his own artistic imagination and the song which he believes to have spurred it into action . 
 = = = Ode to Psyche = = = 
 " Ode to Psyche " is a 67 @-@ line poem written in stanzas of varying length , which took its form from modification Keats made to the sonnet structure . The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character , displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with " O <unk> ! " ( line 1 ) . Psyche , a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself , draws the attention of the narrator , whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her : " Surely I dream 'd to @-@ day , or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken 'd eyes " ( lines 5 – 6 ) . As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid , he confuses the god 's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman 's beauty . The poet does , however , understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares , " even in these days [ ... ] I see , and sing , by my own eyes inspired " ( lines 40 – 43 ) . In line 50 , the poet states " Yes , I will be thy priest , and build a fane " , which , Harold Bloom suggests , implies that the poet himself becomes a " prophet of the soul " as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid 's <unk> according to T.S. Eliot , it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes . 
 = = = To Autumn = = = 
 " To Autumn " is a 33 line poem broken into three stanzas of 11 . It discusses how autumn is both a force of growth and maturation , and deals with the theme of approaching death . While the earlier 1819 odes perfected techniques and allowed for variations that appear within " To Autumn " , Keats dispenses with some aspects of the previous poems ( such as the narrator ) to focus on the themes of autumn and life . The poem discusses ideas without a progression of the temporal scene , an idea that Keats termed as " stationing " . The three stanzas of the poem emphasize this theme by shifting the imagery from summer to early winter and also day turning into dusk . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Keats 's use of the odal hymn in his six odes , along with his use of the odal hymn with a <unk> voice in " Ode to a Grecian Urn " and " Ode to a Nightingale " , created , according to Walter Jackson Bate , " a new tone for the English lyric . " Bate , when speaking about the 1819 odes , wrote : " The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer . Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning . It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning . " In addition to this , Bate argued that " It is because " To Autumn " is so uniquely a distillation , and at many different levels , that each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English . We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [ ... ] The ' Ode to a Nightingale , ' for example , is a less ' perfect ' though a greater poem . " Charles Patterson argued the relationship of " Ode on a Grecian Urn " as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats , " The meaningfulness and range of the poem , along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery , entitle it to a high place among Keats 's great odes . It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of " To Autumn " but is much superior in these qualities to the " Ode to a Nightingale " despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over @-@ all structure . In fact , the " Ode on a Grecian Urn " may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom . " Later , Ayumi <unk> argued that early audiences did not support " Ode to Psyche " because it " turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture . For the same reason , the " Ode on a Grecian Urn " drew neither attention nor admiration . Herbert Grierson believed " Nightingale " to be superior to the other odes because it and " To Autumn " were more logical and contained stronger arguments . Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza , the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of ' idylls ' . "

The history of the borough stretches back to the 12th century ; including involvement in the spread of the Black Death , the settlement of the Americas , the development of Georgian architecture , and preparations for World War II . 
 = = History = = 
 Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour , an outlying part of Wyke Regis . The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards , but was not noted until the 13th century . By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough . Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour ; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310 . French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole . 
 Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348 , possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship . In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry , but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough . Both towns have become known as Weymouth , despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre . The villages of Upwey , Broadwey , Preston , Wyke Regis , Chickerell , <unk> , Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built @-@ up area . 
 King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s : Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown . Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion . During the English Civil War , around 250 people were killed in the local <unk> Conspiracy in February 1645 . In 1635 , on board the ship Charity , around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth , Massachusetts . More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth , Nova Scotia and Salem , Massachusetts ; then called <unk> . There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower . 
 The architect Sir Christopher Wren was the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702 , and controlled nearby Portland 's quarries from 1675 to 1717 . When he designed St Paul 's Cathedral , Wren had it built out of Portland Stone , the famous stone of Portland 's quarries . Sir James Thornhill was born in the White Hart public house in Melcombe Regis and became the town 's MP in 1722 . Thornhill became an artist , and coincidentally decorated the interior of St Paul 's Cathedral . 
 The resort is among the first modern tourist destinations , after King George III 's , brother the Duke of Gloucester built a grand residence there , Gloucester Lodge , and passed the mild winter there in 1780 ; the King made Weymouth his summer holiday residence on fourteen occasions between 1789 and 1805 , even venturing into the sea in a bathing machine . A painted statue of the King stands on the seafront , called the King 's Statue , which was renovated in 2007 / 8 by stripping 20 layers of paintwork , replacing it with new paints and gold leaf , and replacing the iron framework with a stainless steel one . A mounted white horse representing the King is carved into the chalk hills of <unk> . 
 Weymouth 's esplanade is composed of Georgian terraces , which have been converted into apartments , shops , hotels and guest houses . The buildings were constructed in the Georgian and Regency periods between 1770 and 1855 , designed by architects such as James Hamilton , and were commissioned by wealthy businessmen , including those that were involved in the growth of Bath . These terraces form a long , continuous arc of buildings which face Weymouth Bay along the esplanade , which also features the multi @-@ coloured Jubilee Clock , erected in 1887 to mark the 50th year of Queen Victoria 's reign . Statues of Victoria , George III and Sir Henry Edwards , Member of Parliament for the borough from 1867 to 1885 , and two war memorials stand along the Esplanade . 
 In the centre of the town lies Weymouth Harbour ; although it was the reason for the town 's foundation , the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis ( the main town centre ) and Weymouth ( the southern harbourside ) from each other . Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour . The present Town Bridge , built in 1930 , is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth for the first time on 26 January 1869 . A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use , although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon . 
 During World War I , approximately 120 @,@ 000 ANZAC personnel convalesced in Weymouth after being injured at Gallipoli or other theatres of the war . Weymouth and Portland were bombed by German planes in World War II ; Portland harbour had a large naval base , and Weymouth was home to Nothe Fort , next to Nothe Gardens . 517 @,@ 816 troops embarked through the borough to fight at the Battle of Normandy . The Bouncing bomb was tested in the Fleet lagoon to the west of town . The history of the area is documented at the <unk> museum in Brewers Quay . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The district of Weymouth and Portland was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , and merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and the nearby Portland urban district . For local elections the district is divided into 15 wards , 12 of them in Weymouth . Elections take place in a four @-@ year cycle ; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re @-@ election in years one , two and three , and county council elections are held in year four . The Mayor of Weymouth and Portland is Ray Banham ( Liberal Democrat ) , Kate <unk> ( Labour Party ) is Deputy Mayor . 
 Weymouth , Portland and the Purbeck district are in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency , created in 1885 . The constituency elects one Member of Parliament ; currently Richard Drax ( Conservative ) . 
 For European Parliament elections , South Dorset , the rest of South West England , and Gibraltar form the South West England constituency . 
 Dorset South was the most marginal Labour seat in the 2001 general election , won by 153 votes . Jim Knight was expecting to have a difficult 2005 election , yet he won with a margin of 1 @,@ 812 votes — this was in contrast to other areas , where Labour suffered a decline in popularity . This was helped by a high @-@ profile anti @-@ Conservative campaign by musician Billy Bragg . The seat was gained from Labour by Drax for the Conservatives at the 2010 General Election . 
 Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of <unk> in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Germany since 1986 , and the French town of Louviers , in the department of Eure in Normandy , since 1959 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Weymouth is situated on the western shore of Weymouth Bay on the south coast of England , 195 kilometres ( 120 mi ) west @-@ southwest of London , at 50 ° 37 ′ N 2 ° 27 ′ W ( 50 @.@ 613 , − 2 @.@ 457 ) . The town is built on weak sand and clay rock which in most places along the Dorset coast , except for narrow bands at Lulworth Cove , Swanage and Durdle Door , has been eroded and transported away . This weak rock has been protected at Weymouth by Chesil Beach and the strong limestone Isle of Portland that lies offshore , 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) south of Wyke Regis . The island affects the tides of the area , producing a double low tide in Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour . The maximum tidal range is small , at around 2 metres ( 7 ft ) . 
 There are two lakes in the borough , both RSPB Nature Reserves — Radipole Lake in the town centre , and <unk> between the town centre and Preston . Radipole Lake , the largest nature reserve , and mouth of the River Wey before it flows into Weymouth Harbour , is an important habitat for fish and migratory birds , and over 200 species of plants . Radipole is an important tourist attraction ; it and Weymouth Beach are situated very close to the main town centre . There are 11 Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the borough , which cover an area of 800 @.@ 87 hectares ( 1 @,@ 979 acres ) , and there are 37 other Nature Conservation Designations . 
 Situated approximately halfway along the Jurassic Coast , Weymouth is a gateway town to the UNESCO World Heritage Site , which includes 155 kilometres ( 96 mi ) of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms . The South West Coast Path has two routes around Weymouth and Portland — one around its coast , and one along the South Dorset Downs , which reduces the path 's length by 31 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 19 @.@ 3 mi ) . The path is the United Kingdom 's longest national trail , at 1 @,@ 014 kilometres ( 630 mi ) . 
 Weymouth is the largest town in the area , larger than the county town of Dorchester , which lies just to the north , and hence is a centre of activity for the nearby population . A steep ridge of chalk called the South Dorset Downs , locally known as The Ridgeway , separates Dorchester and Weymouth ; they are less agricultural than the valleys in the centre and north of Dorset , but have dairy and arable farms . The nearest villages to Weymouth are part of the built @-@ up area , including Wyke Regis , Chickerell and Preston . 
 The sand and clay on which Weymouth is built is very low @-@ lying — large areas are below sea level , which allowed the eastern areas of the town to flood during extreme low pressure storms . In the 1980s and 1990s a sea wall was built around Weymouth Harbour and along the coast road in Preston ; a rip rap groyne in Greenhill and beach nourishment up to Preston have created a wide and artificially graded pebble beach , to ensure that the low @-@ lying land around <unk> does not flood . The defences at Preston , the extended ferry terminal and the widening of the Esplanade have changed the sediment regime in Weymouth Bay , narrowing the beach at Greenhill and widening the sands in Weymouth . A study conducted as part of the redevelopment of the Pavilion complex showed that the proposed marina will contribute slightly to this effect , but sand dredged out of the marina could be used to make the beach up to 40 metres ( 130 ft ) wider . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Due to its location on the south @-@ west coast of England , Weymouth has a temperate climate ( Köppen climate classification Cfb ) , with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures . The average annual mean temperature from 1981 to 2010 was 11 @.@ 2 ° C ( 52 @.@ 2 ° F ) . The warmest month is August , which has an average temperature range of 14 @.@ 1 to 20 @.@ 1 ° C ( 57 @.@ 4 to 68 @.@ 2 ° F ) , and the coolest is February , which has a range of 3 @.@ 7 to 8 @.@ 4 ° C ( 38 @.@ 7 to 47 @.@ 1 ° F ) . Maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the year are above England 's average , and Weymouth is in AHS Heat zone 1 . Mean sea surface temperatures range from 7 @.@ 0 ° C ( 44 @.@ 6 ° F ) in February to 17 @.@ 2 ° C ( 63 @.@ 0 ° F ) in August ; the annual mean is 11 @.@ 8 ° C ( 53 @.@ 2 ° F ) . 
 The low @-@ lying nature of the area , and the ameliorating effect of the lakes and mild seas that surround the town , act to keep night @-@ time temperatures above freezing for much of the winter , though frosts are recorded . The lowest temperature of − 9 @.@ 8 ° C ( 14 @.@ 4 ° F ) was recorded on 13 January 1987 . Days with snow lying are equally rare : on average zero to six days per year ; almost all winters have one day or less with snow lying . It may snow or sleet in winter , yet it rarely settles on the ground ; low @-@ lying coastal areas on the South Coast of England such as Weymouth experience milder winters than the rest of the United Kingdom . The growing season in Weymouth lasts for more than 310 days per year , and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9b . 
 Weymouth and Portland has one of the sunniest climates in the United Kingdom , along with many south coast towns . The resort averaged 1869 @.@ 8 hours of sunshine annually between 1981 and 2010 , which is 43 % of the maximum possible , and 40 % above the United Kingdom average of 1339 @.@ 7 hours . December is the cloudiest month ( 62 @.@ 9 hours of sunshine ) , November the wettest ( 88 @.@ 7 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) of rain ) and July is the sunniest and driest month ( 243 @.@ 6 hours of sunshine , 35 @.@ 9 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) of rain ) . Sunshine totals in all months are well above the United Kingdom average , and monthly rainfall totals throughout the year are less than the UK average , particularly in summer ; this summer minimum of rainfall is not experienced away from the south coast of England . The average annual rainfall of 730 @.@ 3 millimetres ( 28 @.@ 8 in ) is well below the UK average of 1 @,@ 125 millimetres ( 44 @.@ 3 in ) .

 The mid @-@ year population of Weymouth in 2011 was 52 @,@ 323 , in a built @-@ up area of 18 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 600 acres ) , giving an approximate population density of 2 @,@ 800 residents per square kilometre ( 11 per acre ) , in 25 @,@ 174 dwellings . The population has grown steadily since the 1970s , mainly as a result of migration . There is an above average number of residents aged 60 – 84 ( 27 @.@ 4 % ) , however this is less than the Dorset average of 30 @.@ 2 % , and the proportion of the population between 18 and 59 is also above the Dorset average . The population is largely native to England — 94 @.@ 9 % of residents are White British , slightly below the Dorset average of 95 @.@ 5 % , and well above the England and Wales average of 80 @.@ 5 % . The most common religious identity in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity , at 61 @.@ 0 % , which is slightly above the England and Wales average of 59 @.@ 3 % . The next @-@ largest sector is those with no religion , at 29 @.@ 3 % , slightly above the average of 25 @.@ 1 % . 
 House prices in Weymouth and Portland are relatively high by UK standards , yet around average for the south of England — the average price of a detached house in 2010 was £ 303 @,@ 622 ; semi @-@ detached and terraced houses were cheaper , at £ 204 @,@ 647 and £ 203 @,@ 207 respectively , and an apartment or maisonette cost £ 155 @,@ 056 . The crime rate in Weymouth of 7 @.@ 6 burglaries per 1000 households is lower than that of England and Wales ( 11 @.@ 6 per 1000 ) , but above that of Dorset ( 3 @.@ 6 per 1000 ) . Unemployment levels are low , particularly in summer , at 2 @.@ 5 % of the economically active population in July 2011 , compared to the UK average of 7 @.@ 7 % . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Tourism has been the largest industry in Weymouth for decades , though the number of people employed in the sector has declined slightly since its peak in the late 1990s . Weymouth 's coast and beaches , lakes , museums , aquarium , and two shopping centres are the main attractions for visitors . The visitor accommodation consists of hotels on the seafront , guest houses around the town centre , and caravan and camping sites just out of town , including three sites owned by Haven and British Holidays : <unk> , Seaview and Weymouth Bay . 
 There are over two hundred events held throughout the year in the borough , including firework festivals , dragon boat racing , beach volleyball , handball and motocross , and the annual carnival in mid @-@ August , which attracts around 70 @,@ 000 people each year . Weymouth is the only port in the world to have hosted the start of The Tall Ships ' Races three times — in 1983 , 1987 and 1994 ; the 1994 race attracting 300 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 The Pavilion Theatre was built in 1960 on a peninsula of reclaimed land between the harbour and the esplanade , after the Ritz Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1954 . The Pavilion was owned and operated by Weymouth and Portland Borough Council , providing a venue for local community groups and schools , and hosting seasonal ' end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ pier ' entertainment and year @-@ round shows and events . It was announced in 2006 that the Pavilion complex and 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) of its surroundings would be entirely redeveloped from 2008 to 2011 , in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics . The proposed complex was to include a refurbished theatre , a World Heritage Site visitors ' centre , a new ferry terminal , a 140 bed 4 @-@ star hotel , an underground car park , a shopping arcade , offices , around 340 luxury apartments , 110 affordable homes , public squares , promenades , and a 290 @-@ berth marina . Delays to the project mean it was unlikely to be completed in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the redevelopment never took place . In November 2012 Weymouth and Portland Borough Council announced the intended closure and demolition of the theatre , with the site closing on 31 May 2013 . Following a formal tender process the theatre was leased to local businessman Phil Say and reopened on 13 July 2013 . Weymouth Pavilion is now operated by Weymouth Pavilion CIC as a not @-@ for @-@ profit organisation . 
 As part of the regeneration of Weymouth and Portland , it was decided in 2007 that Weymouth 's esplanade will be redeveloped in time for the 2012 Olympic Games . Planned improvements include a public square around the restored statue of King George III , the restoration and extension the Art Deco pier bandstand , a Tourist information centre and café , Victorian @-@ style shelters and seasonal kiosks , a beach rescue centre , and a sand art pavilion for the sculptures of Mark Anderson . Other alterations to the promenade were made , particularly around key areas such as the Jubilee Clock and the pier bandstand , with the introduction of new cafes and bars that connect the promenade and beach using innovative design , shaped like an upturned boat , also including a lighting scheme and seating areas with planting , fountains and trees . A 2010 council report said there are " venues with an emphasis on an alcohol @-@ led night out . While these uses area positive attribute to the town , popular with both residents and visitors , they are also closely linked to a well @-@ documented crime and disorder problem in the town centre . " 
 Weymouth Harbour is long and narrow , and formed the estuary of the River Wey until the building of a bridge to Westham , which separated the harbour 's backwaters from Radipole Lake . For centuries the harbour was a passenger terminal and trade and cargo port : goods handled included wool and spices , and in the 20th century Weymouth was a bulk importer of fertiliser and cars . The old harbourside , on both sides of the seaward end of the harbour , still hosts a fishing fleet , with docks , unloading areas , and a cross @-@ channel ferry terminal . Fishing and cargo trading employ fewer people in the area since their peak in earlier centuries , but local fishermen catch the largest mass of fish in England and the third largest in the United Kingdom . The inner harbour has been refurbished in two phases , in 1994 – 1996 and in 2002 , to include a new marina with hundreds of berths for pleasure boats , cruisers and sailing boats . Local boats offer fishing and diving trips , pleasure cruises along the Jurassic Coast , and thrill @-@ rides to the Isle of Portland . 
 The main shopping centre in the area is in Melcombe Regis , consisting of two pedestrianised streets ( St. Thomas 's and St. Mary 's Street ) , shops along the esplanade , and a new precinct stretching from St. Thomas 's Street to the harbourside , built in the 1990s . There are shops and restaurants in the pedestrianised Hope Square and Brewers Quay , which are linked to the town centre by town bridge and a small passenger ferry service across the harbour . In 2005 the town centre had 292 shops and 37 @,@ 500 square metres ( 404 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of floorspace , and there was 0 @.@ 4 square kilometres ( 100 acres ) of industrial estate in the area . The shopping catchment area , which extends for approximately 3 miles towards the north and seven miles east and west , has a population of 71 @,@ 700 ( mid @-@ 2001 ) . Weymouth , Portland and Chickerell have been a Fairtrade Zone since 2007 . Fashion company New Look has its global headquarters in Weymouth , and until 2005 the company 's regional distribution centre was based at the same site . Plans were approved in 2007 to develop the New Look site to include new headquarters , retail warehouses and industrial units , a hotel , fire station , and a medical centre with ambulance station .

 Weymouth railway station is the terminus of a route from London Waterloo and of a route from Westbury and Bristol . There used to be a station to handle summer tourist traffic , but this traffic declined and it was demolished in 1986 . A smaller station took up part of the site , and the rest was given over to commercial development . Part of the South West Main Line west of Moreton Station to east of Dorchester South Station has been reduced from dual to single track . Local councils lobbied the Department for Transport , in connection with the 2012 Olympic Games , to relay the double track and increase services . Services to London Waterloo began running every 30 minutes from December 2007 , but services through Bristol to Cardiff were reduced . 
 An unusual feature of the railways in Weymouth was that until 1987 main @-@ line trains ran though the streets and along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at the eastern end of the harbour , to connect with ferries to mainland Europe . Due to declining business , goods traffic ceased in 1972 , but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use . 
 Local bus services are run by First Hampshire and Dorset , which bought the local Southern National company . Buses run from Weymouth to the Isle of Portland , Dorchester , Bournemouth , Wool , Beaminster , Axminster , and to other villages and the town 's holiday parks . Weymouth is connected to towns and villages along the Jurassic Coast by the Jurassic Coast Bus service , which runs for 142 kilometres ( 88 mi ) from Exeter to Poole , through <unk> , Beer , Seaton , Lyme Regis , Charmouth , Bridport , Abbotsbury , Weymouth , Wool , and Wareham . This service is convenient for walkers who can ride the bus to connect with the South West Coast Path for a walk along the coast . 
 The A354 road connects the town to the A35 trunk road in Dorchester , and terminates at Easton on the Isle of Portland . The <unk> road runs east from Weymouth to the south of Warmwell , where it connects with the <unk> to the Isle of Purbeck and Wareham . The <unk> road runs west from Weymouth to the south of Bridport where it terminates and connects to the A35 . In the 1980s the town centre was bypassed by the A354 to Portland , but the government 's road building policy changed before a proposed relief road could be completed . Before completion of the relief road , the A354 followed its original route through Upwey and Broadwey , where traffic problems were common at peak tourist times , particularly on event days such as the carnival . 
 The relief road 's construction was delayed by opposition from residents and environmental groups , including Transport 2000 and the Campaign to Protect Rural England , who objected to the route 's partial destruction of a nature reserve , which is an AONB and SSSI . With Weymouth and Portland scheduled to host 2012 Olympic sailing events the project reopened ; the local authorities favouring a more environmentally friendly proposal than in the 1990s . On 5 April 2007 , Dorset County Council granted planning permission for a modified proposal including a single carriageway running 7 kilometres ( 4 mi ) north , and a 1000 @-@ space park @-@ and @-@ ride scheme , costing £ 84 @.@ 5 million . Work commenced in 2008 ; and was completed by mid @-@ 2011 , in time for the 2012 Olympic sailing events . During archaeological excavations carried out in advance of the relief road construction , a burial pit containing 51 dismembered skeletons of Viking men was discovered on Ridgeway Hill .

 There are three secondary schools in Weymouth — All Saints ' Church of England School in Wyke Regis ; Budmouth College in Chickerell ; and Wey Valley School and Sports College in Broadwey . Wey Valley was added to the Government 's Failing Schools list in 2007 as only 27 % of the students achieved 5 A * to C passes . The fourth secondary school in the Chesil Education Partnership is Royal Manor Arts College on the Isle of Portland . All Saints ' has 921 students on roll , Budmouth has 1560 and Wey Valley 1171 . In 2006 , 31 % of students at Wey Valley , and 58 % of students at All Saints ' and Budmouth , attained five or more A * to C GCSEs including English and mathematics . 
 Budmouth College also has a sixth form centre which had 296 students in 2006 .

 Weymouth 's wide and shallow sandy beach is used for swimming and sunbathing during the tourist season , and for beach sport events throughout the year , including beach motocross , the International handball championships and the beach volleyball classic . The international kite festival , held in May each year on Weymouth Beach , attracts around 40 @,@ 000 spectators to the esplanade from around the world . 
 Weymouth Cricket Club is sponsored by local business and runs in partnership with nearby schools . 
 The local football club , Weymouth F.C. or ' the Terras ' , are outside the Football League but , in common with some other non @-@ league clubs , they became professional in 2005 . The team enjoyed erratic success at their level ; twice playing in the third round of the FA Cup , the highest club competition level . At the end of the 2005 – 06 season the team became champions of the Conference South ( the sixth level of English football ) and moved up to the Conference National ( the fifth level ) for the first time since 1989 . However the club were relegated at the end of the 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 seasons and now play in the Southern League Premier Division ( the seventh level ) . The Terras ' ground is the Bob Lucas Stadium ; its record attendance is 6 @,@ 500 against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup 2005 – 2006 season . 
 The Wessex Stadium is out of town , but until 1987 the team played at a ground near the town centre , which is now an Asda supermarket . The club 's move pre @-@ dated the move to new out @-@ of @-@ town grounds by professional league clubs , and was the first football stadium opened in England in 32 years . Motorcycle speedway racing was staged at the stadium from 1954 until the redevelopment ; Weymouth 's team was revived in 2003 , and ' the Wildcats ' race at a track adjacent to the stadium . However , the club closed early in 2011 , following disputes with the landlords owning the stadium . In 2005 a scheme was proposed to rebuild the Wessex Stadium to occupy a pitch @-@ and @-@ putt golf course , coincidentally with Asda building on the previous stadium site . Although the plans were to move by August 2007 , the scheme was shelved before construction could begin . 
 On the shores of Portland Harbour , 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) south of Wyke Regis , is Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy , where the sailing events of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were based . The main reason that the resort was chosen to be an 2012 Olympic venue was because the National Sailing Academy had only recently been built , so no new venue would have to be built . However , as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency 's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay , in which the academy is built , a new 600 @-@ berth marina and an extension with more on @-@ site facilities was built . Weymouth and Portland were one of the first locations in the United Kingdom to finish building a venue for the Olympic Games , as construction started in October 2007 and finished at the end of 2008 . 
 The waters of Weymouth and Portland were credited by the Royal Yachting Association as the best in Northern Europe for sailing . Local , national and international sailing events are regularly held in the bay ; these include the J / 24 World Championships in 2005 , trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics , the ISAF World Championship 2006 , the BUCS Fleet Racing Championships , and the RYA Youth National Championships . Tall ship Pelican , built as an Arctic fishing trawler in 1948 , offers sail training voyages for youth . Weymouth Bay is a venue for other water @-@ sports — the reliable wind is favourable for <unk> and kite @-@ surfing . The sheltered waters in Portland Harbour and near Weymouth are used for angling , diving to shipwrecks , snorkelling , canoeing , jet skiing , water skiing , and swimming .

In the 1930s , he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini . His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis , and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly restrictive anti @-@ semitic laws in 1938 . After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland , where he remained during the Second World War . Prohibited from conducting there , he earned a living as a pianist . 
 After the war , Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946 . In 1952 he moved to the Frankfurt Opera , where he remained in charge for nine years . He took West German citizenship in 1953 . In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company , London . During his ten @-@ year tenure , he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels . Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title " the Royal Opera " . He became a British citizen in 1972 . 
 In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , a post he held for 22 years . He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra 's music director laureate , a position he held until his death . During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra 's eighth music director , he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983 . 
 Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making , Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a conductor in later years . He recorded many works two or three times at various stages of his career , and was a prolific recording artist , making more than 250 recordings , including 45 complete opera sets . The most famous of his recordings is probably Decca 's complete set of Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen , made between 1958 and 1965 . Solti 's Ring has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made , in polls for Gramophone magazine in 1999 and the BBC 's Music Magazine in 2012 . Solti was repeatedly honoured by the recording industry with awards throughout his career , including a record 32 Grammy Awards as a recording artist .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Solti was born György Stern ( Hungarian : Stern György ) on Maros <unk> , in the <unk> district of the Buda side of Budapest . He was the younger of the two children of <unk> ( " Mor " ) Stern and his wife <unk> , née Rosenbaum , both of whom were Jewish . In the aftermath of the First World War it became the accepted practice in Hungary for citizens with Germanic surnames to adopt Hungarian ones . The right wing regime of Admiral Horthy enacted a series of " <unk> " laws , including a requirement that state employees with foreign @-@ sounding names must change them . Mor Stern , a self @-@ employed merchant , felt no need to change his surname , but thought it prudent to change that of his children . He renamed them after <unk> , a small town in central Hungary . His son 's given name , György , was acceptably Hungarian and was not changed . 
 Solti described his father as " a kind , sweet man who trusted everyone . He shouldn 't have , but he did . Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic . In 1914 , when war broke out , my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country . By the time the bonds matured , they were worthless . " Mor Stern was a religious man , but his son was less so . Late in life Solti recalled , " I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes . " <unk> Stern was from a musical family , and encouraged her daughter Lilly , eight years the elder of the children , to sing , and György to accompany her at the piano . Solti remembered , " I made so many mistakes , but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor . I learnt to swim with her . " He was not a diligent student of the piano : " My mother kept telling me to practise , but what ten @-@ year @-@ old wants to play the piano when he could be out playing football ? " 
 Solti enrolled at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest at the age of ten , transferring to the more prestigious Franz Liszt Academy two years later . When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber , which gave him the ambition to become a conductor . His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education , and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession ; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons . 
 The faculty of the Franz Liszt Academy included some of the most eminent Hungarian musicians , including Béla Bartók , Leó Weiner , Ernő Dohnányi and Zoltán Kodály . Solti studied under the first three , for piano , chamber music and composition respectively . Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály , but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály , whom he would have preferred , turned him down , leaving him to study composition first with Albert Siklós and then with Dohnányi . Not all the Academy 's tutors were equally distinguished : Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernö Unger , " who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions . I attended the class for only two years , but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before I managed to unlearn what he had taught me " . 
 = = = Pianist and conductor = = = 
 After graduating from the Academy in 1930 Solti was appointed to the staff of the Hungarian State Opera . He found that working as a répétiteur , coaching singers in their roles and playing at rehearsals , was a more fruitful preparation than Unger 's classes for his intended career as a conductor . In 1932 he went to Karlsruhe in Germany as assistant to Josef Krips , but within a year , Krips , anticipating the imminent rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis , insisted that Solti should go home to Budapest , where at that time Jews were not in danger . Other Jewish and anti @-@ Nazi musicians also left Germany for Budapest . Among other musical exiles with whom Solti worked there were Otto Klemperer , Fritz Busch , and Kleiber . Before Austria fell under Nazi control , Solti was assistant to Arturo Toscanini at the 1937 Salzburg Festival : 
 Toscanini was the first great musical impression in my life . Before I heard him live in 1936 , I had never heard a great opera conductor , not in Budapest , and it was like a lightning flash . I heard his Falstaff in 1936 and the impact was unbelievable . It was the first time I heard an ensemble singing absolutely precisely . It was fantastic . Then I never expected to meet Toscanini . It was a chance in a million . I had a letter of recommendation from the director of the Budapest Opera to the president of the Salzburg Festival . He received me and said : " Do you know Magic Flute , because we have an influenza epidemic and two of our <unk> are ill ? Could you play this afternoon for the stage rehearsals ? " 
 After further work as a répétiteur at the opera in Budapest , and with his standing enhanced by his association with Toscanini , Solti was given his first chance to conduct , on 11 March 1938 . The opera was The Marriage of Figaro . During that evening , news came of the German invasion of Austria . Many Hungarians feared that Hitler would next invade Hungary ; he did not do so , but Horthy , to strengthen his partnership with the Nazis , instituted anti @-@ semitic laws , mirroring the Nuremberg Laws , restricting Hungary 's Jews from engaging in professions . Solti 's family urged him to move away . He went first to London , where he made his Covent Garden debut , conducting the London Philharmonic for a Russian ballet season . The reviewer in The Times was not impressed with Solti 's efforts , finding them " too violent , for he lashed at the orchestra and flogged the music so that he endangered the delicate , evocative atmosphere . " At about this time Solti dropped the name " György " in favour of " Georg " . 
 After his appearances in London Solti went to Switzerland to seek out Toscanini , who was conducting in Lucerne . Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US . He was unable to do so , but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max <unk> , who was learning the role of Tristan in Wagner 's opera . Throughout the Second World War , Solti remained in Switzerland . He did not see his father again : Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943 . Solti was reunited with his mother and sister after the war . In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor , but earned his living as a piano teacher . After he won the 1942 Geneva International Piano Competition he was permitted to give piano recitals , but was still not allowed to conduct . During his exile , he met Hedwig ( Hedi ) <unk> , daughter of a lecturer at Zürich University . They married in 1946 . In his memoirs he wrote of her , " She was very elegant and sophisticated . ... Hedi gave me a little grace and taught me good manners – although she never completely succeeded in this . She also helped me enormously in my career " . 
 = = = Munich and Frankfurt = = = 
 With the end of the war Solti 's luck changed dramatically . He was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946 . In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor , but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler , Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them . Under Solti 's direction , the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre @-@ war eminence . He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss , in whose presence he conducted Der Rosenkavalier . Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti , but gave him advice about conducting . 
 In addition to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946 . He signed for Decca Records , not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist . He made his first recording in 1947 , playing Brahms 's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg <unk> . He was insistent that he wanted to conduct , and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year , with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven 's Egmont overture . Twenty years later Solti said , " I 'm sure it 's a terrible record , because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited . It is horrible , surely horrible – but by now it has vanished . " He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor . It was in London , Haydn 's Drum Roll symphony , in sessions produced by John Culshaw , with whose career Solti 's became closely linked over the next two decades . Reviewing the record , The Gramophone said , " The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti ( a fine conductor who is new to me ) is remarkable for rhythmic playing , richness of tone , and clarity of execution . " The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI 's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic . 
 In 1951 Solti conducted at the Salzburg Festival for the first time , partly through the influence of Furtwängler , who was impressed by him . The work was Idomeneo , which had not been given there before . In Munich Solti achieved critical and popular success , but for political reasons his position at the State Opera was never secure . The view persisted that a German conductor should be in charge ; pressure mounted , and after five years Solti accepted an offer to move to Frankfurt in 1952 as musical director of the Frankfurt Opera . The city 's opera house had been destroyed in the war , and Solti undertook to build a new company and repertoire for its recently completed replacement . He also conducted the symphony concerts given by the opera orchestra . Frankfurt 's was a less prestigious house than Munich 's and he initially regarded the move as a demotion , but he found the post fulfilling and remained at Frankfurt from 1952 to 1961 , presenting 33 operas , 19 of which he had not conducted before . Frankfurt , unlike Munich , could not attract many of the leading German singers . Solti recruited many rising young American singers such as Claire Watson and Sylvia <unk> , to the extent that the house acquired the nickname " Amerikanische Oper am Main " . In 1953 the West German government offered Solti German citizenship , which , being effectively stateless as a Hungarian exile , he gratefully accepted . He believed he could never return to Hungary , by then under communist rule . He remained a German citizen for two decades . 
 During his Frankfurt years Solti made appearances with other opera companies and orchestras . He conducted in the Americas for the first time in 1952 , giving concerts in Buenos Aires . In the same year he made his debut at the Edinburgh Festival as a guest conductor with the visiting Hamburg State Opera . The following year he was a guest at the San Francisco Opera with Elektra , Die Walküre and Tristan und Isolde . In 1954 he conducted Don Giovanni at the Glyndebourne Festival . The reviewer in The Times said that no fault could be found in Solti 's " vivacious and sensitive " conducting . In the same year Solti made his first appearance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , at the <unk> Festival . In 1960 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York , conducting Tannhäuser , and he continued to appear there until 1964 . 
 In the recording studios Solti 's career took off after 1956 , when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca 's classical recording programme . Culshaw believed Solti to be " the great Wagner conductor of our time " , and was determined to record the four operas of Der Ring des Nibelungen with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available . The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included Kirsten Flagstad , Hans Hotter , Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang <unk> . Apart from Arabella in 1957 , in which he substituted when Karl Böhm withdrew , Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for Das Rheingold , the first of the Ring tetralogy , in September and October 1958 . In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how Walter Legge of Decca 's rival EMI predicted that Das Rheingold would be a commercial disaster ( " ' Very nice , ' he said , ' Very interesting . But of course you won 't sell any . ' " ) The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise . It featured for weeks in the Billboard charts , the sole classical album alongside best sellers by Elvis Presley and Pat Boone , and brought Solti 's name to international prominence . He appeared with leading orchestras in New York , Vienna and Los Angeles , and at Covent Garden he conducted Der Rosenkavalier and Britten 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . 
 = = = Covent Garden = = = 
 In 1960 Solti signed a three @-@ year contract to be music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962 . Even before he took the post the Philharmonic 's autocratic president , Dorothy Chandler , breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti 's approval . Although he admired the chosen deputy , Zubin Mehta , Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset , and he withdrew from his appointment . He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company , London . When first sounded out about the post he had declined it . After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post . Moreover , founded only 15 years earlier , the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe . Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on . 
 The biographer Montague Haltrecht suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden . However , in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed . He originally considered holding both posts in tandem , but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape , as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously . 
 Solti took up the musical directorship of Covent Garden in August 1961 . The press gave him a cautious welcome , but there was some concern that under him there might be a drift away from the company 's original policy of opera in English . Solti , however , was an advocate of opera in the vernacular , and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company , frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists . He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L 'heure espagnole , <unk> and Gianni Schicchi . As the decade went on , however , more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars . 
 Like his predecessor Rafael Kubelík , and his successor Colin Davis , Solti found his early days as musical director marred by vituperative hostility from a small clique in the Covent Garden audience . Rotten vegetables were thrown at him , and his car was vandalised outside the theatre , with the words " Solti must go ! " scratched on its paintwork . Some press reviews were strongly critical ; Solti was so wounded by a review in The Times of his conducting of The Marriage of Figaro that he almost left Covent Garden in despair . The chief executive of the Opera House , Sir David Webster , persuaded him to stay with the company , and matters improved , helped by changes on which Solti insisted . The chorus and orchestra were strengthened , and in the interests of musical and dramatic excellence , Solti secured the introduction of the <unk> system of scheduling performances , rather than the traditional repertory system . By 1967 The Times commented that " Patrons of Covent Garden today automatically expect any new production , and indeed any revival , to be as strongly cast as anything at the Met in New York , and as carefully presented as anything in Milan or Vienna " . 
 The company 's repertory in the 1960s combined the standard operatic works with less familiar pieces . Among the most celebrated productions during Solti 's time in charge was Schoenberg 's Moses and Aaron in the 1965 – 66 and 1966 – 67 seasons . In 1970 , Solti led the company to Germany , where they gave Don Carlos , Falstaff and Victory , a new work by Richard Rodney Bennett . The public in Munich and Berlin were , according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , " beside themselves with enthusiasm " . 
 Solti 's bald head and demanding rehearsal style earned him the nickname " The Screaming Skull " . A music historian called him " the bustling , bruising Georg Solti – a man whose entire physical and mental attitude embodied the words ' I 'm in charge ' . " Singers such as Peter Glossop described him as a bully , and after working with Solti , Jon Vickers refused to do so again . Nevertheless , under Solti , the company was recognised as having achieved parity with the greatest opera houses in the world . Queen Elizabeth II conferred the title " the Royal Opera " on the company in 1968 . By this point Solti was , in the words of his biographer Paul Robinson , " after Karajan , the most celebrated conductor at work " . By the end of his decade as music director at Covent Garden Solti had conducted the company in 33 operas by 13 composers . 
 In 1964 Solti separated from his wife . He moved into the Savoy Hotel , where not long afterwards he met Valerie Pitts , a British television presenter , sent to interview him . She too was married , but after pursuing her for three years , Solti persuaded her to divorce her husband . Solti and Valerie Pitts married on 11 November 1967 . They had two daughters .

 In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . It was the second time he had been offered the post . The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra 's conductor , Fritz Reiner , who made its reputation in the previous decade . Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought . He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time . The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines . When Solti accepted the orchestra 's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting . Both conductors signed three @-@ year contracts with the orchestra , effective from 1969 . 
 One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as " the best provincial orchestra in the world . " Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner , but morale was low , and the orchestra was $ 5m in debt . Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra 's international profile . He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions , and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971 , playing in ten countries . It was the first time in its 80 @-@ year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America . The orchestra received plaudits from European critics , and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker @-@ tape parade . 
 The orchestra 's principal flute player , Donald Peck , commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain : " some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others . We had a good match with Solti and he with us . " Peck 's colleague , the violinist Victor <unk> said , " Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts . Solti is the reverse . He is very tense at rehearsals , which makes us concentrate , but relaxed during the performance , which is a great asset to the orchestra . " Peck recalled Solti 's constant efforts to improve his own technique and interpretations , at one point experimentally dispensing with a baton , drawing a " darker and deeper , much more relaxed " tone from the players . 
 As well as raising the orchestra 's profile and helping it return to prosperity , Solti considerably expanded its repertoire . Under him the Chicago Symphony gave its first cycles of the symphonies of Bruckner and Mahler . He introduced new works commissioned for the orchestra , such as Lutosławski 's Third Symphony , and Tippett 's Fourth Symphony which was dedicated to Solti . Another new work was Tippett 's Byzantium , an orchestral song @-@ cycle , premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the soprano Faye Robinson . Solti frequently programmed works by American composers , including Charles Ives and Elliott Carter . 
 Solti 's recordings with the Chicago Symphony included the complete symphonies of Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and Mahler . Most of his operatic recordings were with other orchestras , but his recordings of The Flying Dutchman ( 1976 ) , Fidelio ( 1979 ) , Moses und Aron ( 1984 ) and his second recordings of Die Meistersinger ( 1995 ) and Verdi 's Otello ( 1991 ) were made with the Chicago players . 
 After relinquishing the position of music director in 1991 , Solti continued to conduct the orchestra , and was given the title of music director laureate . He conducted 999 concerts with the orchestra . His 1,000th concert was scheduled for October 1997 , around the time of his 85th birthday , but Solti died that September .

 In addition to his tenure in Chicago Solti was music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 to 1975 . From 1979 until 1983 he was also principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra . He continued to expand his repertoire . With the London Philharmonic he performed many of Elgar 's major works in concert and on record . Before performing Elgar 's two symphonies , Solti studied the composer 's own recordings made more than 40 years earlier , and was influenced by their brisk tempi and impetuous manner . A critic in The Guardian wrote that Solti " conveys the authentic frisson of the great Elgarian moment more vividly than ever before on record . " Late in his career he became enthusiastic about the music of Shostakovich , whom he admitted he failed to appreciate fully during the composer 's lifetime . He made commercial recordings of seven of Shostakovich 's fifteen symphonies . 
 In 1983 Solti conducted for the only time at the Bayreuth Festival . By this stage in his career he no longer liked abstract productions of Wagner , or modernistic reinterpretations , such as Patrice Chéreau 's 1976 Bayreuth Ring , which he found grew boring on repetition . Together with the director Sir Peter Hall and the designer William Dudley , he presented a Ring cycle that aimed to represent Wagner 's intentions . The production was not well received by German critics , who expected radical reinterpretation of the operas . Solti 's conducting was praised , but illnesses and last @-@ minute replacements of leading performers affected the standard of singing . He was invited to return to Bayreuth for the following season , but was unwell and withdrew on medical advice before the 1984 festival began . 
 In 1991 Solti collaborated with the actor and composer Dudley Moore to create an eight @-@ part television series , Orchestra ! , which was designed to introduce audiences to the symphony orchestra . In 1994 he directed the " Solti Orchestral Project " at Carnegie Hall , a training workshop for young American musicians . The following year , to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations , he formed the World Orchestra for Peace , which consisted of 81 musicians from 40 nations . The orchestra has continued to perform after his death , under the conductorship of Valery Gergiev . 
 Solti regularly returned to Covent Garden as a guest conductor in the years after he relinquished the musical directorship , greeted with " an increasingly boisterous hero 's welcome " ( Grove ) . From 1972 to 1997 he conducted ten operas , some of them in several seasons . Five were operas he had not conducted at the Royal Opera House before : Carmen , Parsifal , Die Entführung aus dem Serail , Simon Boccanegra and a celebrated production of La traviata ( 1994 ) which propelled Angela Gheorghiu to stardom . On 14 July 1997 he conducted the last operatic music to be heard in the old house before it closed for more than two years for rebuilding . The previous day he had conducted what proved to be his last symphony concert . The work was Mahler 's Fifth Symphony ; the orchestra was the Zurich Tonhalle , with whom he had made his first orchestral recording 50 years earlier . 
 Solti died suddenly , in his sleep , on 5 September 1997 while on holiday in Antibes in the south of France . He was 84 . After a state ceremony in Budapest , his ashes were interred beside the remains of Bartók in <unk> Cemetery . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company . He made more than 250 recordings , including 45 complete opera sets . During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor , and some of Solti 's recordings were first issued on the RCA label . 
 Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house . Gordon Parry , the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings , observed , " Many people have said ' Oh well , of course John Culshaw made Solti . ' This is not true . He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do . " 
 Solti 's first recordings were as a piano accompanist , playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg <unk> in 1947 . Decca 's senior producer , Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor ( nor did Walter Legge , Olof 's opposite number at EMI 's Columbia Records ) , but Olof 's younger colleague and successor , Culshaw , held Solti in high regard . As Culshaw , and later James Walker , produced his recordings , Solti 's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid @-@ 1950s . Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic , Chicago Symphony , London Philharmonic , London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras . Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson , Joan Sutherland , Régine Crespin , Plácido Domingo , Gottlob Frick , Carlo Bergonzi , Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam . In concerto recordings , Solti conducted for , among others , András Schiff , Julius <unk> , Clifford Curzon , Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung @-@ wha Chung . 
 Solti 's most celebrated recording was Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna , produced by Culshaw , between 1958 and 1965 . It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made , the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999 , and the second of professional music critics in 2011 , for the BBC 's Music Magazine . 
 = = Honours and memorials = = 
 Honours awarded to Solti included the British CBE ( honorary ) , 1968 , and an honorary knighthood ( KBE ) , 1971 , which became a substantive knighthood when he took British citizenship in 1972 , after which he was known as Sir Georg Solti . He received honours from other countries , including Austria , Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Hungary , Italy , Portugal and the US . He received honorary fellowships or degrees from the Royal College of Music and DePaul , Furman , Harvard , Leeds , London , Oxford , Surrey and Yale universities . 
 In celebration of his 75th birthday in 1987 , a bronze bust of Solti by Dame Elisabeth Frink was dedicated in Lincoln Park , Chicago , outside the Lincoln Park Conservatory . It was first displayed temporarily at the Royal Opera House in London . The sculpture was moved to Grant Park in 2006 in a new Solti Garden , near Orchestra Hall in Symphony Center . In 1997 , to commemorate the 85th anniversary of his birth , the City of Chicago renamed the block of East Adams Street adjacent to Symphony Center as " Sir Georg Solti Place " in his memory . 
 Record industry awards to Solti included the Grand Prix Mondial du Disque ( 14 times ) and 32 Grammy Awards ( including a special Trustees ' Grammy Award , shared with John Culshaw , for the recording of the Ring ( 1967 ) and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award ( 1996 ) ) . He won more Grammys than any other recording artist , whether classical or popular . In September 2007 , as a tribute on the 10th anniversary of his death , Decca published a recording of his final concert . 
 After Solti 's death his widow and daughters set up the Solti Foundation to assist young musicians . Solti 's memoirs , written with the assistance of Harvey Sachs , were published the month after his death . Solti 's life was also documented in a 1997 film by Peter <unk> , Sir Georg Solti : The Making of a Maestro . In 2007 Valerie Solti was appointed a Cultural Ambassador of Hungary , an honorary title granted by the Hungarian state . 
 In 2012 a series of events under the banner of " Solti @ 100 " was announced , to mark the centenary of Solti 's birth . Among the events announced were concerts in New York and Chicago , and commemorative exhibitions in London , Chicago , Vienna and New York . In the same year Solti was voted into the inaugural Gramophone " Hall of Fame " .

 Northampton signed Johnson on a two @-@ year contract in July 2010 following the successful loan spell . After signing for the club on a permanent basis , Johnson 's first match was the opening game of the season , in a 3 – 0 loss against Torquay United . Two months later , he received a straight red card after fouling Simon <unk> and lost his appeal , resulting in a one @-@ match ban , missing a 3 – 1 loss against Oxford United . A week after his suspension , he scored his first goal as a permanent Northampton player in a 2 – 0 win over Lincoln City . In his first season at Northampton ( as a permanent player ) , he made 41 appearances and scored seven goals . 
 Johnson was appointed as captain ahead of the 2011 – 12 season having previously captained the club in a friendly match against Nottingham Forest , but was stripped of the post following the arrival of Clarke Carlisle . Johnson retained his first team place , making 48 appearances and scoring twice in two consecutive games against Morecambe and Southend . During a 3 – 2 loss against Burton Albion on 26 December 2011 , Johnson received a straight red card in the 18th minute , for fouling John McGrath . After the match , the club announced it would appeal against his sending @-@ off . The club won the appeal after The Football Association overturned the decision , therefore making him available to play . 
 As his contract was due to expire in the summer , Johnson signed a one @-@ year extension with Northampton keeping him at the club until 2013 on 16 May 2012 . After signing , manager Aidy Boothroyd said he expected Johnson to realise his full potential in the coming season . However , Johnson suffered a cartilage injury in October 2012 that ruled him out for four to six weeks . He made a return in a 1 – 1 draw against York City , but his return was short @-@ lived when he came off at half @-@ time and was out until January after undergoing knee surgery . After making his return on 19 January 2013 against AFC Wimbledon in a 1 – 1 draw , Boothroyd said Johnson made the team tougher and more aggressive . Later in the 2012 – 13 season , Johnson regained his first team place and the club finished in sixth place , qualifying for the promotion play @-@ offs . Johnson described the team as " the strongest " he had played in . Johnson was an unused substitute in the play @-@ offs as Northampton Town lost 3 – 0 on aggregate against Bradford City . He was released by Northampton at the end of the season .

 = The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science = 
 The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science was published in November 1909 in New York by Doubleday , Page & Company . The book is a highly critical account of the life of Mary Baker Eddy ( 1821 – 1910 ) , the founder of Christian Science , and the early history of the Christian Science church in 19th @-@ century New England . 
 The material first appeared in McClure 's magazine ( 1893 – 1929 ) in 14 installments between January 1907 and June 1908 , preceded by an editorial in December 1906 announcing the series . The articles were the first major examination of Eddy 's life and work , published when she was 85 years old , and became a key primary source for most independent accounts of the church 's early history . 
 The magazine 's publisher and editor @-@ in @-@ chief , S. S. McClure ( 1857 – 1949 ) , assigned five writers to work on the articles : Willa Cather ( 1873 – 1947 ) , who won the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for one of her novels ; researcher Georgine Milmine ( 1874 – 1950 ) ; managing editor Will Irwin ( 1873 – 1948 ) ; Burton J. Hendrick ( 1870 – 1949 ) ; Mark Sullivan ( 1874 – 1952 ) , who became a well @-@ known political columnist ; and briefly Ida Tarbell ( 1857 – 1944 ) . The original byline on the book and articles was Milmine 's , but it later emerged that Cather , who had joined McClure 's as an editor in 1906 , was the principal author . 
 The Christian Science church purchased the manuscript shortly after the book 's publication , and it was soon out of print . It was republished by Baker Book House in 1971 after its copyright had expired , and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press , this time naming both Cather and Milmine as authors . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The material was published by McClure 's when Witter Bynner ( 1881 – 1968 ) was an assistant editor and briefly managing editor . It first appeared under Georgine Milmine 's byline in 14 installments between January 1907 and June 1908 as " Mary Baker G. Eddy : The Story of Her Life and the History of Christian Science . " The text of the articles was revised and updated for the book , where it was presented in 26 chapters . 
 The articles were preceded by an unsigned , seven @-@ page editorial in December 1906 , explaining why the series was being published and discussing the difficulties of the investigation . The author of the editorial wrote : " The Christian Science mind is unfriendly to independent investigation . It presupposes that anything even slightly unfavorable to Mrs. Eddy or to Christian Science is deliberate falsehood . " The publication got off to an unfortunate start by reproducing a photograph on page two of the editorial that purported to be of Eddy , but was in fact of someone else . 
 The criticism of Eddy is considerable . She is portrayed as deceitful , someone who regularly revised her life story , and who was interested only in making money . The authors reproduce witness statements from Eddy 's childhood of her having repeated fainting spells as a way of gaining attention or avoiding punishment , particularly from her father , and say that she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly . 
 Eddy was widowed when she was 22 years old and pregnant , after which she returned to live in her father 's home . Her son was raised there for the first few years of his life , looked after for at least some of the time by domestic staff because of Eddy 's health issues . The articles allege that she allowed him to be adopted by one of the staff when he was four , then failed to maintain a relationship with him until he was in his thirties , though they lived near each other . ( Eddy has written that she was unable to prevent the adoption , but McClure 's implied otherwise . ) 
 Her next two marriages , lifelong poor health , and the numerous legal actions she was involved in – including lawsuits against her students and a criminal case in which her third husband was accused of conspiracy to murder one of them ( an allegation that was never proven ) – are examined in detail . The authors also allege that Eddy 's major work , Science and Health ( 1875 ) , which became Christian Science 's main religious text , borrowed heavily from the work of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby ( 1802 – 1866 ) , a New England faith healer . Quimby had treated Eddy in the years before his death and had given her some of his unpublished notes . 
 Eddy replied only to the early installments in McClure 's by challenging its description of her father , early family life , and some of the issues surrounding her marriages . McClure 's had said that the Bible was the only book in the house when she was growing up ; on the contrary , she wrote , her father was a great reader . Her statement described the educational and professional achievements of her family to counter McClure 's claim that her childhood home had provided a " lonely and <unk> existence . " She offered as an example of her own kindness ( in response to McClure 's view of her as bad tempered ) that a housekeeper of the family 's had resigned because Eddy allowed a blind girl , who had knocked on the door and was unknown to the family , to stay with them .

 Georgine Milmine was born in Ontario , Canada . Before joining McClure 's as a researcher , she worked for the Syracuse Herald in New York . She had been collecting material about Eddy for years , but lacked the resources to research and write it up herself , so she sold it to McClure 's . 
 The publisher assigned five writers to the story , including Milmine , Willa Cather , Burton J. Hendrick , political columnist Mark Sullivan , Will Irwin and for a short time Ida Tarbell . Cather had started working for McClure 's as an editor in 1906 when she was 32 years old . She and Sullivan spent time traveling in New England seeking confirmation of the material about Eddy 's early life . The journalist Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant ( 1881 – 1965 ) wrote in 1953 : 
 Startling material relating to a leading religious leader and romantic personality of that time – Mary Baker G. Eddy – had been brought into McClure 's by one Georgine Milmine . S. S. McClure was always interested in biography ... and he was always interested in novelty . Thus he saw in Mrs. Eddy a " natural " for McClure 's , for her personal origins and idiosyncrasies , her marital history , the psychological and factual background of her ideas and her " message " in Science and Health had not then been publicized . The material was touchy , and would attract a world of readers both of the faithful and the doubters . It must , however , be carefully verified , and Willa <unk> Cather , with four other members of McClure 's staff , was chosen for this job . ... 
 The job seemed to her a little infra dig , not on the level where she cared to move . But she inspired confidence , had the mind of a judge and the nose of a detective when she needed it . ... She was quickly fascinated by the psychological implications of her material , and made long stays in Boston to edit it . But the book that ensued was largely written in the McClure 's office , and was a composite , not Willa Cather 's personal work . 
 Witter Bynner , a McClure 's assistant editor at the time of publication , signed a copy of the book on February 12 , 1934 , writing : " The material was brought to McClure 's by Miss Milmine , but was put into the painstaking hands of Willa Cather for proper presentation , so that a great part of it is her work . " In 1935 a copy of the book listed for sale by Philip <unk> , a New York bookseller , contained a <unk> of an editor 's note identifying Cather as the author . David Stouck , professor emeritus of English at Simon Fraser University , writes that the Christian Science church 's Mary Baker Eddy Library holds the original manuscript of the book and that Cather 's handwriting is evident on it , in notes and edits for the typesetter . Several of Cather 's later characters were reportedly modeled on her portrait of Eddy , including Mrs. Cutter in My Ántonia ( 1918 ) . 
 = = = Cather 's letters = = = 
 Cather denied that she was the main author in letters to <unk> Richmond in 1933 and Harold Goddard Rugg in 1934 ; she told them she had only helped to organize and rewrite the material . According to Stouck , she minimized her role in part because she wanted to distance herself from journalism , and in part because the Christian Science church and Eddy were angered by the articles . Brent <unk> writes that Cather regarded the book as poorly written ; he adds that it contains some excellent writing and character analysis , but that it is not well @-@ structured . He attributes this to poor editing that failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the original McClure 's pieces . 
 Cather identified herself as the author in a letter to her father in December 1906 ; she told him the articles beginning February 1907 ( at that time written , but not yet published ) were hers . She also referred to her authorship in a letter to S.S. McClure in June 1912 . 
 She acknowledged her authorship fully on November 24 , 1922 , in a letter to Edwin H. Anderson ( 1861 – 1947 ) , director of the New York Public Library and an old friend of hers . She told him that she had written the entire book except for the first chapter . S.S. McClure had purchased Milmine 's research , Cather wrote , including newspaper articles from the 1880s , court records , and a first edition of Science and Health , all of which were hard to obtain . Apparently when McClure 's was sold , the new publisher threw away the research , including the first edition . 
 Cather told Anderson that Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment , but that it had been largely based on rumor . S.S. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial . For the rest of the installments , she wrote that no expense was spared in verifying Milmine 's material , and that S. S. McClure had promoted her to managing editor on the basis of her work on the articles . She ended the letter by asking Anderson to regard the information as confidential . She wrote that she had not told the truth about it to anyone previously , <unk> writes , but that she felt someone ought to know the true story . Cather 's letter to Anderson can only be paraphrased , not quoted , because she left a clause in her will forbidding the publication of her letters and private papers . The correspondence will enter the public domain in 2017 , 70 years after her death .

 Peter Lyon wrote in Success Story : The Life and Times of S.S. McClure ( 1963 ) that when the articles first appeared , three Christian Science officials arrived at the McClure 's offices and asked McClure to allow them to edit the rest of the articles before publication . When he refused , they said he would soon notice a loss of advertising . 
 The church purchased the original manuscript of the book and there were rumors that the plates had been destroyed . In June 1920 the church also purchased some of McClure 's research notes from a New York manuscript dealer . There were stories that Christian Scientists were buying and destroying copies of the book , and removing them from libraries to keep them out of circulation . Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant wrote in 1953 that copies had become scarce even in libraries . The book 's copyright expired 28 years after publication . Baker Book House , a Christian publishing house , republished it in 1971 " in the interest of fairness and objectivity , " according to its back cover . 
 Caroline Fraser writes that the church tried to stop the University of Nebraska Press from republishing the book in 1993 . The university was interested in doing so , with a new introduction by David Stouck , because the articles and book were Cather 's first extended work , and therefore important in her development as a writer . According to Fraser , the head of the church 's Committee on Publication ( its media office ) called the Nebraska Press and told them the reprint might damage the church 's and Eddy 's reputation . The Press said the church representative " felt it was his responsibility to try to bully us into stopping publication or into saying that the book was worthless . " 
 Stouck made clear his view in the book 's preface that Willa Cather was " indisputably the principal author of The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science . " But , according to Fraser , there were fears for the jobs of the church researchers who had helped make the Cather – Milmine manuscript available for examination . Stouck therefore agreed to add a statement to the book : 
 Since the re @-@ issue of The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science went to press new materials have come to light which suggest that Eddy 's enemies may have played a significant role in organizing materials for the " Milmine " biography . New information about Georgine Milmine , moreover , suggests that she would have welcomed biased opinion for its sensational and commercial value . The exact nature of Willa Cather 's part in the compiling and writing of the biography remains , accordingly , a matter for further scholarly investigation . " 
 The " enemies " Stouck refers to relate to the so @-@ called " Next Friends " lawsuit , which was being prepared during the McClure 's serialization . The lawsuit was brought by Eddy 's relatives , who said that she was unable to manage her own affairs ; had it succeeded she would have lost control of the church and her fortune . According to Fraser , the suit was organized in 1907 by Joseph Pulitzer ( 1847 – 1911 ) , owner of the New York World ( 1860 – 1931 ) ; his motive was to engineer a story about Eddy to rival that of McClure 's . Gillian Gill , in her Mary Baker Eddy ( 1998 ) , wrote that the New Hampshire Historical Society holds documents that show the McClure 's journalists were in touch with the litigants and that both sides were feeding each other information . 
 According to Fraser , an official from the church 's Committee on Publication made the following statement at its 1993 annual meeting : 
 A major corrective opportunity this year involved the rerelease of one of the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy , The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine . Dating from the yellow journalism period , this book was published in an attempt to discredit her . The current publisher , after much correspondence with our office , instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias . The book has received almost no attention in the public , proving if Truth isn 't spoken , nothing is said . 
 = = = General reception and influence = = = 
 The articles and book became key primary sources for most of the biographies of Eddy that have been published independently of the church . Gill wrote that in any publication not written by a Christian Scientist , the material is regarded as the single trustworthy source on Eddy , especially on the first half of her life . It influenced Edwin Franken Dakin 's Mrs. Eddy : The Biography of a Virginal Mind ( 1929 ) , Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore 's Mary Baker Eddy : The Truth and the Tradition ( 1932 ) , Martin Gardner 's The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy ( 1993 ) , and Caroline Fraser 's God 's Perfect Child ( 1999 ) . 
 The New York Times wrote in 1910 that the book " ranks among the really great biographies – or would were its subject of more intrinsic importance " : 
 Since this Life first appeared in McClure 's Magazine not one important statement as of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned . It is a product of much and highly intelligent labor , and were Christian Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason the wretched cult would not have survived its publication for a single month . It is unanswerable and conclusive , and nobody who has not read it can be considered well @-@ informed as to the history or nature of <unk> . 
 Gill disagreed that the book offers an accurate portrayal of Eddy . She argued , for example , that the story of Eddy having " fits " as a child to get her own way , or rather the way McClure 's described them , was " invented more or less out of whole cloth " by McClure 's journalist Burton Hendrick , and that the accounts of her as " hysterical " were misogynist . ( That Eddy would fall and lose consciousness as a child is supported by Robert Peel ( 1909 – 1992 ) , who worked for the church and wrote a sympathetic three @-@ volume biography of Eddy . ) 
 The journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns ( 1894 – 1988 ) , who was a minister in the Church of Religious Science ( a closely related belief system to Christian Science ) , wrote in 1974 that Cather was " a fine – maybe our finest – American woman novelist , " but that she was a " lousy unscrupulous reporter . " She argued that Cather had " stirred with grim fancy the most vicious and inaccurate of all the attacks on Mrs. Eddy . " David Stouck , in his introduction to the University of Nebraska Press edition , wrote that Cather 's portrayal of Eddy " contains some of the finest portrait sketches and reflections on human nature that Willa Cather would ever write .

 Seekers is a children 's novel series written by a team of authors under the pseudonym Erin Hunter , who also wrote the Warriors series . Seekers follows the adventures of four bear cubs : Kallik ( a polar bear ) , Lusa ( a black bear ) , Ujurak ( a small grizzly bear who can shape @-@ shift into any animal ) , and Toklo ( also a grizzly bear ) . Led by Ujurak , the four bears search for a place where they can live in peace without human interference and harassment . The first book The Quest Begins was released on May 27 , 2008 and was followed by Great Bear Lake , Smoke Mountain , The Last Wilderness , Fire in the Sky , and Spirits in the Stars , released on February 8 , 2011 . The series has been well received , with critics praising the realistic behavior of the characters , the excitement in the novels , and the descriptions of the bears ' world . 
 = = Inspiration and origins = = 
 Similarly to the Warriors series , Seekers began as a request from HarperCollins to Victoria Holmes to develop another series about a group of animals , but not cats . Dogs were considered , but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchical social organization , pack and hunting lifestyles , and territoriality . This was expressed by Victoria Holmes later in an online chat , where she stated that she " was reluctant to create stories that ... would be quite similar to Warriors . Dogs live in packs , they hunt for their food , they have a strict hierarchy within their communities , they guard their territories " . Horses , otters and dolphins were considered , but were dismissed : Holmes felt that horses tended to run away rather than stay and fight , and that dolphin battles would be slow without " the all @-@ action excitement that Erin loves so much " . In the end , the company left the decision to Holmes and she opted for bears ; in the later author chat she notes that bears " live much more solitary lifestyles than cats , they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever ( performing bears don 't count ) , and they are much bigger animals , with a whole lot more potential for fighting " . The series took inspiration from Inuit beliefs and Native American languages . Holmes found that Native Americans and bears are very closely linked to the natural environment . The names of the bears are taken from several different Indian languages . Lusa , for example , means " black " in Choctaw . 
 Holmes drew inspiration from Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages which are spoken in the area which the bears live . Holmes developed <unk> 's shape @-@ shifting powers after reading up on shamans , who are supposed to be able to transform into other animals . Holmes liked the idea and decided to have one of the bears have the same ability , which allowed him to " infiltrate a human community without them guessing the truth . " Later , Holmes " needed to establish what sort of beliefs each bear would have , " so after finding that bears are closely linked to their environment just like Native Americans , Holmes centered her research around the Natives . The names of the bears are from Native American languages ; Lusa means midnight or black in Choctaw , while Kallik means lightning in Inuktitut , <unk> means storm in Inuktitut , Taqqiq means moon , Toklo means two in <unk> , and Ujurak means rock .

 The series takes place over the span of six books , which are : The Quest Begins , Great Bear Lake , Smoke Mountain , The Last Wilderness , Fire in the Sky , and Spirits in the Stars . The story follows four young bears . Lusa , a black bear , Kallik , a polar bear , Toklo , a grizzly bear and Ujurak , who is able to shape @-@ shift into any animal , but remains a brown bear most of the time . 
 The first book , The Quest Begins , shows how each of the four bears are either abandoned or separated from their parents . Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas ( killer whales ) eat her mother , while her brother was still on the other side of the canal , thinking they were both dead . After this , Kallik travels to find her brother . Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother , Tobi , dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing , and left Toklo to travel alone . Lusa was born and raised in a zoo . Her story intertwines with Toklo 's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild . Hoping to leave her home , she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo . Meanwhile , Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him ; they begin to travel together . They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book . By Great Bear Lake , the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic . Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq , he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub . Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them . The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book , where there is plentiful food and shelter . After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters , they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness . However , even though they are there , Ujurak , who leads the journey , feels that they need to go further , into the Arctic . In Fire in the Sky , the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic . In the sixth and final book of the first series , Spirits in the Stars , the four bears make it to Star Island , a place where many polar bears live . They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub . The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub . Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone . The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat , but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others . Yakone , a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears , is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book .

 Seekers has also been published in original English @-@ language manga form . The books are drawn by Bettina <unk> , who also drew The Rise of Scourge . The first one , Toklo 's Story , was released on February 9 , 2010 , the same day The Last Wilderness was released . The second , featuring Kallik , called Kallik 's Adventure was released on February 8 , 2011 . The third one was going to be called Lusa 's Tale , But Tokyopop , the graphic novel company , decided not to make any more books for the USA . Unless Erin Hunter creates it herself , the book may not come out at all . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The main theme emphasized in the series is the environment . Holmes says that by " coming up with a series about a different animal gave me a chance to explore some themes that don 't fit so easily into Warriors . In particular , the environment . " Holmes says that she has always been keen on recycling and saving the planet so she wanted to explore the ways bears and other animals might react to humans destroying their homes and habitats . Many reviewers have picked up the theme . Publishers Weekly found that " readers will appreciate the bears ' struggle to survive , along with Hunter 's environmental theme . " Booklist also commented on each separate story of the three bears touch on environmental problems and issues . School Library Journal noted that " The bears ' declining habitat is evident , and often throughout their journey the animals have to dodge cars and humans with guns . " 
 A review from Children 's Literature picked up the environmental theme , but commented on themes such as " youth versus age , new versus tradition and the discovery that foreign others are often not very different from oneself . " This also ties into a theme of racism noted by a <unk> reviewer . He notes that " [ Hunter ] also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach — three bears of different color , different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship . " Despite differences between the bears they still work together . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The first series contains a total of six books . It was originally to be called " The Clawed Path , " as the journey the four bears make through all six books in the series is referred to as " the clawed path . " At the very last moment , the title was changed so that it would look similar to the Warriors series . Holmes was initially unhappy with the change , but has since said that she has come to like it and the way it looks on the books . 
 The first novel of the series , The Quest Begins , was first featured on the <unk> 's <unk> Program in November 2007 . Readers who signed up for the program had a chance to read an early edition of this book , an Advanced Reader 's Copy , before it was published in stores . The Quest Begins was released in the US on May 27 , 2008 . The book was also released as a paperback on February 10 , 2009 and an e @-@ book on October 6 , 2009 . The US has published the fifth book and published the sixth on February 8 , 2011 . 
 The books have also been released in the UK and Canada . Canada received the first book on May 25 , 2008 . Canada has published up to the sixth book . The UK releases have different covers than the Canadian and US covers . In the UK , only the first , second , third and fourth books were released . The first three books have also been translated into Russian .

 Seekers has received generally positive reviews . Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful ending of the first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears ' struggle to survive . Booklist found the plot of the first book to have an " interesting balance of cute anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors . " School Library Journal wrote " from the first page , this story is exciting and refreshing " and " [ t ] he plot is fast paced , and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline @-@ charged mood of these youngsters on their own . " Kirkus Review found that " Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty , beauty , tenderness , savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery . " However , the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot . In a review for the second and third books , Horn Book Review felt that readers might experience some confusion about the mountain , but they would still enjoy the fantasy adventure and the descriptions of the animals .

 " Krusty Gets Kancelled " is the twenty @-@ second and final episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 13 , 1993 . In the episode , a new show featuring a puppet named Gabbo premieres in Springfield and competes with Krusty the Clown 's show . Krusty 's show is soon cancelled , and Bart Simpson decides to help Krusty get back on the air by staging a comeback special . 
 John Swartzwelder wrote the episode and David Silverman served as director . Following the success of " Homer at the Bat " , the writers wanted to try a similar guest star heavy episode , except with celebrities instead of baseball players . The episode proved quite difficult as many of the actors asked to guest star declined at the last minute and the comeback special portion was nearly scrapped . Johnny Carson , Hugh Hefner , Bette Midler , Luke Perry and the Red Hot Chili Peppers ( Flea , Anthony Kiedis , Arik Marshall and Chad Smith ) all guest star as themselves and appear on Krusty 's special . Elizabeth Taylor and Barry White , both of whom guest starred in previous episodes this season , make cameo appearances . 
 = = Plot = = 
 One afternoon while watching television , Homer and Bart see a highly distracting commercial for something named " Gabbo " . The advertisement is the start of a viral marketing campaign around Springfield to build interest in whatever " Gabbo " is . Finally , " Gabbo " is revealed to be a ventriloquist 's dummy . Ventriloquist Arthur Crandall announces that Gabbo 's new program will air in direct competition with the established Krusty the Klown Show on each afternoon at 4 p.m. Gabbo 's catchphrase — " I 'm a bad <unk> boy " — instantly charms his intended audience , and this has a negative impact on Krusty and his show . The clown vows to withstand the competition from the new program , but Gabbo 's cutthroat tactics quickly attract Krusty 's audience . Krusty tries to fight back with a dummy of his own , but due to its gruesome appearance and poor condition , it falls apart , and scares off many of the children in the audience . Even The Itchy & Scratchy Show abandon Krusty , move to the Gabbo Show , and are replaced with the strangely incomprehensible Eastern European cartoon " Worker and Parasite " ( in the style of <unk> <unk> ) with characters resembling them . Eventually , Krusty 's ratings hit rock bottom , and then his show is cancelled . 
 Left without work and without having built a nest egg , Krusty falls on hard times and begins suffering from depression . Meanwhile , Bart and Lisa , all along unimpressed with Gabbo , decide to try to help Krusty . When Bart sneaks into the studio where they are filming Gabbo , he overhears Gabbo referring to children of Springfield as " S.O.B. ' s " while the cameras are switched off . He manages to distract the cameraman and turns the cameras back on as Gabbo continues this rant . This adversely affects Gabbo 's reputation , and Kent Brockman reports it on the news . But he repeats the same " S.O.B. ' s " gaffe , is fired from his job , and Gabbo escapes unscathed . Meanwhile , Krusty is still down in the dumps without a job . After visiting his house and seeing photos of Krusty 's celebrity friends , Bart and Lisa suggest he host a comeback special . They begin recruiting major celebrities to appear on Krusty 's special : Bette Midler , Johnny Carson , the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Hugh Hefner , and Luke Perry ( Krusty 's " worthless half @-@ brother " ) . They also try to recruit Elizabeth Taylor , but her agent declines the invitation before they can speak to her . 
 Bart and Lisa return to Krusty to declare their success , only to find him morbidly obese from drinking several milkshakes after believing them to be weight @-@ loss shakes . Fortunately , the entire Simpson family helps get him back into shape before the special airs . 
 Krusty 's comeback special features his reunion with Sideshow Mel , Perry getting shot out of a cannon , the Red Hot Chili Peppers singing " Give It Away " in their underwear , Carson lifting a 1987 Buick Skylark over his head and Krusty and Midler singing " Wind Beneath My Wings " . The show is a great success and Krusty 's career gets back on track . While watching the special at home , Taylor remarks to herself that she should fire her agent . Afterwards , everyone heads to Moe 's for an after party , where they toast Krusty and watch Carson as he plays the accordion while balancing Grampa and Jasper on a bench on his head . 
 = = Production = = 
 The idea of The Krusty the Clown Show being cancelled was pitched by writer John Swartzwelder . The rest of the writers decided this would be an opportunity to include a group of celebrity guest stars . They had done a similar episode the year before called " Homer at the Bat " which starred nine Major League Baseball players and had hoped to emulate its success . At that point , the writers had a list of celebrities that had wanted to do a guest spot on the show and decided to use this episode to burn through some of them . However , the episode was described by executive producer Mike Reiss as " a nightmare " because several guests pulled out at the last minute and the script had to be changed several times . One of the goals for the episode was to have an ex @-@ President of the United States . They wrote " very respectful but cute " parts for each then @-@ living ex @-@ president ( Nixon , Ford , Carter , and Reagan ) at the time , but they all turned them down . Only Ronald Reagan responded , sending a politely worded reply . 
 All of the guest stars were recorded over a period of several months . One of the writers ' goals was to get a musical act to appear , but several performers , including The Rolling Stones and Wynonna Judd , turned the role down ( although the Stones did eventually appear in Season 14 's " How I Spent My Strummer Vacation " ) . The Red Hot Chili Peppers finally accepted , and were directed by George Meyer who told them to ad @-@ lib many of their lines . The celebrity aspect of the episode was almost canceled because the producers were unable to get an obligation before the record deadline . Johnny Carson appears in the episode , and it was one of the few televised appearances he made after he retired from The Tonight Show . He recorded his lines the night after the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards . The original role pitched for Carson was one where he visited the Simpson family 's house and <unk> off them . Carson felt this role was too degrading , so instead the writers took the opposite route and portrayed him as extremely versatile and multi @-@ talented . Bette Midler 's condition for guest starring was that the show promoted her anti @-@ littering campaign . Elizabeth Taylor guest starred as herself and also recorded a part as Maggie in " Lisa 's First Word " on the same day . Luke Perry was one of the first guest stars to agree to their part . 
 The short cartoon " Worker and Parasite " is a reference to Soviet cartoons . To produce the animation , director David Silverman <unk> several drawings and made the animation very jerky . The scene where Krusty sings " Send in the Clowns " was very tricky for the animators because it involves two shots of the same scene from different angles . Parts of the scene were animated by Brad Bird . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Folk singer Judy Collins ' 1975 rendition of the song " Send in the Clowns " is parodied in the episode , and Krusty sings the altered lyrics : " Send in those soulful and doleful , schmaltz @-@ by @-@ the @-@ bowlful clowns " in a musical number of his comeback special . Gabbo 's name comes from the 1929 film The Great Gabbo . He was originally designed to be more square , but the second design was made to be " a demented Howdy Doody " . His voice was based on Jerry Lewis . The sequence with Gabbo 's song contains several references to the 1940 film Pinocchio . Krusty mentions that he beat Joey Bishop . Bishop was an entertainer who had his own show , The Joey Bishop Show , which ran opposite of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . Bette Midler 's serenading Krusty is a reference to the way Bette sang to Johnny Carson on the penultimate episode of Carson 's The Tonight Show . The scene in which Krusty instructs the Red Hot Chili Peppers to change the lyrics to the song " Give It Away " is a reference to Ed Sullivan instructing The Doors to change the lyrics to the song " Light My Fire " . The poses of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the scene are based on the movie The Doors . Flea , the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers , is mistakenly seen playing a guitar during the performance of " Give It Away " . Several scenes in Krusty 's special are based on Elvis Presley 's ' 68 Comeback Special . The musical piece that Hugh Hefner plays on the wine glasses is from Peter and the Wolf and was composed by Sergei Prokofiev .

 = Battle of the Eastern Solomons = 
 The naval Battle of the Eastern Solomons ( also known as the Battle of the Stewart Islands and , in Japanese sources , as the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea ( <unk> ) ) took place on 24 – 25 August 1942 , and was the third carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II and the second major engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Guadalcanal Campaign . As at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway , the ships of the two adversaries were never within sight of each other . Instead , all attacks were carried out by carrier @-@ based or land @-@ based aircraft . 
 After several damaging air attacks , the naval surface combatants from both America and Japan withdrew from the battle area without either side securing a clear victory . However , the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage . Japan 's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews . Also , Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships , giving the Allies more time to prepare for the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery , ammunition , and other supplies . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. Marine Corps units ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the U.S. and Australia , and secure the islands as launching points for a campaign with an eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 The Allied landings were directly supported by three U.S. aircraft carrier Task Forces ( TF ) : TF 11 ( USS Saratoga ) , TF 16 ( USS Enterprise ) , and TF 18 ( USS Wasp ) , their respective air groups , and supporting surface warships , including a battleship , cruisers , and destroyers . The overall commander of the three carrier task forces was Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher , who flew his flag on Saratoga . The aircraft from the three carriers provided close air support for the invasion forces and defended against Japanese air attacks from Rabaul . After a successful landing , they remained in the South Pacific area charged with four main objectives : ( 1 ) guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo ; ( 2 ) giving support to Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against possible Japanese counteroffensives ; ( 3 ) covering the movement of supply ships aiding Guadalcanal ; and ( 4 ) engaging and destroying any Japanese warships that came within potential range . 
 Between 15 and 20 August , the U.S. carriers covered the delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal . This small but hard @-@ won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain , and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace . In fact , Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area . Historically , Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal . 
 Surprised by the Allied offensive in the Solomons , Japanese naval forces ( under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ) and army forces prepared a counteroffensive , with the goal of driving the Allies out of Guadalcanal and Tulagi . The counteroffensive was called Operation Ka ( Ka comes from the first syllable for Guadalcanal as pronounced in Japanese ) with the naval forces having an additional objective of destroying Allied warship forces in the South Pacific area , specifically the U.S. carriers .

 = = = Prelude = = = 
 On 16 August 1942 , a convoy of three slow transport ships loaded with 1 @,@ 411 Japanese soldiers from the 28th " Ichiki " Infantry Regiment as well as several hundred naval troops from the 5th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force ( SNLF ) , departed the major Japanese base at Truk Lagoon ( Chuuk ) and headed towards Guadalcanal . The transports were guarded by light cruiser Jintsu , eight destroyers , and four patrol boats , led by Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka ( flag in Jintsu ) Also departing from Rabaul to help protect the convoy was a " Close Cover force " of four heavy cruisers from the 8th Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa . These were the same relatively old heavy cruisers that had defeated an Allied naval surface force in the earlier Battle of Savo Island ( with the subtraction of the Kako , which had been sunk by an American submarine ) . Tanaka planned to land the troops from his convoy on Guadalcanal on 24 August . 
 On 21 August , the rest of the Japanese Ka naval force departed Truk , heading for the southern Solomons . These ships were basically divided into three groups : the " Main Body " contained the Japanese carriers — Shōkaku and Zuikaku , light carrier Ryūjō , and a screening force of one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers , commanded by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo in Shōkaku ; the " Vanguard Force " consisted of two battleships , three heavy cruisers , one light cruiser , and three destroyers , commanded by Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe ; the " Advanced Force " contained five heavy cruisers , one light cruiser , six destroyers , and the seaplane carrier Chitose , commanded by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō . Finally , a force of about 100 IJN land @-@ based bombers , fighters , and reconnaissance aircraft at Rabaul and nearby islands were positioned for operational support . Nagumo 's main body positioned itself behind the " Vanguard " and " Advanced " forces in an attempt to more easily remain hidden from U.S. reconnaissance aircraft . 
 The Ka plan dictated that once U.S. carriers were located , either by Japanese scout aircraft or an attack on one of the Japanese surface forces , Nagumo 's carriers would immediately launch a strike force to destroy them . With the U.S. carriers destroyed or disabled , Abe 's " Vanguard " and Kondo 's " Advanced " forces would close with and destroy the remaining Allied naval forces in a warship surface action . This would then allow Japanese naval forces the freedom to neutralize Henderson Field through bombardment while covering the landing of the Japanese army troops to retake Guadalcanal and Tulagi . 
 In response to an unanticipated land battle fought between U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal and Japanese forces on 19 – 20 August , the U.S. carrier task forces under Fletcher reversed back towards Guadalcanal from their positions 400 mi ( 350 nmi ; 640 km ) to the south on 21 August . The U.S. carriers were to support the Marines , protect Henderson Field , engage the enemy and destroy any Japanese naval forces that arrived to support Japanese troops in the land battle on Guadalcanal . 
 Both Allied and Japanese naval forces continued to converge on 22 August and both sides conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts , however neither side spotted its adversary . The disappearance of at least one of their scouting aircraft ( shot down by aircraft from Enterprise before it could send a radio report ) , caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area . The U.S. , however , was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces . 
 At 09 : 50 on 23 August , a U.S. PBY Catalina flying boat ( based at <unk> in the Santa Cruz Islands ) initially sighted Tanaka 's convoy . By late afternoon , with no further sightings of Japanese ships , two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off to attack the convoy . However , Tanaka , knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting , reversed course once it had departed the area , and eluded the strike aircraft . After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike , the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August . By 18 : 23 on 23 August , with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of their presence in the area , Fletcher detached Wasp ( which was getting low on fuel ) and the rest of TF 18 for the two @-@ day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel . Thus , Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle . 
 = = = Carrier action on August 24 = = = 
 At 01 : 45 on 24 August 1942 , Nagumo ordered Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara ( with the light carrier Ryūjō , the heavy cruiser Tone and destroyers Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze ) to proceed ahead of the main Japanese force and send an aircraft attack force against Henderson Field at daybreak . The Ryūjō mission was most likely in response to a request from <unk> <unk> ( the naval commander at Rabaul ) for help from the combined fleet in neutralizing Henderson Field . The mission may also have been intended by Nagumo as a feint maneuver to divert U.S. attention allowing the rest of the Japanese force to approach the U.S. naval forces undetected as well as to help provide protection and cover for Tanaka 's convoy . Most of the aircraft on Shōkaku and Zuikaku were readied to launch on short notice if the U.S. carriers were located . Between 05 : 55 and 06 : 30 , the U.S. carriers ( mainly Enterprise augmented by PBY Catalinas from <unk> ) launched their own scout aircraft to search for the Japanese naval forces . 
 At 09 : 35 , a Catalina made the first sighting of the Ryūjō force . Later that morning , several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo 's and Mikawa 's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed . Throughout the morning and early afternoon , U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines , leading Fletcher to believe that the Japanese knew where his carriers were , which actually was not yet the case . Still , Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area . Finally , with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers , at 13 : 40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō . However , he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted . 
 Meantime , at 12 : 20 , Ryūjō launched six Nakajima B5N2 " Kate " bombers and 15 A6M3 Zero fighters to attack Henderson Field in conjunction with an attack by 24 Mitsubishi G4M2 " Betty " bombers and 14 Zeros from Rabaul . However , unknown to the Ryūjō aircraft , the Rabaul aircraft had encountered severe weather and returned to their base earlier at 11 : 30 . The Ryūjō aircraft were detected on radar by Saratoga as they flew toward Guadalcanal , further fixing the location of their ship for the impending U.S. attack . The Ryūjō aircraft arrived over Henderson Field at 14 : 23 , and tangled with Henderson 's fighters ( members of the Cactus Air Force ) while bombing the airfield . In the resulting engagement , three " Kates " , three Zeros , and three U.S. fighters were shot down , and no significant damage was done to Henderson Field . 
 Almost simultaneously , at 14 : 25 a Japanese scout aircraft from the cruiser Chikuma sighted the U.S. carriers . Although the aircraft was shot down , its report was transmitted in time , and Nagumo immediately ordered his strike force launched from Shōkaku and Zuikaku . The first wave of aircraft ( 27 Aichi D3A2 " Val " dive bombers and 15 Zeros ) was off by 14 : 50 and on its way toward Enterprise and Saratoga . Coincidentally about this same time , two U.S. scout aircraft finally sighted the main Japanese force . However , due to communication problems , these sighting reports never reached Fletcher . Before leaving the area , the two U.S. scout aircraft attacked Shōkaku , causing negligible damage . 
 At 16 : 00 a second wave of 27 " Vals " and nine Zeros was launched by the Japanese carriers and headed south toward the U.S. carriers . Abe 's " Vanguard " force also surged ahead in anticipation of meeting the U.S. ships in a surface action after nightfall . 
 Again coincidentally about this same time , the Saratoga strike force arrived and attacked Ryūjō , hitting and heavily damaging her with three to five bombs and perhaps one torpedo , and killing 120 of her crew . Also during this time , several U.S. B @-@ 17 heavy bombers attacked the crippled Ryūjō but caused no additional damage . The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall and she sank soon after . Amatsukaze and Tokitsukaze rescued Ryūjō 's survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force , who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby . After the rescue operations were complete , both Japanese destroyers and Tone rejoined Nagumo 's main force . 
 At 16 : 02 , still waiting for a definitive report on the location of the Japanese fleet carriers , the U.S. carriers ' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft . Fifty @-@ three F4F @-@ 4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers . However , communication problems , limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar , primitive control procedures , and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros , prevented all but a few of the U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers . Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks , Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted . These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find , or else to circle outside the battle zone , until it was safe to return . 
 At 16 : 29 , the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks . Although several attempted to set up to attack the Saratoga , they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier , Enterprise . Thus , Enterprise was the target of almost the entire Japanese air attack . Several Wildcats followed the " Vals " into their attack dives , despite the intense anti @-@ aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships , in a desperate attempt to disrupt their attacks . As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti @-@ aircraft fire , as well as several Vals . 
 Because of the effective anti @-@ aircraft fire from the U.S. ships , plus evasive maneuvers , the bombs from the first nine " Vals " missed Enterprise . However , at 16 : 44 , an armor @-@ piercing , delayed @-@ action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline , killing 35 men and wounding 70 more . Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list , but it was not a major breach of hull integrity . 
 Just 30 seconds later , the next " Val " planted its bomb only 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) away from where the first bomb hit . The resulting detonation ignited a large secondary explosion from one of the nearby 5 in ( 130 mm ) guns ' ready powder casings , killing 35 members of the nearby gun crews and starting a large fire . 
 About a minute later , at 16 : 46 , the third and last bomb hit Enterprise on the flight deck forward of where the first two bombs hit . This bomb exploded on contact , creating a 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) hole in the deck , but caused no further damage . Four " Vals " then broke off from the attack on Enterprise to attack the U.S. battleship North Carolina , but all of their bombs missed and all four " Vals " were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire or U.S. fighters . The attack was over at 16 : 48 , and the surviving Japanese aircraft reassembled in small groups and returned to their ships . 
 Both sides thought that they had inflicted more damage than was the case . The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese aircraft , even though there were only 42 aircraft in all . Actual Japanese losses — from all causes — in the engagement were 25 aircraft , with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued . The Japanese , for their part , mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers , instead of just one . The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement , with most of the crews being rescued . 
 Although Enterprise was heavily damaged and on fire , her damage @-@ control teams were able to make sufficient repairs for the ship to resume flight operations at 17 : 46 , only one hour after the engagement ended . At 18 : 05 , the Saratoga strike force returned from sinking Ryūjō and landed without major incident . The second wave of Japanese aircraft approached the U.S. carriers at 18 : 15 but was unable to locate the U.S. formation because of communication problems and had to return to their carriers without attacking any U.S. ships , losing five aircraft in the process from operational mishaps . Most of the U.S. carrier aircraft launched just before the first wave of Japanese aircraft attacked failed to find any targets . However , two SBD Dauntlesses from Saratoga sighted Kondo 's advanced force and attacked the seaplane tender Chitose , scoring two near @-@ hits which heavily damaged the unarmored ship . The U.S. carrier aircraft either landed at Henderson Field or were able to return to their carriers after dusk . The U.S. ships retired to the south to get out of range of any approaching Japanese warships . In fact , Abe 's " Vanguard " force and Kondo 's " Advance " force were steaming south to try to catch the U.S. carrier task forces in a surface battle , but they turned around at midnight without having made contact with the U.S. warships . Nagumo 's main body , having taken heavy aircraft losses in the engagement and being low on fuel , also retreated northward . 
 = = = Actions on 25 August = = = 
 Believing that two U.S. carriers had been taken out of action with heavy damage , Tanaka 's reinforcement convoy again headed toward Guadalcanal , and by 08 : 00 on 25 August they were within 150 mi ( 130 nmi ; 240 km ) of their destination . At this time , Tanaka 's convoy was joined by five destroyers which had shelled Henderson Field the night before , causing slight damage . At 08 : 05 , 18 U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field attacked Tanaka 's convoy , causing heavy damage to Jintsu , killing 24 crewmen , and knocking Tanaka unconscious . The troop transport <unk> Maru was also hit and eventually sank . Just as the destroyer Mutsuki pulled alongside <unk> Maru to rescue her crew and embarked troops , she was attacked by four U.S. B @-@ 17s from Espiritu Santo which landed five bombs on or around Mutsuki , sinking her immediately . An uninjured but shaken Tanaka transferred to the destroyer <unk> , sent Jintsu back to Truk , and took the convoy to the Japanese base in the Shortland Islands . 
 Both the Japanese and the U.S. elected to completely withdraw their warships from the area , ending the battle . The Japanese naval forces lingered near the northern Solomons , out of range of the U.S. aircraft based at Henderson Field , before finally returning to Truk on 5 September . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle is generally considered to be a tactical and strategic victory for the U.S. because the Japanese lost more ships , aircraft , and aircrew , and Japanese troop reinforcements for Guadalcanal were delayed . Summing up the significance of the battle , historian Richard B. Frank states : 
 The Battle of the Eastern Solomons was unquestionably an American victory , but it had little long @-@ term result , apart from a further reduction in the corps of trained Japanese carrier aviators . The ( Japanese ) reinforcements that could not come by slow transport would soon reach Guadalcanal by other means . 
 The U.S. lost only seven aircrew members in the battle . However , the Japanese lost 61 veteran aircrew , who were hard for the Japanese to replace because of an institutionalized limited capacity in their naval aircrew training programs and an absence of trained reserves . The troops in Tanaka 's convoy were later loaded onto destroyers at the Shortland Islands and delivered piecemeal , without most of their heavy equipment , to Guadalcanal beginning on August 29 , 1942 . The Japanese claimed considerably more damage than they had inflicted , including that Hornet — not in the battle — had been sunk , thus avenging its part in the Doolittle Raid . 
 Emphasizing the strategic value of Henderson Field , in a separate reinforcement effort , Japanese destroyer Asagiri was sunk and two other Japanese destroyers heavily damaged on 28 August , 70 mi ( 61 nmi ; 110 km ) north of Guadalcanal in " The Slot " by U.S. aircraft based at the airfield . The battle for the island settled into a two @-@ month @-@ long stalemate , punctuated by an intense land battle at Edson 's Ridge on 13 September and a large surface naval engagement at Cape Esperance and a bombardment of Henderson Field by two Japanese battleships from Truk in early October . 
 Enterprise traveled to Pearl Harbor for extensive repairs , which were completed on 15 October 1942 . She returned to the South Pacific on 24 October , just in time for the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and her rematch with Shōkaku and Zuikaku . 
 = Siegfried @-@ class coastal defense ship = 
 The Siegfried class was a group of six coastal defense ships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( " Imperial Navy " ) in the late 19th century . The ships were intended to protect the German coastline from naval attacks . The class comprised the lead ship Siegfried , along with her sisters Beowulf , Frithjof , Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Hagen . All six ships were named after Norse mythological figures . Two further vessels , the Odin class , were built to a similar design but were not identical . 
 The Siegfried @-@ class ships were obsolete by the outbreak of World War I , and saw only limited service in their intended role before they were withdrawn from active duty . The ships then served in a variety of secondary duties , including barracks ships , target ships , and in the case of Beowulf , an icebreaker in the Baltic Sea . All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919 , days before the Treaty of Versailles was signed . Five of the ships were sold for scrapping immediately after they were struck from the register , but Frithjof was purchased by a shipping company , and converted into a freighter . She served in this capacity until she too was scrapped in 1930 .

 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Siegfried class were 76 @.@ 40 meters ( 250 ft 8 in ) long at the waterline and 79 m ( 259 ft 2 in ) long overall . The ships had a beam of 14 @.@ 90 m ( 48 ft 11 in ) and a draft of between 5 @.@ 51 m ( 18 ft 1 in ) forward and 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 ft 10 in ) aft . All six ships were heavily rebuilt , each undergoing refits at various times between 1898 and 1904 . During the rebuilding , the ships were lengthened , to 84 @.@ 80 m ( 278 ft 3 in ) at the waterline and 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 ft 7 in ) overall . The ships ' beams remained the same , but their draft was slightly decreased , to 5 @.@ 45 m ( 17 ft 11 in ) forward and 5 @.@ 47 m ( 17 ft 11 in ) aft . The ships had a designed displacement of 3 @,@ 500 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 400 long tons ; 3 @,@ 900 short tons ) , and a maximum displacement of 3 @,@ 741 t ( 3 @,@ 682 long tons ) . After the reconstruction , the displacement was increased to between 4 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 436 t ( 3 @,@ 937 to 4 @,@ 366 long tons ) , depending on the ship . 
 The ships used transverse and longitudinal steel frames in the hull . They had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60 % of the hull . After the refits , one more watertight compartment was added . The ships were described as good sea boats ; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm . The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas , however . The ships had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men , with an additional 6 officers and 22 men when serving as a flagship . The refit increased crew requirements , to an additional 31 sailors normally , and the extra flagship crew increased to 9 officers and 34 men . The ships carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one pinnace , two cutters , one yawl , and one dinghy . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships were powered by two sets of 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines , each in its own engine room . These engines drove a pair of three @-@ bladed screws that were 3 @.@ 50 m ( 11 ft 6 in ) in diameter . The ships had eight marine type boilers , with the exception of Hagen , which was equipped with eight Thornycroft boilers . The ships had similar maximum speeds , with Beowulf the fastest at 15 @.@ 1 knots ( 28 @.@ 0 km / h ; 17 @.@ 4 mph ) and Heimdall the slowest at 14 @.@ 6 knots ( 27 @.@ 0 km / h ; 16 @.@ 8 mph ) . Each ship had three electric generators that provided between 29 – 26 kilowatts at 67 volts . The ships stored up to 220 t ( 220 long tons ; 240 short tons ) of coal and 220 t ( 220 long tons ; 240 short tons ) of fuel oil , which enabled a range of 1 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 760 km ; 1 @,@ 710 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . At 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) , the ships could only steam 740 nmi ( 1 @,@ 370 km ; 850 mi ) . With the refit , fuel bunkerage was more than doubled , to 580 t ( 570 long tons ; 640 short tons ) of coal and 500 t ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) of oil . This dramatically increased the sailing range , to 3 @,@ 400 nmi ( 6 @,@ 300 km ; 3 @,@ 900 mi ) at 10 knots and 1 @,@ 940 nmi ( 3 @,@ 590 km ; 2 @,@ 230 mi ) at 14 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' primary armament consisted of three 24 @-@ centimetre ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) K L / 35 guns . In an arrangement very unusual for such large guns , two of which were mounted in a pair of MPL C / 88 turrets forward side @-@ by @-@ side , while the third was mounted in a single turret aft . The guns could train 150 degrees to either side of the centerline , and depress to − 4 degrees and elevate to 25 degrees . This enabled a maximum range of 13 @,@ 000 m ( 43 @,@ 000 ft ) . The guns had an ammunition storage of 204 rounds , or 68 shells per gun . The guns had a rate of fire of around 2 shells per minute . The 1895 design for the armor @-@ piercing shell weighed 140 kg ( 310 lb ) . 
 The ships also had a secondary battery of eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 guns with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , though Siegfried only had six of these guns . After the refit , this was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the munition storage correspondingly increased to 2 @,@ 500 rounds . The 8 @.@ 8 cm gun fired a 10 kg ( 22 lb ) projectile at a muzzle velocity of 590 m / s ( 1 @,@ 936 m / s ) . The guns could sustain a rate of fire of approximately 15 rounds per minute . Six machine guns were temporarily fitted . 
 The ships were also equipped with four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes . One tube was mounted in the stern in an above @-@ water swivel mount , two were placed laterally , also above water , and the fourth was in the bow . The torpedo tubes were supplied with a total of 10 torpedoes . After the refit , the stern and lateral tubes were replaced with 45 cm ( 18 in ) weapons , but the lateral torpedo tubes were submerged . They had 8 torpedoes between them . The bow tube was retained , but also moved below the waterline ; it had three torpedoes . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ships ' armor consisted of compound steel for the first three ships and Krupp armor for the last three , coupled with teak . The upper section of the main armored belt was 240 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) at either end . This was mounted on 330 mm ( 13 in ) of timber . The lower section of the belt was 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick in the central area , and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) on the bow and stern . This portion of the armored belt was mounted on 290 mm ( 11 in ) of timber . The main armored deck was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , though on Hagen and Heimdall this was increased to 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The conning tower had a roof that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick and sides that were 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick ; the armor protection on the conning tower sides was also increased on Hagen and Heimdall , to 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The six ships of the Siegfried class were built by a combination of private and government shipyards . Siegfried was laid down at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel in 1888 . The ship was ordered as the coast defense ship " O " under construction number 44 . She was launched on 10 August 1889 and commissioned into the fleet on 29 April 1890 . Beowulf was built at AG Weser in Bremen from 1890 to 1892 . She had been ordered as " P " , under construction number 100 . Beowulf was launched on 8 November 1890 and commissioned on 1 April 1892 . Frithjof was also built at AG Weser , under construction number 101 and the provisional name " Q " . She was launched on 21 July 1891 and commissioned into active service on 23 February 1893 . 
 Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Hagen were all built at Imperial Navy dockyards , with Heimdall at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven and the latter two at the Kaiserliche Werft Kiel . Heimdall was laid down in 1891 under construction number 14 and the provisional name " U " ; she was launched on 27 July 1892 and commissioned on 7 April 1894 . Hildebrand and Hagen were ordered as " R " and " S " , respectively . Hildebrand was laid down in 1890 , launched on 6 August 1892 , and commissioned on 28 October 1893 . Hagen , the last ship of the class , was laid down in 1891 , launched on 21 October 1893 , and completed on 2 October 1894 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The ships of the Siegfried class saw only limited service in their intended roles . The revolutions in capital ship building in the first decade of the 20th century rapidly made these ships obsolete . The Second Naval Law , passed on 27 March 1908 , reduced the service life of all capital ships from 25 years to 20 years . This meant that the Siegfried @-@ class ships , along with a number of other vessels , were to be replaced as soon as possible . Siegfried , Beowulf , and Frithjof were replaced by the Helgoland @-@ class battleships Helgoland , Thüringen , and Oldenburg . Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Hagen were replaced by the Kaiser @-@ class battleships Kaiser , Friedrich der Grosse , and Kaiserin , respectively . 
 As the new battleships were intended for offensive operations , the Siegfried class was still retained for coast defense duties . The ships served in this capacity through the start of World War I , until they were withdrawn from active service in 1915 . Afterward , all six ships served in a variety of secondary roles , primarily as barracks ships . All six ships were struck from the naval register on 17 June 1919 , shortly before the Treaty of Versailles , which ended the First World War , was signed . Siegfried was a barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven from 1916 . She was intended to be rebuilt as a salvage ship , but this plan was abandoned and the vessel was sold to H. Peters , <unk> in 1919 for 425 @,@ 000 marks . She was broken up in 1920 in Kiel . Beowulf served as a target ship for U @-@ boats from 1916 to 1918 , when she transitioned to ice @-@ breaking duty in the Baltic Sea . Frithjof was a barracks ship in Danzig after 1916 . Following her removal from navy service , she was sold to A Bernstein in Hamburg . She was rebuilt as a freighter by Deutsche Werke , and served in this capacity until she was broken up in 1930 . She was the longest serving Siegfried @-@ class ship . 
 Heimdall was a barracks ship for the crews of U @-@ boats and the Ems coast defense flotilla based in Emden . Like Siegfried , Heimdall was intended to be reconstructed as a salvage ship , and this was likewise abandoned . She was broken up for scrap metal in 1921 . Hildebrand was a barracks ship in Windau after she was removed from active duty . She was sold to a Dutch ship @-@ breaking firm in 1919 , but while en route to the scrapyard , she became grounded on the Dutch coast . The wreck was blown up in 1933 , and eventually scrapped in situ . Hagen was a barracks ship in Libau , Danzig , and Warnemünde during the remainder of World War I. She was sold for scrapping to Norddeutsche Tiefbauges after the end of the war .

 U.S. Route 195 ( US 195 ) is a north – south United States Highway , of which all but 0 @.@ 65 miles of its 94 @.@ 42 miles ( 1 @.@ 05 of 151 @.@ 95 km ) are within the state of Washington . The highway starts in rural Idaho north of the city of Lewiston as a state highway in an interchange with US 95 . As the road crosses into Washington it becomes a state highway that connects communities in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington . US 195 travels north , serving the cities of Pullman , Colfax and Rosalia in Whitman County before continuing into Spokane County to its terminus in the city of Spokane at an interchange with Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) . 
 The first section of US 195 designated as part of Washington 's state highway system was codified in 1913 from Colfax to Spokane as the Inland Empire Highway and from the Idaho state line to Pullman as the Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway . The two highways were included as part of State Road 3 in 1923 and US 195 during the creation of the US Highway System on November 11 , 1926 . Originally , the northern terminus of the highway was at US 95 in Sandpoint , but was truncated to Spokane after US 2 was extended west from Bonners Ferry in 1946 . US 195 was cosigned with Primary State Highway 3 ( PSH 3 ) from US 95 to Spokane and PSH 6 from Spokane to Newport from the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 until the 1964 highway renumbering . US 195 was extended south into Idaho after the relocation of US 95 , designated as the North and South Highway in 1916 , onto its present freeway in 1975 . Bypasses of Pullman , Rosalia , and Plaza were completed during the early 1970s , converting portions of US 195 into a divided highway .

 US 195 travels within Idaho for 0 @.@ 577 miles ( 0 @.@ 929 km ) from an interchange with US 95 to the Washington state line , entirely north of Lewiston atop the Lewiston Hill in unincorporated Nez Perce County . ITD surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state 's highways . These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . A July 2011 survey reported average daily traffic of 6 @,@ 761 vehicles being served the US 95 interchange .

 US 195 travels 93 @.@ 37 miles ( 150 @.@ 26 km ) north through the Palouse region of Eastern Washington , from the Idaho state line north to Spokane . The highway serves as an important link between Pullman and Spokane as well as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway and a main north – south route in the region alongside State Route 27 ( SR 27 ) . US 195 enters Washington north of Clarkston in unincorporated Whitman County and travels west to an intersection with its 0 @.@ 61 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 98 km ) spur route , providing a connection to US 95 northbound towards Moscow . The highway continues northwest through farmland and the towns of Uniontown and Colton along Union Flat Creek towards Pullman . US 195 intersects SR 27 , also part of the Palouse Scenic Byway , and travels west of Pullman on a highway bypass of the city . The bypass travels through the termini of SR 194 and SR 270 as it leaves the Pullman area heading north towards Colfax along the South Fork Palouse River . US 195 becomes Main Street within Colfax and travels through the town along a WSDOT rail line to the eastern terminus of SR 272 and SR 26 . The highway continues north along Pine Creek and the WSDOT rail line past the northern terminus of SR 271 , a diamond interchange south of Rosalia , before leaving the Palouse Scenic Byway at the Spokane County border . The roadway heads north through a diamond interchange in Plaza and along <unk> Creek past the community of <unk> . US 195 enters the city of Spokane as a four @-@ lane highway along Hangman Creek and ends at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 90 , cosigned with US 2 and US 395 . 
 US 195 is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 195 , part of the Revised Code of Washington as § 47 @.@ 17 @.@ 380 . Every year , WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of AADT , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of US 195 within Washington was in Hangman Valley before the I @-@ 90 interchange in Spokane , serving 19 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busiest section was between Pullman and Colfax , serving 3 @,@ 100 vehicles .

 The Inland Empire Highway was originally a collection of gravel county roads that have existed since 1898 in the Spokane area and 1905 in the Pullman area . The highway was added to the state highway system in 1913 , traveling within the Palouse region between Colfax and Spokane . The Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway was also established in 1913 , traveling northwest from Sampson Trail Y at the Idaho – Washington state line to Pullman . The Idaho portion of US 195 became part of the North and South Highway in 1916 and was not numbered under Idaho 's state highway system in 1953 . The gap in the Second Division between Pullman and Colfax was named by Whitman County as a highway of importance the following year and was not built until 1925 as part of State Road 3 . State Road 23 , connecting Spokane to Newport , was designated in 1915 before it was renamed to the Pend O <unk> Highway and renumbered to State Road 6 in 1923 . The Inland Empire Highway was numbered as State Road 3 in 1923 and retained the designation as PSH 3 in 1937 , while State Road 6 became PSH 6 . 
 The United States Highway System was established on November 11 , 1926 , during its adoption by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) and included US 195 , traveling north from US 95 within Washington through Pullman and Spokane before ending at US 95 in Sandpoint , Idaho . The present four @-@ lane divided highway along Hangman Creek in Spokane was constructed in 1939 as part of general improvements to Eastern Washington highways , relocating the route of the creek and a nearby Northern Pacific Railway line . The section of US 195 between Spokane and Sandpoint was replaced by an extension of US 2 from Bonners Ferry , Idaho to Everett , Washington in 1946 , truncating the highway to US 10 and US 395 . During the 1964 highway renumbering , Washington converted its highways to the present state route system , to take effect in 1970 . US 195 replaced PSH 3 and its branches along its present route , with its southern terminus at US 95 atop Lewiston Hill in Idaho and its northern terminus at I @-@ 90 in Spokane at an interchange that was opened in 1969 . 
 The State Department of Highways completed construction of three highway bypasses between 1973 and 1975 , avoiding the cities of Pullman , Rosalia , and Plaza , using funding originally intended for the canceled Bay Freeway project in Seattle . US 95 was relocated onto its present freeway , bypassing Washington state , in 1979 and US 195 was extended south into Idaho to the new interchange with a spur route traveling towards northbound US 95 . The highway between Uniontown and Rosalia was designated as part of the Palouse Scenic Byway on December 19 , 2002 , as part of the Washington State Scenic and Recreational Highways program . WSDOT is , as of March 2013 , upgrading US 195 within Spokane in Hangman Valley to a limited @-@ access highway by constructing diamond interchanges and a single point urban interchange at four intersections to be completed in late 2013 . The project began with engineering studies in 1999 and progressed to limited access plans in 2002 and construction beginning in 2013 on the interchange with Cheney @-@ Spokane Road .

 = Len Waters = 
 Leonard Victor ( Len ) Waters ( 20 June 1924 – 24 August 1993 ) was the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator , and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) during World War II . Aborigines at the time suffered significant discrimination and disadvantages in Australian society , such as restrictions on movement , residence , employment , and access to services and citizenship . Born in northern New South Wales and raised in Queensland , Waters was working as a shearer when he joined the RAAF in 1942 . Training initially as a mechanic , he volunteered for flying duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944 . He flew P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre , where he completed 95 missions , mainly close air support . By the end of the war he had risen to the rank of warrant officer . Following his discharge from the RAAF in 1946 , he attempted to start a regional airline but was unable to secure financial backing and government approval . He went back to shearing , and died in 1993 at the age of 69 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 The fourth of 11 children to Donald and Grace Waters ( née Bennett ) , Len Waters was born at <unk> Mission , near <unk> in northern New South Wales on 20 June 1924 . He grew up at <unk> , near St George , Queensland , and was educated to the seventh grade at <unk> State School . Hearing tales of pioneering aviators Charles Kingsford Smith , Amy Johnson , Bert Hinkler and Charles Lindbergh , and reading stories of Biggles , Flash Gordon , and Buck Rogers , he had , as he put it , his " head in the clouds " from an early age . Waters left school when he was 14 to support his family , working alongside his father as a ring barker . He was paid 10 shillings per week , for a seven @-@ day week , less than one @-@ sixth of the average wage at the time . In 1939 , he began working as a shearer . 
 = = RAAF career = = 
 Although the military had officially barred or restricted the recruitment of Aborigines in earlier periods , these impediments were significantly relaxed after Japan entered World War II , and Australia came under direct attack for the first time . Waters volunteered for service in the RAAF on 24 August 1942 , at Brisbane , and was accepted . He began training as an aircraft mechanic , but later volunteered for flying service , and commenced initial training at Somers , Victoria , in December 1943 . The aircrew interviewer thought he looked " a bit rough " but " should make a fighter " . Waters believed his lack of education would be a disadvantage , and studied nights to make up for it . Keen to be a pilot , he was concerned that he would be allocated to duty as a wireless operator because he showed an aptitude for Morse transmission early on . He was also asked to imagine himself as the tail gunner in a Lancaster or Halifax heavy bomber , to which he replied , " I had a very disappointed look on my face , sir ! " So convinced was he that he would not achieve his dream of becoming an aviator , Waters made three separate bets against himself being selected , and had to pay out £ 15 when he was nevertheless chosen . 
 Waters undertook his basic flight instruction at No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School in Narrandera , New South Wales , where he flew De Havilland Tiger Moths . He completed his training on CAC Wirraways and received his wings as a sergeant pilot at No. 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty . Posted to No. 2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura , Victoria , he converted to P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighters . Once , while he was on leave , Waters was reportedly gaoled in Moree , New South Wales , for not carrying an identity card , which was one of the racially discriminatory institutions affecting Aborigines at the time . On 14 November 1944 , he was posted to No. 78 Squadron , a fighter unit based on the island of Noemfoor , off Dutch New Guinea . When he arrived , he was allocated a P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk . By chance , a previous pilot had nicknamed the plane " Black Magic " and painted those words on its nose . Waters found the name of his plane an amusing coincidence and chose to retain it . 
 By this stage of the war , Japanese aircraft were almost non @-@ existent in the South West Pacific theatre ; No. 78 Squadron 's main role was ground attack , bombing and strafing enemy positions . Waters flew 95 sorties from Noemfoor , and later from the air bases at Morotai and Tarakan , in Borneo . During one mission , his aircraft was struck by a 37 mm cannon shell that embedded itself behind him in the cockpit without detonating . He flew for another two hours , with the possibility of the shell exploding at any time , a situation he likened to having a loaded gun against his head . " I 'll tell you what " , he said after returning to base , " that was the best landing I ever made " . On 1 January 1945 , he was promoted to flight sergeant . By the end of the war , Waters was commanding operations which included commissioned officers . A colleague described him as a " gaunt , genial figure , humble despite his daring feats " . In addition to his combat flying , Waters also held the RAAF middleweight boxing title . 
 One of Len Waters ' brothers , Donald Edward ( Jimmy ) Waters , had served as an infantryman with the Australian Army during the war . With the end of the Pacific War in September 1945 , Len considered volunteering for the Australian component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan , if his brother did also . Jim declined at the time ( he later changed his mind ) , so Len returned to Australia and left the air force with the rank of warrant officer on 18 January 1946 . 
 = = Post @-@ war life and legacy = = 
 After returning to Australia , Waters attempted to start a regional airline serving South West Queensland . However , he was not able to secure finance or bureaucratic agreement . He reportedly wrote four letters seeking government approval , but never received a reply . He never flew a plane again . While racism in the military during World War II was considered to be minimal , Waters and other Aborigines who had served their country found that the skills they had acquired were not valued in peacetime . He wrote later that , having put off his uniform , he simply " returned to being a <unk> " . 
 Four weeks after his discharge from the Air Force , Waters married Gladys Saunders , with whom he had six children . He worked as an automotive mechanic , but was forced to cease by union rules , which required him to serve an apprenticeship . Waters was then briefly employed by a local council in Queensland as a road worker , before returning to shearing , which took him away from his family to properties stretching from North Queensland to Victoria . He personally estimated that he sheared a million sheep during his life . 
 Waters applied for housing commission accommodation and was allocated a house at Inala , Brisbane , in August 1956 . He eventually bought the property and lived there for 33 years . He died on 24 August 1993 at the age of 69 in <unk> , and was buried in St George Cemetery . 
 In 1995 – 96 , Waters was commemorated in several ways : Australia Post depicted his portrait on a stamp and that of his P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighter " Black Magic " on an <unk> , as part of its Australia Remembers series ; Black Magic Port was named after his personal Kittyhawk ; Len Waters Place , a park in Inala , was opened ; Moree Plains Shire Council dedicated Leonard Waters Park in <unk> , New South Wales ; and Len Waters Street in Ngunnawal , Australian Capital Territory , was named after him . In 2003 , <unk> Shire Council erected a monument to Waters and another local RAAF identity , Squadron Leader John Jackson , in St George . In 2011 , the Sutherland Shire Council recognised Len Waters ' memory and achievements by dedicating Len Waters Park , with a memorial plinth and plaque , at <unk> Circuit , Barden Ridge , New South Wales .

 " Casino Night " was the first episode of the series written by Steve Carell . Initially , Carell suggested to executive producer Greg Daniels that an episode should revolve around a casino night . When it came time to plan the finale for the show , Daniels chose the idea and picked Carell to write the script . Parts of the script were fleshed out during the flights to and from New York when the show was filming the earlier episode " Valentine 's Day " . Later , Carell had only one weekend to write the bulk script . Daniels was very happy with the rough script and noted " came in with a great draft " . Jenna Fischer admitted that filming the episode was a relief because she had " been carrying around the secret cliff @-@ hangers for two months " . Toby Flenderson , who is portrayed by writer Paul Lieberstein , stated during the episode " I 'm gonna chase that feeling " after winning at a game of poker . The line was originally intended to lead to a subplot wherein Toby develops a gambling addiction , but the storyline was later abandoned . 
 The episode was the fifth episode of the season and the seventh of the entire series directed by Ken Kwapis . During the editing of the episode , executive producer Greg Daniels publicly addressed NBC in an interview , stating , " I 'd like to get a supersized episode , because it ’ s a really long script with a lot of good stuff . " In response , fans of the show set up an online petition to " supersize " the season finale . The website generated over 2 @,@ 800 signatures . On April 20 , NBC announced it would be extending the season finale by ten minutes . Although other NBC shows Will & Grace and My Name Is Earl that aired on the same night had extended episodes , cast members David Denman and John Krasinski credited in interviews the petition for the extended time . Denman and Krasinski both believed that the petition was partially responsible for the other two shows getting extended times as well . 
 The filming of the episode 's ending caused a " huge divide among the writing staff and the director and the cast " . Carell , Kwapis , and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to " follow the characters and the emotion of the moment " by having the action captured in full by the show 's cameramen . The writing staff , on the other hand , wanted Pam and Jim 's moment to be private and only heard via the mics ; Daniels explained , " The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [ with the scene ] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn 't know was going to happen and so only heard on their mics and came running around the corner to film . " Eventually , both versions were filmed , but the former was broadcast . The alternate version has never been released . 
 The episode features Kevin Malone playing the drums in a band , which had been an idea circulated since the first season , when allusions to him being in a Steve Miller tribute band were written ; the scenes had to be removed from the series due to issues negotiating with the singer . The crew later decided to have Kevin be in a Police tribute band called Scrantonicity because he " talks so low , and has very little expression , and there is no band that sings higher and with more expression than the Police . " While Kevin was always intended to be the band 's lead singer , executive producer Greg Daniels approached Baumgartner about possibly playing an instrument , but the actor replied he could not play anything . Daniels and Baumgartner then discussed instruments that would be " funny " to play and brought up harmonicas , saxophones , and drums . They ultimately decided on the latter because they deemed a " drumming lead singer [ to ] be the funniest choice , " regardless of the fact that the actor had " absolutely no drumming experience , and it 's a difficult instrument . " 
 The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Michael creating Dunder Mifflin Mad Libs , Dwight and Jim choosing their charities , Dwight considering Jim 's telekinetic powers , an extension of Michael 's scene with Darryl , Pam finding planning a wedding stressful , Meredith and the casino dealer sharing a past .

 On the phone with Jan , Michael compares the performance of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin to the biblical story of David and Goliath . He later tells her that she 's the " Eva Peron to his Cesar Chavez " . He later calls answers his phone while talking to her and says " Jan Levenson , I presume " , a reference to " Dr. Livingstone , I Presume " . Michael reasons that the money from the casino night should benefit the Boy Scouts of America because " They don 't have cookies like the Girl Scouts ! " He later states that he will donate all of his charity winnings to Comic Relief , a British charity . Kelly reasons that she would donate her winnings to Kobe Bryant 's foundation , only because he bought his wife a large ring . 
 When Michael mentions donating money to " <unk> with AIDS " , the conversation gets confused , and the various office workers being talking about <unk> , Afghans , and the nonsensical " <unk> " . In a talking head , Michael notes that AIDS is not a humorous disease , and is one of the many things that is off @-@ topic in comedy , including the assassination of John F. Kennedy and The Holocaust . However , he notes that the assassination of Abraham Lincoln recently became funny . While looking through the various cover bands , Jim and Pam stumble upon a Kiss tribute and Jim tells Pam that her wedding should have three stages like Lollapalooza . Kevin 's band is playing a cover of " Don 't Stand So Close to Me " by The Police .

 " Casino Night " received widespread critical acclaim from television critics . Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated that " This episode , the season finale , was , in a word , brilliant . You could not ask for a better way to tie up story lines that occurred over the course of a season while opening up new ones at the same time . " Sciannamea went on to praise Carell 's writing , as well as the progression of the relationship arcs in the show . Brian Zoromski of IGN said that " ' Casino Night , ' was full of great character development , awkward situations and laugh @-@ out @-@ loud moments . " Zoromski enjoyed the unfolding of the Jim @-@ Pam relationship during the latter half of season two , and the climax of it in the season finale . He also enjoyed and praised the development of two minor characters , Kevin Malone and Creed Bratton , the latter played by the actor of the same name . He ultimately awarded the episode a ten out of ten , denoting a " Masterpiece " . Jacob <unk> of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an " A " . Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly noted that , unlike other shows that featured resolved sexual tension , The Office was in no worry of being cancelled .

In a 2011 poll conducted by fansite OfficeTally , fans voted " Casino Night " as their favorite of all Office episodes that had been aired at that time .

 Monica ( Courteney Cox ) tells her friends that she will not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of leftovers it will create . Chandler does not eat turkey as a result of his dislike of all Thanksgiving foods ( a result of childhood trauma ) , <unk> ( Lisa Kudrow 's character ) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy . This left only Monica , Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey . Joey ( Matt LeBlanc ) protests , and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary . Monica agrees , and Joey finishes the nineteen @-@ pound turkey by the end of the episode . Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high @-@ school friend of hers and Ross 's called Will Colbert ( Brad Pitt ) . Rachel does not remember him , and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner . 
 Throughout dinner , Will is hostile to Rachel . Will , like Monica , has lost a great deal of weight since high school and looks great . When Will keeps ignoring her advances and is continuously hostile , he reveals that she was horrible to him in high school . Will also eventually reveals that during high school , he and Ross initiated the episode 's titular rumor : that Rachel is a hermaphrodite , which was spread throughout their entire high school , and even went so far as to reach Chandler 's high school . Rachel reacts tearfully , claiming she never hurt Ross in high school , until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school 's 50 @-@ year @-@ old librarian , though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true , much to everyone 's amusement and disgust . Monica comforts Rachel , saying that despite the rumor , she was still the most popular girl in their high school , and reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that some things are more important than high school . Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that turns to a high five when he discovers that Ross " knocked her up but did not marry her . " Ultimately the characters settle their differences . The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey wearing Phoebe 's @-@ turned @-@ Rachel 's maternity pants and getting the meat sweats .

 It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood , though this was unfounded as Will 's weight was merely referred to on screen . Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance , though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience . When questioned about his appearance in the show , Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game , though added that he liked the series anyway . The episode was taped on November 2 , following four days of rehearsals .

 As the series finale drew close in 2004 , Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends : " <unk> reactions , overly exaggerated comedy , near @-@ palpable self @-@ consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor , Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage . After five minutes ' viewing , the audience did , too . " His work on set is admired by the main stars ; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was " definitely [ ... ] going against type " and LeBlanc called him " really great on the show " . USA Today rates Will 's line " Look at her standing there with those yams . My two greatest enemies , Ross . Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates " one of the best of the episode . 
 The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community , a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC , calling the episode " ignorant , insulting , degrading , and absolutely unprofessional " . The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society 's website and read an on @-@ air apology before future episodes .

 = Biman Bangladesh Airlines = 
 Biman Bangladesh Airlines ( Bengali : বিমান <unk> <unk> ় <unk> ্ <unk> ) , partly transcribed from English into Bengali and the other way around , commonly known as Biman ( Bengali : বিমান ) , is the flag carrier of Bangladesh . Its main hub is at Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka and it also operates flights from its secondary hubs at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet . The airline provides international passenger and cargo services to its destinations ; as of April 2015 , it has air service agreements with 42 countries , but flies to just 16 of them . The airline 's headquarters , Balaka Bhaban , is located in <unk> , Dhaka . Annual Hajj flights ; transporting tourists and non @-@ resident Bangladeshi workers and migrants ; and the activities of its subsidiaries form an integral part of the airline 's business . The carrier is currently facing stiff competition from a number of domestic Bangladeshi private airlines as well as some international carriers , which offer greater flexibility targeting Bangladesh 's air transport sector which is experiencing an 8 % annual growth rate , thanks to a large number of tourists and non @-@ resident Bangladeshi travellers . 
 Created in February 1972 , Biman enjoyed an internal monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996 . In the decades following its founding , the airline expanded its fleet and destinations but it was adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement . At its peak , Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations , extending from New York City in the west to Tokyo in the east . The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007 , when it was transformed into the country 's largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh . Since becoming a public limited company in 2007 , the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet . The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more . Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency and it also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then , the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe . 
 = = History = = 
 Biman Bangladesh Airlines was established on 4 January 1972 as Bangladesh 's national airline under the Bangladesh Biman Ordinance ( Presidential Order No. 126 ) . The initiative to launch the flag carrier was taken by 2 @,@ 500 former employees , including ten Boeing 707 commanders and seven other pilots of Pakistan International Airlines , who submitted a proposal to the government on 31 December 1971 following the independence of Bangladesh . The airline was initially called Air Bangladesh but was soon changed to its current name . 
 On 4 February 1972 , Biman started its domestic services , initially linking Dhaka with Chittagong , Jessore and Sylhet , using a single Douglas DC @-@ 3 acquired from India . Following the crash of this DC @-@ 3 on 10 February 1972 , near Dhaka , during a test flight , two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement . Shortly afterwards , additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC @-@ 6 , loaned by the World Council of Churches , which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC @-@ 6 , a DC @-@ 6B model leased from Troll @-@ Air , to operate the Dhaka @-@ Calcutta route . On 4 March 1972 , Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian . The short haul fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972 ; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972 . Three additional Fokker F27s were acquired during March and September of that year . In the first year of operation , Biman operated 1 @,@ 079 flights carrying just over 380 @,@ 000 passengers . 
 Four Fokker F27s joined the fleet in 1973 , enabling Biman to double the frequency of the Kolkata flight to a twice daily service . A Boeing 707 was added to the fleet in September and the flight to London became twice @-@ weekly , while a Chittagong – Kolkata flight also began operating . In 1974 , operations were extended to Kathmandu ( February ) , Bangkok ( November ) and Dubai ( December ) . In 1976 , Biman sold two of its Fokker F27s and bought another Boeing 707 to extend international services to Abu Dhabi , Karachi and Mumbai . Singapore was added to Biman 's list of international destinations , when a third Boeing 707 was purchased in February 1977 , followed by Jeddah , Doha and Amsterdam the following year , which also saw the purchase of its fourth Boeing 707 . In 1977 , Biman was converted into a public sector corporation to be governed by a board of directors appointed by the government . The airline broke even for the first time in 1977 – 78 , and made a profit the following year . International destinations expanded to include Kuala Lumpur , Athens , Muscat and Tripoli in 1979 , followed by Yangon , Tokyo and Dhahran in 1980 . Biman took delivery of its first 85 @-@ seater Fokker F28 @-@ 4000 in 1981 . In 1983 , three Douglas DC @-@ 10s joined the fleet and the airline started to phase out the Boeing 707s . The flight network expanded further to include Baghdad ( 1983 ) , Paris ( 1984 ) and Bahrain ( 1986 ) . On 5 August 1984 , Biman faced its worst accident ever when a Fokker F27 flying in from Chittagong crashed near Dhaka , killing all 49 on board . The long haul fleet was then supplemented by the purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996 , followed by the addition of two more in 2000 , from Singapore Airlines and Air Jamaica , and another in 2003 .

 Kevin John Steele , who served as MD and CEO of Biman from March 2013 to April 2014 , was the first foreign national in the airline 's history to be appointed CEO and MD of Biman . He was chosen from a pool of 42 local and foreign candidates after a competitive selection process . Steele is a British citizen who has many years of experience working in management and administrative positions at British Airways and other airlines around the world .

 The airline was wholly owned by the Bangladeshi government through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception . In 1977 , Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy , led by a government @-@ appointed board of directors .

 During the late 1980s , Hossain Mohammad Ershad , President of Bangladesh at the time , served as president of Biman . After an early period of expansion and growth , Biman entered an era of nose @-@ diving profits and slow growth , exacerbated by incompetent and corrupt management , who padded purchases , falsified repair bills , and kept unprofitable routes in operation for political reasons . Research conducted in 1996 found that Biman had 5 @,@ 253 non @-@ flying personnel , 30 percent more than Singapore Airlines , a carrier who operated a fleet almost ten times the size of Biman 's . The report described Biman as " poorly managed , overstaffed , undercapitalized , and subject to excessive political interference in its day @-@ to @-@ day management . "

 In the 1992 – 93 fiscal year , accounts under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism revealed that BDT 22 million in tax was not paid to the government . The audit carried out in 1999 , also showed that Biman was owed BDT 2 @.@ 2 million by travel agents from the proceeds of ticket sales , most likely with the collusion of Biman officials . Additionally , BDT 2 @.@ 4 million was overpaid as incentive commissions to the sales agents in violation of Biman policies . In 2007 , the caretaker government launched an anti @-@ corruption drive . This was shortly followed by the forced retirement of 35 other employees and officials , some of whom were close aides of <unk> Iskander . In 2008 Iskander , younger brother of former premier Khaleda Zia , was sent to jail over charges of concealing information regarding his wealth and not for his connection with Biman . 
 Faced with growing losses from the late 1990s onwards , the government offered 40 percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004 , hoping a buyer would take over the management of the carrier . However , the proposal demanded that many decision @-@ making rights remain within the Bangladesh government , and the offer was ignored by outside airlines . A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $ 1 @.@ 6 million in consultancy fees with no positive results . 
 = = = = 2000s = = = = 
 In the 2005 – 06 fiscal year , Biman carried 1 @.@ 15 million passengers , a growth of 70 % over the previous decade . With the rise of private domestic carriers in Bangladesh , however , Biman 's market share for domestic passengers dropped by 35 % over the previous ten years ' average , with only 162 @,@ 000 passengers travelling with Biman in the domestic sector in the 2005 – 06 fiscal year . During the same period , Biman reported its biggest annual loss of over US $ 120 million ( BDT 8 @.@ 3 billion as of 2010 ) , with a US $ 100 million ( BDT 6 @.@ 9 billion as of 2010 ) loss reported the following year . Biman also fell behind on millions of dollars in payments to its fuel supplier , the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation ( BPC ) , with debts that rose to BDT 15 @.@ 64 billion in late December 2006 ( 2006 @-@ 12 ) .

 In May 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 05 ) , the caretaker government approved plans to turn Biman into a public limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations . As a part of the restructuring , the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme ( VRS ) to reduce the man @-@ equipment ratio ( MER ) of 367 : 1 ( ratio of manpower to aircraft ) . The industry average at the time was 200 : 1 , and other Asian airlines operated with <unk> of about 150 : 1 . The VRS provided compensation based on length of service , at a cost to the government of over BDT 2 @.@ 97 billion borrowed from the World Bank . Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1 @,@ 600 , but 2 @,@ 162 applications were received , many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met . Biman accepted between 1 @,@ 863 and 1877 applications , and affirmed that key personnel would not be allowed to leave the organisation via VRS . 
 On 23 July 2007 , Biman Bangladesh Airlines became the largest public limited company in Bangladesh . Earlier suggestions that the airline should be renamed Bangladesh Airlines were rejected . The government is the sole shareholder of the 1 @.@ 5 billion shares , but intends to offer 49 percent to the private sector while retaining majority ownership . The previous managing director , Dr. Abdul Momen , was appointed as the chief executive officer ( CEO ) and managing director of the new organisation . The six directors were appointed from the ministries of energy , commerce , finance , civil aviation , foreign affairs , and the cabinet division , with the cabinet secretary taking on the role as chairman of the board of directors . The six secretaries and a joint secretary to the civil aviation ministry were made the seven shareholders of the new PLC . In September 2008 ( 2008 @-@ 09 ) , the government appointed Air Commodore <unk> Kuddus ( retd ) to replace Dr. Momen as CEO . From 2002 to 2005 Kuddus had been chair of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh ( CAAB ) , before which he had held various posts in the Bangladesh Air Force . 
 Following the privatisation , an initiative was launched by ex @-@ Biman employees , who left the organisation via the VRS , to set up a competing airline . Names proposed for the airline included Air Bangla International , Biman Employees Airlines and Balaka . They were joined by previous managing directors of Biman , along with the former president of the Bangladesh Airline Pilots ' Association . However , nothing further was heard of regarding the proposed venture . 
 The airline made profits in FY 2007 – 08 ( BDT 60 million ) and FY 2008 – 09 ( BDT 150 million ) ; In FY 2009 – 10 , however , the carrier incurred in a net loss of BDT 800 million .

 In FY 2010 – 11 it made losses of BDT 2 billion , despite the government exempting it a debt of about BDT 11 @.@ 94 billion and BDT 5 @.@ 73 billion owed to the BPC and the CAAB , respectively . In FY 2011 – 12 it made a loss of BDT 6 @.@ 06 billion ( US $ 75 million ) ; in FY 2012 – 13 <unk> figures show a loss of BDT 2 billion . The airline plans to be fully profitable by FY 2014 – 15 .

 Biman is notable for disruptions to its flight schedule and poor customer service . In 2007 , Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for its failure to maintain flight schedules . Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80 % usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow , as required by EU and International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) regulations , during the summer of 2007 . Biman should , therefore , not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London . Following discussions with BAA , however , Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80 % usage . Delays continued unabated and in September 2008 , Biman 's Dhaka – London direct flight utilising a DC @-@ 10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time . In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times , Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow , with flights delayed on average by three hours . In 2008 , the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman , citing both safety and security concerns and Biman 's unreliable flight schedules . It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk , and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance . Biman 's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive , but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules . He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months . 
 In 2013 , Biman signed agreements with SITA and Mercator to provide infrastructure support and revenue accounting services to the airline . 
 In 2014 , Biman launched advance seat reservation system on its website . The airline also offers online meal selection option , where the passenger can choose from diabetic meals , vegetarian meals , Asian vegetarian meal , child meal and Muslim meal , that will be served on board .

 Biman relaunched its inflight magazine re @-@ branded as <unk> in September 2013 . The bi @-@ monthly magazine , previously known as <unk> , and prior to that <unk> , is published by <unk> Media Group . The magazine is available in both Bengali and English , covering topics about Bangladesh and Biman 's destinations . English and Bengali language newspapers are also available on board in the aircraft . 
 The newer Boeing 777s are equipped with modern in @-@ flight entertainment . Every seat is fitted with personal touch screen displays provided by Thales . It is loaded with movies , songs and games . It also has high resolution moving maps and live flight information . It is in two languages – English and Bengali . 
 Biman launched in @-@ flight duty free sales in March 2014 , branded as Biman Boutique . The duty @-@ free products include : perfumes , cosmetics , <unk> , watches , children 's gifts , chocolate and tobacco .

 = = = Ticketing = = = 
 An agreement was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman 's ticketing system with an e @-@ ticketing solution to comply with IATA rules , which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems . E @-@ ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check @-@ in facilities , reducing the need to queue up at check @-@ in counters . However , Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e @-@ ticketing , although it has been able to reduce its own costs . In 2005 , Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order , after allegations of money laundering . The suspension , however , lasted only a month , and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court . 
 In 2013 , Biman signed an agreement with German e @-@ ticketing company Hahn Air , enabling Biman 's tickets to be purchased from anywhere around the world . 
 = = = Biman Cargo = = = 
 Biman also operates a cargo service using the cargo holds of its passenger aircraft to ship freight to international destinations . It has established Cargo Village at Shahjalal International Airport where the cargo is packaged and labelled before being loaded onto its aircraft . 
 While the air cargo industry in Bangladesh grew by 16 @.@ 5 % in the fiscal year 2003 – 04 , Biman 's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines , Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108 % growth from the previous year . The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10 @.@ 6 % and were responsible for handling 24 % of the total 99 @,@ 000 tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4 @.@ 6 % and 6 @.@ 0 % respectively . Foreign airlines handled 47 % of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29 % . 
 As with its passenger service and management , corruption has also been rife at Biman Cargo . An investigation in 2004 uncovered irregularities in a number of Biman 's Middle East operations which deprived the government of millions of dollars in revenue . Biman officials in Dubai were found to have been " extending special privileges " to the main freight handler in exchange for bribes . The smuggling of foreign currency and gold bars is reported to have taken place at the Biman Cargo Village by Biman and CAAB employees . A number of arrests were made but the perpetrators evaded punishment through lack of evidence and pressure from the CAAB union . 
 = = Destinations = = 
 As of November 2014 , Biman serves 21 destinations , 18 of them international . However , the carrier has air service agreements with 43 countries leaving room for expansion for which it lacks aircraft . The airline operates flights to several destinations in the Middle East , some destinations in South and South East Asia ; London and Rome in Europe . 
 The airline announced intentions to commence flights to Guangzhou and Kunming in China in summer 2014 . Former Biman board director Kazi <unk> Alam criticised the expansion as poorly planned and not commercially viable . 
 = = = New York and Manchester = = = 
 From 1993 to 2006 , Biman operated flights to John F. Kennedy International Airport , New York City , from Dhaka via Brussels . New York was Biman 's farthest and most prestigious destination , and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses to maintain a landing slot in the US which , if cancelled , could be difficult to regain . To curb the losses , Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re @-@ routed it through Manchester Airport , UK , capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community in the north of England . On 8 April 2006 , Biman 's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK . However , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh ( CAAB ) into Category 2 ( does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards ) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program , which placed additional restrictions on the country 's airlines when flying to the US . A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the <unk> , a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday . For Biman , this meant that it could continue flying to the US , but could not expand or make alterations to its routes , such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester . The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules , and flights to New York were again re @-@ routed through Brussels . 
 The FAA had already warned Biman to replace its ageing DC @-@ 10s by December 2005 . According to experts , these aircraft were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic . On 13 May 2006 , the FAA refused permission for Biman flight <unk> ( Dhaka – Brussels – JFK ) to enter its airspace , citing safety concerns over the ailing DC – 10 aircraft used on the route . The flight was diverted to Montréal @-@ Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada , where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey . Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it a clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers . The FAA eventually admitted it was mistaken and apologised for the error . 
 The incident put an end to the route , which had been losing US $ 80 @,@ 000 per flight , owing to its use of obsolete DC @-@ 10s . Biman decided to axe the route along with a number of other regional and domestic routes to curb the huge losses being incurred by the airline each month . However , in October 2007 , Biman was directed by the then caretaker government to resume flights to New York . Biman was given until 25 October 2008 ( extended from an earlier deadline of 23 March 2008 ) to resume flights to the airport by the JFK airport authority , after which it would have lost the landing slot permanently . 
 The resumption of flights to the United States may take place in 2015 , this depending on the FAA upgrading the category of the CAAB which is still category 2 , as of May 2015 . 
 = = = Hajj flights = = = 
 The annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj is undertaken by thousands of Bangladesh 's predominantly Muslim population . Biman has been the sole Bangladeshi airline permitted by the government to provide flights for pilgrims to King Abdulaziz International Airport , Jeddah . Every year , the commencement of these flights is inaugurated by high @-@ ranking government officials , including , at times , the Prime Minister . 
 In 2002 , the government opened the service to private tour operators for the first time . The initial private flights were plagued with delays , with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days , which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights ' monopoly to Biman . 
 Biman 's handling of Hajj flights has also been beset with troubles . In 2005 , the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high . In 2006 , Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business – class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy @-@ class passengers . Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims ' visas , and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers . Once the situation was resolved , Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers . 
 In June 2007 , the caretaker government approved a three @-@ year Hajj policy aiming to alleviate the problems encountered during the previous two years . Hajj flights would also begin leaving from Bangladesh 's two other international airports , Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport . Biman put out a tender for the wet lease of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with Phuket Air . However , the deal fell through in August 2007 after Phuket Air demanded advance payment of 30 % instead of the previously agreed @-@ to 10 % . <unk> Aeronautical Services of Australia was selected next , following a re @-@ tender , to fill the gap left by Phuket Air . In 2008 , Biman wet @-@ leased a 542 @-@ seater Boeing 747 @-@ 200 from <unk> Air of Nigeria for six months to operate flights to Saudi Arabia and the UAE . Another 512 @-@ seater Boeing 747 @-@ 300 was leased from Orient Thai Airlines . 
 As of June 2014 , Biman still experienced difficulties in providing their scheduled services , as the carrier gave priority to the transportation of pilgrims to Jeddah during the Hajj season using aircraft that otherwise were flown on its regular flights . Despite this , the airline reported a profit of almost BDT 1 billion from the 2012 Hajj season , the highest results ever since these services were started in 1973 . 
 = = Fleet = = 
 A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC @-@ 3 were the first aircraft in Biman 's fleet . Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka . Shortly afterwards , a Boeing 707 , chartered from British Caledonian , joined the airline 's fleet , allowing Biman to begin international flights . In 1983 , Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 @-@ 30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes . The British Aerospace ATP entered the fleet in late 1990 , coming to replace the Fokker F27s . 
 During the mid @-@ 1990s , Biman switched its airliner of choice for long haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft . In 1995 , two PW4000 @-@ powered Airbus A310 @-@ 300s were ordered ; the first of them joined the fleet on 15 June 1996 ( 1996 @-@ 06 @-@ 15 ) . It nevertheless retained its elderly DC – 10 fleet , even though the aircraft had been banned by several countries ( notably the USA ) because of safety concerns . 
 For over three decades , the DC – 10 – 30s were Biman 's sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well , with no noteworthy mechanical problems – in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations . These were operated with Fokker F28 and BAe ATPs which were routinely out of service because of technical trouble . In one incident , a government minister disembarked a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft he was on was a BAe ATP . In January 2003 , Biman leased two Boeing 737 @-@ 300s which were used on domestic and regional routes for eighteen months . These acted as a replacement for the BAe ATPs . 
 McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10s and Airbus A310 @-@ 300s made up most of Biman 's international fleet , before the delivery of the modern Boeing 777 @-@ 300ERs started in 2011 . Fokker <unk> made up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors , before they were retired in 2012 . Biman 's fleet contains the second @-@ to @-@ last Douglas DC – 10 to come off the production line ( l / n 445 ) , and only three other Airbus A310 – 300s were produced following Biman 's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996 . The two Fokker F28 – <unk> were acquired from <unk> in 2004 at a cost of $ 2 @.@ 91 million . Both of these aircraft were built in 1977 , making Biman 's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet . The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule , as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems , leading to flight delays and cancellations . A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source . A deal was signed in January 2012 ( 2012 @-@ 01 ) a three @-@ year contract with a German company for the maintenance of their powerplants , for the DC – 10s . The airline operates its own ancillary and maintenance facilities at Shahjalal International Airport , where it carries out all maintenance work and C @-@ Checks on DC – 10 – 30s and A310 – 300s .

 In 2000 , Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide @-@ bodied aircraft to replace the DC – 10s , but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline 's expected privatisation were shelved by the government . A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide @-@ bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $ 1 billion . Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government . After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government , Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled . A similar attempt to purchase medium @-@ haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed . In March 2007 ( 2007 @-@ 03 ) , Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310 @-@ 300 and two Airbus A300 @-@ 600 aircraft for two years . The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . 
 After Biman became a public limited company , renewed attempts were made to procure new @-@ generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet . In November 2007 , Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777 @-@ 200s ( with options for two more ) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787 @-@ 8 Dreamliners ( with options for two more ) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009 . The average price of these aircraft was quoted as US $ 165 million . Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing . To manage the fleet in the short run , Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase / dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310 @-@ 300 aircraft . 
 On 10 March 2008 , the Biman management unveiled a plan to procure eight next @-@ generation wide @-@ bodied aircraft from Boeing Commercial Airplanes for a total cost of US $ 1 @.@ 26 billion , including four 419 @-@ seater Boeing 777 @-@ 300ER ( average price of US $ 182 @.@ 9 million per unit ) , and four Boeing 787 @-@ 8 Dreamliners that will seat 294 ( US $ 133 @.@ 31 million per unit ) , to be delivered in 2017 . The deal for the acquisition of these eight aircraft was signed with Boeing in April 2008 , and also included a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of two Boeing 737 @-@ 800s to be delivered in 2015 , with Biman making an initial instalment of US $ 1 @.@ 54 million . Of the remaining cost , US @-@ based <unk> bank will finance 85 % , while a syndication of local banks will finance the balance . In June the same year , Biman placed a firm order for two Boeing 737 @-@ 800s , and took options for two more aircraft of the type . The total order for these ten aircraft was valued at around US $ 2 @.@ 5 billion .

 In 2010 , Biman leased two Boeing 777 @-@ 200ERs from <unk> Airways . These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777 @-@ 300ERs in 2011 . To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777 @-@ 300ERs the airline used an initial US $ 277 million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase . Wearing a new livery , the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777 @-@ 300ER in late October 2011 . It was the 300th 777 @-@ 300ER delivered by Boeing . The 301st ever delivered Boeing 777 @-@ 300ER also went to Biman ; the airline took possession of it in late November 2011 ( 2011 @-@ 11 ) . The third Boeing 777 @-@ 300ER , named Aakash Pradeep , was handed over to the carrier in February 2014 ( 2014 @-@ 02 ) ; the fourth one , named <unk> <unk> , joined the fleet in March 2014 ( 2014 @-@ 03 ) , following the government approving a US $ 356 million loan , of which US $ 290 million will be provided by the Ex @-@ Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank . 
 Biman retired its entire McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 fleet on 20 February 2014 , by operating a special Dhaka @-@ Birmingham farewell flight with its last DC @-@ 10 , with a stopover at Kuwait ; the carrier also operated nine separate aviation enthusiasts ' scenic flights at Birmingham , from 22 – 24 February , three flights a day . The last DC @-@ 10 will then be scrapped locally in Dhaka . The Airbus A310 @-@ 300s will also be phased out in 2015 . 
 The carrier leased two Boeing 777 @-@ 200ER aircraft from EgyptAir in March 2014 . The airline plans to expand its fleet to 16 aircraft , to allow route expansion . With newly leased Dash 8 @-@ Q400 aircraft , the carrier is resuming full swing domestic flights to Cox 's Bazar , Jessore , Saidpur , Rajshahi and Barisal in April 2015 . The two aircraft , dry leased from Smart Aviation Company for a period of five years , will also be operated on regional flights to Kolkata and Yangon . Initially it was supposed to resume in November 2013 , which Biman failed to as it was unable to find a lessor of aircraft . 
 = = = Livery = = = 
 In modern Bengali , the word বিমান <unk> refers to " aeroplane " , originating from the Sanskrit word <unk> , a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient Vedic literature . The logo , painted on the tail , is a stylised white stork ( <unk> bôlaka ) inside a red circle . The logo was designed by painter <unk> Hassan . The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section . This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines , matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag , and has remained so for over two decades . 
 In 2010 , Biman went through a rebranding exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery , designed by Teague , which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft . However , following change of government , Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government . The carrier has adopted a new , more modern revised version of its livery , that was applied to the new Boeing 777 @-@ 300ERs delivered in late 2011 . 
 The bôlaka has also given its name to the Biman headquarters , the Balaka Bhaban ( <unk> <unk> bôlaka <unk> , Stork Building ) , and a landmark sculpture in Dhaka depicting storks is in front of Biman 's former headquarters , the Biman Bhaban in the Motijheel Commercial Area in Dhaka .

 = New York State Route 21 = 
 New York State Route 21 ( NY 21 ) is a state highway extending for 99 @.@ 99 miles ( 160 @.@ 92 km ) through the western part of New York in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 417 in the village of Andover , and its northern terminus is at a junction with NY 104 in the town of Williamson . In between , NY 21 serves the cities of Hornell and Canandaigua and intersects several major east – west routes , including the Southern Tier Expressway ( I @-@ 86 / NY 17 ) near Hornell , the conjoined routes of U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and NY 5 in Canandaigua , the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) in Manchester , and NY 31 in Palmyra . 
 NY 21 originally extended from the Pennsylvania state line in the south to Lake Ontario in the north when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . South of Hornell , the route followed modern NY 36 . NY 21 was rerouted to follow its current alignment south of Hornell in the 1950s and truncated on its northern end to Williamson in 1980 . Other changes of local importance , mostly realignments to bypass communities along the route , have also occurred at various points in the route 's history . NY 21 originally had an alternate route around Canandaigua Lake ; however , that highway — designated NY 21A — was eliminated in the 1940s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Andover to Naples = = = 
 NY 21 begins at an intersection with NY 417 in the village of Andover . The route heads northward , paralleling the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad ( WNYP ) through a rural stretch of eastern Allegany County . At Alfred Station , located just east of the village of Alfred , the highway meets the eastern terminus of NY 244 . NY 21 and the WNYP head northeast through the village of Almond to the Steuben County line , where the road and rail line begin to turn to the southeast toward Hornell . The portion of NY 21 near Almond briefly parallels the Southern Tier Expressway , designated Interstate 86 ( I @-@ 86 ) and NY 17 . East of the county line , NY 21 leaves the vicinity of the expressway and passes through another undeveloped stretch to reach the city of Hornell , where it becomes West Main Street . 
 The highway follows West Main Street for several blocks into the city 's downtown district , where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway 's Southern Tier Line and intersects NY 36 . NY 21 turns north onto NY 36 , separating from the WNYP and forming a concurrency with NY 36 north along a four @-@ lane divided highway known as the Maple City Bypass . The overlap ends north of the city limits in the town of Hornellsville , where NY 21 splits from NY 36 and resumes its northeasterly track . Not far to the north of this point is exit 34 of the Southern Tier Expressway , accessed by way of NY 36 . From Hornell , NY 21 heads northeast through progressively less developed areas as it winds its way across the hilly terrain of the Southern Tier . For the next 15 miles ( 24 km ) , NY 21 serves only small , roadside hamlets , such as Fremont , <unk> , and Loon Lake . 
 North of <unk> , NY 21 takes on a more northerly course through the county that eventually brings it to the village of Wayland , where it intersects I @-@ 390 at exit 3 south of the village . The interchange also serves as the southern terminus of NY 15 and is adjacent to the north end of NY 415 , which terminates north of the exit at NY 21 . NY 15 joins NY 21 north into the center of Wayland , where the two routes separate upon intersecting NY 63 . While NY 15 continues north from the village into Livingston County , NY 21 leaves Wayland on an east – west alignment , roughly paralleling the northern county line and a B & H Rail Corporation line as it runs through a valley surrounding the Cohocton River . After 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , the road enters the hamlet of North Cohocton , centered around NY 21 's junction with the northern terminus of NY 371 . 
 While the river , its valley , and the rail line proceed south from North Cohocton , NY 21 turns to the northeast , ascending out of the valley and finally crossing the county line , at this point bordering Ontario County . The route meanders across another area of hilly , undeveloped terrain to the village of Naples , home to the north end of NY 53 and the south end of NY 245 . NY 21 meets the two routes at opposite ends of the community , with NY 53 terminating south of the village center and NY 245 beginning to its north . Naples also serves as NY 21 's entrance to the Finger Lakes region ; the village itself is located in the southernmost part of the Canandaigua Lake valley . 
 = = = Naples to Williamson = = = 
 NY 21 continues north from Naples , running alongside the western edge of the lake valley , and eventually the lake itself . Near Woodville , a hamlet 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of Naples , the route briefly enters Yates County for just over a half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) before reentering Ontario County . It serves lakeside homes and cottages in the town of South Bristol for another 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , after which the road begins to climb the side of the valley and meander toward the hamlet of Bristol Springs . Here , the road forks , with NY 64 beginning to the left ( west ) and NY 21 continuing to the right ( north ) . While NY 64 heads northwest to Rochester , NY 21 progresses to the northeast , overlooking Canandaigua Lake on its way through mostly isolated areas of the town of Canandaigua . The route eventually reaches the outskirts of the city of Canandaigua , where it intersects US 20 and NY 5 . 
 At this point , NY 21 turns east , joining US 20 and NY 5 as all three routes head around the southwestern portion of the city . The primary portion of the bypass ends about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) later at an intersection with South Main Street ; the junction also marks the east end of the overlap between the three routes and the south end of NY 332 . NY 21 turns north onto South Main Street , following NY 332 through the city 's historic downtown district . The two routes pass by 426 South Main Street , Benham House , and the city 's former United States Post Office , all properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places , before splitting at the junction of Gibson and North Main streets . NY 332 continues north from this point on North Main Street toward Victor while NY 21 follows Gibson Street northeastward through a residential section of the city . It passes Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park and the city 's VA Hospital before leaving the Canandaigua city limits . 
 Outside the Canandaigua city limits , the area surrounding NY 21 becomes rural once again ; however , the surrounding terrain is more level than it was south of the city . The route heads northeast through farmland to Chapin , a small hamlet in the town of Hopewell , where it intersects the south end of NY 488 and turns to take on a more northerly course . Not far to the north are the adjacent villages of <unk> and Manchester , roughly separated by the Ontario Central Railroad . Here , NY 21 passes under the railroad and intersects both NY 96 and the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) at exit 43 just north of the Manchester village center . Past the Thruway , NY 21 becomes rural in nature once more as it runs across rolling terrain to the Wayne County line . 
 Within Wayne County , the area around NY 21 becomes more developed as it enters the village of Palmyra , where the road is village @-@ maintained from the southern village line to its junction with NY 31 in the village 's historic center . The route briefly overlaps NY 31 along East Main Street before crossing both the Erie Canal and the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Rochester Subdivision on its way out of the village . From Palmyra to Williamson , the land surrounding NY 21 is predominantly rural in nature . However , midway between the two locations , NY 21 comes close to the hamlet of Marion , which it bypasses to the west . In Williamson , NY 21 passes through the town center at a junction with Ridge Road before ending at an intersection with NY 104 in a more commercial section of the town . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Prior to the American Revolution , the path of modern NY 21 north of Canandaigua was part of an old Native American trail connecting Seneca Lake to Lake Ontario by way of Canandaigua Lake . The trail began in the vicinity of Geneva and went west to Canandaigua on a path now occupied by US 20 and NY 5 . It continued north from Canandaigua , passing through the village of Palmyra and the hamlet of Marion before reaching the Lake Ontario shoreline at Pultneyville . Construction to convert the Canandaigua – Marion section of the trail into a road was completed in 1794 . The remainder of the trail north to Pultneyville was converted into a road approximately three years later . 
 The Canandaigua – Pultneyville highway served as a post road in the years that followed . At some point , the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion , initially a corduroy road , was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled . The highway fell into disrepair over the years , leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll . The toll booths were eventually removed , and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road . By the 1920s , the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua – Pultneyville highway . In the mid @-@ 1920s , it became part of NY 72 , a north – south highway extending from NY 52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 72 became part of NY 21 , a new route extending from the Pennsylvania state line at Troupsburg to Pultneyville . It followed what is now NY 36 from the state line to Hornell and modern County Route 121 ( CR 121 ) , NY 415 , and NY 371 between Loon Lake and North Cohocton ( via Cohocton ) . The remainder of NY 21 roughly followed its current alignment . At the same time , what is now NY 21 from Andover to Hornell was designated as the western half of NY 17F while the section between Loon Lake and modern NY 415 was assigned NY 371 . The remaining piece around Wayland was part of NY 2 south of Wayland and part of the new NY 39 from Wayland to Cohocton . NY 39 overlapped NY 21 from Cohocton to Naples , where it forked from NY 21 and continued east on modern NY 245 . 
 Several portions of current NY 21 south of Naples had carried designations prior to 1930 . In 1924 , the Andover – Hornell segment was designated as part of NY 17 ; at the same time , the short piece between modern NY 415 and the center of Wayland became part of NY 4 . By 1926 , the portion connecting Wayland to Naples was included in the new NY 52 . NY 4 was renumbered to NY 2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US 4 . 
 = = = Realignments and truncations = = = 
 The alignments of NY 21 and NY 371 between Loon Lake and Cohocton were flipped c . 1937 , routing NY 21 through the village of Wayland instead . The realignment extended NY 21 's overlap with NY 39 west to Wayland and created an overlap with NY 2 south of the village . NY 2 was absorbed into an extended US 15 ( now NY 15 ) by the following year . In the early 1940s , the NY 17F designation was eliminated and replaced with an extended NY 36 from Andover to Hornell . The alignments of NY 36 and NY 21 south of Hornell were flipped in the early 1950s , placing both routes on their current alignments south of the city . 
 On April 1 , 1980 , NY 21 was truncated to its present northern terminus at NY 104 in Williamson as part of a highway maintenance swap between New York State and Wayne County . In the swap , ownership and maintenance of NY 21 north of Williamson was transferred from the state of New York to the county in exchange for maintenance of NY 441 between the Monroe – Wayne county line and NY 350 . The former routing of NY 21 north to Lake Road ( CR 101 ) in Pultneyville is now designated as CR 120 . 
 Until the 1980s , NY 21 entered Canandaigua on Bristol Street and followed it to South Main Street ( then @-@ US 20 and NY 5 ) , where it joined its current alignment . When the Western Bypass around the southwestern fringe of the city was constructed in the late 1970s and early 1980s , US 20 and NY 5 were realigned to follow the highway around the city . NY 21 was also realigned at this time to follow its modern routing on the bypass and South Main Street . The segment of Bristol Street vacated by NY 21 between the Western Bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) as unsigned NY <unk> until September 1 , 1996 , when maintenance of the road was turned over to the town of Canandaigua . However , the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007 . 
 = = NY 21A = = 
 NY 21A was an alternate route of NY 21 along the eastern side of Canandaigua Lake . When it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , it began at NY 21 north of the village of Naples and ran along the east shore of the lake to eastern Canandaigua , where it ended at US 20 and NY 5 . In between , NY 21A passed through the lakeside hamlet of Vine Valley . The route was truncated c . 1939 to begin in Vine Valley , separating it from its parent route . It was eliminated entirely in the early 1940s when most of NY 21A was absorbed by NY 364 .

 = TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship = 
 The TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship was a women 's professional wrestling tag team championship owned by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion . It was contested for mainly by teams consisting of two female wrestlers in TNA , known as the TNA Knockouts , in TNA 's women 's division ; however , the championship was once held by a male . 
 The creation of the championship was announced on August 20 , 2009 during a backstage segment on TNA 's primary television program TNA Impact ! . Like most professional wrestling championships , the title is won via the result of a scripted match . Sarita and Taylor Wilde were the inaugural champions . They won a four @-@ week tournament to crown the first champions . The final champions were ODB and Eric Young , who held the titles for a record 478 days . 
 On the June 20 , 2013 episode of Impact Wrestling , Knockouts Division Executive Brooke Hogan stripped ODB and Young of the title because Young is a male talent , despite the fact that he had been a male for the prior 478 days . This ultimately resulted in the titles being deactivated , as it 's no longer listed among TNA 's active championships .

 TNA Knockout , or just Knockout for short , is the term used by TNA to refer to its onscreen female employees ; this is similar to TNA 's main rival World Wrestling Entertainment and their Divas pseudonym . TNA 's first women 's accomplishment was announced at TNA 's first weekly pay @-@ per @-@ view event on June 19 , 2002 . It was called the " Miss TNA " crown . The holder of the crown was determined in a lingerie battle royal on June 19 , 2002 , which aired on June 26 , 2002 . The participants in the match were Alexis Laree , Elektra , Erin Bray , Francine , Miss Joni , Sasha , Shannon , Taylor Vaughn , and Teresa Tyler . Vaughn last eliminated Elektra to win the crown . The TNA Knockout of the Year is another award in TNA given to the knockout who achieved the most or had the best run that year . The most recent Knockout of the Year was Gail Kim in 2007 ; no award was given out in 2008 . In October 2007 at TNA 's Bound for Glory PPV event , TNA established their first women 's championship , with Gail Kim winning a 10 knockout gauntlet match to become the first TNA Women 's Knockout Champion . Ms. Brooks , Christy Hemme , Awesome Kong , Roxxi Laveaux , Talia Madison , Shelly Martinez , Jackie Moore , ODB , and Angel Williams were also involved in the match . Two DVDs on the topic of the TNA Knockouts have been released by TNA . The first was named " Knockouts : The Ladies of TNA Wrestling Vol.1 " and was released on August 29 , 2006 . " Knocked Out : The Women of TNA Wrestling " was the second , being released on October 7 , 2008 .

 Sonic Unleashed , released as Sonic World Adventure ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Sonikku Wārudo Adobenchā ) in Japan , is a 2008 video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for multiple platforms in 2008 . The game follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he attempts to restore the world to normal after his nemesis , Doctor Eggman . The game also focuses on Sonic 's ' <unk> ' form , which he gains during the beginning after coming into contact with the energy of Dark Gaia . Gameplay features two distinct styles , with each being played either during daytime or night @-@ time . Daytime stages incorporate Sonic 's traditional platforming and trademark speed , with a combination of behind @-@ the @-@ back third @-@ person viewpoints and 2D side @-@ scroller platforming ; gameplay seamlessly transitions between these two views . Night @-@ time levels see Sonic transform into the Werehog ; gameplay slows down to accommodate greater platform play , and involves combat against waves of enemies using the Werehog 's brute strength . 
 The game 's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the Unleashed name , and shortly after , images and a gameplay video were leaked to the public in March 2008 . Public anticipation for the game was high , owing to the video 's demonstration of some two @-@ dimensional gameplay , seen as a possible return to Sonic 's platforming roots . However , critical reception for the game was mixed , with reviewers praising certain elements , such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio that make up the environments , and criticizing others , such as the new Werehog game mechanic , as well as several gameplay and design concepts . Many reviewers felt that Unleashed was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series . Sonic Unleashed was de @-@ listed in 2010 , following Sega 's decision to remove all Sonic titles with average Metacritic scores from sale in stores . Despite this , the game was made available to purchase on PlayStation Network on April 8 , 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Sonic Unleashed is a platform game in which the player controls the titular Sonic the Hedgehog in two modes : fast @-@ paced levels that take place during daytime , showcasing Sonic 's trademark speed as seen in previous games in the series , and slower , night @-@ time levels , during which Sonic transforms into the Werehog , and gameplay switches to an action @-@ based , brawler style of play , in which Sonic battles Gaia enemies ( those created by the main enemy in the game , Dark Gaia ) . Each level takes place on a particular continent , each of which is based on a real @-@ world location ( i.e. , Greece @-@ based <unk> , Italy @-@ based <unk> , Africa @-@ based <unk> , New York @-@ based Empire City , China @-@ based Chun @-@ nan , Antarctica @-@ based <unk> , Middle East @-@ based Shamar , and Southeast Asia @-@ based <unk> . In sections of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game , the player may choose to advance the time of day in order to play as either Sonic or the Werehog ; in the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions , time is advanced automatically . 
 Daytime levels focus on Sonic 's speed , and to this extent , sees the player control Sonic through fast @-@ moving stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay . 2D sections are reminiscent of the Mega Drive / Genesis @-@ era Sonic games , where the player controls Sonic in a side @-@ scrolling fashion , while 3D sections see the camera placed behind Sonic , so the player may move in all directions . In addition to moves available in past games , such as the homing attack , new moves are also introduced . For instance , a new sidestep feature known as the Quick Step is available , allowing Sonic to dodge left and right , and a Drift feature , which allows Sonic to make tighter turns without slowing down . The game also features a gameplay mechanic previously used in the Sonic Rush series called the Sonic Boost , which greatly increases Sonic 's speed , allowing him to smash through objects , destroy enemies instantly , or even access different level paths . In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions , an on @-@ screen " Ring Energy " meter displays how much boost is available . The amount of boost remaining may be increased by collecting more rings , and is decreased by using the Boost . In contrast , the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of the game represent available Boost using bars , which may be added by performing " Action Chains " , destroying multiple enemies in quick succession through the use of homing attacks , or by collecting rings . Japanese game company Dimps helped design some of the stages . 
 Nighttime levels feature slower @-@ paced , action @-@ oriented levels , in which Sonic transforms into the Werehog , a beast form that has great strength and stretchable arms . Gameplay here sees the player use a variety of melee and combo attacks to defeat large numbers of enemies , collect items , and move items around to advance through the level , and use his stretchable arms to cling to distant objects ; simple puzzle elements are also featured . Collecting rings in these levels replenishes the Werehog 's health , while a special move , Unleashed Mode , allows the Werehog to channel his energy into increasing the power of his attacks for a short time . Nighttime levels are adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote , such that players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in order to grab onto objects and proceed in the levels . The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of nighttime levels to daytime , with more than three times as many nighttime levels ( twenty @-@ five in all ) . After nighttime levels are completed , Dark Gaia Points are gained , allowing access to bonus moves . 
 In addition to these two gameplay types , Sonic Unleashed also features hubworlds , in which the player may reveal , as well as advance , the story of the game . <unk> operate differently depending on the version of the game being played ; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature fully interactive , explorable 3D hubworlds , similar to those in Sonic 2006 and Sonic Adventure , in which townspeople may be interacted with and side quests may be undertaken , in order to gain experience or unlock items , such as artwork , videos and music tracks . In contrast , the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions feature menu @-@ based map systems , in which players simply click on areas to talk to townspeople and find information . Within both day and nighttime levels are medals that Sonic may collect , two types of which exist : Sun and Moon . In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions , collecting these medals allows the player to level up Sonic 's Sun and Moon stats , and these must be increased to reach new stages in the game , with a certain number of Sun medals for Hedgehog levels , and a certain number of Moon medals for Werehog levels . Because only the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature playable hubworlds , these are also the only versions in which Sun and Moon medals may be found by exploring the towns , talking to the citizens , and completing side quests . In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions , Sun and Moon medals are earned after completing stages and clearing their objectives . The medals are used to open up doors in Gaia gates , which can earn bonus content . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In a cold open , Sonic is pursuing his nemesis , Doctor Eggman , bounding around a fleet of spaceships . After the defeat of several of his robots , Sonic transforms into Super Sonic . After a brief chase through the airships , Sonic corners Eggman . However , Eggman manages to trap him using a powerful new ray weapon which drains the power of the Chaos Emeralds , causing them to turn grey and useless . He then uses the Emeralds ' energy to fire an enormous laser and unleash a powerful beast , Dark Gaia , from the center of the planet , which has devastating consequences , shattering the planet into seven pieces . In addition , the ray and drained Chaos Emeralds have the unforeseen side @-@ effect of transforming Sonic into a " Werehog " — a beast form with greater strength and abilities — at night . Eggman then ejects Sonic into space , who then lands safely onto the planet below . 
 After landing along with the Emeralds , Sonic encounters a friendly creature who appears to suffer amnesia . Assuming he has caused it with his fall , Sonic decides to assist him in his quest to find out who he is , and the monster becomes a guide for the player ; Sonic soon gives him the nickname Chip . Sonic 's quest begins , and with the help of some old friends , such as Amy and Tails , he attempts to solve the crisis by traveling the world 's continents , finding shrines that will fix the Emeralds , in order to return the world , and himself , to normal . 
 After six of the seven continents are returned to normal , Chip is able to regain his memory ; he is in fact Dark Gaia 's opposite , Light Gaia . Since the beginning of time , the two of them had been in a cycle where Dark Gaia would break the planet apart , and Light Gaia would put it back together . Chip was released along with Dark Gaia , but because both of them were released prematurely , he lost his memory , and Dark Gaia was broken apart . They are able to place the last Chaos Emerald in the shrine on the final continent at Eggman 's new empire , " <unk> " , but are interrupted by him ; Sonic then defeats Eggman who is using a robot that utilizes Dark Gaia 's power . During the battle , the three sink into the core of the Earth and encounter Dark Gaia . Eggman orders Dark Gaia to destroy Sonic , but it turns on him , knocking him away with one of its tentacles , and absorbs the power that turned Sonic into a Werehog , curing Sonic of lycanthropy , and uses that power to become Semi @-@ Perfect Dark Gaia . 
 Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip , but Chip protects Sonic and calls all of the Gaia temples together to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia . The Gaia <unk> seemingly destroys Dark Gaia , but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet , and consumes the entire world in darkness , becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process . Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic , allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it ; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet , but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic . Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface , before returning himself to the inside of the planet ; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words . Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet to remind him of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails , flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sonic Team began development of the game in 2006 , after having begun work on the core technology , the Hedgehog Engine , in 2005 . The title was first brought to public attention when the Sonic Unleashed name was trademarked by Sega on March 12 , 2008 . Screenshots of cut scenes , artwork , and a video were leaked ten days later , with the title then officially confirmed by Sega on April 3 , 2008 with a small selection of screenshots and an updated video . The game was developed internally by Sonic Team in Japan . It was originally intended to be the third installment of the Sonic Adventure series and subsequently , at an early development stage , had the working title Sonic World Adventure , complete with work @-@ in @-@ progress logo . However , the development team began to introduce enough new innovations to separate it from the Sonic Adventure titles , and so a new title , Sonic Unleashed , was decided upon . It was then later revealed that the game 's name in Japan would in fact remain Sonic World Adventure for its release there . 
 Sonic Team decided early on in the development process to reduce the number of characters present in the game , as well as to make Sonic the only playable character ; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters . While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning , it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series , and so the concept of the Werehog was born , in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story . Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism , but hoped that long @-@ term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken . 
 In terms of technology , Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was born out of desire to see a global illumination solution used for the game 's lighting — that is , light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others . To this extent , development on the renderer for this process began , and the final solution allowed the developers to use distributed rendering over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty @-@ kilometer action stage in around two or three days . Characters , enemies and objects are then lit at run @-@ time with Sonic Team 's " Light Field " technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre @-@ calculated lighting . Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform , two development " silos " were set up to work on two separate builds of the game : one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the Hedgehog Engine , and one for the PlayStation 2 and Wii version , which instead utilizes a modified version of an existing , internal Sega engine . Hashimoto , who had never directed a Sonic game before , incorporated new features such as a " Quick Step " mechanic allowing players to dodge obstacles with the L and R triggers . Hashimoto sought to combine the best qualities of 2D and 3D Sonic gameplay and address the criticisms directed at previous 3D entries in the franchise . Additional code to dynamically adjust the speed of the game for different situations was used to properly balance its fast pace with traditional platforming elements . 
 As well as the unique motion @-@ based gameplay mechanics , the Wii version of the game also supports the GameCube controller , and also the option of using the Classic Controller . The daytime levels for the Wii were altered to accommodate the motion control @-@ based drift mechanic , while night @-@ time levels include a mostly behind @-@ the @-@ back view and different platforming styles and combat mechanics . Developer Dimps , who had past involvement in the Sonic franchise , was involved in the design of the daytime areas for these versions . In addition , overall , the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions have fewer daytime levels than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts . 
 Initially , it was stated that Unleashed was to be intended solely as a single @-@ player experience , and would not offer any multiplayer or online modes . This was cast into doubt when references to online modes were alluded to around E3 2008 , but later interviews re @-@ iterated that Unleashed would have no online modes at all . However , downloadable content , including additional levels , would remain a possibility after the game 's release . A demo version was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on December 8 , 2008 and on the US and EU PlayStation Stores on December 18 and 24 , 2008 , respectively . The demo does not contain any of the Werehog stages . On March 12 , 2009 Sega released Sonic Unleashed 's first downloadable content for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , consisting of four Chun @-@ nan daytime stages and two night stages in addition to two new missions . Since then , more downloadable levels have been added : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Shamar , Empire city and <unk> . 
 Speaking after the game 's release , Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight director Tetsu <unk> remarked that although he did not feel the Werehog concept was a mistake , time and resources were a limiting factor in the game 's production . He also remarked that the Werehog may reappear in future games , or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed , should one be made . 
 Game developer Gameloft announced in May 2009 that it had secured a licensing agreement with Sega Europe Ltd. to produce mobile phone versions of Sega properties , and that its first title would be a version of Sonic Unleashed for mobile phone platforms . It was released in June 2009 in Europe , Middle East , Australia and New Zealand . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Initial anticipation when the first media for Unleashed was revealed was high , as the demonstration videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots , especially because of the series ' declining quality in recent years , and a number of poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded it , such as the 2006 game , Sonic the Hedgehog . 
 Critical reception to Unleashed was mixed , with Metacritic aggregate scores of 60 and 54 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively , and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions . The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections , as well as text @-@ based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and camera system , were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game , though a few review websites , such as 1UP , gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts . Nevertheless , the game was a commercial success and sold 2 @.@ 45 million units combined making it Sega 's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008 . 
 Positive elements of Sonic Unleashed remarked upon by reviews include the environments , such as the " postcard @-@ perfect architecture " , and the graphics , with stages looking " absolutely gorgeous " and being " very pretty and lovingly animated " , with one reviewer comparing them to a playable Pixar film . Praise was given to the technical competence of Sega 's new Hedgehog Engine as a whole on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions , with " bright cartoonish graphics that fly by without a stutter " ; however , some complaints were raised about frame rate reduction when large numbers of enemies appeared during the Werehog sections . Although the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions do not use the Hedgehog Engine , graphics for these platforms were still praised for their high quality , with the title being nominated for Best Graphics Technology for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards . The soundtrack to the game was also praised as being an improvement on more recent installments in the series ; use of an orchestral score , rather than rock as in more recent games , was appreciated . 
 An overwhelmingly negative reaction was given by critics to the Werehog concept and corresponding night @-@ time sections , which contributed greatly to the lower than expected review scores . Some reviewers compared the Werehog sections to God of War . Complaints stemmed from the game 's change of speed , from high @-@ speed daytime sections to the slower , night @-@ time sections ; the " pace @-@ breaking combat levels " were described as " plodding " , as well as " lethargic " and " combat @-@ heavy " . Further to the change of pace , the new style of gameplay that accompanies the night @-@ time levels was widely criticized , involving " frustrating " platform elements and combat described as not " terribly interesting " and " boring " , with " awkward " action sequences overall . Some reviewers felt that the Werehog as a concept did not mix well with the daylight areas and traditional Sonic gameplay ; GamePro 's review described them as " dreadfully out @-@ of @-@ place " , while IGN stated that they have " nothing to do with Sonic whatsoever " , feeling that the Werehog was " being slapped on " to the Sonic experience . 
 In stark contrast to the Werehog sections , many reviewers found the daytime levels to be enjoyable , especially the " exhilarating " sense of speed they provide ; with " the most satisfying gameplay of any Sonic title in years " , the game " perfectly [ captures ] the feel of classic Sonic " . Many also enjoyed the mixture of , and transition between , 2D and 3D sections . Indeed , many reviewers remarked that they would have appreciated the game more had it consisted solely of , and expanded upon , the daytime levels . GameSpot 's review for the Xbox 360 version , however , argued that the controls were " unresponsive " in the daytime levels , and that most of them were " horribly designed " , instead describing the Wii version as a " vastly superior experience " , with its daytime levels praised for better control and design . 
 Aside from the criticism of Werehog levels , further aspects of the game were criticised , contributing to the mixed review scores . The quests that players must undertake in hub @-@ towns were described as " inane " and " tedious " , where " figuring out what happens next involves aimlessly wandering through towns and speaking to citizens , only to discover that most of them don 't know what we 're looking for " . The story and overall tone of the game , including the new character Chip , were criticised , some remarking that it was too juvenile , or comparable to that of a Saturday morning cartoon .

 The game 's original soundtrack , entitled Planetary Pieces : Sonic World Adventure Original Soundtrack , was released as a three @-@ disc set in Japan on January 28 , 2009 . The main theme music for the game is entitled " Endless Possibility " , and features Jaret Reddick of the American rock band Bowling for Soup . The ending theme music for the game is a slow tempo ballad entitled " Dear My Friend " , and features singer Brent Cash . 
 Downloadable packs containing extra levels for this game are available on the PlayStation Network and the Xbox Live Arcade . 
 Archie Comics has made an adaptation of Sonic Unleashed featuring the opening cutscene and Sonic 's transformation into the Werehog . A short 3D animated film was released on November 21 , 2008 , entitled Sonic : Night of the Werehog , which tells the story of two male ghosts who live in a haunted house taking pictures of scared children in order to woo a female ghost , and their frustration with an unafraid Sonic who enters the house with a very afraid Chip . But soon , it 's the ghosts who are afraid when Sonic looks at the full moon and transforms . The film was produced by Sega VE Animation Studio . 
 On March 25 , 2010 , a pack of Sonic costumes was released to the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 game LittleBigPlanet . The pack includes Sonic , Tails , Knuckles , Dr. Eggman and Sonic the Werehog . 
 For Sonic 's 20th anniversary , Sonic Generations includes major gaming aspects from past titles . A remake of the Rooftop Run stage appears in the console and PC versions , along with a modified Egg Dragoon serving as the second @-@ to @-@ last boss of those versions . However , Sonic does not retain the Werehog form and instead must fight the machine in his normal form . 
 On May 14 , 2014 , Archie Comics ' Sonic the Hedgehog comics branched out to follow some of the main events in Sonic Unleashed , such as the planet breaking apart , and the addition of Sonic the Werehog starting in issue 264 . 
 = Bird = 
 Birds ( Aves ) are a group of endothermic vertebrates , characterised by feathers , toothless beaked jaws , the laying of hard @-@ shelled eggs , a high metabolic rate , a four @-@ chambered heart , and a lightweight but strong skeleton . Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm ( 2 in ) bee hummingbird to the 2 @.@ 75 m ( 9 ft ) ostrich . They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species , at approximately ten thousand , with more than half of these being passerines , sometimes known as perching birds or , less accurately , as songbirds . 
 The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving group of dinosaurs , having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs . True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period , around 100 million years ago . DNA @-@ based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs . Birds , especially those in the southern continents , survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling . Primitive bird @-@ like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper , in the broader group Avialae , have been found dating back to the mid @-@ Jurassic period . Many of these early " stem @-@ birds " , such as Archaeopteryx , were not yet capable of fully powered flight , and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks , and long bony tails . 
 Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds . Wings , which evolved from forelimbs , give most birds the ability to fly , although further speciation has led to some flightless birds , including ratites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight . Some bird species of aquatic environments , particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins , and also members of the duck family , have also evolved for swimming . Birds , specifically Darwin 's finches , played an important part in the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection . 
 Some birds , especially corvids and parrots , are among the most intelligent animals ; several bird species make and use tools , and many social species pass on knowledge across generations , which is considered a form of culture . Many species annually migrate great distances . Birds are social , communicating with visual signals , calls , and bird songs , and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting , flocking , and mobbing of predators . The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous , usually for one breeding season at a time , sometimes for years , but rarely for life . Other species have polygynous ( " many females " ) or , rarely , polyandrous ( " many males " ) breeding systems . Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction . They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents . Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching . Some birds , such as hens , lay eggs even when not fertilized , though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring . 
 Many species of birds are economically important . Domesticated and undomesticated birds ( poultry and game ) are important sources of eggs , meat , and feathers . Songbirds , parrots , and other species are popular as pets . Guano ( bird excrement ) is harvested for use as a fertilizer . Birds prominently figure throughout human culture . About 120 – 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century , and hundreds more before then . Human activity threatens about 1 @,@ 200 bird species with extinction , though efforts are underway to protect them . Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry .
