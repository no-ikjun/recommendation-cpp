 On December 4 , Michigan was selected to play in the Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies . It was Michigan 's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season , when Michigan was defeated by the USC Trojans in the 2007 Rose Bowl . The meeting between the Hokies and the Wolverines was the first between the two schools . Virginia Tech was forced to use its third @-@ string kicker during the game , as first @-@ string kicker Cody <unk> was suspended for the game as a result of an arrest for breaking @-@ and @-@ entering , while second @-@ string kicker Tyler Weiss was suspended from the game and sent home for missing curfew . 
 Virginia Tech dominated the majority of the first half . In the first quarter , Virginia Tech 's third @-@ string kicker Justin Myer kicked a 37 @-@ yard field goal , which was the only scoring play of the quarter . Myer added a 43 @-@ yard field goal in the second quarter . At the end of the half , however , Denard Robinson threw a 45 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Junior Hemingway to give Michigan a 7 – 6 lead and on the ensuing kickoff , Michigan 's J.B. Fitzgerald forced a fumble , which Michigan recovered . Michigan 's Brendan Gibbons kicked a 24 @-@ yard field goal as time expired . In the third quarter , Michigan scored another touchdown on a Denard Robinson to Junior Hemingway pass , this time from 18 yards out . This scoring drive followed an interception by linebacker Frank Clark . Virginia Tech responded with another Justin Myer field goal , this time from 36 yards away . In the fourth quarter , Virginia Tech 's quarterback Logan Thomas trimmed Michigan 's lead to two points , and then promptly tied the game throwing a successful two @-@ point conversion to Marcus Davis . Michigan responded with a 39 @-@ yard Brendan Gibbons field goal , but Virginia Tech tied the game with two seconds remaining via a 25 @-@ yard field goal by Myer . In overtime , Virginia Tech seemingly scored the go @-@ ahead touchdown on a Logan Thomas to Danny Coale pass , but video review overturned the play . The next play saw Myer miss a 37 @-@ yard field goal . Michigan received the ball and saw Gibbons kick the game @-@ winning 37 @-@ yard field goal . 
 The game was Michigan 's fifth BCS bowl appearance . With the victory , Michigan won the only BCS bowl that it had not yet won , improved its bowl record to 20 – 21 , and improved its record against the ACC to 19 – 3 . Michigan also moved to 2 – 0 in overtime in bowl games , with the previous victory coming in the 2000 Orange Bowl . Hemingway , who caught both Michigan touchdowns , was named the Sugar Bowl MVP . Brady Hoke became the eighth coach to lead a team to a BCS bowl and third to win a BCS bowl in his first season .

 = 2nd Ranger Infantry Company ( United States ) = 
 The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company ( Airborne ) was a Ranger light infantry company of the United States Army active during the Korean War . As a small special operations unit , it specialized in irregular warfare . A segregated unit , all of its personnel , including its officers , were African @-@ Americans . 
 Activated and trained as a successor organization to the 2nd Ranger Battalion from World War II , the 2nd Ranger Company was formed and trained extensively in airborne warfare . Deployed to South Korea in December 1950 , the company quickly adopted the motto of " Buffalo Rangers " and worked extensively as a scouting force for the U.S. 7th Infantry Division . In this role , the company undertook several major operations against the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army , including Operation Tomahawk in early 1951 . 
 Even though racial politics often resulted in the company receiving untrained replacements , it performed well in many small @-@ scale engagements during this time . In the summer of 1951 , the company was employed along the front line as an advance force to push back Chinese attacks as the front lines became more static . The company was highly regarded for its actions capturing and holding Hill 581 during the Battle of the Soyang River , in which the company inflicted hundreds of casualties on the Chinese without a single Ranger being killed . 
 Disbanded in August 1951 along with all the other Ranger companies , the unit 's soldiers accrued several awards in its 10 @-@ month existence . These included four campaign streamers , nine Silver Star Medals and over 100 Purple Heart Medals . Subsequent research has focused on the economy of force of how the Rangers were employed and how their performance was impacted by the racist policies of their time . 
 = = Origins = = 
 On 25 June 1950 the Korean War began when the North Korean People 's Army invaded the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) with 90 @,@ 000 well @-@ trained and equipped troops who easily overran the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army . In response , the United States ( U.S. ) and United Nations ( UN ) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing . The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better @-@ trained North Koreans . From there , the U.S. and UN suffered a steady stream of defeats that pushed them back to the Pusan Perimeter by August . At the same time , North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities . 
 UN units , spread out along the Pusan Perimeter , had a difficult time repelling these units as they were untrained in combating guerrilla warfare . North Korean special forces units like the NK 766th Independent Infantry Regiment had great success in defeating ROK troops , prompting U.S. Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins to order the creation of an elite force which could " infiltrate through enemy lines and attack command posts , artillery , tank parks , and key communications centers or facilities . " All U.S. Army Ranger units , which had previously undertaken this role , had been disbanded after World War II because they required time @-@ consuming training , specialization , and expensive equipment . With the defeat of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong , and the strength of U.S. infantry units in question , U.S. commanders felt the recreation of Ranger units was essential . In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began , the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee , the head of its G @-@ 3 Operations miscellaneous division , to create a new experimental Army Ranger unit , the Eighth Army Ranger Company , to trial the concept of reestablishing small light infantry companies that specialized in infiltration and irregular warfare . In the meantime , the Ranger Training Center was established at Fort Benning , Georgia . 
 = = = Organization = = = 
 With the successful development of the Eighth Army Ranger Company , the establishment of additional Ranger companies was ordered . The composition of the new 2nd Army Ranger Infantry Company was formulated on the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of the World War II Ranger units . The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was organized into three heavily armed platoons , which were overseen by a headquarters element of five men . Each platoon comprised 36 men in three squads : two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad . Each platoon was also furnished with 60 mm M2 mortars , M20 Super Bazookas , and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles . One sniper was designated for each platoon , with the remainder of the troops being equipped with M1 Garand and M2 Carbine rifles . They were authorized two vehicles : an M38 Jeep and an M35 2 ½ ton cargo truck . Overall , the company was far more heavily armed than both the Eighth Army Ranger Company and standard infantry companies . Like the other numbered Ranger companies , its organization called for 5 officers and 107 enlisted men . 
 The troops for the Ranger company were to be Airborne qualified , so the Ranger Training Center heavily recruited troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School . In spite of this , only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing . They initially wore a black and gold scroll as a shoulder sleeve insignia , but that insignia was later redesignated the Ranger Tab and the Rangers adopted a black , red and white scroll similar to that unofficially worn by Ranger Battalions in World War II . 
 Soon after arriving in Korea , the unit took to the nickname " Buffalo Rangers , " which U.S. newspapers had applied to the unit as a homage to the Buffalo Soldiers . " Buffalo " subsequently became both the division 's motto as well as its password for patrols upon their return to company lines . The 2nd Ranger Company was the only Ranger company in the history of the U.S. Army to consist entirely of African @-@ Americans . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and training = = = 
 The U.S. Army , which up until that point typically did not allow African @-@ American soldiers to serve in special forces units , authorized African @-@ Americans to apply to become Rangers . However , in spite of Executive Order 9981 , which had de @-@ segregated the U.S. military in 1948 , the Army opted to pool all black applicants into one company . By 1950 , most units were still de facto segregated , and in the 82nd Airborne Division , Ranger applicants came from the all @-@ black units including the 3rd Battalion , 505th Airborne Infantry , the <unk> Tank Battalion and the 80th Anti @-@ Aircraft Artillery Battalion . Many of the applicants were World War II veterans who had seen combat , and many others had served with the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion . 
 Of a pool of 5 @,@ 000 applicants , on 2 October the Ranger Training School selected 22 officers and 314 enlisted men for the first three Ranger companies , which were entirely white . A fourth , all African @-@ American company was organized several days later . The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company ( Airborne ) was organized on 9 October 1950 , assuming the lineage of A Company of the 2nd Ranger Battalion . It had an initial strength of 135 enlisted men and 5 officers under the command of First Lieutenant Warren E. Allen , company commander , and Second Lieutenant James C. Queen , executive officer . Originally it had been designated the 4th Ranger Infantry Company ( Airborne ) , but the two companies switched designations , apparently to prevent accusations of racial discrimination . The unit was formally activated on 25 October 1950 at Fort Benning . 
 The Rangers trained extensively in reconnaissance , long @-@ range patrols , motorized scouting , setting up roadblocks , land navigation , camouflage , concealment , and adjusting indirect fire . They undertook frequent live fire exercises , many at night , simulating raids , ambushes and infiltrations . The Rangers trained 60 hours per week and ran 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) each day and frequently held 20 miles ( 32 km ) speed marches , which were considered traditions for Ranger training from World War II . The training for the numbered companies included much of the program used by Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett to train the Eighth Army Ranger Company . In spite of a 30 percent dropout rate , most of the men completed the course and graduated on 15 November 1950 . The Rangers left Fort Benning on 3 December and traveled to Camp Stoneman , California , with the 4th Ranger Company . They sailed for Japan on 9 December aboard the transport USS General H.W. Butner bound for the front lines in the Korean War . The company arrived at Yokohama , Japan , on 24 December , and was flown from Tachikawa Air Base to Taegu five days later . 
 = = = Korea = = = 
 Arriving in Korea at 11 : 15 on 30 December , the 2nd Ranger Company was attached to the 32nd Regimental Combat Team , 7th Infantry Division , X Corps which was regrouping in <unk> having been badly mauled in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir , a battle which signaled the unexpected entry of Chinese troops into the war . The next day , the division was ordered to Tanyang and Wonju to block Chinese southward advance along main roads and railroads in the area . On 6 January the Rangers arrived at <unk> @-@ ni with the regimental headquarters , where they were used as a security element for its medical units to protect them from infiltration . The Rangers established counter @-@ guerrilla patrols around the regiment 's main aid station and headquarters . They first saw combat at 02 : 00 on 7 January , driving off 20 North Korean guerrillas who had inadvertently run into one of their roadblocks . They then repulsed a company @-@ sized second attack on the position . In this action , the Rangers lost their first killed in action , Sergeant First Class Isaac Baker , as well as three wounded . The North Koreans had 50 killed . At 09 : 00 9 January , 3rd Platoon conducted a patrol to <unk> where they ambushed an advance North Korean patrol , killing 11 while suffering one wounded in a six @-@ hour firefight from 09 : 00 to 14 : 45 . The company soon created a " curfew , " attacking anyone they encountered after dark , a move which effectively disrupted communications and resupply to the local Chinese guerrilla unit , which instead opted to move out of the Rangers ' area of operation . 
 On 14 January , the Rangers formed the armored spearhead of the 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry attack on the village of <unk> @-@ ri , as part of an offensive to push Chinese forces back from the Tanyang area . The company entered the village at 07 : 30 and was ambushed by a battalion of Chinese troops entrenched there in fortified positions . The Rangers were able to capture the village and fend off a counterattack with their heavy weapons , suffering five killed and five wounded while killing 100 Chinese soldiers . However , as it moved to reinforce another U.S. infantry company advancing north , the 2nd Ranger Company was hit by a strong Chinese counterattack , and was forced to withdraw after running out of ammunition . It suffered another six killed and three wounded . 
 Continued patrols and skirmishes in the Tanyang area , as well as non @-@ battle casualties to frostbite and sickness in the middle of the Korean winter , whittled down the 2nd Ranger Company to 67 men by the end of January . X Corps commander Major General Ned Almond ordered all black replacements to be sent to the Ranger company , even though they had not been trained as Rangers . This action , seen as a racist move by historians , was done to keep Almond 's troops segregated . Although Ranger replacements were in short supply and the order effectively ensured that the company was brought back to at full strength , it nevertheless reduced the company 's effectiveness . Reinforcements from many career fields , including many non @-@ combat troops , joined the company and had to be retrained . 
 The 7th Infantry Division reached full strength and saw action around <unk> and Pyeongchang as part of an effort to push the North Korean and Chinese forces back above the 38th parallel and away from Seoul . In early February , the 7th Infantry Division engaged in a series of successful " limited objective " small unit attacks and ambushes before advancing slowly as it cleared enemy hilltop positions throughout the remainder of the month . In this time , the 2nd Ranger Company acted as a probing force and spearhead for attacks . On 20 February it led the 17th Infantry Regiment in an attack on <unk> , taking the town from a superior force of Chinese troops . The action was undertaken with several war correspondents observing the battle , bringing international attention to the Ranger unit . The Rangers were commended for a particularly aggressive attack in which they pursued and surprised a Chinese column moving into the village , persisting in their attack with fixed bayonets even when it became apparent that the Chinese force was larger than anticipated . The Chinese were routed in heavy fighting . A few days later , field commanders reported to The Pentagon that the company was performing extremely well , and it was pulled from the lines for a new mission . 
 = = = Operation Tomahawk = = = 
 On 28 February 1951 , the 2nd Ranger Company was attached to the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team ( RCT ) , alongside the 4th Ranger Infantry Company , and began unit training jumps and tactical exercises in preparation for a combat parachute drop . These exercises continued throughout March 1951 , as much of the UN force conducted the aggressive Operation Ripper as a large @-@ scale counteroffensive against the Chinese and North Korean forces . To follow @-@ up this attack , Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway , commander of the Eighth Army , planned Operation Tomahawk , a mission to insert the 187th RCT and the Rangers behind the Chinese lines to cut off Chinese supplies and force them to retreat north of Seoul . During the three weeks of training , the Rangers were reinforced by another platoon of African @-@ American Rangers directly from Ranger school under Lieutenant Antonio Anthony . 
 On 23 March , the 187th and attached Rangers were dropped around Munsan @-@ ni , 24 miles ( 39 km ) northwest of Seoul , with the mission to hold an airhead to interfere with the Chinese and North Korean logistical network , and linkup with the 6th Medium Tank Battalion 18 hours after drop . The force of 3 @,@ 500 left Taegu in 150 transports , over the Yellow Sea and over the North Korean coast . The 2nd Ranger Company dropped from its aircraft at 09 : 15 , the first time in history U.S. Army Rangers conducted an aerial insertion into combat . Suffering only two Rangers injured from the jump , the force was nonetheless able to surprise and capture several positions of the NK 19th Division . 
 The Rangers massed and moved south to a terrain feature known as Hill 151 , the linkup point with the 6th Tank Battalion . The company surprised and overwhelmed a Chinese platoon in a village 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the hill , killing six and capturing twenty . They then took the hill despite North Korean resistance , killing eleven and capturing one , and forcing two platoons of North Koreans to retreat from the hill . The Rangers suffered one killed and two wounded . By 18 : 00 they had linked up with the advancing 64th Medium Tank Battalion of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division . Over the next five days , the Rangers commenced mopping up North Korean and Chinese resistance , advancing 20 miles ( 32 km ) north . 
 = = = Retraining and lull = = = 
 In April , the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was reattached to the 7th Infantry Division , this time to the 31st Regimental Combat Team . The company spent the month training replacements , with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into the company . By May , the process of transferring these men to other units began as U.S. Army units throughout Korea , driven by necessity , began slowly desegregating . The Rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men , among them the first white member of the unit , medic Joe Russo . 
 By May , the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258 , on the front lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division . They conducted frequent patrols along an outpost network , often encountering and engaging Chinese troops . They fortified the hill and surrounding areas , which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked . During this period , the fighting entered a lull , and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations . Allen , Pryor , and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men , leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill . 
 = = = Hill 581 = = = 
 Shortly after this , however , Chinese infiltrators began appearing regularly in the undermanned 2nd Company 's area , and by 15 May , Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581 , several miles from their position , from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258 . Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May , covered by 7th Division artillery fire . At 15 : 00 , they engaged the surprised Chinese , conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire . By 17 : 00 , the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the Chinese , who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack . 
 Chinese troops counterattacked in force at 23 : 00 , with two battalions of infantry supported by snipers and mortar fire . Aided by 7th Division artillery fire , the Rangers held the hill against Chinese resistance . The Rangers repulsed four successive Chinese assaults by one of the battalions , expending all of their grenades by 02 : 00 on 18 May , and running short on ammunition by 03 : 00 . At that point , the second Chinese battalion commenced its assault , surprising the Rangers and driving them from the peak of Hill 581 . Queen counterattacked and retook the hill by 05 : 00 . At 06 : 45 , the Chinese gave up the attack , having been severely mauled . In the unsuccessful attempt to take Hill 581 , Chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured . The Rangers , having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug @-@ in positions , suffered only 10 wounded in the battle . Commanders in the 7th Infantry Division were stunned by the 2nd Ranger Company 's effectiveness in the fight , and as a result of the action , the company came to be considered a model unit . 
 The 2nd Ranger Company then moved east to help relieve the 7th Marines , which was reeling from Chinese attacks . In three days of intermittent fighting , the company conducted a number of search and destroy missions . This culminated in an attack on Hill 545 , where an estimated company of Chinese troops , who had previously pushed the Marines back , were themselves surprised by the Rangers and forced to withdraw , losing 15 killed to the Rangers ' two wounded . 
 = = = Final battles and disbandment = = = 
 In June 1951 , with peace talks underway in Panmunjom , the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles as a means to secure a better position for the UN at the bargaining table . After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division , on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772 , an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line . That morning , the company , with support from 7th Division artillery , advanced on the hill , which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P @-@ 51 Mustangs . Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew at the end of the day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded . Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded . On 11 July , the Rangers continued the attack , backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near <unk> @-@ ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further . In this attack , one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded . 
 Following this , another lull in fighting along the 38th parallel occurred , during which both sides took time to fortify their positions and conduct fewer patrols . As the need for offensive action diminished , on 10 July , the U.S. Army ordered the deactivation of all of its Ranger companies . In doing so , the Army noted that the establishment of the Ranger companies had only been a trial directed by The Pentagon , which had been completed . The decision was further clarified in relation to the 2nd Ranger Company , with the Army stating that " racial differences " had prevented the company from being used effectively in offensive operations . 
 As a result of the decision to disband the Ranger units , the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea . Like many of the other Ranger units , most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT . As an airborne unit , it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th , their airborne skills could be used . Nevertheless , in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result , the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again . 
 = = Awards and decorations = = 
 The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was awarded four campaign streamers for its service in the Korean War . In 1955 , the unit was again designated A Company of the 2nd Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment , and that unit carries on the 2nd Ranger Company 's lineage . 
 Rangers of the company also received numerous individual decorations . Nine Rangers received Silver Star Medals and 11 received Bronze Star Medals . A total of 103 Purple Heart Medals were awarded to 84 members of the company , with 11 Rangers receiving two Purple Hearts and four Rangers receiving three . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was one of sixteen Ranger companies formed in 1950 , and one of seven to see combat in Korea . Subsequent military science studies of the Korean War Rangers have analyzed their economy of force , focusing on how well the U.S. military employed the Rangers as special forces . In a thorough analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War , Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that Rangers in Korea were misused and ineffective . Chae contended that the Ranger formations ' lack of support personnel made them a logistical and administrative liability , as they had to be attached to conventional units for support . Furthermore , Chae argued that the small size of the Ranger units meant they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers , and their employment with divisional elements meant they did not have the necessary intelligence information to conduct effective infiltration operations . He concluded that these problems were due to " lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities , limitations inherent in Rangers ' force structure , and basic distrust of elite forces . " 
 In his own 2003 thesis , Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond said the 2nd Ranger Company 's performance in Korea had been exemplary , in spite of racial discrimination against it . The troops , who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company , quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers . Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea , noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units to which they were attached were decorated . Bond also said many of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units , due in part to the command climate precipitated by Almond .

 = Verbascum thapsus = 
 Verbascum thapsus ( great mullein or common mullein ) is a species of mullein native to Europe , northern Africa , and Asia , and introduced in the Americas and Australia . 
 It is a hairy biennial plant that can grow to 2 meters tall or more . Its small yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem , which grows from a large rosette of leaves . It grows in a wide variety of habitats , but prefers well @-@ lit disturbed soils , where it can appear soon after the ground receives light , from long @-@ lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank . It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds , but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive , since its seeds require open ground to germinate . It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops , since it is not a very competitive species , being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling . It also hosts many insects , some of which can be harmful to other plants . Although individuals are easy to remove by hand , populations are difficult to eliminate permanently . 
 It is widely used for herbal remedies , with well @-@ established emollient and astringent properties . <unk> remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems , but also used in topical applications against a variety of skin problems . The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches . 
 = = Description = = 
 Verbascum thapsus is a dicotyledonous plant that produces a rosette of leaves in its first year of growth . The leaves are large , up to 50 cm long . The second year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem , usually 1 – 2 m tall . In the eastern part of its range in China , it is , however , only reported to grow up to 1 @.@ 5 m tall . The tall pole @-@ like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length . All parts of the plants are covered with star @-@ shaped trichomes . This cover is particularly thick on the leaves , giving them a silvery appearance . The species ' chromosome number is 2n = 36 . 
 On flowering plants the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem . They are thick and decurrent , with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem , ranging from oblong to oblanceolate , and reaching sizes up to 50 cm long and 14 cm across ( 19 inches long and 5 inches wide ) . They become smaller higher up the stem , and less strongly decurrent down the stem . The flowering stem is solid and 2 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( nearly an inch ) across , and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence , usually following damage . After flowering and seed release the stem and fruits usually persist in winter , drying into dark brown , stiff structures of densely packed , ovoid @-@ shaped and dry seed capsules . The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer . The plant produces a shallow taproot . 
 Flowers are <unk> with ( usually ) five stamen , a 5 @-@ lobed calyx tube and a 5 @-@ petalled corolla , the latter bright yellow and an 1 @.@ 5 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) wide . The flowers are almost sessile , with very short pedicels ( 2 mm , 0 @.@ 08 in ) . The five stamens are of two types , with the three upper stamens being shorter , their filaments covered by yellow or whitish hairs , and having smaller anthers , while the lower two stamens have glabrous filaments and larger anthers . The plant produces small ovoid ( 6 mm , 0 @.@ 24 in ) capsules that split open by way of two valves , each capsule containing large numbers of minute brown seeds less than a millimetre ( 0 @.@ 04 in ) in size , marked with longitudinal ridges . A white @-@ flowered form , V. thapsus f. <unk> , is known to occur . Flowering lasts for up to three months from early to late summer ( June to August in northern Europe ) , with flowering starting at the bottom of the spike and progressing irregularly upward ; each flower opens for part of a day and only a few open at the same time around the stem . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 For the purpose of botanical nomenclature , Verbascum thapsus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum . The specific epithet thapsus had been first used by Theophrastus ( as <unk> , <unk> ) for an unspecified herb from the Ancient Greek settlement of <unk> , near modern Syracuse , Sicily , though it is often assimilated to the ancient Tunisian city of Thapsus . 
 At the time , no type specimen was specified , as the practice only arose later , in the 19th century . When a lectotype ( type selected amongst original material ) was designated , it was assigned to specimen 242 @.@ 1 of Linnaeus ' herbarium , the only V. thapsus specimen . The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum . European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation , which has led to the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years . Introduced American populations show much less variation . 
 The taxonomy of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since <unk> Mürbeck 's <unk> in the 1930s , with the exception of the work of Arthur Huber @-@ <unk> , who used informal group in organizing the genus for the floras of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species . Since Huber @-@ <unk> 's groups are not taxonomical , Mürbeck 's treatment is the most current one available , as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus . In Mürbeck 's classification , V. thapsus is placed in section <unk> subsect . <unk> ( or sect . Verbascum subsect . Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices ) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum ( black or dark mullein ) , Verbascum <unk> ( white mullein ) and Verbascum sinuatum ( wavy @-@ leaved mullein ) . 
 = = = Subspecies and hybrids = = = 
 There are three usually recognized subspecies : 
 V. thapsus subsp. thapsus ; type , widespread . 
 V. thapsus subsp. crassifolium ( Lam . ) <unk> . ; Mediterranean region and to 2000 metres in southwestern Austria . ( <unk> subsp. montanum ( <unk> . ) Bonnier & <unk> ) 
 V. thapsus subsp. giganteum ( <unk> . ) Nyman ; Spain , endemic . 
 In all subspecies but the type , the lower stamens are also hairy . In subsp. crassifolium , the hairiness is less dense and often absent from the upper part of the anthers , while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles . In subsp. giganteum , the hairs are densely white tomentose , and lower leaves strongly decurrent . <unk> crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers , which measure 15 – 30 mm wide , whereas in the type they are 12 – 20 mm in diameter . Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species . Due to its morphological variation , V. thapsus has had a great many subspecies described . A recent revision led its author to maintain V. giganteum but sink V. crassifolium into synonymy . 
 The plant is also parent to several hybrids ( see table ) . Of these , the most common is V. × <unk> <unk> . ( × V. nigrum ) . All occur in Eurasia , and three , V. × <unk> Fritsch , V. × <unk> <unk> and V. × <unk> L. ( syn . V. × <unk> <unk> ) , have also been reported in North America . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 V. thapsus is known by a variety of names . European reference books call it " great mullein " . In North America , " common mullein " is used while western United States residents commonly refer to mullein as " cowboy toilet paper " . 
 In the 19th century it had well over 40 different common names in English alone . Some of the more whimsical ones included " <unk> <unk> " , " indian rag weed " , " <unk> lungwort " , " Adams @-@ rod " , " hare 's @-@ beard " and " ice @-@ leaf " . Vernacular names include innumerable references to the plant 's hairiness : " woolly mullein " , " velvet mullein " or " blanket mullein " , " beggar 's blanket " , " Moses ' blanket " , " poor man 's blanket " , " Our Lady 's blanket " or " old man 's blanket " , and " <unk> " , and so on ( " flannel " is another common generic name ) . 
 Some names refer to the plant 's size and shape : " shepherd 's club ( s ) " or " staff " , " Aaron 's Rod " ( a name it shares with a number of other plants with tall , yellow inflorescences ) , and a plethora of other " X 's staff " and " X 's rod " . The name " velvet dock " or " mullein dock " is also recorded , where " dock " is a British name applied to any broad @-@ leaved plant . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Verbascum thapsus has a wide native range including Europe , northern Africa and Asia , from the Azores and Canary Islands east to western China , north to the British Isles , Scandinavia and Siberia , and south to the Himalayas . In northern Europe , it grows from sea level up to 1 @,@ 850 m altitude , while in China it grows at 1 @,@ 400 – 3 @,@ 200 m altitude . 
 It has been introduced throughout the temperate world , and is established as a weed in Australia , New Zealand , tropical Asia , La Réunion , North America , Hawaii , Chile , Hispaniola and Argentina . It has also been reported in Japan . 
 In the United States it was imported very early in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and <unk> properties . By 1818 , it had begun spreading so much that Amos Eaton thought it was a native plant . In 1839 it was already reported in Michigan and in 1876 , in California . It is now found commonly in all the states . In Canada , it is most common in the Maritime Provinces as well as southern Quebec , Ontario and British Columbia , with scattered populations in between . 
 Great mullein most frequently grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil , usually on sandy or chalky ones . It grows best in dry , sandy or gravelly soils , although it can grow in a variety of habitats , including <unk> , meadows , roadsides , forest clearings and pastures . This ability to grow in a wide range of habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Great mullein is a biennial and generally requires winter dormancy before it can flower . This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root , and <unk> application bypasses this requirement . Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil , at temperatures between 10 ° C and 40 ° C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present ( tests give a 35 % germination rate under ideal conditions ) , in the wild , they in practice only do so when exposed to light , or very close to the soil surface , which explains the plant 's habitat preferences . While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists , growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid . 
 Seeds germinate in spring and summer . Those that germinate in autumn produce plants that overwinter if they are large enough , while rosettes less than 15 cm ( 6 in ) across die in winter . After flowering the entire plant usually dies at the end of its second year , but some individuals , especially in the northern parts of the range , require a longer growth period and flower in their third year . Under better growing conditions , some individuals flower in the first year . Triennial individuals have been found to produce fewer seeds than biennial and annual ones . While year of flowering and size are linked to the environment , most other characteristics appear to be genetic . 
 A given flower is open only for a single day , opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon . Flowers are self @-@ <unk> and protogynous ( with female parts maturing first ) , and will self @-@ pollinate if they have not been pollinated by insects during the day . While many insects visit the flowers , only some bees actually accomplish pollination . V. thapsus ' flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range , extending to September or October in warmer climates . Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies . The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors . 
 The seeds maintain their <unk> powers for decades , up to a hundred years , according to some studies . Because of this , and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer ( each plant produces hundreds of capsules , each containing up to 700 + seeds , with a total up to 180 @,@ 000 or 240 @,@ 000 seeds ) , it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time , and can sprout from apparently bare ground , or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died . Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by a long period of dormancy as seeds . Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far . Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement ; 75 % of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant , and 93 % fall within 5 m . 
 <unk> bees of the genus <unk> use the hair ( amongst that of various woolly plants ) in making their nests . The seeds are generally too small for birds to feed on , although the American goldfinch has been reported to consume them . Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves ( Hawaiian goose ) or flowers ( palila ) , or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects ( white @-@ headed woodpecker ) . 
 = = Fossil record = = 
 Seed of Verbascum thapsus has been recorded from part of the Cromer Forest Bead series and at West Wittering in Sussex from some parts of the <unk> interglacial layers . 
 = = Agricultural impacts and control = = 
 Because it cannot compete with established plants , great mullein is no longer considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation , except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with , such as Californian semi @-@ <unk> areas of the Eastern Sierra Nevada . In such ecological contexts , it crowds out native herbs and grasses ; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession . Although not an agricultural threat , its presence can be very difficult to completely eradicate , and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures . The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado ( Class C ) and Hawaii , and the Australian state of Victoria ( regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region , and regionally controlled in several others ) . 
 Despite not being an agricultural weed in itself , it hosts a number of insects and diseases , including both pests and beneficial insects . It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus , <unk> <unk> ( the cucurbit powdery mildew ) and Texas root rot . A study found V. thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families . Most of the pests found were western flower thrips ( <unk> occidentalis ) , <unk> species such as the tarnished plant bug ( L. <unk> ) , and various spider mites from the family <unk> . These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests . 
 Other insects commonly found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V. thapsus in particular . They include mullein thrips ( <unk> verbasci ) , <unk> <unk> ( whose larva consume the seeds ) and the mullein moth ( <unk> verbasci ) . Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein , including predatory mites of the genera <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the minute pirate bug <unk> <unk> and the mullein plant bug ( <unk> verbasci ) . The plant 's ability to host both pests and <unk> makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures , like <unk> verbasci and <unk> hesperus ( <unk> ) , a predator of whiteflies . A number of pest Lepidoptera species , including the Stalk Borer ( <unk> <unk> ) and Gray <unk> ( Strymon <unk> ) , also use V. thapsus as a host plant . 
 Control of the plant , when desired , is best managed via mechanical means , such as hand pulling and <unk> , preferably followed by sowing of native plants . Animals rarely graze it because of its irritating hairs , and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective , as the hair causes water to roll off the plant , much like the lotus effect . Burning is ineffective , as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy . G. <unk> and <unk> verbasci usually have little effect on V. thapsus populations as a whole . Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein . Effective ( when used with a surfactant ) contact herbicides include glyphosate , <unk> and <unk> @-@ methyl . Ground herbicides , like <unk> , are also effective , but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Great mullein has been used since ancient times as a remedy for skin , throat and breathing ailments . It has long had a medicinal reputation , especially as an astringent and emollient , as it contains mucilage , several saponins , coumarin and glycosides . Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung and it is now widely available in health and herbal stores . Non @-@ medical uses have included dyeing and making torches . 
 = = = Medical uses = = = 
 Dioscorides first recommended the plant 2000 years ago , against pulmonary diseases , and this has remained one of its primary uses , especially against cough . Leaf <unk> or herbal teas were used for <unk> , consumption , dry cough , bronchitis , sore throat and hemorrhoids . Leaves were also smoked against pulmonary ailments , a tradition that in America was rapidly transmitted to Native American peoples . The Zuni people , however , use the plant in poultices of powdered root applied to sores , rashes and skin infections . An infusion of the root is also used to treat athlete 's foot . The combination of <unk> saponins and emollient mucilage makes the plant particularly effective for cough . All preparations meant to be drunk have to be finely filtered to eliminate the irritating hairs . 
 Oil from the flowers was used against catarrhs , <unk> and , in Germany , <unk> , frostbite , eczema and other external conditions . Topical application of various V. thapsus @-@ based preparations was recommended for the treatment of warts , boils , <unk> , hemorrhoids , and chilblains , amongst others . Recent studies have found that great mullein contains <unk> compounds with <unk> and potential anti @-@ <unk> action . These compounds are concentrated in the flowers . The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs . It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom . The plant 's leaves , in addition to the seeds , have been reported to contain rotenone , although quantities are unknown . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Like many ancient medicinal plants ( Pliny the Elder describes it in his Naturalis Historia ) , great mullein was linked to witches , although the relationship remained generally ambiguous , and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits . The seeds contain several compounds ( saponins , glycosides , coumarin , rotenone ) that are toxic to fish , and have been widely used as <unk> for fishing . 
 The flowers provide dyes of bright yellow or green , and have been used for hair dye . The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks , or put into shoes to help with insulating them . The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches . Due to its weedy capacities , the plant , unlike other species of the genus ( such as V. <unk> ) , is not often cultivated . 
 The stalk can also be dried as a spindle for making fire either by hand drill or bow drill .

 Daft Punk are a French electronic music duo consisting of producers Guy @-@ Manuel de Homem @-@ Christo and Thomas Bangalter . The two achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and were met with continuous success in the years following , combining elements of house music with funk , techno , disco , rock , and synthpop . They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music ; specifically , the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 . They rarely grant interviews or appear on television . 
 Bangalter and de Homem @-@ Christo were originally in a rock band called Darlin ' together , which disbanded after a short period of time , leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers . The duo became Daft Punk , releasing their debut album Homework on Virgin Records in 1997 to highly positive reviews . They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter ( Busy P ) , the head of Ed Banger Records . The 2001 release of Discovery was even more successful , driven by the club singles " One More Time " , " Digital Love " , and " Harder , Better , Faster , Stronger " . In March 2005 , the duo released the album Human After All to mixed reviews . However , the singles " Robot Rock " and " Technologic " achieved success in the United Kingdom . 
 Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007 , which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic / Dance Album . The duo composed the score of the film Tron : Legacy in 2010 and released its soundtrack album . In January 2013 , Daft Punk left Virgin Records for Sony Music Entertainment 's subsidiary label Columbia , and released Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim . The album 's lead single " Get Lucky " became an international success , peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries . Random Access Memories led to five Grammy wins in 2014 , including Album of the Year as well as Record of the Year for " Get Lucky " .

This eventually led to the formation of the guitar @-@ based group called Darlin ' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992 . Bangalter and de Homem @-@ Christo played bass and guitar , respectively , while Brancowitz performed on drums . The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name , which they covered along with an original composition . Stereolab released both tracks on a multi @-@ artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom . Bangalter felt that " The rock n ' roll thing we did was pretty average , I think . It was so brief , maybe six months , four songs and two gigs and that was it . " A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music " a daft punky thrash . " Instead of dismissing the review , they found it amusing . As de Homem @-@ Christo stated , " We struggled so long to find [ the name ] Darlin ' , and this happened so quickly . " Darlin ' soon disbanded , leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix . Bangalter and de Homem @-@ Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers .

 In September 1993 , Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney , where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam , co @-@ founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings . The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk 's debut single , " The New Wave " , a limited release in 1994 . The single also contained the final mix of " The New Wave " called " Alive " , which was to be featured on Daft Punk 's first album . 
 Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record " Da Funk " . It became the duo 's first commercially successful single the same year . After the success of " Da Funk " , Daft Punk looked to find a manager . The duo eventually settled on Pedro Winter , who regularly promoted it and other artists at his Hype night clubs . The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which the duo licensed its tracks to the major label through its production company , Daft Trax . Bangalter spoke of the duo 's decision to sign with Virgin : 
 Many record companies offered us deals . They came from everywhere , but we decided to wait — partly because we didn 't want to lose control of what we had created . We turned down many record companies . We weren 't interested in the money , so we turned down labels that were looking for more control than we were willing to give up . In reality , we 're more like partners with Virgin . 
 With regard to the artistic control and freedom , Bangalter stated : 
 We 've got much more control than money . You can 't get everything . We live in a society where money is what people want , so they can 't get the control . We chose . Control is freedom . People say we 're control freaks , but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people . We 're not trying to manipulate other people , just controlling what we do ourselves . Controlling what we do is being free . People should stop thinking that an artist that controls what he does is a bad thing . A lot of artists today are just victims , not having control , and they 're not free . And that 's pathetic . If you start being dependent on money , then money has to reach a point to fit your expenses . 
 " Da Funk " and " Alive " were later included on Daft Punk 's 1997 debut album Homework . In February of that year , the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as " one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time . " According to The Village Voice , the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula . As noted by critic Alex Rayner , Homework brought together established club styles and the " burgeoning eclecticism " of big beat . The most successful single from Homework was " Around the World " , which is known for the repeating chant of the song 's title . " Da Funk " was also included on The Saint film soundtrack . Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze , Michel Gondry , Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak . The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. : A Story About Dogs , Androids , Firemen and Tomatoes .

 By 1999 , the duo was well into the recording sessions for its second album , which had begun a year earlier . The 2001 release of Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop @-@ oriented style , initially stunning fans of Daft Punk 's previous material in Homework . The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful , open @-@ minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood . This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late ' 70s to early ' 80s era on the album . The album reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom , and its single , " One More Time " , was a major club and mainstream hit that nearly topped the UK Singles Chart .

 = = Influences = = 
 Bangalter and de Homem @-@ Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style . Years before producing electronic music as a duo , they shared tastes for Elton John , MC5 , The Rolling Stones , The Beach Boys and The Stooges . Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English as a second language , since he wanted to understand the lyrics . The duo 's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin ' . Bangalter explained : " It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time . It 's like , you know , everybody wants to be in a band . " They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s . De Homem @-@ Christo referred to <unk> by Primal Scream as the record that " put everything together " in terms of genre " . 
 The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contain a quote from Brian Wilson . Bangalter stated : " In Brian Wilson 's music you could really feel the beauty — it was very spiritual . Like Bob Marley , too . " When questioned on the success of Daft Punk 's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre , Bangalter responded , " before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on . The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people . " The Daft Punk track " Teachers " , from Homework , refers to several influences , such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards . De Homem @-@ Christo stated : " Their music had a big effect on us . The sound of their productions — the compression , the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony 's voice , the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today . " A 2011 <unk> podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in " Teachers " , the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework , and a Kraftwerk @-@ like 1983 track produced by Daniel <unk> , father of Bangalter . 
 Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk on tracks for Discovery . For the album , Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music . A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single " Windowlicker " , which was " neither a purely club track nor a very chilled @-@ out , down @-@ tempo relaxation track " , according to Bangalter . The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of an artist from a previous era . As stated by de Homem @-@ Christo , " On ' Digital Love ' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge , " which was generated through an in @-@ studio Wurlitzer piano . During a later interview , de Homem @-@ Christo clarified that " we didn 't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs . " Daft Punk would collaborate with Edwards again on the song " Fragments of Time " , featured on the 2013 album Random Access Memories . 
 During a 2009 interview , Bangalter named Andy Warhol as one of Daft Punk 's early artistic influences . For the Tron : Legacy soundtrack , the duo drew inspiration from Wendy Carlos , the composer of the original Tron film , as well as Max Steiner , Bernard Herrmann , John Carpenter , Vangelis , Philip Glass and Maurice Jarre . Daft Punk later sought a " west coast vibe " during the production of Random Access Memories , referencing such bands as Fleetwood Mac , The Doobie Brothers and the Eagles . They also highlighted the influence of Jean Michel Jarre in an interview following the album 's release . 
 = = Visual components and image = = 
 Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions . The music videos for their singles from Homework featured distinctive characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance . The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555 . 
 Their outward personas have also changed over time . In one of the duo 's earliest magazine appearances , de Homem @-@ Christo stated in a Jockey Slut interview that , " We don 't want to be photographed . [ ... ] We don 't especially want to be in magazines . We have a responsibility . " Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French television arts program at the time , Daft Punk did not wish to speak on screen " because it is dangerous . " During their Homework years , the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance . When not wearing disguises , they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation ( as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD ) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits . Few official photos of the duo 's faces exist , including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes . 
 In their more visible Discovery years , they appeared wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots , interviews , live shows and music videos . The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin , the duo who also designed them . With engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian , Inc . , they are capable of various LED effects . Wigs were originally attached to both helmets , but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001 . Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers in an advertisement during a special presentation of the music videos from the Discovery album during Cartoon Network 's Toonami block . Thomas Bangalter once stated , " We did not choose to become robots . There was an accident in our studio . We were working on our sampler , and at exactly 9 : 09 am on September 9 , 1999 , it exploded . When we regained consciousness , we discovered that we had become robots . " 
 Daft Punk have said that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines . However , Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness . " But then it became exciting from the audience 's point of view . It 's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower . " When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits , Bangalter stated " No , we don 't need to . It 's not about having inhibitions . It 's more like an advanced version of glam , where it 's definitely not you . " With the release of Human After All , the musical duo 's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear . The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane . Bangalter stated that , " We never like to do the same thing twice . It 's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different , whether it 's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality . We 're happy to give back to the masses " . 
 According to Bangalter , the duo has a " general rule about not appearing in videos . " Although Daft Punk rarely grants interviews , Bangalter is cited as being the more talkative and opinionated one of the duo . With regard to fame and stardom , he said : 
 In the same interview , he was also asked a question if stardom can be avoided . 
 During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk 's Electroma , the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces . While on the set of the film , the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned . As reported on October 2006 , the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview . During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision , reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media . 
 It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity . The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop . 
 Bangalter has noted , " The mask gets very hot , but after wearing it as long as I have , I am used to it . " He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 In the mid @-@ to @-@ late nineties , Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States . In 1996 , the duo were featured at an Even <unk> event in Wisconsin , their first public performance in the U.S. In addition to live original performances , they performed a number of times in various clubs using vinyl records from their collection . They were known for incorporating various styles of music into their DJ sets at that time . 
 In 1997 they did their <unk> to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world . For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage . As Bangalter stated , " Everything was synched up — the drum machines , the bass lines . The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars . On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to . " 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo , England , headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk . Also of note is the performance of 8 November in Birmingham , UK , from which came the recording of Alive 1997 .

 In February 2009 , a website stated that a " hidden " tour had been set for 2009 . An event for 13 February 2009 in Shanghai , China was mentioned in the website . It was later revealed to be a hoax unaffiliated with Daft Punk and a scam to sell tickets for a nonexistent event . Representatives of the band announced that Daft Punk had no tour plans for 2009 , but stated that the duo was looking forward to performing in China during their next world tour " in 2010 or 2011 " . The announcement also stated that all of Daft Punk 's shows are and would be posted on their official MySpace page , and that the page can therefore be used to verify validity .

 Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements . It was developed in 19th @-@ century New England by Mary Baker Eddy , who argued in her book Science and Health ( 1875 ) that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone . The book became Christian Science 's central text , along with the Bible , and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies . 
 Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ , Scientist , and in 1894 the Mother Church , The First Church of Christ , Scientist , was built in Boston , Massachusetts . Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States , with nearly 270 @,@ 000 members by 1936 , a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100 @,@ 000 . The church is known for its newspaper , the Christian Science Monitor , which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 , and for its Reading Rooms , which are open to the public in around 1 @,@ 200 cities . 
 Eddy described Christian Science as a return to " primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing . " There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of other branches of Christianity . In particular , adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism , believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion . This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine , but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health . 
 The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care – adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and vaccination when required by law – but maintains that Christian Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine . Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led to the deaths of several adherents and their children . Parents and others were prosecuted for , and in a few cases convicted of , manslaughter or neglect .

 = = = Metaphysical family = = = 
 Several periods of Protestant Christian revival nurtured a proliferation of new religious movements in the United States . In the latter half of the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family : groups such as Christian Science , Divine Science , the Unity School of Christianity and ( later ) the United Church of Religious Science . From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought , in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science . 
 The term metaphysical referred to the movement 's philosophical idealism , a belief in the primacy of the mental world . Adherents believed that material phenomena were the result of mental states , a view expressed as " life is consciousness " and " God is mind . " The supreme cause was referred to as Divine Mind , Truth , God , Love , Life , Spirit , Principle or Father – Mother , reflecting elements of Plato , Hinduism , Berkeley , Hegel , Swedenborg and transcendentalism . 
 The metaphysical groups became known as the mind @-@ cure movement because of their strong focus on healing . Medical practice was in its infancy , and patients regularly fared better without it . This provided fertile soil for the mind @-@ cure groups , who argued that sickness was an absence of " right thinking " or failure to connect to Divine Mind . The movement traced its roots in the United States to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby ( 1802 – 1866 ) , a New England clockmaker turned mental healer , whose motto was " the truth is the cure . " Mary Baker Eddy had been a patient of his , leading to debate about how much of Christian Science was based on his ideas . 
 New Thought and Christian Science differed in that Eddy saw her views as a unique and final revelation . Eddy 's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction ( that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others ) , introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature . Most significantly , she dismissed the material world as an illusion , rather than as merely subordinate to Mind , leading her to reject the use of medicine , or materia medica , and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups . Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual . 
 = = = Christian Science theology = = = 
 Christian Science leaders place their religion within mainstream Christian teaching , according to J. Gordon Melton , and reject any identification with the New Thought movement . Eddy was strongly influenced by her Congregationalist upbringing . In founding the Church of Christ , Scientist , in April 1879 , she wrote that she wanted it to " reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing . " Later she suggested that Christian Science was a kind of second coming and that Science and Health was an inspired text . In 1895 , in the Manual of the Mother Church , she ordained the Bible and Science and Health as " Pastor over the Mother Church . " 
 According to the church 's tenets , adherents accept " the inspired Word of the Bible as [ their ] sufficient guide to eternal Life ... acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God ... [ and ] acknowledge His Son , one Christ ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter ; and man in God 's image and likeness . " 
 Christian Science theology differs in several respects from that of traditional Christianity . Eddy 's Science and Health reinterprets key Christian concepts , including the Trinity , divinity of Jesus , atonement and resurrection ; from the 1883 edition she included a glossary that redefined the Christian vocabulary , and added with a Key to the Scriptures to the title . At the core of Eddy 's theology is the view that the spiritual world is the only reality and is entirely good , and that the material world , with its evil , sickness and death , is an illusion . Eddy saw humanity as an " idea of Mind " that is " perfect , eternal , unlimited , and reflects the divine , " according to Bryan Wilson ; what she called " mortal man " is simply humanity 's distorted view of itself . Despite her view of the non @-@ existence of evil , an important element of Christian Science theology is that evil thought , in the form of malicious animal magnetism , can cause harm , even if the harm is only apparent . 
 Eddy viewed God not as a person , but as " All @-@ in @-@ all . " Although she often described God as if discussing personhood – she used the term " Father – Mother God " ( as did Ann Lee , the founder of <unk> ) , and in the third edition of Science and Health referred to God as " she " – God is mostly represented in Christian Science by the synonyms " Mind , Spirit , Soul , Principle , Life , Truth , Love . " The Holy Ghost is Christian Science , and heaven and hell are states of mind . 
 There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer . The process involves the Scientist engaging in a silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter , something Christian Science practitioners will do for a fee , including in absentia , to address ill health or other problems . Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is " not curative ... on its own premises , but rather preventative of ill health , accident and misfortune , since it claims to lead to a state of consciousness where these things do not exist . What heals is the realization that there is nothing really to heal . " It is a closed system of thought , viewed as infallible if performed correctly ; healing confirms the power of Truth , but its absence derives from the failure , specifically the bad thoughts , of individuals . 
 Eddy accepted as true the creation narrative in the Book of Genesis up to chapter 2 , verse 6 – that God created man in his image and likeness – but rejected the rest " as the story of the false and the material , " according to Wilson . Her theology is <unk> ; she viewed the Trinity as suggestive of polytheism . She saw Jesus as a Christian Scientist , a " Way @-@ shower " between humanity and God , and distinguished between Jesus the man and the concept of Christ , the latter a synonym for Truth and Jesus the first person fully to manifest it . The crucifixion was not a divine sacrifice for the sins of humanity , the atonement ( the forgiveness of sin through Jesus 's suffering ) " not the bribing of God by offerings , " writes Wilson , but an " at @-@ one @-@ ment " with God . 
 Her views on life after death were vague and , according to Wilson , " there is no doctrine of the soul " in Christian Science : " [ A ] fter death , the individual continues his probationary state until he has worked out his own salvation by proving the truths of Christian Science . " Eddy did not believe that the dead and living could communicate . 
 To the more conservative of the Protestant clergy , Eddy 's view of Science and Health as divinely inspired was a challenge to the Bible 's authority . " <unk> " was viewed as a cult ; one of the first uses of the modern sense of the word was in A. H. Barrington 's Anti @-@ Christian Cults ( 1898 ) , a book about Spiritualism , Theosophy and Christian Science . In a few cases Christian Scientists were expelled from Christian congregations , but ministers also worried that their parishioners were choosing to leave . In May 1885 the London Times ' Boston correspondent wrote about the " Boston mind @-@ cure craze " : " Scores of the most valued Church members are joining the Christian Scientist branch of the metaphysical organization , and it has thus far been impossible to check the defection . " In 1907 Mark Twain described the appeal of the new religion : 
 = = Birth of the religion = = 
 = = = Mary Baker Eddy = = = 
 Born Mary Morse Baker on a farm in Bow , New Hampshire , Eddy was the youngest of six children in a family of Protestant Congregationalists . Her father , Mark Baker , was a deeply religious man , although , according to one account , " Christianity to him was warfare against sin , not a religion of human brotherhood . " In common with most women at the time Eddy was given little formal education , but said she had read widely at home . From childhood she lived with protracted ill health , complaining of chronic indigestion and spinal inflammation , and according to biographers experiencing fainting spells . The literary critic Harold Bloom described her as " a kind of anthology of nineteenth @-@ century nervous ailments . " 
 Eddy 's first husband died just before her 23rd birthday , six months after they married and three months before their son was born , leaving her penniless ; as a result of her poor health she lost custody of the boy when he was four , although sources differ as to whether she could have prevented this . Her second husband left her after 13 years of marriage ; Eddy said that he had promised to become her child 's legal guardian , but it is unclear whether he did , and Eddy lost contact with her son until he was in his thirties . ( Per the legal doctrine of coverture , women in the United States could not then be their own children 's guardians . ) 
 Her third husband , Asa Gilbert Eddy , died five years after they married ; she believed he had been killed by malicious animal magnetism . Six years later , when she was 67 and apparently in need of loyalty and affection , she legally adopted a 41 @-@ year @-@ old homeopath as her second son . 
 Eddy was by all accounts charismatic and able to inspire great loyalty , although Gillian Gill writes that she could also be irrational and unkind . According to Bryan Wilson , she exemplified the female charismatic leader , and was viewed as the head of the Christian Science church even after her death ; he wrote in 1961 that her name – Christian Scientists call her Mrs. Eddy or " our beloved Leader " – was still included in all articles published in the Christian Science journals . 
 It was in part because of her unusual personality that Christian Science flourished , despite the numerous disputes she initiated among her followers . " She was like a patch of colour in those gray communities , " McClure 's wrote , " She never laid aside her regal air ; never entered a room or left it like other people . " Mark Twain , a prominent critic of hers , described her in 1907 as " vain , untruthful [ and ] jealous , " but " [ i ] n several ways ... the most interesting woman that ever lived , and the most extraordinary . " 
 = = = Phineas Parkhurst Quimby = = = 
 Eddy tried every remedy for her ill health , including a three @-@ month stay at the Vail 's <unk> Institute in Hill , New Hampshire . She told the Boston Post in 1883 that , for the seven years prior to 1862 ( most of her second marriage ) , she had been effectively confined to her bed or room . 
 In 1861 Eddy heard of a healing method developed by Phineas Parkhurst Quimby , a former clockmaker in Portland , Maine . Self @-@ styled Dr. P. P. Quimby , a practitioner of the " Science of Health , " Quimby had become interested in healing after recovering suddenly from a condition he believed was consumption ( tuberculosis ) . After attending a lecture in Maine in 1837 by the French mesmerist Charles <unk> , Quimby began to practise mesmerism himself . Mesmerism was named after Franz Mesmer ( 1734 – 1815 ) , a German physician who argued for the existence of a fluid through which bodies could influence each other , a force he called animal magnetism . Quimby and an assistant , Lucius <unk> , traveled around Maine and New Brunswick giving demonstrations ; <unk> , in a trance , would offer mind readings and suggestions for cures . 
 Quimby abandoned mesmerism around 1847 when he realized that it was suggestion that was effecting the apparent cures . He came to the view that disease was a mental state . When Jesus healed a paralysed arm he had known , Quimby wrote , " that the arm was not the cause but the effect , and he addressed Himself to the intelligence , and applied His wisdom to the cause . " In so doing Jesus had relied upon Christ , a synonym for Truth , Science and God , a power that Quimby believed all human beings could access . Quimby referred to this idea , in February 1863 , as " Christian science , " a phrase he used only once in writing . He wrote : 
 By 1856 Quimby had 500 patients a year . He would sit next to them and explain that the disease was something their minds could control ; sometimes he would wet his hands and rub their heads , but it was the talking that helped them , he said , not the manipulation . Quimby began to write his thoughts down around 1859 – his work was published posthumously as The Quimby Manuscripts in 1921 – and was generous in allowing his patients to copy one of his essays , " Questions and Answers . " This became an issue , from 1883 onwards , when Eddy was accused of having based Christian Science on his work . 
 = = = Eddy as Quimby 's patient = = = 
 When Eddy first met Quimby in Portland in October 1862 , she had to be helped up the stairs to his consulting rooms . She spoke highly of him the following month in a letter to the Portland Evening Courier : " This truth which he opposes to the error of giving intelligence to matter and placing pain where it never placed itself ... changes the currents of the system to their normal action ... " In a second letter she offered to supply quotations from Quimby 's " theory of Christ ( not Jesus ) . " Between then and May 1864 , Eddy returned to see Quimby several times , staying for weeks in Portland and visiting him daily . She wrote to him regularly , and composed a sonnet for him , " Mid light of science sits the sage profound . " 
 Eddy first used mental healing on a patient in March 1864 , when one of Quimby 's patients in Portland , Mary Ann Jarvis , suffered a relapse when she returned home to Warren , Maine . Eddy stayed with her for two months , giving Jarvis mental healing to ease a breathing problem , and writing to Quimby six times for absent treatment for herself . She called the latter " angel visits " ; in one of her letters to Quimby , she said that she had seen him in her room . In April she gave a public lecture in Warren , contrasting mental healing with Spiritualism , entitled : " P. P. Quimby 's Spiritual Science healing disease , as opposed to Deism or Rochester Rapping Spiritualism . " 
 = = = Fall in Lynn = = = 
 Quimby died on January 16 , 1866 , three months after Eddy 's father . Eddy wrote a poem on January 22 , " Lines on the Death of Dr. P. P. Quimby , Who Healed with the Truth that Christ Taught , in <unk> to All <unk> , " which was published in a local newspaper . Two weeks later , on February 1 , she slipped on ice in Lynn , Massachusetts , injuring her head and neck : 
 Christian Scientists call this " the fall in Lynn , " and see it as the birth of their religion . Decades later Eddy wrote that , on the third day after the fall , she had been helped by reading a certain Bible passage . In several editions of Science and Health she identified it as Mark 3 , but later said that it had been Matthew 9 : 2 @-@ 8 , a passage about Jesus healing the paralytic at Capernaum : " As I read , the healing Truth dawned upon my sense ; and the result was that I rose , dressed myself , and ever after was in better health than I had before enjoyed . " The physician who treated her at the time , Alvin M. Cushing , swore in an affidavit in 1907 that the injury had not been a serious one , and that Eddy had responded to morphine and a homeopathic remedy ; she had not said anything to him about a miraculous healing . 
 The fall in Lynn in 1866 was one of several experiences Eddy associated with the development of mental healing . In the first edition of Science and Health ( 1875 ) , she wrote that she had " made our first discovery that science mentally applied would heal the sick " in 1864 , while she was seeing Quimby , and in 1883 told the Boston Post that she had " laid the foundations of mental healing " in 1853 , when she was practising homeopathy . Elsewhere in the first edition of Science and Health she attributed the discovery to her difficulties with chronic indigestion as a child . In other editions she attributes the same difficulties to someone else . Eddy first linked the fall in Lynn to Christian Science in 1871 , in a letter to a prospective student : 
 Whether Eddy considered herself healed at the time is unclear . Two weeks after the fall she requested treatment from another patient of Quimby 's , Julius Dresser . In June that year the Mayor of Lynn told the city Eddy had sent them a letter " in which she states that owing to the unsafe condition of [ the streets ] ... she slipped and fell , causing serious personal injuries , from which she has little prospect of recovering , and asking for pecuniary recompense for the injuries received . " In February 1867 Eddy and her husband , Daniel Patterson , a dentist , filed a lawsuit against the city to recover damages .

 In March 1866 , a month after the fall , Eddy and her husband ( then married for 13 years ) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn . At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted , unable to pay the $ 1 @.@ 50 weekly rent . He appears to have returned briefly – they moved to a boarding house in July , and in August he paid Dr. Cushing 's bill from the fall – but the marriage was over . He sent her $ 200 a year for a time , and they divorced in 1873 . 
 Her first student was Hiram Crafts , a shoe worker in whose house she stayed , who advertised for patients himself in May 1867 , offering a cure for " Consumption , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Rheumatism . " Eddy asked Crafts to set up a practice with her , but the plan came to nothing . In addition to teaching , Eddy had started to write ; toward the end of 1866 she began work on an allegorical interpretation of Genesis , intended as the first volume of a book ( never published ) , The Bible in its Spiritual Meaning . 
 In the summer of 1868 , while lodging with Spiritualist Sarah Bagley in Amesbury , Eddy advertised for students in a Spiritualist magazine , the Banner of Light , as Mary B. Glover ( her first husband 's surname ) . The ad promised a " principle of science " that would heal with " [ n ] o medicine , electricity , physiology or hygiene required for unparalleled success in the most difficult cases . " Sally Wentworth , another Spiritualist , offered Eddy $ 300 @-@ worth of bed and board in Stoughton if Eddy would treat her daughter 's lung condition and teach Wentworth the healing method . Eddy stayed there for two years , from 1868 to 1870 , teaching Wentworth with Quimby 's unpublished essay , " Questions and Answers . " She acknowledged that the manuscript was Quimby 's , and spoke often of how she had promised to teach his healing method , which at the time she called Moral Science . 
 = = = Moral Science practice in Lynn = = = 
 Eddy was asked to leave the Wentworths ' in early 1870 . They fell out over several issues , including her request that they pay a printer $ 600 to publish her Genesis manuscript , which apparently ran to over 100 @,@ 000 words . 
 She returned to Amesbury to stay with Sally Bagley , where she resumed contact with Richard Kennedy . Kennedy had been a fellow lodger two years earlier when he was working in a box factory , and had become one of her earliest students . She now asked him to join her in opening a Moral Science practice in Lynn ; he would see patients and she would teach . He agreed to pay her $ 1 @,@ 000 for the previous two years ' tuition . Kennedy rented rooms in Lynn in June 1870 , and placed a sign in the yard , " Dr. Kennedy " ; he was 21 and Eddy 49 . The practice became popular . McClure 's wrote that people would say : " Go to Dr. Kennedy . He can 't hurt you , even if he doesn 't help you . " 
 Lynn was a center of the shoe industry and most of Eddy 's students were factory workers or artisans . She charged $ 100 , raised a few weeks later to $ 300 , for a three @-@ week course of 12 lessons ( reduced in 1888 to seven ) . Eddy based the lessons on a revised version of Quimby 's " Questions and Answers " manuscript , now called " The Science of Man , by which the sick are healed , Embracing Questions and Answers in Moral Science , " and on three shorter manuscripts , " The Soul 's Inquiry of Man , " " Spiritualism " and " Individuality , " which she had written for her classes . " Questions and Answers " began : " What is God ? " The answer : " Principle , wisdom , love , and truth . " Two books on mental healing appeared around that time that may have influenced Eddy 's thinking : The Mental Cure ( 1869 ) and Mental Medicine ( 1872 ) , both by Warren Felt Evans , another former patient of Quimby 's . 
 Eddy allowed her students to make copies of the manuscripts , but they were forbidden , under a $ 3 @,@ 000 bond , from showing them to anyone . The students agreed to pay Eddy 10 percent annually of income derived from her work , and $ 1 @,@ 000 if they failed to practice or teach it . She at first taught them to rub patients ' heads , to " lay [ their ] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever " ; Kennedy would manipulate each student 's head and solar plexus before class in preparation . The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down , and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either . Eventually Eddy told them to ignore that part of the manuscript , and from then on Christian Science healing did not involve touching patients . 
 In 1879 Eddy sued two of the students ( unsuccessfully ) for royalties from their practices . They testified that she had claimed she no longer needed to eat and had seen the dead raised . Eddy told the judge she meant she had " seen the dead in understanding raised . " 
 = = = Mary B. Glover 's Christian Scientists ' Home = = = 
 Kennedy decided toward the end of 1871 to end his business partnership with Eddy . She had accused him in front of others of cheating at cards ; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her . There was a temporary reconciliation , but he was unhappy about the abandonment of head rubbing , and after a dispute between Eddy and a student over a refund was played out in the local press , he decided to go his own way . 
 Once Kennedy and Eddy had settled their financial affairs in May 1872 , she was left with $ 6 @,@ 000 . Peel writes that at this point she had already written 60 pages of Science and Health . She was renting rooms in Lynn at 9 Broad Street , when 8 Broad Street came on the market . In March 1875 she purchased it for $ 5 @,@ 650 , taking in students to pay the mortgage . It was in the attic room of this house that she completed Science and Health . 
 Shortly after moving in , Eddy became close to another student , Daniel Spofford . He was 33 years old and married when he joined her class ; he later left his wife in the hope that he might marry Eddy , but his feelings were not reciprocated . Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week if she would preach to them every Sunday . They called themselves the Christian Scientists ' Association . 
 Eddy placed a sign on 8 Broad Street , Mary B. Glover 's Christian Scientists ' Home . According to McClure 's , there was a regular turnover of tenants and domestic staff , whom Eddy accused of stealing from the house ; she blamed Richard Kennedy for using mesmerism to turn people against her . According to Peel , there was gossip about the attractive woman , the men who came and went , and whether she was engaged in witchcraft . She was hurt , he wrote , but made light of it : " Of course I believe in free love ; I love everyone . "

 = = = = Publication = = = = 
 Eddy copyrighted her book , then called The Science of Life , in July 1874 . Three of her students , George Barry , Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford , paid a Boston printer , W. F. Brown and Company , $ 2 @,@ 200 to produce the first edition . The printer began work in September 1874 , but stopped whenever the advance payment ran out , so progress was slow . The book – Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover , with eight chapters and 456 pages – finally appeared on October 30 , 1875 , published in the name of the Christian Science Publishing Company . 
 The book was positively received by Amos Bronson Alcott , who in 1876 wrote to Eddy that she had " reaffirm [ ed ] in modern phrase the Christian revelations , " and that he was pleased it had been written by a woman . The printer 's proofreading had been poor . Martin Gardner called the first edition a " chaotic patchwork of repetitious , poorly <unk> topics , " with spelling , punctuation and grammatical mistakes . 
 Eddy changed printers for the second edition , which was also poorly proofread , and for the third edition in 1881 switched again , this time to John Wilson & Sons , University Press , Cambridge , MA . John Wilson and his successor , William Dana <unk> , continued to print the book until after Eddy 's death . To the 6th edition in 1883 , Eddy added with a Key to the Scriptures ( later retitled with Key to the Scriptures ) , a 20 @-@ page glossary containing her definitions of biblical terms . The book sold 15 @,@ 000 copies between 1875 and 1885 . 
 In August 1885 , on the advice of John Wilson , she hired one of his <unk> , the Rev. James Henry Wiggin , as an editor and literary adviser . The issue of how much Wiggin contributed to Science and Health is controversial . A former Unitarian clergyman , he was the book 's editor from the 16th edition in 1886 until the 50th in 1891 – 22 editions appeared between 1886 and 1888 alone – and according to his literary executor , speaking after Wiggin 's death , said he had rewritten it . Robert Peel wrote that Wiggin had " toned up " Eddy 's style , but had not affected her thinking . In a letter to Wiggin in July 1886 , Eddy wrote : " Never change my meaning , only bring it out . " 
 Eddy continued to revise the book until her death in 1910 . In 1902 she added a chapter , " <unk> , " recounting healing testimonies from the Christian Science Journal and Christian Science Sentinel . There were over 400 editions ( the final ran to 18 chapters and 600 pages ) , seven of them major revisions , according to Gottschalk , and members were encouraged to buy them all . Other income derived from the sale of rings and brooches , pictures of Eddy , and in 1889 the Mary Baker Eddy souvenir spoon ; Eddy asked every Christian Scientist to buy at least one , or a dozen if they could afford to . When the copyright on Science and Health expired in 1971 , the church persuaded Congress to extend it to 2046 . The bill was supported by two of President Richard Nixon 's aides , Christian Scientists H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman . The law was overturned as unconstitutional in 1987 , after a challenge by United Christian Scientists , an independent group . By 2001 Science and Health had sold over nine million copies . 
 = = = = Sickness as error = = = = 
 Science and Health expanded on Eddy 's view that sickness was a mental error . People said that simply reading Science and Health had healed them ; cures were claimed for everything from cancer to blindness . Eddy wrote in the New York Sun in December 1898 , in an article called " To the Christian World , " that she had personally healed tuberculosis , diphtheria and " at one visit a cancer that had eaten the flesh of the neck and exposed the jugular vein so that it stood out like a cord . I have physically restored sight to the blind , hearing to the deaf , speech to the dumb , and have made the lame walk . " Eddy wrote that her views had derived , in part , from having witnessed the apparent recovery of patients she had treated with homeopathic remedies so diluted they were drinking plain water . She concluded that Divine Mind was the healer : 
 She argued that even naming and reading about disease could turn thoughts into physical symptoms , and that the recording of ages might reduce the human lifespan . To explain how individuals could be harmed by poison without holding beliefs about it , she referred to the power of majority opinion . Eddy allowed exceptions from Christian Science prayer , including for dentistry , optometry and broken limbs ; she said she had healed broken bones using " mental surgery , " but that this skill would be the last to be learned . But for the most part ( then and now ) , Christian Scientists believe that medicine and Christian Science are incompatible . Medicine asserts that something needs to be fixed , while Christian Science asserts that spiritual reality is perfect and beliefs to the contrary need to be corrected . 
 In the 1890s Richard Cabot of Harvard Medical School studied the healing testimonies published by the Christian Science Journal , which Eddy founded in 1883 , for his senior thesis . He wrote in McClure 's in 1908 that the claims were based on self @-@ diagnosis or secondhand reports from doctors , and attributed them to the placebo effect . In 1900 medical lecturer William <unk> called the beneficiaries " hysterical patients ... the victims of obscure nervous ailments . " 
 Rodney Stark writes that a key to Christian Science 's appeal at the time was that its success rate compared favorably with that of physicians , particularly when it came to women 's health . Most doctors had not been to medical school , there were no antibiotics , and surgical practices were poor . By comparison the placebo effect ( being treated at all , no matter what the treatment was ) worked well . Stark argues that the " very elaborate and intensely psychological Christian Science ' treatments ' maximize such effects , while having the advantage of not causing further harm . " 
 = = = Malicious animal magnetism = = = 
 In January 1877 Eddy spurned an approach from Daniel Spofford , and to everyone 's surprise married another of her students , Asa Gilbert Eddy . Eddy already believed that her former student and business partner Richard Kennedy was plotting against her . Weeks after the wedding Spofford was suspected too . She had hinted in October 1876 that he might be a successor , but instead he was expelled from the Christian Scientists ' Association for " immorality " after quarrelling with her over money . She filed lawsuits against him and others for royalties or unpaid tuition fees . McClure 's wrote that Eddy required " absolute and unquestioning conformity " from her students . 
 The conviction that she was at the center of plots and counter @-@ plots became a feature of Eddy 's life . She believed that several students were using what she called " malicious animal magnetism , " or evil thought , against her . ( She also referred to it as An . Mag . , Mes . , <unk> , <unk> , mesmerism , malicious mesmerism , animal magnetism , mental malpractice , malicious malpractice , and mental influence . ) 
 Wilson writes that the concept of malicious animal magnetism was an important one in Christian Science . In 1881 Eddy added a 46 @-@ page chapter on it , " <unk> , " to Science and Health . From the 16th edition in 1886 , when James Henry Wiggin became the book 's editor , the chapter was reduced and renamed , and in the final edition is a seven @-@ page chapter called " Animal Magnetism Unmasked " . Eddy spoke openly about it , including to the press . When her husband died in 1882 she told the Boston Globe that malicious animal magnetism had killed him . 
 While Eddy argued that reality was entirely spiritual ( and therefore entirely good ) , it remained true that human beings were affected by their belief in evil , which meant it had power , even if the power was an illusion . Evil was " like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted , " writes Wilson . To defend herself against it , Eddy organized " watches , " during which students ( known as mental or metaphysical workers ) would give " adverse treatment " to her enemies . This was called " taking up the enemy in thought . " According to former students , Eddy would tell them to say ( often with Richard Kennedy in mind ) : " You are affected as you wish to affect me . Your evil thought reacts upon you , " then call Kennedy bilious , consumptive or poisoned by arsenic . 
 Eddy set up what she called a secret society of her students ( known as the P. M. , or private meeting ) to deal with malicious animal magnetism , but said that the group only met twice . In her later years , Wilson writes , Eddy concluded that individuals ought not to be " taken up in thought , " and came to see animal magnetism as an impersonal force . From 1890 she felt that her students were focusing on it too much , and thereafter public discussion of malicious animal magnetism declined , although Gottschalk adds that it continued to play an important role in the teaching of Christian Science . Adam H. Dickey , Eddy 's private secretary for the last three years of her life , wrote that hour @-@ long watches were held in her home three times a day to protect her against it . The Manual of the Mother Church forbids members from practising it , and requires that Christian Science teachers instruct students " how to defend themselves against mental malpractice , and never to return evil for evil . " 
 = = = Witchcraft trial , conspiracy charge = = = 
 In May 1878 Eddy brought a case against Daniel Spofford , in Salem , Massachusetts , for practicing mesmerism . It came to be known as the second Salem witchcraft trial . The case was filed in the name of one of Spofford 's patients , Lucretia Brown , who said that he had bewitched her , though Eddy appeared in court on Brown 's behalf . In preparation for the hearing , Eddy organized a 24 @-@ hour watch at 8 Broad Street , during which she asked 12 students to think about Spofford for two hours each and block malicious mesmerism from him . She arrived at the court with 20 supporters , including Amos Bronson Alcott ( a " cloud of witnesses , " according to the Boston Globe ) , but Judge Horace Gray dismissed the case . 
 The attempt to have Spofford tried was not the end of the dispute . In October 1878 Eddy 's husband and another student , Edward Arens , were charged with conspiring to murder Spofford . A barman said they had offered him $ 500 to do it ; after a complex series of claims and counter @-@ claims , the charges were dropped when a witness retracted his statement . Eddy attributed the allegation to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of Science and Health , just published . Her lawyer had to apply for an attachment order against her house to collect his fee .

 On August 23 , 1879 , 26 members of the Christian Scientists ' Association were granted a charter to form the Church of Christ ( Scientist ) . Services were held in people 's homes in Lynn and later in Hawthorne Hall , Boston . On January 31 , 1881 , Eddy was granted a charter to form the Massachusetts Metaphysical College to teach " pathology , ontology , therapeutics , moral science , metaphysics , and their application to the treatment of disease . " The college lived wherever Eddy did ; a new sign appeared on 8 Broad Street . 
 In October 1881 there was a revolt . Eight church members resigned , signing a document complaining of Eddy 's " frequent <unk> of temper , love of money , and the appearance of hypocrisy . " Only a few students remained , including Calvin Frye , who became Eddy 's most loyal personal assistant . They appointed Eddy pastor of the church in November 1881 , and drew up a resolution in February 1882 that she was " the chosen messenger of God to the nations . " 
 Despite the support , the resignations ended Eddy 's time in Lynn . The church was struggling and her reputation had been damaged by the disputes . By now 61 years old , she decided to move to Boston , and in early 1882 rented a house at 569 Columbus Avenue , a silver plaque announcing the arrival of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College . The college 's prospectus , published in 1884 , offered three diplomas : Christian Scientist ( C.S. ) for Christian Scientists ' Association members ; Christian <unk> ( C.M. ) for Eddy 's 12 @-@ lesson course and three years ' practice ; and Doctor of Christian Science ( <unk> ) for <unk> whose " life and character conform to Divine science . " Students could study metaphysics , science of the scriptures , mental healing and obstetrics , using two textbooks , Science and Health and the Bible . Between 1881 and October 1889 , when Eddy closed the college , 4 @,@ 000 students took the course at $ 300 per person or married couple , making her a rich woman . Mark Twain wrote that she had turned a sawdust mine ( possibly Quimby 's ) into a Klondike . 
 = = = Death of Asa Gilbert Eddy = = = 
 Eddy 's husband , Asa Gilbert Eddy , died of heart disease on June 4 , 1882 , shortly after the move to Boston . She invited the Boston Globe to her home on the day of his death to allege that he had been killed by malicious animal magnetism , courtesy of " certain parties here in Boston , who had sworn to injure them . " The Globe wrote : 
 A doctor performed an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband 's diseased heart , but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism . Fraser wrote that the articles made Eddy a household name , a real @-@ life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James 's The Bostonians ( 1885 – 1886 ) , with her interest in spiritualism , women 's rights and the mind cure . Shortly after the death , Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students . The following year , 1883 , she founded the Journal of Christian Science ( later called the Christian Science Journal ) , which spread news of her ideas across the United States .

 In 1885 Eddy was accused of promoting Spiritualism and pantheism by the Reverend <unk> J. Gordon , in a letter read out by Joseph Cook during one of his popular Monday lectures at Tremont Temple in Boston . She demanded a right of reply , and on March 16 , 1885 , she told the congregation that she was not a Spiritualist , and that she believed in God as the Supreme Being and in the atonement . She described Christian Science healing as " Christ come to destroy the power of the flesh . " Stephen Gottschalk wrote that the occasion marked the " emergence of Christian Science into American religious life . " 
 The first church building was erected in 1886 in Oconto , Wisconsin , by local women who believed Christian Science had helped them . For a down payment of $ 2 @,@ 000 and a mortgage of $ 8 @,@ 763 , the church purchased land in Falmouth Street , Boston , for the erection of a building . Eddy asked Augusta Stetson , a prominent Scientist , to establish a church in New York . By the end of 1886 Christian Science teaching institutes had sprung up around the United States . 
 In December 1887 Eddy moved to a $ 40 @,@ 000 , 20 @-@ room house at 385 Commonwealth Avenue , Boston . She had been teaching four to six classes a year , and by 1889 had probably made at least $ 100 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 634 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . By 1890 the Church of Christ ( Scientist ) had 8 @,@ 724 members in the United States , having started 11 years earlier with just 26 . 
 = = = Eddy 's debt to Quimby = = = 
 Eddy 's debt to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby became the " single most controversial issue " of her life , according to Gillian Gill . Quimby was not the only source Eddy stood accused of having copied ; Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore , Bryan Wilson , Charles S. Braden and Martin Gardner identified several texts she had used without attribution . For example , an open letter from Eddy to the church , dated September 1895 and published in Eddy 's Miscellaneous Writings 1883 – 1896 ( 1897 ) , is almost identical to Hugh Blair 's essay " The Man of Integrity , " published in Lindley Murray 's The English Reader ( 1799 ) . 
 Eddy acknowledged Quimby 's influence in her early years . When a prospective student asked in 1871 whether her methods had been used before , she replied : 
 Later she drew a distinction between their methods , arguing that Quimby 's involved one mind healing another , while hers depended on a connection with Divine Mind . In February 1883 Julius Dresser , a former patient of Quimby 's , accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby 's work as her own . In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853 , nine years before she met him . She wrote later : " We caught some of his thoughts , and he caught some of ours ; and both of us were pleased to say this to each other . " 
 The issue went to court in September 1883 , when Eddy complained that her student Edward Arens had copied parts of Science and Health in a pamphlet , and Arens counter @-@ claimed that Eddy had copied it from Quimby in the first place . Quimby 's son was so unwilling to produce his father 's manuscripts that he sent them out of the country ( perhaps fearing litigation with Eddy or that someone would tamper with them ) , and Eddy won the case . Things were stirred up further by Eddy 's pamphlet Historical Sketch of Metaphysical Healing ( 1885 ) , in which she again called Quimby a mesmerist , and by the publication of Julius Dresser 's The True History of Mental Healing ( 1887 ) . 
 The charge that Christian Science came from Quimby , not divine revelation , stemmed in part from Eddy 's use of Quimby 's manuscript ( right ) when teaching Sally Wentworth and others in 1868 – 1870 . Eddy said she had helped to fix Quimby 's unpublished work , and now stood accused of having copied her own corrections . Against this , Lyman P. Powell , one of Eddy 's biographers , wrote in 1907 that Quimby 's son held an almost identical copy , in Quimby 's wife 's handwriting , of the Quimby manuscript that Eddy had used when teaching Sally Wentworth . It was dated February 1862 , eight months before Eddy met Quimby . 
 In July 1904 the New York Times obtained a copy of the Quimby manuscript from Sally Wentworth 's son , and juxtaposed passages with Science and Health to highlight the similarities . It also published Eddy 's handwritten notes on Quimby 's manuscript to show what the newspaper alleged was the transition from his words to hers . Quimby 's manuscripts were published in 1921 . Eddy 's biographers continued to disagree about his influence on Eddy . Bates and Dittemore , the latter a former director of the Christian Science church , argued in 1932 that " as far as the thought is concerned , Science and Health is practically all Quimby , " except for malicious animal mesmerism . Robert Peel , who also worked for the church , wrote in 1966 that Eddy may have influenced Quimby as much as he influenced her . Gardner argued in 1993 that Eddy had taken " huge chunks " from Quimby , and Gill in 1998 that there were only general similarities . 
 = = = First prosecutions = = = 
 In 1887 Eddy started teaching a " metaphysical obstetrics " course , two one @-@ week classes . She had started calling herself " Professor of Obstetrics " in 1882 ; McClure 's wrote : " Hundreds of Mrs. Eddy 's students were then practising who knew no more about obstetrics than the babes they helped into this world . " The first prosecutions took place that year , when practitioners were charged with practicing medicine without a licence . All were acquitted during the trial , or convictions were overturned on appeal . 
 The first manslaughter charge was in March 1888 , when Abby H. Corner , a practitioner in Medford , Massachusetts , attended to her daughter during childbirth ; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive . The defense argued that they might have died even with medical attention , and Corner was acquitted . To the dismay of the Christian Scientists ' Association ( the secretary resigned ) , Eddy distanced herself from Corner , telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class . 
 From then until the 1990s around 50 parents and practitioners were prosecuted , and often acquitted , after adults and children died without medical care ; charges ranged from neglect to second @-@ degree murder . The American Medical Association ( AMA ) declared war on Christian Scientists ; in 1895 its journal called Christian Science and similar ideas " <unk> to infants , and pestilential perils to communities in spreading contagious diseases . " Juries were nevertheless reluctant to convict when defendants believed they were helping the patient . There was also opposition to the AMA 's effort to strengthen medical licensing laws . Historian Shawn Peters writes that , in the courts and public debate , Christian Scientists and Jehovah 's Witnesses linked their healing claims to early Christianity to gain support from other Christians . 
 Vaccination was another battleground . A Christian Scientist in Wisconsin won a case in 1897 that allowed his son to attend public school despite not being vaccinated against smallpox . Others were arrested in 1899 for avoiding vaccination during a smallpox epidemic in Georgia . In 1900 Eddy advised adherents to obey the law , " and then appeal to the gospel to save ... [ themselves ] from any bad results . " In October 1902 , after seven @-@ year @-@ old Esther Quimby , the daughter of Christian Scientists , died of diphtheria in White Plains , New York ( she had received no medical care and had not been quarantined ) , the authorities pursued manslaughter charges . The controversy prompted Eddy to declare that " until public thought becomes better acquainted with Christian Science , the Christian Scientists shall decline to doctor infectious or contagious diseases , " and from that time the church required Christian Scientists to report contagious diseases to health boards . 
 = = = Building the Mother Church = = = 
 In 1888 Eddy became close to another of her students , Ebenezer Johnson Foster , a homeopath and graduate of the Hahnemann Medical College . He was 41 and she was 67 , but apparently in need of affection and loyalty she adopted him legally in November that year , and he changed his name to Ebenezer Johnson Foster Eddy . 
 A year later , in October 1889 , Eddy closed the Massachusetts Metaphysical College ; according to Bates and Dittemore , the state attorney was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students . She also foreclosed the mortgage on the land in Boston the church had purchased , then purchased it herself for $ 5 @,@ 000 through a middle man , though it was worth considerably more . She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church ; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her . The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association . Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five @-@ person board of directors that answered only to her , which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death . 
 The cornerstone of The First Church of Christ , Scientist , containing the Bible , Eddy 's writings and a list of directors and financial contributors , was laid in May 1894 in the Back Bay area of Boston . Church members raised funds for the construction , and the building was finished in December 1894 at a cost of $ 250 @,@ 000 . It contained a " Mother 's Room " in the tower for Eddy 's personal use , furnished with rare books , silks , tapestries , rugs , a dressing gown and slippers , though she spent only one night there and it was later turned into a storage room . The archway into the room was made of Italian marble , and the word Mother was engraved on the floor . 
 Within two years the Boston membership had exceeded the original church 's capacity . By 1903 the block around the church had been purchased by Christian Scientists , and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension , accommodating 5 @,@ 000 people , was completed at a cost of $ 2 million . This attracted the criticism that , whereas Christian Scientists spent money on a magnificent church , they maintained no hospitals , orphanages or missions in the slums . 
 Christian Science went on to become the fastest @-@ growing American religion in the early 20th century . The federal religious census recorded 85 @,@ 717 Christian Scientists in 1906 ; 30 years later it was 268 @,@ 915 . In 1890 there were seven Christian Science churches in the United States , a figure that had risen to 1 @,@ 104 by 1910 . Churches began to appear in other countries too : 58 in England , 38 in Canada and 28 elsewhere by 1910 . 
 = = = View of Mark Twain = = = 
 Mark Twain was a prominent contemporaneous critic of Eddy 's . His first article about Christian Science was published in Cosmopolitan in October 1899 . Another three appeared in 1902 – 1903 in North American Review , then a book , Christian Science ( 1907 ) . He also wrote " The Secret History of <unk> , the World Empire " ( 1901 – 1902 ) , in which Christian Science replaces Christianity and Eddy becomes the Pope . 
 Twain described Eddy as " [ g ] rasping , sordid , <unk> , <unk> for everything she sees – money , power , glory – vain , untruthful , jealous , despotic , arrogant , insolent , pitiless where thinkers and <unk> are concerned , illiterate , shallow , incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines , immeasurably selfish . " 
 Science and Health he called " strange and frantic and incomprehensible and <unk> , " and argued that Eddy had not written it herself . " There is nothing in Christian Science that is not explicable , " he wrote , " for God is one , Time is one , Individuality is one , and may be one of a series , one of many , as an individual man , individual horse ; whereas God is one , not one of a series , but one alone and without an equal . " Eddy apart , Twain felt ambivalent toward mind @-@ cure , arguing that " the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful . " His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it , Awake to a Perfect Day ( 1956 ) . 
 = = = McClure 's articles = = = 
 The first history of Christian Science appeared in McClure 's magazine in 14 installments from January 1907 to June 1908 , preceded by an editorial in December 1906 . The essence of the articles , which included court documents and affidavits from Eddy 's associates , was that Eddy 's chief concern was money , and that she had derived Christian Science from Quimby . The material was also published as a book , The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science ( 1909 ) . It became the key source for most non @-@ church histories of the religion . The editor @-@ in @-@ chief assigned five writers to work on the series , including the novelist Willa Cather as the principal author . The book was kept out of print from early in its life by the Christian Science church , which bought the original manuscript . It was republished in 1971 by Baker Book House when its copyright expired , and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press . 
 = = = Next Friends suit , Eddy 's death = = = 
 In March 1907 several of Eddy 's relatives filed an unsuccessful lawsuit , the " Next Friends suit , " against members of Eddy 's household , alleging that she was unable to manage her own affairs . Calvin Frye , her long @-@ time personal assistant , was a particular target of the allegations . The New York World 's front @-@ page story in October 1906 , headline " Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy Dying ; Footman and Dummy Control Her , " said that Eddy was housebound and dying of cancer , that her staff had taken control of her fortune , and that another woman was impersonating her in public . 
 The newspaper persuaded Eddy 's family ( or " next friends " ) to file a lawsuit . Several joined the action , including Eddy 's biological son , George Glover , and adoptive son , Ebenezer J. Foster Eddy . Eddy was interviewed in her home in August 1907 by the judge and two psychiatrists , who concluded that she was mentally competent . In response to the McClure 's and New York World stories , Eddy asked the church in July 1908 to found the Christian Science Monitor as a platform for responsible journalism . It appeared in November that year , with the motto " To injure no man , but to bless all mankind , " and went on to win seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002 . 
 Eddy died two years later , on the evening of Saturday , December 3 , 1910 , aged 89 . The Mother Church announced at the end of the Sunday morning service that Eddy had " passed from our sight . " It said that " the time will come when there will be no more death , " but that Christian Scientists " do not look for [ Mrs. Eddy 's ] return in this world . " Her estate was valued at $ 1 @.@ 5 million , most of which she left to the church . 
 = = Decline = = 
 A census at the height of the religion 's popularity in 1936 counted c . 268 @,@ 915 Christian Scientists in the United States ( 2 @,@ 098 per million ) . The movement has been in decline since then . The church has sold buildings to free up funds . It closed 23 of its churches in Los Angeles between 1960 and 1995 . In 2004 it sold the First Church of Christ , Scientist , Manhattan , to the Crenshaw Christian Center for $ 14 million . ( The building was sold again in 2014 to be converted into condominiums . ) 
 There were an estimated 106 @,@ 000 Scientists in the United States in 1990 ( 427 per million ) , according to Rodney Stark . In 2009 the church said that for the first time more new members had been admitted from Africa than from the United States , although it offered no numbers . 
 The Manual of the Mother Church prohibits the church from publishing membership figures , but it does provide the names of Christian Science practitioners , Scientists trained to offer Christian Science prayer on behalf of others . In 1941 there were 11 @,@ 200 practitioners in the United States , against 965 in 2015 ( 1 @,@ 249 worldwide ) . Stark writes that clusters of practitioners listed in the Christian Science Journal in 1998 were living in the same retirement communities . 
 Stark attributes the rise of the movement in the late @-@ 19th and early @-@ 20th centuries to several factors , chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy . Because patients often fared better without medical treatment , Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison . Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms , despite the new content Eddy introduced . It was not puritanical . Members were expected not to drink or smoke , but could otherwise do as they pleased , and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted . 
 In 1906 72 percent of Christian Scientists in the United States were female , against 49 percent of the population . The church was attractive to women because it offered professional opportunities when it was difficult for women to find work outside the home . As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons . Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal , 12 were women . 
 The increased efficacy of medicine around World War II heralded the religion 's decline . Stark charts the use of sulfonamide to kill bacteria , the availability of penicillin in the 1940s and breakthroughs in immunology . Other factors were increased career opportunities for women , and that much of the membership was elderly . In 1998 30 percent of Christian Scientists were over 65 . Eddy was in her sixties by the time the movement began to spread . Stark writes that the " characteristics of the earliest members of a movement will tend to be reproduced in subsequent converts . " A significant percentage of Scientists remained single ( Eddy placed little emphasis on marriage and family ) , or became Scientists when their children were adults and unlikely to be converted . Christian Science did not have missionaries , so it relied on internal growth , but the conversion rate within families was not high . In a study cited by Stark , of 80 people raised within Christian Science just 26 ( 33 percent ) became Scientists themselves . 
 = = Healing practices = = 
 = = = Christian Science prayer = = = 
 Christian Scientists avoid almost all medical treatment , relying instead on Christian Science prayer . Christian Science prayer consists of silently arguing with oneself . There are no appeals to a personal god , and no set words . Caroline Fraser wrote in 1999 that the practitioner might repeat to herself , " the <unk> of God using Eddy 's seven synonyms – Life , Truth , Love , Spirit , Soul , Principle and Mind , " then that " Spirit , Substance , is the only Mind , and man is its image and likeness ; that Mind is intelligence ; that Spirit is substance ; that Love is wholeness ; that Life , Truth , and Love are the only reality . " She might deny other religions , the existence of evil , mesmerism , astrology , numerology and the symptoms of whatever the illness is . She concludes , Fraser writes , by asserting that disease is a lie , that this is the word of God and that it has the power to heal . 
 Christian Science practitioners are certified by the Church of Christ , Scientist , to charge a fee for Christian Science prayer . There were 1 @,@ 249 practitioners worldwide in 2015 ; in the United States in 2010 they charged $ 25 – $ 50 for an e @-@ mail , telephone or face @-@ to @-@ face consultation . Their training is a two @-@ week , 12 @-@ lesson course called primary class , based on the Recapitulation chapter of Science and Health . Practitioners wanting to teach primary class take a six @-@ day " normal class , " held in Boston once every three years , to become Christian Science teachers . There are also Christian Science nursing homes . They offer no medical services ; the nurses are Christian Scientists who have completed a course of religious study and training in basic skills , such as feeding and bathing . 
 = = = Testimonials = = = 
 The Christian Science Journal and Christian Science Sentinel publish anecdotal healing " testimonials , " which must be accompanied by statements from three <unk> : " people who know [ the <unk> ] well and have either witnessed the healing or can vouch for [ the <unk> 's ] integrity in sharing it . " Philosopher Margaret P. Battin writes that the seriousness with which these are treated by Christian Scientists ignores factors such as false positives caused by self @-@ limiting conditions . Because no negative accounts are published , the testimonials strengthen people 's tendency to rely on anecdotes . 
 The church published 53 @,@ 900 such accounts between 1900 and April 1989 . A church study , published in 1989 , examined 10 @,@ 000 of them , 2 @,@ 337 of which the church said involved conditions that had been medically diagnosed , and 623 of which were " medically confirmed by follow @-@ up examinations . " The report offered no evidence of the medical follow @-@ up . The Massachusetts Committee for Children and Youth listed among the report 's flaws that it had failed to compare the rates of successful and unsuccessful Christian Science treatment . 
 = = = Religious exemptions = = = 
 The main criticism Christian Scientists face is that their children are denied equal protection under the law . Sick and disabled children have been told the only thing wrong with them is " incorrect " thinking , and practitioners have told parents that the parents ' thoughts can harm their children . The church maintains that members are free to choose medical care , but several have said they fear ostracism . The American Academy of Pediatrics regards failure to seek medical care for children as " child neglect , regardless of the motivation . " 
 In the United States the Christian Science church has persuaded federal and local government to create and maintain religious @-@ exemption statutes , using the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment . The Free Exercise Clause ( italicized ) reads : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .... " Many of the exemptions say that in life @-@ threatening situations children must have access to medical care , but without early access the seriousness of an illness may not be recognized , in part because Christian Scientists are encouraged not to educate themselves about physical ailments . 
 After the conviction for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five @-@ year @-@ old Lisa Sheridan , who died without medical care in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , the church lobbied the United States Department of Health , Education , and Welfare ( HEW ) to add a religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations . Added in 1974 , this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent . States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding ; the wording of the exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science . 
 Largely as a result of lobbying by Children 's Healthcare is a Legal Duty , the government eliminated the HEW regulation in 1983 , but 39 states , Guam and the District of Columbia still had religious exemptions in their civil codes on child abuse and neglect as of February 2015 . Forty @-@ eight US states allowed religious exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015 . In Australia the church was the only group with a religious exemption for vaccination as of April 2015 ; the government said that it planned to remove it . 
 = = = Child deaths , prosecutions = = = 
 In over 50 cases between 1887 and the early 1990s , prosecutors charged Christian Scientists after adults and children died of treatable illnesses without medical care . The death in 1967 of five @-@ year @-@ old Lisa Sheridan of pneumonia , in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , was the first of several in the 20th century known within the church as the " child cases , " according to Fraser . Her mother was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years ' probation . It was after this prosecution that the church began lobbying for religious exemptions . 
 In 1977 16 @-@ month @-@ old Matthew Swan died of bacterial meningitis in Detroit , Michigan , after his parents were persuaded not to seek timely medical care ; they responded by founding Children 's Healthcare is a Legal Duty ( CHILD ) in 1983 . Between 1980 and 1990 seven Christian Scientist parents in the United States were prosecuted ; there were four convictions , two overturned . In 1988 12 @-@ year @-@ old Ashley King died in Phoenix , Arizona , after living for months with a tumor on her leg that had a 41 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) circumference ; her parents pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment . A prominent case in Massachusetts was Commonwealth v. Twitchell in 1990 , which saw the parents of two @-@ year @-@ old Robyn Twitchell convicted of involuntary manslaughter after he died of peritonitis . The conviction was overturned ; the appellate court ruled that the couple had " reasonably believed " they could rely on Christian Science prayer without being prosecuted . 
 The first time the church was held liable ( overturned on appeal ) was in 1993 after 11 @-@ year @-@ old Ian <unk> died of <unk> in Minnesota in 1989 . The church sent a Christian Science nurse to sit with him ; doctors testified that he could have been saved by an insulin injection up to two hours before his death . The mother and stepfather were charged with manslaughter , but the charges were dismissed . The boy 's father sued the mother , stepfather , practitioner , nurse , nursing home and church . He was awarded $ 5 @.@ 2 million compensatory damages , later reduced to $ 1 @.@ 5 million , and $ 9 million in punitive damages against the church . The Minnesota State Court of Appeals overturned the award against the church and nursing home in 1995 , finding that a judgment that forced the church to " abandon teaching its central tenet " was unconstitutional , and that , while the individuals had a duty of care toward the boy , the church and nursing home did not .

 In the hierarchy of the Church of Christ , Scientist , only the Mother Church in Boston , The First Church of Christ , Scientist , uses the definite article in its name . Otherwise the first Christian Science church in any city is called First Church of Christ , Scientist , then Second Church of Christ , Scientist , and so on , followed by the name of the city ( for example , Third Church of Christ , Scientist , London ) . When a church closes , the others in that city are not renamed . 
 Founded in April 1879 , the Church of Christ , Scientist is led by a president and five @-@ person board of directors . There is a public @-@ relations department , known as the Committee on Publication , with representatives around the world ; this was set up by Eddy in 1898 to protect her own and the church 's reputation . The church was accused in the 1990s of silencing internal criticism by firing staff , delisting practitioners and excommunicating members . 
 The church 's administration is headquartered on Christian Science Center on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Huntington Avenue , Boston . The 14 @.@ 5 @-@ acre site includes the Mother Church ( 1894 ) , Mother Church Extension ( 1906 ) , the Christian Science Publishing Society building ( 1934 ) – which houses the Mary Baker Eddy Library and the church 's administrative staff – the Sunday School building ( 1971 ) , and the Church Colonnade building ( 1972 ) . It also includes the 26 @-@ story Administration Building ( 1972 ) , designed by <unk> <unk> of I. M.

 Prohibitions include engaging in mental malpractice ; visiting a store that sells " obnoxious " books ; joining other churches ; publishing articles that are uncharitable toward religion , medicine , the courts or the law ; and publishing the number of church members . The manual also prohibits engaging in public debate about Christian Science without board approval , and learning hypnotism .

 The church faced internal dissent in 1991 over its decision to publish The Destiny of The Mother Church . Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp , former president of the Mother Church , the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament . Knapp and his family bequeathed $ 98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993 ; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms . One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church 's decision , and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned . In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization , and the bequest was split three ways .

 Mitchell Neil William " Mitch " McGary ( born June 6 , 1992 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . A native of Chesterton , Indiana , McGary declared for the NBA draft after completing his sophomore season for the 2013 – 14 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team . He was drafted 21st overall by the Thunder in the 2014 NBA draft . 
 At the time of his National Letter of Intent signing with Michigan Wolverines basketball , ESPN.com and Scout.com ranked McGary as the number two player in the United States high school class of 2012 , while Rivals.com ranked him as the number three prospect . He was not only the consensus top power forward recruit in the nation , but also the top big man according to most sources at the time . After his signing , however , McGary fell down in the rankings as his underdeveloped offensive skills became apparent . 
 At Michigan , McGary became the sixth man as well as the leading shot blocker and rebounder for the 2012 – 13 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team . During the season , he was twice named Big Ten Freshman of the Week .

 Mitch McGary was born on June 6 , 1992 , and grew up in the Chesterton , Indiana , area . He played in YMCA and Amateur Athletic Union ( AAU ) basketball leagues as a youth , and his father , Tim , who had never played organized sports , coached him until fourth grade . McGary 's mother is named Valerie . When McGary was younger , his father thought his athletic future was in baseball . McGary played on the 2007 – 08 Chesterton High School junior varsity team as a freshman , while eventual three @-@ time Michigan Wolverines captain Zack Novak was a senior on the varsity team . That year he also was a 6 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) , 190 @-@ pound ( 86 kg ) freshman tight end on the high school football team , but his father made him quit football as he continued to grow . His local Indiana <unk> Players AAU basketball team included future Michigan teammates Max Bielfeldt and Glenn Robinson III , son of Glenn Robinson . McGary joined the varsity basketball team the following season and played two years . McGary is afflicted with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . He eventually transferred to Brewster Academy , a prep school in Wolfeboro , New Hampshire , to repeat his junior year because his parents thought the discipline would be good for him . Before transferring to Brewster , McGary was the tallest kid in his school and in the basketball conference that he played in . McGary shoots left @-@ handed . 
 As late as March 2011 , McGary ranked 92nd in the national class of 2012 by Rivals.com. During the LeBron James Skills Academy in July , McGary stood out as the best player in attendance . He was invited to participate in the 5th annual Nike Global Challenge the following month . Due to an ankle injury he did not participate . However , later that month , he participated in the Boost Mobile Elite 24 event , where he shattered a backboard . His other 2011 summer camps included Pittsburgh Jam Fest , the National Basketball Players Association Top 100 camp and the Under Armour Best of the Best Camp , where he was the most valuable player . Also in August , ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six : University of Florida , University of Maryland , University of North Carolina , University of Michigan , Duke University and University of Kentucky . Because McGary does not like to be the bearer of bad news , when he narrowed his list , he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services . McGary scheduled his official Michigan visit for the beginning of September . McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan , University of North Carolina , and Duke University , in that order , by October 4 . However , due to injuries suffered a few weeks earlier while shattering the backboard , he only played pick @-@ up games at Duke . He also made an unofficial visit to Florida prior to these official visits . While Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander was recruiting him , a Brewster Academy groundskeeper relayed a story about McGary consoling a freshman who was in tears when his parents dropped him off on the first day of school . Alexander says the groundskeeper told him that " McGary spotted the kid from a distance , stopped his conversation and ran to him , consoled him and brought him into school with his group of friends . " Alexander said that McGary 's character made him a great fit for Michigan . 
 His reported best friend , Robinson had committed to Michigan on September 14 , 2010 . In a press conference broadcast on ESPNU on November 3 , 2011 , McGary announced his verbal commitment to Michigan over his other two finalist Florida and Duke . Within hours of the commitment , ESPN ranked Michigan 's recruiting class the fifth best in the nation . After several other schools announced their commitments , Michigan , which had been outside the top 25 at the end of October , ranked the number 7 class in the nation , according to ESPN . He waited until November 9 to sign his National Letter of Intent so that his parents , who were still living in Indiana , could be present . Both of his parents had liked head coach Mike Krzyzewski and had hoped that he would choose Duke . At the time of their November 2011 National Letter of Intent signings , Nik Stauskas , Robinson and McGary gave Michigan a consensus top 10 entering class for its 2012 class . 
 McGary was technically eligible for the 2012 NBA Draft . Brewster entered the 2012 NEPSAC Class AAA Boys ' Basketball Tournament undefeated and ranked number 1 in the nation according to the Five @-@ Star Basketball Rankings published in Sports Illustrated , but lost in the semifinals of the tournament to Northfield Mount Hermon School , who was led by future teammate Spike Albrecht , in overtime on March 2 . In the overtime period , McGary missed a game @-@ tying free throw with 17 @.@ 3 seconds remaining . His Brewster team defeated Massanutten Military Academy and Notre Dame Prep to reach the March 7 championship game in the National Prep Championship against Hargrave Military Academy . Brewster won the National Prep Championship Game . The 2011 – 12 Brewster team was reported to have eight future Division I basketball players , including Florida State commit Aaron Thomas , Xavier commit <unk> Christon , NC State commit T. J. Warren , and <unk> Sampson . <unk> Sampson earned both the 2012 National Prep Championship MVP and New England Preparatory School Athletic Council ( NEPSAC ) AAA Player of the Year , leaving McGary with a supporting role . 
 McGary was invited to participate in the four @-@ team All @-@ American Championship along with future teammate Robinson in New Orleans on April 1 , 2012 . Six days later , McGary represented USA Basketball at the 15th annual Nike Hoops Summit as part of the 2012 USA Junior National Select Team .

 = Johannes Kepler = 
 Johannes Kepler ( German : [ <unk> ] ; December 27 , 1571 – November 15 , 1630 ) was a German mathematician , astronomer , and astrologer . A key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution , he is best known for his laws of planetary motion , based on his works Astronomia nova , Harmonices Mundi , and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy . These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton 's theory of universal gravitation . 
 Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz , Austria , where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg . Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe , and eventually he was the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II . He was also a mathematics teacher in Linz , Austria , and an adviser to General Wallenstein . Additionally , he did fundamental work in the field of optics , invented an improved version of the refracting telescope ( the Keplerian telescope ) , and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei . 
 Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology , but there was a strong division between astronomy ( a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts ) and physics ( a branch of natural philosophy ) . Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work , motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason . Kepler described his new astronomy as " celestial physics " , as " an excursion into Aristotle 's Metaphysics " , and as " a supplement to Aristotle 's On the Heavens " , transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Kepler was born on December 27 , the feast day of St. John the Evangelist , 1571 , at the Free Imperial City of Weil der Stadt ( now part of the Stuttgart Region in the German state of Baden @-@ Württemberg , 30 km west of Stuttgart 's center ) . His grandfather , Sebald Kepler , had been Lord Mayor of that town but , by the time Johannes was born , he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline . His father , Heinrich Kepler , earned a precarious living as a mercenary , and he left the family when Johannes was five years old . He was believed to have died in the Eighty Years ' War in the Netherlands . His mother Katharina <unk> , an inn @-@ keeper 's daughter , was a healer and herbalist . Born prematurely , Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child . Nevertheless , he often impressed travelers at his grandfather 's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty . 
 He was introduced to astronomy at an early age , and developed a love for it that would span his entire life . At age six , he observed the Great Comet of 1577 , writing that he " was taken by [ his ] mother to a high place to look at it . " At age nine , he observed another astronomical event , a lunar eclipse in 1580 , recording that he remembered being " called outdoors " to see it and that the moon " appeared quite red " . However , childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands , limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy . 
 In 1589 , after moving through grammar school , Latin school , and seminary at <unk> , Kepler attended <unk> Stift at the University of Tübingen . There , he studied philosophy under Vitus Müller and theology under Jacob <unk> ( a student of Philipp Melanchthon at Wittenberg ) , who also taught Michael Maestlin while he was a student , until he became Chancellor at Tübingen in 1590 . He proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skillful astrologer , casting horoscopes for fellow students . Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin , Tübingen 's professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631 , he learned both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system of planetary motion . He became a Copernican at that time . In a student disputation , he defended heliocentrism from both a theoretical and theological perspective , maintaining that the Sun was the principal source of motive power in the universe . Despite his desire to become a minister , near the end of his studies Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz . He accepted the position in April 1594 , at the age of 23 .

 = = = Mysterium Cosmographicum = = = 
 Kepler 's first major astronomical work , Mysterium Cosmographicum ( The <unk> Mystery ) , was the first published defense of the Copernican system . Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19 , 1595 , while teaching in Graz , demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac : he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios , which , he reasoned , might be the geometrical basis of the universe . After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations ( even with extra planets added to the system ) , Kepler began experimenting with 3 @-@ dimensional polyhedra . He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs ; nesting these solids , each encased in a sphere , within one another would produce six layers , corresponding to the six known planets — Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn . By ordering the solids selectively — octahedron , icosahedron , dodecahedron , tetrahedron , cube — Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet 's path , assuming the planets circle the Sun . Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet 's orb to the length of its orbital period : from inner to outer planets , the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius . However , Kepler later rejected this formula , because it was not precise enough . 
 As he indicated in the title , Kepler thought he had revealed God 's geometrical plan for the universe . Much of Kepler 's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about the connection between the physical and the spiritual ; the universe itself was an image of God , with the Sun corresponding to the Father , the stellar sphere to the Son , and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit . His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism . 
 With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin , Kepler received permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript , pending removal of the Bible exegesis and the addition of a simpler , more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler 's new ideas . Mysterium was published late in 1596 , and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597 ; it was not widely read , but it established Kepler 's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer . The effusive dedication , to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz , also provided a crucial doorway into the patronage system . 
 Though the details would be modified in light of his later work , Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral @-@ <unk> cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum . His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it , concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it . In 1621 , Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium , half as long again as the first , detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication . 
 In terms of the impact of Mysterium , it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in his " De Revolutionibus " . Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book , he resorted to Ptolemaic devices ( viz . , epicycles and eccentric circles ) in order to explain the change in planets ' orbital speed , and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the earth 's orbit rather than that of the sun " as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy . " Modern astronomy owes much to " Mysterium Cosmographicum " , despite flaws in its main thesis , " since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it . " 
 = = = Marriage to Barbara Müller = = = 
 In December 1595 , Kepler was introduced to Barbara Müller , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old widow ( twice over ) with a young daughter , Regina Lorenz , and he began courting her . Müller , heiress to the estates of her late husbands , was also the daughter of a successful mill owner . Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler 's nobility ; though he had inherited his grandfather 's nobility , Kepler 's poverty made him an unacceptable match . Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium , but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication . However , Protestant officials — who had helped set up the match — pressured the <unk> to honor their agreement . Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27 , 1597 . 
 In the first years of their marriage , the <unk> had two children ( Heinrich and Susanna ) , both of whom died in infancy . In 1602 , they had a daughter ( Susanna ) ; in 1604 , a son ( Friedrich ) ; and in 1607 , another son ( Ludwig ) . 
 = = = Other research = = = 
 Following the publication of Mysterium and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors , Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work . He planned four additional books : one on the stationary aspects of the universe ( the Sun and the fixed stars ) ; one on the planets and their motions ; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features ( focused especially on Earth ) ; and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth , to include atmospheric optics , meteorology , and astrology . 
 He also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium , among them <unk> Ursus ( Nicolaus Reimers Bär ) — the imperial mathematician to Rudolph II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe . Ursus did not reply directly , but republished Kepler 's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over ( what is now called ) the Tychonic system with Tycho . Despite this black mark , Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler , starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler 's system ; among a host of objections , Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus . Through their letters , Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems , dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory ( particularly its theological viability ) . But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho 's observatory , Kepler had no way to address many of these issues . 
 Instead , he turned his attention to chronology and " harmony , " the numerological relationships among music , mathematics and the physical world , and their astrological consequences . By assuming the Earth to possess a soul ( a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets ) , he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena . By 1599 , however , he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data — just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz . In December of that year , Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in Prague ; on January 1 , 1600 ( before he even received the invitation ) , Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho 's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones .

 = = = Work for Tycho Brahe = = = 
 On February 4 , 1600 , Kepler met Tycho Brahe and his assistants Franz <unk> and <unk> at <unk> nad <unk> ( 35 km from Prague ) , the site where Tycho 's new observatory was being constructed . Over the next two months he stayed as a guest , analyzing some of Tycho 's observations of Mars ; Tycho guarded his data closely , but was impressed by Kepler 's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access . Kepler planned to test his theory from Mysterium Cosmographicum based on the Mars data , but he estimated that the work would take up to two years ( since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use ) . With the help of Johannes <unk> , Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho , but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6 . Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements , and in June , Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family . 
 Political and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe ; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies , Kepler sought an appointment as mathematician to Archduke Ferdinand . To that end , Kepler composed an essay — dedicated to Ferdinand — in which he proposed a force @-@ based theory of lunar motion : " In Terra <unk> virtus , quae <unk> <unk> " ( " There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move " ) . Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand 's court , it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses , which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz . These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in Astronomiae Pars Optica . 
 On August 2 , 1600 , after refusing to convert to Catholicism , Kepler and his family were banished from Graz . Several months later , Kepler returned , now with the rest of his household , to Prague . Through most of 1601 , he was supported directly by Tycho , who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho 's ( by then deceased ) rival , Ursus . In September , Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor : the Rudolphine Tables that should replace the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold . Two days after Tycho 's unexpected death on October 24 , 1601 , Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work . The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life . 
 = = = Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II = = = 
 Kepler 's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor . Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events , he had been casting well @-@ received detailed horoscopes for friends , family , and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen . In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders , the emperor sought Kepler 's advice in times of political trouble . Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars ( including numerous alchemists ) and kept up with Kepler 's work in physical astronomy as well . 
 Officially , the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and <unk> , but Kepler 's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered . The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family , but the difficulties of the over @-@ extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle . Partly because of financial troubles , his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant , marred with bickering and bouts of sickness . Court life , however , brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ( Johannes Matthäus <unk> von <unk> , Jost Bürgi , David Fabricius , Martin <unk> , and Johannes <unk> , among others ) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly . 
 = = = Astronomiae Pars Optica = = = 
 As he slowly continued analyzing Tycho 's Mars observations — now available to him in their entirety — and began the slow process of tabulating the Rudolphine Tables , Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600 . Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena , such as unexpected shadow sizes , the red color of a total lunar eclipse , and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse . Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations . Through most of 1603 , Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory ; the resulting manuscript , presented to the emperor on January 1 , 1604 , was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica ( The Optical Part of Astronomy ) . In it , Kepler described the inverse @-@ square law governing the intensity of light , reflection by flat and curved mirrors , and principles of pinhole cameras , as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies . He also extended his study of optics to the human eye , and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye 's lens onto the retina . The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics , although he did suggest that the image was later corrected " in the hollows of the brain " due to the " activity of the Soul . " Today , Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics ( though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent ) . With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry , Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work . He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci , the geometric form would morph or degenerate , one into another . In this way , an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity , and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another , a circle is formed . As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another , the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines . He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity , thus having the properties of a large circle . 
 = = = The Supernova of 1604 = = = 
 In October 1604 , a bright new evening star ( SN 1604 ) appeared , but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself . Kepler began systematically observing the nova . Astrologically , the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon , the start of the about 800 @-@ year cycle of great conjunctions ; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne ( c . 800 years earlier ) and the birth of Christ ( c . 1600 years earlier ) , and thus expected events of great portent , especially regarding the emperor . It was in this context , as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor , that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova . In it , Kepler addressed the star 's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating . He noted its fading luminosity , speculated about its origin , and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars , further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens ( the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging ) . The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens . In an appendix , Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius <unk> ; he calculated that , if <unk> was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind , then the Star of Bethlehem — analogous to the present new star — would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800 @-@ year cycle . 
 = = = Astronomia nova = = = 
 The extended line of research that culminated in Astronomia nova ( A New Astronomy ) — including the first two laws of planetary motion — began with the analysis , under Tycho 's direction , of Mars ' orbit . Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars ' orbit using an equant ( the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system ) , eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho 's observations to within two arcminutes ( the average measurement error ) . But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result ; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes . The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him , Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data . 
 Within Kepler 's religious view of the cosmos , the Sun ( a symbol of God the Father ) was the source of motive force in the solar system . As a physical basis , Kepler drew by analogy on William Gilbert 's theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from De Magnete ( 1600 ) and on his own work on optics . Kepler supposed that the motive power ( or motive species ) radiated by the Sun weakens with distance , causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it . Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order . Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars , he created a formula in which a planet 's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun . Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle , however , required very extensive calculation ; to simplify this task , by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry : planets sweep out equal areas in equal times — Kepler 's second law of planetary motion . 
 He then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars , using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg @-@ shaped ovoid orbit . After approximately 40 failed attempts , in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse , which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked . Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data , he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses , with the sun at one focus — Kepler 's first law of planetary motion . Because he employed no calculating assistants , however , he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars . By the end of the year , he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova , though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho 's observations , the property of his heirs . 
 = = = Dioptrice , Somnium manuscript , and other work = = = 
 In the years following the completion of Astronomia Nova , most of Kepler 's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides ( specific predictions of planet and star positions ) based on the table ( though neither would be completed for many years ) . He also attempted ( unsuccessfully ) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio <unk> . Some of his other work dealt with chronology , especially the dating of events in the life of Jesus , and with astrology , especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of <unk> Roeslin . 
 Kepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter @-@ attacks , while physician Philip <unk> published a work dismissing astrology altogether ( and Roeslin 's work in particular ) . In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other , Kepler prepared Tertius <unk> [ Third @-@ party Interventions ] . Nominally this work — presented to the common patron of Roeslin and <unk> — was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars , but it also set out Kepler 's general views on the value of astrology , including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls . While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the " evil @-@ smelling dung " in which " an industrious hen " scrapes , there was an " occasional grain @-@ seed , indeed , even a pearl or a gold nugget " to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer . Conversely , Sir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology , as Kepler was " continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology , but it was the only thing for which people would pay him , and on it after a fashion he lived . " 
 In the first months of 1610 , Galileo Galilei — using his powerful new telescope — discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter . Upon publishing his account as Sidereus Nuncius [ Starry Messenger ] , Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler , in part to bolster the credibility of his observations . Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply , Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo [ Conversation with the Starry Messenger ] . He endorsed Galileo 's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo 's discoveries and telescopic methods , for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology . Later that year , Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in <unk> de Jovis <unk> , providing further support of Galileo . To Kepler 's disappointment , however , Galileo never published his reactions ( if any ) to Astronomia Nova . 
 After hearing of Galileo 's telescopic discoveries , Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne . The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as Dioptrice in 1611 . In it , Kepler set out the theoretical basis of double @-@ convex converging lenses and double @-@ concave diverging lenses — and how they are combined to produce a Galilean telescope — as well as the concepts of real vs. virtual images , upright vs. inverted images , and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction . He also described an improved telescope — now known as the astronomical or Keplerian telescope — in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo 's combination of convex and concave lenses . 
 Around 1611 , Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published ( posthumously ) as Somnium [ The Dream ] . Part of the purpose of Somnium was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet , to show the feasibility of a non @-@ geocentric system . The manuscript , which disappeared after changing hands several times , described a fantastic trip to the moon ; it was part allegory , part autobiography , and part treatise on interplanetary travel ( and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction ) . Years later , a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother , as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel . Following her eventual acquittal , Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story — several times longer than the actual text — which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content ( particularly regarding lunar geography ) hidden within the text .

 As a New Year 's gift that year ( 1611 ) , he also composed for his friend and some @-@ time patron , Baron <unk> von <unk> , a short pamphlet entitled <unk> Seu de Nive <unk> ( A New Year 's Gift of Hexagonal Snow ) . In this treatise , he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and , extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry , posed what later became known as the Kepler conjecture , a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres . 
 = = = Personal and political troubles = = = 
 In 1611 , the growing political @-@ religious tension in Prague came to a head . Emperor Rudolph — whose health was failing — was forced to abdicate as King of Bohemia by his brother Matthias . Both sides sought Kepler 's astrological advice , an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice ( with little reference to the stars , except in general statements to discourage drastic action ) . However , it was clear that Kepler 's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim . 
 Also in that year , Barbara Kepler contracted Hungarian spotted fever , then began having seizures . As Barbara was recovering , Kepler 's three children all fell sick with smallpox ; Friedrich , 6 , died . Following his son 's death , Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua . At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg , concerns over Kepler 's perceived Calvinist heresies in violation of the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return . The University of Padua — on the recommendation of the departing Galileo — sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship , but Kepler , preferring to keep his family in German territory , instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz . However , Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler 's return . 
 Kepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph 's death in early 1612 , though between political upheaval , religious tension , and family tragedy ( along with the legal dispute over his wife 's estate ) , Kepler could do no research . Instead , he pieced together a chronology manuscript , Eclogae <unk> , from correspondence and earlier work . Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor , Matthias re @-@ affirmed Kepler 's position ( and salary ) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz . 
 = = Linz and elsewhere ( 1612 – 1630 ) = = 
 In Linz , Kepler 's primary responsibilities ( beyond completing the Rudolphine Tables ) were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services . In his first years there , he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague — though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples . His first publication in Linz was De vero Anno ( 1613 ) , an expanded treatise on the year of Christ 's birth ; he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce Pope Gregory 's reformed calendar to Protestant German lands ; that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise Nova <unk> <unk> <unk> , on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels , published in 1615 . 
 = = = Second marriage = = = 
 On October 30 , 1613 , Kepler married the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Susanna <unk> . Following the death of his first wife Barbara , Kepler had considered 11 different matches over two years ( a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem ) . He eventually returned to <unk> ( the fifth match ) who , he wrote , " won me over with love , humble loyalty , economy of household , diligence , and the love she gave the stepchildren . " The first three children of this marriage ( Margareta Regina , Katharina , and Sebald ) died in childhood . Three more survived into adulthood : <unk> ( born 1621 ) ; <unk> ( born 1623 ) ; and Hildebert ( born 1625 ) . According to Kepler 's biographers , this was a much happier marriage than his first . 
 = = = Epitome of Copernican Astronomy , calendars , and the witch trial of his mother = = = 
 Since completing the Astronomia nova , Kepler had intended to compose an astronomy textbook . In 1615 , he completed the first of three volumes of Epitome <unk> Copernicanae ( Epitome of Copernican Astronomy ) ; the first volume ( books I @-@ III ) was printed in 1617 , the second ( book IV ) in 1620 , and the third ( books V @-@ VII ) in 1621 . Despite the title , which referred simply to heliocentrism , Kepler 's textbook culminated in his own ellipse @-@ based system . The Epitome became Kepler 's most influential work . It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes . Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion ( applied to Mars in Astronomia nova ) to all the planets as well as the Moon and the Medicean satellites of Jupiter , it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data . 
 As a spin @-@ off from the Rudolphine Tables and the related Ephemerides , Kepler published astrological calendars , which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work — especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld . In his calendars — six between 1617 and 1624 — Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events ; the latter were often <unk> accurate , thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions . By 1624 , however , the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself ; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz . 
 In 1615 , Ursula Reingold , a woman in a financial dispute with Kepler 's brother Christoph , claimed Kepler 's mother Katharina had made her sick with an evil brew . The dispute escalated , and in 1617 Katharina was accused of witchcraft ; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time . Beginning in August 1620 , she was imprisoned for fourteen months . She was released in October 1621 , thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler . The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors . Katharina was subjected to <unk> <unk> , a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch , in a final attempt to make her confess . Throughout the trial , Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his " harmonic theory " . The result , published in 1619 , was Harmonices Mundi ( " Harmony of the World " ) . 
 = = = Harmonices Mundi = = = 
 Kepler was convinced " that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world " . In Harmony , he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world — particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects — in terms of music . The central set of " harmonies " was the musica <unk> or " music of the spheres " , which had been studied by Pythagoras , Ptolemy and many others before Kepler ; in fact , soon after publishing Harmonices Mundi , Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with Robert Fludd , who had recently published his own harmonic theory . 
 Kepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids , including the figures that would come to be known as Kepler 's solids . From there , he extended his harmonic analysis to music , meteorology , and astrology ; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies — and in the case of astrology , the interaction between those tones and human souls . In the final portion of the work ( Book V ) , Kepler dealt with planetary motions , especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun . Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers , but Kepler — with Tycho 's data and his own astronomical theories — treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them . 
 Among many other harmonies , Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion . He then tried many combinations until he discovered that ( approximately ) " The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances . " Although he gives the date of this epiphany ( March 8 , 1618 ) , he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion . However , the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely <unk> law was not realized until the 1660s . When conjoined with Christiaan Huygens ' newly discovered law of centrifugal force , it enabled Isaac Newton , Edmund Halley , and perhaps Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them . This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies , such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated , and also by Galileo 's student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics . 
 = = = Rudolphine Tables and his last years = = = 
 In 1623 , Kepler at last completed the Rudolphine Tables , which at the time was considered his major work . However , due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe 's heir , it would not be printed until 1627 . In the meantime , religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years ' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy . In 1625 , agents of the Catholic Counter @-@ Reformation placed most of Kepler 's library under seal , and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged . Kepler moved to Ulm , where he arranged for the printing of the Tables at his own expense . 
 In 1628 , following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand 's armies under General Wallenstein , Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein . Though not the general 's court astrologer per se , Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein 's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself . In his final years , Kepler spent much of his time traveling , from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and Ulm to a temporary home in Sagan , and finally to Regensburg . Soon after arriving in Regensburg , Kepler fell ill . He died on November 15 , 1630 , and was buried there ; his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard . Only Kepler 's self @-@ authored poetic epitaph survived the times : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , nunc terrae <unk> <unk> 
 Mens coelestis erat , corporis umbra <unk> . 
 I measured the skies , now the shadows I measure 
 Skybound was the mind , earthbound the body rests . 
 = = Reception of his astronomy = = 
 Kepler 's laws were not immediately accepted . Several major figures such as Galileo and René Descartes completely ignored Kepler 's Astronomia nova . Many astronomers , including Kepler 's teacher , Michael Maestlin , objected to Kepler 's introduction of physics into his astronomy . Some adopted compromise positions . Ismael <unk> accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler 's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse , while Seth Ward used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant . 
 Several astronomers tested Kepler 's theory , and its various modifications , against astronomical observations . Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory , under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed . In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631 , Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury , and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date . Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted , a confirmation of Kepler 's prediction . This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury . However , his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables . Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe , including Paris . Jeremiah Horrocks , who observed the 1639 Venus transit , had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model , predicted the transit , and then built apparatus to observe the transit . He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model . 
 Epitome of Copernican Astronomy was read by astronomers throughout Europe , and following Kepler 's death it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler 's ideas . Between 1630 and 1650 , it was the most widely used astronomy textbook , winning many converts to ellipse @-@ based astronomy . However , few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions . In the late 17th century , a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler 's work — notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke — began to incorporate attractive forces ( though not the quasi @-@ spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler ) and the Cartesian concept of inertia . This culminated in Isaac Newton 's Principia Mathematica ( 1687 ) , in which Newton derived Kepler 's laws of planetary motion from a force @-@ based theory of universal gravitation . 
 = = Historical and cultural legacy = = 
 = = = History of science = = = 
 Beyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy , Kepler has loomed large in the philosophy and historiography of science . Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as Jean Etienne <unk> 's 1758 Histoire des mathématiques and Jean @-@ Baptiste Delambre 's 1821 Histoire de l <unk> moderne . These and other histories written from an Enlightenment perspective treated Kepler 's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval , but later Romantic @-@ era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success . William Whewell , in his influential History of the Inductive Sciences of 1837 , found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius ; in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences of 1840 , Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of scientific method . Similarly , Ernst Friedrich Apelt — the first to extensively study Kepler 's manuscripts , after their purchase by Catherine the Great — identified Kepler as a key to the " Revolution of the sciences " . Apelt , who saw Kepler 's mathematics , aesthetic sensibility , physical ideas , and theology as part of a unified system of thought , produced the first extended analysis of Kepler 's life and work . 
 Alexandre Koyré 's work on Kepler was , after Apelt , the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler 's cosmology and its influence . In the 1930s and 1940s , Koyré , and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science , described the " Scientific Revolution " as the central event in the history of science , and Kepler as a ( perhaps the ) central figure in the revolution . Koyré placed Kepler 's <unk> , rather than his empirical work , at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world @-@ views . Since the 1960s , the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly , including studies of his astrology and meteorology , his geometrical methods , the role of his religious views in his work , his literary and rhetorical methods , his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time , and even his role as an historian of science . 
 Philosophers of science — such as Charles Sanders Peirce , Norwood Russell Hanson , Stephen Toulmin , and Karl Popper — have repeatedly turned to Kepler : examples of <unk> , analogical reasoning , falsification , and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler 's work . Physicist Wolfgang Pauli even used Kepler 's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of analytical psychology on scientific investigation . 
 = = = Editions and translations = = = 
 Modern translations of a number of Kepler 's books appeared in the late @-@ nineteenth and early @-@ twentieth centuries , the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 ( and is nearing completion in the early 21st century ) . 
 An edition in eight volumes , <unk> Opera omnia , was prepared by Christian Frisch ( 1807 – 1881 ) , during 1858 to 1871 , on the occasion of Kepler 's 300th birthday . Frisch 's edition only included Kepler 's Latin , with a Latin commentary . 
 A new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by Walther von Dyck ( 1856 – 1934 ) . Dyck compiled copies of Kepler 's unedited manuscripts , using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction . These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch . Dyck 's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler 's unpublished manuscripts . 
 Max Caspar ( 1880 – 1956 ) published his German translation of Kepler 's Mysterium Cosmographicum in 1923 . Both Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician Alexander von Brill ( 1842 – 1935 ) . Caspar became Dyck 's collaborator , succeeding him as project leader in 1934 , establishing the Kepler @-@ Kommission in the following year . Assisted by Martha List ( 1908 – 1992 ) and Franz Hammer ( 1898 – 1979 ) , Caspar continued editorial work during World War II . Max Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948 . The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas ( during 1976 – 2003 ) and Ulrich <unk> ( during 1984 – 1999 ) and Roland <unk> ( 1998 – 2014 ) .

 Kepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time ; science popularizer Carl Sagan described him as " the first astrophysicist and the last scientific astrologer " . 
 The debate over Kepler 's place in the Scientific Revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments . One of the most influential is Arthur Koestler 's 1959 The Sleepwalkers , in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero ( morally and theologically as well as intellectually ) of the revolution . 
 A well @-@ received , if fanciful , historical novel by John Banville , Kepler ( 1981 ) , explored many of the themes developed in Koestler 's non @-@ fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science . Somewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction , Heavenly Intrigue ( 2004 ) , suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data .

 In Austria , Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector 's coin : the 10 @-@ euro Johannes Kepler silver coin , minted on September 10 , 2002 . The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler , who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas . Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally , and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle ( the motif of the obverse of the coin ) . In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum . 
 The German composer Paul Hindemith wrote an opera about Kepler entitled Die Harmonie der Welt , and a symphony of the same name was derived from music for the opera . Philip Glass wrote an opera called Kepler based on Kepler 's life ( 2009 ) . 
 Kepler is honored together with Nicolaus Copernicus with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church ( USA ) on May 23 . 
 Directly named for Kepler 's contribution to science are Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , Kepler 's Supernova ( Supernova 1604 , which he observed and described ) and the Kepler Solids , a set of geometrical constructions , two of which were described by him and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing .

The screenplay was by Richard Curtis , who had written Four Weddings and a Funeral ( 1994 ) , and the film was produced by Duncan Kenworthy and directed by Roger Michell . The film stars Hugh Grant , Julia Roberts , Rhys Ifans , Emma Chambers , Tim McInnerny , Gina McKee , and Hugh Bonneville . 
 Notting Hill was well received by critics and became the highest grossing British film released that year . The film won a BAFTA , was nominated in two other categories , and won other awards , including a British Comedy Award and a Brit Award for the soundtrack . 
 = = Plot = = 
 William " Will " Thacker owns an independent travel bookshop in Notting Hill . He is divorced and shares his house with an eccentric , care @-@ free Welshman named Spike . 
 Will encounters Hollywood superstar Anna Scott when she enters his shop . Minutes later , they collide in the street and his drink spills on her clothes . Will offers his house nearby for Anna to change . Before leaving , she impulsively kisses him . 
 Days later , Anna leaves him a message that she is at the Ritz Hotel . Will is mistaken for a journalist — in a panic he claims he works for Horse & Hound , and is made to interview the cast of Anna 's new sci @-@ fi film , which he has not seen . Anna calls him back in and says she has cleared her evening for him . Will is exhilarated , before remembering that he is expected at his sister Honey 's birthday party ; Anna surprises him by saying she will join him . 
 At the house of Max and Bella , Anna feels at home as she share stories with the small group of birthday party guests . She and Will share a moment in a private garden square . The next day they go to a restaurant , where Will overhears Anna being criticised and defends her . Anna invites Will to her room at the Ritz , but her American boyfriend , film star Jeff King , has arrived unannounced . Will pretends to be a room @-@ service waiter and Jeff is very dismissive towards him . Anna is apologetic and embarrassed ; she thought King had broken up with her . Will realizes he must end things with Anna . 
 Over the next six months , Max and Bella set Will up on a series of awful blind dates , hoping to help him move on from Anna . Anna appears at Will 's house ; some pre @-@ stardom nude photos have been published , and she needs a place to hide out . When she sees Will 's poster of the Marc Chagall painting La Mariée , Anna describes it as " how being in love should be . " After an amazing day together , Anna goes to him at night and they make love . The next morning , she makes him breakfast in bed and she asks if she can stay . The doorbell rings and they are horrified to find a horde of reporters , alerted by Spike 's outspoken talk at the pub . Spike re @-@ opens the door to be photographed in only his dirty underwear , exacerbating the situation . While Anna gets dressed , she verbally berates Will for what she views as his desire for publicity . He tries to cheer her up , reminding her that the fame is all nonsense , but she tells him the scandal will follow her forever , departing with the statement that she regrets their time together . 
 Several months pass . At a dinner with his friends , Will discovers that Anna is back in town to make a Henry James film , which Will had previously suggested to her . He visits her location shoot , where Anna sees him and invites him past security . Given headphones to hear the dialogue , Will leaves when he overhears Anna evading questions from her co @-@ star , stating that Will is no one important . 
 The next day , Anna comes to the bookshop with a present . She explains that her co @-@ star is a notorious <unk> and she was simply being discreet . Anna admits she still has feelings for him , apologises for her behaviour months ago and explains that she now understands his comment , months earlier , that the fame is nonsense . Will hears her out , but turns her down , saying he is unable to handle another inevitable break up , especially considering how big of a star she is and that he would be unable to escape seeing her face . She leaves Will 's present behind , which turns out to be the original La Mariée . 
 Will meets his friends , where Spike is the first to lambaste him for turning away the woman he loves . His friends race him across London in Max 's car , to reach her press conference at the Savoy Hotel . Will adopts his Horse & Hound persona to ask a series of questions that reveals their relationship , while also convincing her to stay in the UK . 
 A montage shows the two getting married , at one of Anna 's movie premieres , then happily sitting on a garden square bench , where Will reads to a heavily pregnant Anna . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Julia Roberts as Anna Scott : A Hollywood film star . She meets Will when she comes into his book shop in Notting Hill . Roberts was the " one and only " choice for the role , although Roger Michell and Duncan Kenworthy did not expect her to accept . Her agent told her it was " the best romantic comedy she had ever read " . Roberts said that after reading the script she decided she was " going to have to do this " . 
 Hugh Grant as William " Will " Thacker : Recently divorced everyman owner of a travel book shop in Notting Hill . The decision to cast Grant was unanimous , as he and Richard Curtis had a " writer / actor marriage made in heaven " . Michell said that " Hugh does Richard better than anyone else , and Richard writes Hugh better than anyone else " , and that Grant is " one of the only actors who can speak Richard 's lines perfectly " . 
 Emma Chambers as Honey Thacker : Will 's younger sister , she is a fan of Anna Scott . She later marries her brother 's flatmate Spike . 
 Hugh Bonneville as Bernie : An incompetent stockbroker and a friend of Will . He does not recognise Anna Scott upon meeting her and by way of small talk about the low pay in acting , asks her how much money she made on her last film . 
 Rhys Ifans as Spike : Will 's slacker Welsh flatmate who dreams of being an artist . He later marries Honey Thacker and becomes Will 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . He is described by Will as " the stupidest person in the world , only doubled " . 
 Tim McInnerny as Max : Will 's best friend , in whom Will often confides . He and Bella host Honey 's birthday party . 
 Gina McKee as Bella : A paraplegic lawyer who is married to Max . She is described by Will as one of the only two women that he has ever loved . 
 James Dreyfus as Martin : William 's unprofessional assistant at his bookshop . 
 The casting of Bonneville , McInnerny , McKee , Chambers , and Ifans as Will 's friends was " rather like assembling a family " . Michell explained that " When you are casting a cabal of friends , you have to cast a balance of qualities , of types and of sensibilities . They were the jigsaw that had to be put together all in one go , and I think we 've got a very good variety of people who can realistically still live in the same world . " 
 Other characters 
 Richard McCabe as Tony : A failing restaurateur . The group meets at his restaurant . 
 Dylan Moran as Rufus : A thief who attempts to steal from Will 's bookshop . Despite being caught on CCTV concealing a book down his trousers he professes his innocence , then asks Anna if she wants his phone number .

 Richard Curtis developed the film from thoughts while lying awake at night . He described the starting point as " the idea of a very normal person going out with an unbelievably famous person and how that impinges on their lives " . Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on Pushing Tin . He said that in commercial terms he had made the wrong decision , but did not regret it . The producer , Duncan Kenworthy , then turned to Roger Michell , saying that " Finding someone as good as Roger , was just like finding the right actor to play each role . Roger shone out . " 
 Curtis chose Notting Hill as he lived there and knew the area , saying " Notting Hill is a melting pot and the perfect place to set a film " . This left the producers to film in a heavily populated area . Kenworthy noted " Early on , we toyed with the idea of building a huge exterior set . That way we would have more control , because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers . " In the end they decided to film in the streets . Michell was worried " that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road , and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting " . The location team , and security personnel prevented this , as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill , who Michell believes were " genuinely excited " about the film . The location manager Sue Quinn , described finding locations and getting permission to film as " a mammoth task " . Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area , promising to donate to each person 's favourite charity , resulting in 200 charities receiving money . 
 Stuart Craig , the production designer , was pleased to do a contemporary film , saying " we 're dealing with streets with thousands of people , market traders , shop owners and residents which makes it really complex " . Filming began on 17 April 1998 in West London and at Shepperton Studios . Will 's bookshop was on Portobello Road , one of the main areas in which filming took place . Other places within Notting Hill included Westbourne Park Road , Golborne Road , Landsdowne Road and the Coronet Cinema . Will 's house , 280 Westbourne Park Road , was owned by Richard Curtis and behind the entrance there is a grand house , not the flat in the film that was made up in the studios . The blue door was auctioned for charity . The current door is blue again . The Travel Book Store is located at 142 Portobello Road . After filming for six weeks in Notting Hill , filming moved to the Ritz Hotel , where work had to take place at night , the Savoy Hotel , the Nobu Restaurant , the Zen Garden of the Hempel Hotel and Kenwood House . One of the final scenes takes place at a film premiere , which presented difficulties . Michell wanted to film Leicester Square but was declined . Police had found fans at a Leonardo DiCaprio premiere problematic and were concerned the same might occur at the staged premiere . Through a health and safety act , the production received permission to film and constructed the scene in 24 hours . Interior scenes were the last to be filmed , at Shepperton Studios . The final cut was 3 @.@ 5 hours long , 90 minutes edited out for release . 
 The film features the 1950 Marc Chagall painting La Mariée . Anna sees a print of the painting in William 's home and later gives him what is presumably the original . Michell said in Entertainment Weekly that the painting was chosen because Curtis was a fan of Chagall 's work and because La Mariée " depicts a yearning for something that 's lost . " The producers had a reproduction made for the film , but had to get permission from the owner as well as clearance from the Design and Artists Copyright Society . Finally , according to Kenworthy , " we had to agree to destroy it . They were concerned that if our fake was too good , it might float around the market and create problems . " The article also noted that " some experts say the real canvas could be worth between US $ 500 @,@ 000 and US $ 1 million . " 
 The film features the book Istanbul : The Imperial City ( 1996 ) by John Freely . William recommends this book to Anna , commenting the author has at least been to Istanbul . In reality , Freely teaches at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul , and is the author of nine books about the city .

 Music was composed by Trevor Jones . Several additional songs written by other artists include Elvis Costello 's cover of the Charles Aznavour song " She " , Shania Twain 's remixed version of " You 've Got A Way " , as well as Ronan Keating 's specially recorded cover of " When You Say Nothing at All " ; the song reached number one in the British charts . Pulp recorded new song " Born to Cry " , which was released on the European version of the soundtrack album . 
 The song played when Will strides down Portobello Road is " Ain 't No Sunshine " by Bill Withers . Tony and Bernie play " Blue Moon " on the piano at Tony 's restaurant on the night it closes . Originally , Charles Aznavour 's version of " She " was used in the film , but American test screening audiences did not respond to it . Costello was then brought in by Richard Curtis to record a cover version of the song . Both versions of the song appear in non @-@ US releases . 
 The soundtrack album was released by Island Records .

 The film had generally positive reviews , scoring an 82 % " Certified Fresh " rating at Rotten Tomatoes . Variety 's Derek Elley said that " It 's slick , it 's gawky , it 's 10 minutes too long , and it 's certainly not " Four Weddings and a Funeral Part 2 " in either construction or overall tone " , giving it an overall positive review . Cranky Critic called it " Bloody damned good " , as well as saying that it was " A perfect date flick . " Nitrate said that " Notting Hill is whimsical and light , fresh and quirky " , with " endearing moments and memorable characters " . In his review of the film 's DVD John J. Puccio noted that " the movie is a fairy tale , and writer Richard Curtis knows how much the public loves a fairy tale " , calling it " a sweet film " . Desson Howe of The Washington Post gave the film a very positive review , particularly praising Rhys Ifans ' performance as Spike . James Sanford gave Notting Hill three and a half stars , saying that " Curtis ' dialogue may be much snappier than his sometimes <unk> plot , but the first hour of Notting Hill is so beguiling and consistently funny it seems churlish to complain that the rest is merely good . " Sue <unk> of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated that " Notting Hill is clever , funny , romantic – and oh , yes , reminiscent of Four Weddings and a Funeral " , but that the film " is so satisfying , it doesn 't pay to nitpick . " Roger Ebert praised the film , saying " the movie is bright , the dialogue has wit and intelligence , and Roberts and Grant are very easy to like .

 = Subtropical Storm One ( 1974 ) = 
 Subtropical Storm One was a short @-@ lived subtropical cyclone that brought copious amounts of rainfall to central Florida in late June 1974 . The storm originated in an area of convection that detached from a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 24 . A new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection and the system began to intensify . Later that day , the storm had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression . Early on June 25 , it made landfall near Clearwater , Florida with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and later attained its peak intensity over eastern Florida with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . After reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean , the system began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition . The storm ultimately dissipated off the coast of North Carolina early on June 26 . 
 Despite its relatively weak strength , the system produced nearly 12 in ( 300 mm ) of rain around Tampa , Florida , and the National Hurricane Center reported upwards of 20 in ( 510 mm ) nearby . Around Lake Okeechobee , precipitation totals of 7 in ( 180 mm ) were common . The heavy rainfall led to moderate flooding across the state . One tornado was confirmed to have touched down in association with the cyclone . Three people drowned as a result of the storm and damage amounted to $ 10 million ( 1974 USD , $ 48 million in 2009 USD ) .

 A tropical depression was situated over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June 22 , 1974 . By June 24 , the depression began to weaken as it moved near the Mexican coastline , causing convective activity to move away from the center of circulation . Later that day , a new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection in the central Gulf of Mexico . It continued to mature , and around 1800 UTC , the system had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression . Although subtropical , the storm was operationally considered to be non @-@ tropical , but was reassessed in a post @-@ season analysis of the system . Upon becoming subtropical , the storm tracked rapidly towards the northeast at 24 mph ( 39 km / h ) . Early on June 25 , the depression intensified into a subtropical storm as it neared the Florida coastline . 
 Reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm until it made landfall near Clearwater , Florida with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) during the morning of June 25 . Although over land , the system continued to intensify as it moved through the Florida Peninsula . Roughly six @-@ hours after landfall , the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 1000 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) . Not long after attaining this intensity , the storm moved over the far western Atlantic Ocean and began to weaken . Later that day , it began to undergo an extratropical transition , acquiring frontal features and elongated convection . The storm completed this transition within 12 hours before becoming poorly defined and dissipating off the North Carolina coastline early on June 26 .

 Following the formation of the system , the National Hurricane Center issued small craft advisories and gale warnings for most of the Florida coastline . Although it was relatively weak , the system brought torrential rainfall to parts of central Florida , with amounts of 11 @.@ 38 in ( 289 mm ) in St. Petersburg . The National Hurricane Center reported that up to 20 in ( 510 mm ) fell near Tampa . In a 24 @-@ hour span , 9 @.@ 54 in ( 242 mm ) of rain fell in Inverness . Rainfall amounts exceeding 7 in ( 180 mm ) covered a large area north of Tampa and totals between 5 and 7 in ( 130 and 180 mm ) were common west of Lake Okeechobee . Two runways at the St. Petersburg @-@ Clearwater International Airport were submerged in flood waters during the storm . 
 Offshore , waves up to 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) affected coastal areas . Several vessels became stranded in the storm , resulted in many Coast Guard rescues , many by towing the ships back to shore . A tornado was reported near Fort Myers . Additionally , two waterspouts touched down near Sarasota ; however , both struck unpopulated areas and left no damage . One of the two waterspouts was later confirmed as an F0 tornado with a track length of roughly 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) . Beach erosion was common along many beaches in southeastern states . The most significant erosion took place between Cedar Key and Naples where coastal flooding was reported . After moving through Florida , the subtropical storm brought gusty winds and light to moderate rainfall to Georgia , South Carolina and North Carolina . Throughout Florida , three people were killed by the storm from drowning and floods left roughly $ 10 million ( 1974 USD , $ 48 million in 2009 USD ) in damage . 
 = Survivors ( 2008 TV series ) = 
 Survivors is a British science fiction television series produced by the BBC . It depicts the lives of a group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of the human species . According to the producers , the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors ( 1975 – 1977 ) , created by Terry Nation , but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme . Two series were produced of the new show : series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November – December 2008 , and series 2 ran in January – February 2010 , ending with a cliffhanger . The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that , due to poor viewing figures and other considerations , Survivors had been cancelled . 
 The series premiered in South Africa on BBC Entertainment , in September 2009 , in France on <unk> channel NRJ 12 on 12 January 2010 , on BBC America in the United States on 13 February 2010 , and in Australia on Channel Nine , on 21 March 2010 .

 Set in the present day , the series focuses on a group of ordinary people who survive the aftermath of a devastating viral pandemic – referred to as " European flu " – which kills most of the world 's population by causing Cytokine Storms in the body 's immune system . The series sees the characters struggling against terrible dangers in a world with no society , no police , and no law , led by the de facto matriarch of the group , Abby Grant . 
 = = Production = = 
 Sue Hogg , an executive producer at the BBC , was inspired to remake Survivors following the recent increase in concerns about future pandemics and diseases such as SARS . It was decided that the show would be a re @-@ imagining of the 1970s material made by BBC Productions rather than an external production company . The BBC pursued the rights for Survivors from Terry Nation 's estate so that the series could be revived . The agreement , which was signed in 2007 , took months of negotiations . For legal reasons , the new series is billed as being based on Nation 's novelisation of material from his episodes of the 1970s series . 
 In remaking the series , Adrian Hodges worked to avoid criticisms of the 1970s series , and he felt it was " important that a new version had a cultural and class mix that really represented the country as it is now " ; to meet this needs , they created two new characters , Al and Najid . The writers claimed that the new series retained the " spirit " of the 1970s show , but Hodges concentrated on the hope and the humanity in what was said to be an attempt to make it " less depressing " to watch . 
 The city scenes in the first series were filmed in Manchester , while city scenes in the second series were filmed in Birmingham . 
 To help create a world with no people , some scenes were shot very early on a Sunday morning , including a sequence where Al Sadiq drives his car at speed around the city centre . Producer Hugh Warren said this approach reduced the amount of computer @-@ generated imagery required and allowed the budget to be spent on effects such as when the city starts to flood and fires burn . Other locations included a house near <unk> in Lancashire , which doubled as the survivors ' main base , the disused Earth Centre in the village of Denaby Main near Doncaster , and the Jaguar Cars test track in Nuneaton , which stood in for deserted motorways . 
 The series was shot using 35 mm film . Warren said this was chosen over high @-@ definition cameras due to the low light levels that would be experienced when filming in a world without electricity and during an autumn filming period , and over Super 16 due to high @-@ definition transmission requirements . 
 The first series received a mixed critical reception , with some reviewers concerned that it is too derivative and predictable , while others were more positive . The producers were happy to have started well , survived the ratings lull in the middle , and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks . Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows . 
 The second season of Survivors was delayed because of the real @-@ life swine flu epidemic in 2009 and thus was broadcast in 2010 .
