 The stage design was presented during the Heads of Delegations meeting held on 30 September 2014 . Gio <unk> , a Milan @-@ based design company , was given the task of designing the stage for the 2014 contest . The stage used an origami @-@ like appearance , inspired by the triangle @-@ shaped 2014 Junior Eurovision logo . The venue itself was approximately 30 @,@ 000 m2 ( 320 @,@ 000 sq ft ) in size , and the production team moved in to the venue on 21 October .

 = = = Running order = = = 
 During the Heads of Delegations meeting in Malta on 30 September 2014 , the broadcaster PBS along with the production team sought permission to change the running order rule , which was to allow the artists to randomly select their position number ( a system used in 2013 ) . The agreed change was for the host country , Malta , to pick their position at random , followed by countries that were to open and close the show to be picked randomly . The remaining countries would then select at random whether they were to perform in the first or second half of the show . This draw took place during the opening ceremony , at the Verdala Palace on 9 November 2013 . A pre @-@ draw to decide the order in which countries would select their running order halves , took place on 7 November 2014 , hosted by Moira Delia , Vladislav Yakovlev , and Gaia <unk> . PBS and the production team then decided the running order so that they could avoid similar entries performing consecutively . This method has been used in the senior contests since 2013 . The Executive Supervisor along with the Steering Group presented the finalised running order shortly after the opening ceremony . 
 = = = Rehearsals = = = 
 The national broadcaster , PBS , decided at the Heads of Delegations meeting on 30 September 2014 , that all participating countries would not have their rehearsals in running order ; allowing for school visits and personal trips of the participants to be carried out uninterruptedly , something which had not been done in previous years . 
 = = = Voting = = = 
 The voting system for 2014 was reverted to a system previously used in both the Junior and Senior contests prior to 2013 . Both the national juries and televoting awarded 1 to 8 points , 10 and then the maximum 12 points to their ten favourite songs . The way the votes were to be announced remained unchanged , the first seven points appeared on screen ; whilst spokespersons from each of the participating countries read out their top three points ( 8 , 10 , and 12 ) . 
 On 30 October 2014 , the EBU announced that a new online voting system would be introduced for the 2014 contest , to allow countries from around the world to vote for their favourite entry . The votes were not used in the official voting results , but the country who received the most online votes was presented with the new " Online Voting Winner " award , during the winners presentation conference after the show . In order to prevent vote @-@ rigging , the online results were published via the Junior Eurovision website , after the show has concluded . Due to the website crashing the online voting award was not awarded .

 = 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl = 
 The 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game between the Connecticut Huskies ( UConn ) of the Big East Conference and the South Carolina Gamecocks of the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) , on January 2 , 2010 at Legion Field in Birmingham , Alabama . The game was the final contest of the 2009 NCAA Division I @-@ Football Bowl Subdivision ( Division I @-@ FBS ) football season for both teams , and it ended in a 20 – 7 victory for Connecticut . 
 Connecticut was selected to play in the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl following a tumultuous 7 – 5 regular season that included five losses by a total of just fifteen points , a double @-@ overtime victory at Notre Dame , and the murder of cornerback Jasper Howard . The Huskies faced South Carolina , who also had 7 – 5 regular @-@ season , highlighted by wins over then @-@ No. 4 Mississippi and then @-@ No. 15 Clemson . Pregame coverage focused on the tragedy that marked the Huskies ' season , as well as on head coaches Randy Edsall of Connecticut and Steve Spurrier of South Carolina . 
 Connecticut scored twice in the first quarter : on a one @-@ handed 37 @-@ yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Kashif Moore and then on a 33 @-@ yard field goal after South Carolina failed to convert a fourth @-@ down play at its 32 @-@ yard line . Running back Andre Dixon scored for UConn on a 10 @-@ yard rush early in the fourth quarter . South Carolina scored its sole touchdown after the game had effectively been decided , on a two @-@ yard run by Brian Maddox . 
 Dixon was named player of the game , and finished with 126 rushing yards and one touchdown . Connecticut wide receiver Marcus Easley and South Carolina linebacker Eric Norwood were among four players from the teams to be selected in the subsequent 2010 National Football League ( NFL ) Draft . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 In 2010 , the PapaJohns.com Bowl selection committee had a contractual arrangement with the Big East and the SEC that allowed the committee to pick one team from each conference . The Big East had had a contractual bowl bid to the game since its inception in 2006 . The SEC agreed to send its ninth bowl @-@ eligible team to the bowl starting in 2008 , but did not have enough bowl @-@ eligible teams in either 2008 or 2009 to take advantage of the bid . In 2010 , the SEC received $ 900 @,@ 000 for sending a team to the game , while the Big East received $ 600 @,@ 000 . 
 The Big East 's contract with the bowl committee stated that the group would make its selection in coordination with the International Bowl and the St. Petersburg Bowl after other Big East @-@ affiliated bowl games made their selections . Conference champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) berth in the 2010 Sugar Bowl . The Gator Bowl had the first pick after the BCS , and selected West Virginia . The Meineke Car Care Bowl , which had the next selection , considered both Pittsburgh , which had the better regular @-@ season record , and Rutgers , whose fans had a better traveling reputation ; it selected Pittsburgh . 
 Three bowl @-@ eligible Big East teams remained : Connecticut , Rutgers , and South Florida . The previous two years , Rutgers had played in the 2008 International Bowl and the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl . In the same period , South Florida played in the 2007 PapaJohns.com Bowl and the 2008 St. Petersburg Bowl . Connecticut had played in the 2009 International Bowl the previous year . In general , bowl games and conferences prefer to have different teams play in each game each year . Partly because of this , Rutgers went to the 2009 St. Petersburg Bowl , South Florida to the 2010 International Bowl , and Connecticut to the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl . 
 For Connecticut 's opponent , the PapaJohns.com Bowl had the right to select a SEC team , but only after all other bowls with contracts with the SEC made their selections . Conference champion Alabama finished No. 1 in the BCS standings and earned a berth to the 2010 BCS National Championship Game . Conference championship game loser Florida took the SEC champion 's automatic slot in the 2010 Sugar Bowl , vacant since Alabama was selected to appear in the national championship game . The Capital One Bowl had the next selection and opted for Louisiana State University ( LSU ) . The Cotton Bowl and Outback Bowl selected Ole Miss and Auburn respectively . The Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl , which had the next pick , selected Tennessee . The next selections were shared by the Liberty Bowl and Music City Bowl , which opted for Arkansas and Kentucky , respectively . The Independence Bowl , with the next @-@ to @-@ last selection , picked Georgia , leaving the PapaJohns.com Bowl with the last available bowl @-@ eligible SEC team , South Carolina . 
 The game was the first meeting between the two schools and the first PapaJohns.com Bowl appearance for each . The game was the 30th anniversary of South Carolina 's last postseason game at Legion Field , in the December 1979 Hall of Fame Bowl , and it was the 20th anniversary of head coach Steve Spurrier 's last Legion Field bowl game , with Duke in the December 1989 All @-@ American Bowl .

 The Connecticut Huskies finished 8 – 5 in 2008 , ending the season with a victory in the 2009 International Bowl . The departure of running back Donald Brown — the NCAA rushing leader in 2008 — as well as three other Huskies selected in the first two rounds of the 2009 NFL Draft , was expected to hurt the team . In the Big East preseason media poll , the Huskies were picked to finish sixth in the conference .

 The Huskies opened the 2009 season at Ohio University , and never trailed in the game , winning 23 – 16 . UConn 's next game was its home opener , versus No. 19 North Carolina . Connecticut led 10 – 0 through three quarters , but North Carolina tied the game with 2 : 36 left and took the lead when UConn was called for a holding penalty in its end zone , which by rule resulted in a safety . North Carolina won the game 12 – 10 . Connecticut rebounded in its next game at Baylor , winning 30 – 22 ; they then faced Division I @-@ Football Championship Subdivision ( Division I @-@ FCS ) opponent Rhode Island , an historic rival of the team , and defeated them 52 – 10 . 
 The Huskies opened Big East conference play at the Pittsburgh Panthers . UConn held a 21 – 6 lead with less than four minutes left in the third quarter , but Pittsburgh rallied to win with a field goal as time expired . Connecticut closed the first half of its season versus Big East opponent Louisville on homecoming weekend . In the third quarter , with UConn leading 21 – 13 , Louisville running back Bilal Powell ran off left tackle near the end zone . He was caught by cornerback Jasper Howard , who forced a fumble . Connecticut kicked a field goal on the ensuing drive and won the game 38 – 25 , giving the Huskies a 4 – 2 overall record , 1 – 1 within the Big East conference .

 Later that night , Howard and several other UConn football players were at a dance at the Student Union Center on the Connecticut campus . At 12 : 26 am a fire alarm sounded , forcing the evacuation of the building . As the students exited , an altercation broke out between a group of UConn football players and a group of non @-@ students . The attackers brandished knives and stabbed Howard before fleeing . Howard was taken by ambulance to Windham Community Memorial Hospital , and then evacuated by helicopter to St. Francis Hospital in Hartford , where he was pronounced dead . Coach Randy Edsall was summoned to identify the body . Howard 's murder was the first homicide on UConn 's campus in more than thirty years . 
 Connecticut 's next game , one week after Howard 's death , was at West Virginia . In a close @-@ run game , Connecticut lost 28 – 24 after West Virginia responded to the Huskies ' late go @-@ ahead score with one of its own . Two days after the game , the entire UConn team traveled to Howard 's hometown of Miami , Florida , for his funeral . The next game , the first at Rentschler Field since Howard 's death , was against Rutgers . Connecticut came back in the fourth quarter to take a 24 – 21 lead with 38 seconds remaining ; Rutgers completed an 81 @-@ yard touchdown pass one play later to win 28 – 24 . UConn also lost the game that followed , 47 – 45 , at undefeated No. 5 Cincinnati . After three straight losses , the Huskies ' record dropped to 4 – 5 overall ; 1 – 4 in the Big East . The losses to this point were by a combined total of 15 points .

 Connecticut 's next game was a nationally @-@ televised appearance at the Notre Dame Fighting Irish . The Irish scored two touchdowns early but the Huskies responded with a touchdown and a field goal . Notre Dame expanded its lead to 17 – 10 in the third quarter , but Todman ran back the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a game @-@ tying touchdown . In the fourth quarter , Notre Dame once again took the lead on a 23 @-@ yard field goal ; after two touchdown @-@ scoring running plays were negated by holding penalties , Connecticut tied the score on a 29 @-@ yard field goal with 1 : 10 left , sending the game into overtime . The teams traded touchdowns in the first overtime , and the Huskies won the game with a touchdown in the second overtime . Edsall stated that the game was the " best win " in UConn football history . 
 Connecticut finished the regular season by beating Syracuse and South Florida at home . The South Florida game , played as snow fell on Rentschler Field , was won on a last @-@ second 42 @-@ yard field goal by kicker Dave Teggart . The two wins gave UConn a final regular season record of 7 – 5 overall , 3 – 4 in the Big East . They finished in a three @-@ way tie with Rutgers and South Florida for fourth place in the conference .

 The South Carolina Gamecocks went 7 – 6 in 2008 , losing their final three games , including the 2009 Outback Bowl against Iowa , by a combined score of 118 – 30 .

 = = = = Early season = = = = 
 South Carolina opened its 2009 season with a win against North Carolina State . Their next game , against No. 21 Georgia , featured a kickoff returned for a touchdown , an interception returned for a touchdown , a safety , a blocked extra point attempt , and 24 penalties . In the end , quarterback Stephen Garcia 's pass on 4th @-@ and @-@ 4 from the 7 @-@ yard line with 22 seconds remaining was batted down by the defense and fell incomplete , preserving a 41 – 37 win for Georgia . South Carolina proceeded to beat Florida Atlantic 38 – 16 . 
 In their next contest , South Carolina faced No. 4 Mississippi , and came away with a 16 – 10 upset ; the Gamecocks had lost their previous 22 games against AP top 5 teams . Next up was a win against in @-@ state Division I @-@ FCS opponent South Carolina State With the victory , the Gamecocks earned their first Top 25 ranking of the 2009 season , appearing in the AP Poll at No. 25 . South Carolina finished the first half of their season against SEC opponent Kentucky . Defensive end Cliff Matthews knocked down Kentucky 's pass attempt on what would have been a game @-@ tying two @-@ point conversion to preserve the 28 – 26 win . After six games , the Gamecocks had a record of 5 – 1 overall , 2 – 1 in the SEC , and were a consensus No. 22 in the AP , Coaches ' , and Harris polls . 
 = = = = Late season = = = = 
 After winning five of their first six games , the Gamecocks proceeded to lose four of their next five . Against No. 2 Alabama , eventual Heisman Trophy @-@ winning running back Mark Ingram ran for a then @-@ career record 246 yards and a touchdown ; South Carolina lost 20 – 6 . The defeat dropped the Gamecocks to No. 23 in the AP and Coaches ' polls , and out of the Harris poll altogether ; in the first BCS standings released that week , the Gamecocks were ranked 24th . South Carolina came back to beat Vanderbilt 14 – 10 ; the Gamecocks rose to No. 21 in all three polls , and No. 22 in the following week 's BCS standings . The next game , against Tennessee , was never close ; South Carolina fell behind 21 – 0 early in the second quarter and lost 31 – 13 . The loss caused the Gamecocks to fall out of all three polls as well as the BCS standings . South Carolina then faced Arkansas , who scored 23 unanswered points on their way to delivering the Gamecocks a 33 – 16 loss . The following game was against No. 1 Florida , who was undefeated . South Carolina was within three points of Florida as the fourth quarter began , but Garcia was subsequently sacked four times and intercepted twice ; Florida won 24 – 14 . The Gamecocks ' record fell to 6 – 5 overall , 3 – 5 within the SEC . 
 After a bye week , South Carolina closed out their regular season with a game against their fierce in @-@ state rivals , the No. 15 Clemson Tigers , who had already clinched a berth in the 2009 ACC Championship Game that would be played the next week . Clemson star running back C. J. Spiller returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown ; he was held to 18 yards rushing the rest of the game . The Gamecocks scored 24 unanswered points to take a 24 – 7 lead through three quarters , and matched the Tigers the rest of the way to win 34 – 17 . This win gave South Carolina a final regular season record of 7 – 5 overall , 3 – 5 in the SEC .

 In the weeks preceding the game , media coverage focused on the tragic circumstances surrounding the Huskies ' season . On December 21 , 2010 , the team was declared the winner of the 2009 FedEx Orange Bowl / FWAA Courage Award , given to a person or team who displayed courage on or off the field , overcame injury or physical handicap , prevented a disaster , or lived through hardship . The award was presented at the 2010 Orange Bowl on January 5 , 2011 , following the PapaJohns.com Bowl . 
 Edsall was praised for coaching the Huskies to a successful season despite the off @-@ field distractions . By appearing in the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl , UConn made its third straight bowl appearance and fourth since joining the Big East for the 2004 season . There were rumors that Edsall was a candidate for the Notre Dame head coaching position , vacated by the firing of Charlie Weis . On December 11 , Cincinnati coach Brian Kelly was given the Notre Dame job ; Edsall remained with Connecticut . 
 Pregame coverage also discussed the performance of Steve Spurrier as head coach of South Carolina . His Gamecock teams had been competitive in the SEC , but were unable to win championships ; during his tenure to that point , they had finished no higher than second in the SEC East division . Nevertheless , analysts described him as one of " the game 's better minds and motivators " and " still one of the <unk> coaches around " . The 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl marked Spurrier 's return to Birmingham ; in the United States Football League he competed against the local Birmingham Stallions as head coach of the Tampa Bay Bandits from 1983 to 1985 . Legion Field was also the home of the 1992 and 1993 SEC Championship Games ; teams coached by Spurrier participated in both contests . 
 = = = Offensive matchups = = = 
 = = = = Connecticut offense = = = = 
 The Connecticut offense was led by the rushing attack of running backs Jordan Todman and Andre Dixon , who were described as " one of the best running @-@ back tandems in the nation " . The two combined for 27 touchdowns and more than 2 @,@ 100 rushing yards during the regular season . South Carolina linebacker Eric Norwood described Todman as a speedy back , with " that burst and that breakaway speed to go with it " , and compared him to Clemson running back C. J. Spiller . In contrast , Norwood described Dixon as a " taller , more downhill back , vertical guy " . 
 In previous seasons , UConn had been largely dependent on running the ball ; the team developed more balance in 2009 , ranking 41st of 120 Division I FBS teams nationally in rushing offense and 46th in passing . Marcus Easley 's emergence as a productive wide receiver was key to the development of the Huskies ' passing attack . A former walk @-@ on who entered the season with only five career receptions , he led Connecticut in receiving in 2009 with 44 catches for 853 yards and eight touchdowns . Quarterback Zach Frazer was inconsistent in the early season . He was injured in the game against North Carolina , but regained his starting role after backup Cody Endres was hurt in the Rutgers game later in the season . In UConn 's four games before the bowl , Frazer performed well ; he threw six touchdown passes against only two interceptions and helped the Huskies score an average of 41 points per game . Experts felt Frazer would need to have a good performance for Connecticut to have a chance to win . 
 = = = = South Carolina offense = = = = 
 The Gamecocks struggled offensively for most of 2009 , ranking only 76th in total offense and 96th in scoring . Their offense was quarterbacked by Stephen Garcia . A highly touted prospect coming out of high school , Garcia had a breakout season in 2009 , finishing second in the SEC with 2 @,@ 733 passing yards — more than former Heisman Trophy @-@ winning Florida quarterback Tim Tebow — and 17 touchdowns against nine interceptions . Freshman wide receiver Alshon Jeffery was Garcia 's most frequent passing target ; he caught 43 passes for 735 yards and six touchdowns . Although South Carolina 's passing attack had success , its running game was the worst in the SEC and 91st nationally . The Gamecocks ' offensive line struggled , ranking 104th in sacks allowed . It did not help matters that Eric Wolford , the running game coordinator and offensive line coach , left the team before the bowl game to become head coach at Youngstown State .

 Connecticut had a weaker defense in 2010 than in previous seasons . The Huskies were 72nd in total defense , 60th in scoring defense , 48th against the run , and 94th against the pass . UConn 's pass defense was hurt by the loss of Jasper Howard ; following his death , freshman cornerback <unk> @-@ Wreh Wilson was forced into the starting lineup alongside senior Robert McClain . Top performers for the Connecticut defense included defensive end Lindsey Witten , who led the Big East with 11 @.@ 5 sacks , and linebacker Lawrence Wilson , who led the Big East and was fourth in the nation with 136 tackles , averaging over 11 per game .

 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the win , Connecticut finished the season with a final record of 8 – 5 ; South Carolina fell to 7 – 6 . Financially , both teams roughly broke even on the game : the Huskies were given an expense allowance of about $ 1 @.@ 2 million from the Big East and spent just over $ 1 million , while the Gamecocks received just under $ 1 million from the SEC and spent about $ 900 @,@ 000 . 
 In the postgame press conference , South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said : 
 " The first thing I want to do , and hopefully half the team does , is apologize to about 30 @,@ 000 Gamecocks that came down here to see a football game , and we couldn 't put one on . I thought we were ready to play . I thought we practiced pretty well . But obviously our offense was very sad , our defense not as good as it 's been most of the time . We thoroughly got beat by a better team , a better @-@ disciplined team . " 
 Throughout the offseason , Spurrier apologized for his team 's performance , held himself accountable for the loss , and promised the team would perform significantly better the next season . Acknowledging that the team had underperformed expectations , he promised he would resign or retire rather than let the program degenerate to the point where he might be fired or forced out . 
 Both teams made assistant coaching changes in the offseason . Less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the PapaJohns.com Bowl , South Carolina announced new offensive line coach Shawn Elliott , who previously worked at Appalachian State . Two Connecticut assistants left for other jobs : defensive backs coach Scott Lakatos went to Georgia , while tight ends coach Dave McMichael departed for West Virginia . They were replaced with new defensive backs coach Darrell Perkins , who previously coached at Louisiana @-@ Monroe , and new tight ends coach Jonathan <unk> , a member of the UConn football team between 2001 – 04 who most recently coached at Fordham . 
 The Gamecocks performed better in 2010 . With a 36 – 14 win over Florida , South Carolina won the SEC East division and clinched a spot in the SEC Championship Game for the first time in school history . South Carolina finished 2010 on a down note , however , as they lost the championship game 56 – 17 to eventual 2011 BCS National Championship Game winner Auburn and then lost the 2010 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Bowl 26 – 17 to Florida State . 
 Connecticut began the 2010 season with a 30 – 10 loss at Michigan . They dropped to 3 – 4 after seven games with losses to Temple , Rutgers , and Louisville as Zach Frazer was benched and Cody Endres was dismissed from the team . Frazer returned as the starter and the Huskies turned their season around by winning five straight games , good enough to win a share of the Big East conference championship and the right to play in a BCS bowl , even though they were not ranked in the final BCS standings . UConn played in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl , losing 48 – 20 to Oklahoma . Following the game , coach Randy Edsall left the Huskies to take the head coaching position at Maryland . 
 Multiple players from the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl went on to play professional football ; both teams had two players selected in the 2010 National Football League ( NFL ) Draft . For UConn , wide receiver Marcus Easley was selected in the fourth round by the Buffalo Bills , and cornerback Robert McClain was selected in the seventh round by the Carolina Panthers . Gamecock linebacker Eric Norwood was selected in the fourth round by the Panthers . Defensive end Clifton <unk> , selected in the sixth round by the Cleveland Browns , was the other South Carolina player drafted . 
 The 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl was the final game by that name . Although Papa John 's had an option to renew its sponsorship for two years , it decided not to because of rising costs . The company instead opted to refocus its marketing dollars on the NFL and its sponsorship of Louisville 's home field , Papa John 's Cardinal Stadium . The game 's name changed to the BBVA Compass Bowl starting with the 2011 contest . Per the bowl 's website , the 2010 PapaJohns.com Bowl remains the game in the bowl series with the greatest economic impact , at $ 18 @.@ 4 million . 
 = Batman : Mask of the Phantasm = 
 Batman : Mask of the Phantasm ( also known as Batman : The Animated Movie ) is a 1993 American animated neo @-@ noir superhero mystery film featuring the DC Comics character Batman , and is based on the 1990s Batman : The Animated Series . Released by Warner Bros. , the film was directed by Eric <unk> and Bruce Timm , produced by Alan Burnett , Michael Uslan , Benjamin Melniker and Timm , and has a screenplay credited to Burnett , Paul Dini , Martin Pasko and Michael Reaves . Phantasm features the vocal talents of Kevin Conroy , Mark Hamill and Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . ( all reprising their roles from The Animated Series ) , in addition to the voices of Dana Delany , Hart Bochner , Stacy Keach and Abe Vigoda . The film 's storyline introduces Andrea Beaumont , Bruce Wayne 's former girlfriend , who returns to Gotham City , restarting their romance . Two weeks prior to her return , a new mysterious vigilante begins systematically murdering Gotham 's crime bosses . Due to the person 's dark appearance , he is mistaken for Batman . Now on the run from the police , the Dark Knight must apprehend the killer , clear his name , and deal with the romance between himself and Andrea . 
 The original idea was to release the film as direct @-@ to @-@ video , but Warner Bros. ultimately decided for a theatrical release , giving the filmmakers a strenuous eight @-@ month schedule . Mask of the Phantasm was released on December 25 , 1993 to widespread acclaim from critics , who praised the film for its animation style , dialogue and acting . However , due to the decision to release the film in theaters on such short notice , it failed at the box office . 
 After its release on home video the film has found cult success and developed a cult following . In 2010 , IGN said Mask of the Phantasm was " the Dark Knight 's best big screen story " until Batman Begins ( 2005 ) and ranked it as one of the best animated movies of all time . Time ranked it as one of the 10 best superhero movies ever , and Wired magazine named Kevin Conroy " the best Batman of all time " . 
 The film 's success led to two direct @-@ to @-@ video standalone sequels , Batman & Mr. Freeze : SubZero and Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a conference of crime bosses held in a Gotham City skyscraper , gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure , shortly after Batman bursts in on the meeting . Due to the killer 's resemblance to Batman , the Dark Knight is blamed for Sol 's death . Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a public menace ( despite Commissioner Gordon 's protests ) , then later attends a party at the mansion of billionaire Bruce Wayne , Batman 's secret identity . Reeves teases Bruce about his bad luck with women and for having allowed an old girlfriend , Andrea Beaumont , to get away . 
 In a flashback to 10 years before , Bruce meets Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents ' grave . That night , in one of his first crime @-@ fighting attempts , Bruce foils an armored car robbery while disguised in a black ski @-@ mask and leather jacket . Though he succeeds , he is discouraged that the criminals did not fear him . Around the same time , he begins a romance with Andrea . Eventually , Bruce decides to abandon his plan to become a crime @-@ fighting vigilante and proposes marriage to Andrea . Soon afterward , however , Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father , Carl Beaumont , ending her engagement to Bruce in a Dear John letter . Believing that he has lost his last chance of having a normal life , Bruce dons the mask of Batman for the first time . 
 The mysterious killer finds and murders another gangster , Buzz Bronski . Around the same time , Batman discovers that Andrea has returned to Gotham for the first time in 10 years , and she ends up finding out that Bruce is Batman . Batman soon finds evidence linking Andrea 's father with gangster Salvatore Valestra , for whom both Sol and Bronski once worked as enforcers . When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers , she rebuffs him over the choices that he made while she was away . The killer later targets Valestra , who turns to the Joker for help . The killer arrives at Valestra 's house , and finds the gangster already dead at the Joker 's hands ; the house explodes , with the killer barely escaping . Batman pursues the killer , but is interrupted by the police , who try to arrest Batman . Andrea rescues Batman in her car , and they spend the night together at Wayne Manor . Andrea explains to Bruce that she and her father had left Gotham and had been hiding in Europe from the Valestra mob , to whom he owed a lot of money . Batman comes to suspect that Andrea 's father may be the killer , but later gets Reeves ( who was told of Batman 's innocence by the Joker before being poisoned by him , as he believed the Councilman to be the killer ) to confess that he told the Valestra mob where Beaumont was hiding in return for campaign contributions , and that the mob ordered Beaumont 's death . 
 The killer tracks the Joker to his hideout — an abandoned world 's fair amusement park — and removes its ominous costume : the killer is Andrea , intent on avenging her father 's death at the hands of the Joker , who is revealed to be the last surviving member and professional hitman of the Valestra mob . Having already deduced her identity , and ready for her attack , the Joker fights her . Just before he can kill Andrea , Batman arrives and saves her from the Joker , and begs Andrea to give up her quest for revenge . She refuses , stating that the mob ruined her life by taking away her future with him ; she tells Batman that he himself is driven by revenge before disappearing . Batman battles with the Joker , a struggle that ends in a stalemate . Moments later , Andrea returns and seizes the Joker , bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown in a cloud of smoke as the entire amusement park erupts in a series of rigged explosions . Batman barely escapes by falling into a waterway and being swept away to safety by the current . 
 Alfred later consoles a heartbroken Bruce , telling him that no one could have helped Andrea . Bruce finds a locket containing a picture of himself and Andrea left behind in the Batcave . Meanwhile , Andrea is shown standing alone on the deck of a departing ocean liner . In the final scene , Batman stands alone on the top of a Gotham building ; when the Bat @-@ Signal appears in the sky , he swings off into the night to continue his war on crime .

 = = Production = = 
 Impressed by the success of the first season of Batman : The Animated Series on the Fox Network , Warner Bros. assigned Alan Burnett to write a story for a full @-@ length animated film . Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film , it was Burnett 's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show 's regular rogues gallery . Burnett also cited he " wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show . I wanted a story that got into his head . " The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton 's 1989 film Batman , but writer Michael Reaves said , " We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live @-@ action . " Aiding Burnett in writing the script were : Martin Pasko , who handled most of the flashback segments ; Michael Reaves , who wrote the climax ; and Paul Dini , who claims he " filled in holes here and there . " Orson Welles ' 1941 classic Citizen Kane served as an influence for the flashbacks , a story about loss and the passage of time . 
 Early in production , Warner Bros. decided to release Phantasm with a theatrical release , rather than straight to video . That left less than a year for production time ( most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release ) . Due to this decision , the animators went over the scenes once more in order to accommodate widescreen theatrical aspect ratio . The studio cooperated well , granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control . 
 In addition to the creative control , the studio also increased the production budget to $ 6 million , which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces . The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely computer @-@ generated Gotham City . As a visual joke , sequence director Kevin Altieri set the climax of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City , where Batman and the Joker were giants . This was an homage to a mainstay of Batman comic books of the Dick Sprang era , often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props ( they would later do another homage to Sprang 's works in The New Batman Adventures episode " Legends of the Dark Knight " ) . From start to finish , the film was completed within eight months . 
 Composer Shirley Walker cited the score of Phantasm as a favorite among her own compositions . In an interview with <unk> , Walker explained that the " latin " lyrics used in the Main Title of Mask of The Phantasm were actually names of key Warner Bros staff read backwards . The lyrics are deciphered as follow : 
 = = Themes = = 
 Paul Dini intended each of the flashbacks into Batman 's love life to " have a tendency to get worse , when you hope things will get better . " Bruce 's relationship with Andrea , which at first shows promise , eventually turns into turmoil . At first , Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage , but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship . This eventually leads into Bruce 's decision to become Batman . Richard Corliss of Time felt this scene paralleled Andrea 's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love , when she finds her own father murdered . Both events transform the two people ( Bruce becomes Batman , Andrea becomes the Phantasm ) . One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents ' tombstone saying " I didn 't count on being happy . " According to writer Michael Reaves , this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce 's tragic life , as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life . Reaves also stated : " When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time , [ after Andrea breaks their engagement ] , and Alfred says ' My God ! ' he 's reacting in horror , because he 's watching this man he 's helped raise from childhood , this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life , at last embrace the unspeakable . " 
 = = Comic books and novelizations = = 
 In December 1993 , two novelizations were released . One was written by Alan Burnett , Paul Dini , and Andrew Helfer with the other authored by Geary Gravel . 
 DC Comics released a comic book adaptation written by Kelley Puckett and drawn by Mike <unk> . The comic book adaptation was later included with the VHS release . Kenner who had already released toys for the regular Batman cartoon series , produced several tie in figures for the film , including the Joker and the Phantasm ( packaged unmasked , spoiling a pivotal plot point in the film ) 
 Batman & Robin Adventures Annual # 1 : Shadow of the Phantasm is a comic book sequel to the film , written by Paul Dini , and was released in 1996 .

Mask of the Phantasm has been largely cited by Batman fans and critics alike as one of the best Batman films ever made , and has appeared on numerous " best @-@ of " lists for both animated films and superhero films . In 2010 , IGN said it was " the Dark Knight 's best big screen story " until Batman Begins ( 2005 ) . Wired magazine 's Scott Thill said Kevin Conroy is " the finest Batman on record " . In 2016 , the Nostalgia Critic reviewed the film and called it the best ever cinematic representation of Batman .

 = Batman : The Killing Joke = 
 Batman : The Killing Joke is a 1988 one @-@ shot graphic novel featuring the characters Batman and the Joker written by Alan Moore , illustrated by Brian Bolland , and published by DC Comics . Set in the fictional U.S. city of Gotham , Batman : The Killing Joke provides an origin story for the supervillain the Joker , loosely adapted from the 1951 story arc " The Man Behind the Red Hood ! " . Taking place over two timelines , The Killing Joke depicts the Joker attempting to drive Jim Gordon insane and Batman 's desperate attempt to stop him . 
 Created by Moore as his own take on Joker 's source and psychology , the story became famous for its origin of the Joker as a tragic character ; a family man and failed comedian who suffered " one bad day " that finally drove him insane . Moore stated that he attempted to show the similarities between the two characters . The story 's effects on the mainstream Batman continuity also included the shooting and paralysis of Barbara Gordon ( a.k.a. Batgirl ) , an event that laid the groundwork for her to develop the identity of Oracle . 
 Many critics consider the graphic novel to be the definitive Joker story and one of the best Batman stories ever published . The comic won the Eisner Award for ' Best Graphic Album ' in 1989 and appeared on The New York Times Best Seller List in May 2009 . In 2006 , The Killing Joke was reprinted as part of the trade paperback DC Universe : The Stories of Alan Moore . In 2008 , DC Comics reprinted the story in a deluxe hardcover edition , which features new coloring by Bolland , with a more somber , realistic , and subdued palette than the original . Elements of The Killing Joke have inspired or been incorporated into other aspects of Batman media , such as films and video games . 
 = = Background and creation = = 
 Artist Brian Bolland 's version of the Joker stemmed in part from his having recently seen the film The Man Who Laughs . Giordano 's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker . He recounted , " I thought about it in terms of who 's my favorite writer at the moment , what hero I would really love to do , and which villain ? I basically came up with Alan , Batman and the Joker . " 
 Although the story takes pains to stress that it is merely one possible ' origin story , ' it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity , and a central mutilation of a long @-@ running character had to be specially approved by editor Wein . Bolland said that he saw " Judge Death [ as ] almost a dry run for drawing the Joker . " He also recounted that " by the time Alan had finished Watchmen he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent ... in the end , he only continued to do Killing Joke as a favour to me . " 
 The 48 @-@ page prestige format one @-@ shot comic took a considerable amount of time to produce . Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time @-@ consuming work ; both creators ' then @-@ recently finished 12 @-@ issue <unk> titles — Moore 's Watchmen and Bolland 's Camelot 3000 — had seen delays . He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC , who he says " seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace . " The original editor , Len Wein , left the company , and was replaced by Dennis O 'Neil , a " very hands @-@ off sort of guy , " with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book . 
 Bolland envisaged the flashback sequences in black and white , and instructed Watchmen @-@ colorist John Higgins to use " muted November colors " . He was upset when he saw the finished comic had " garish ... hideous glowing purples and pinks ... and my precious Eraserhead @-@ esque flashback sequences swamped in orange . " The 2008 @-@ published 20th anniversary edition of the book featured new colouring by Bolland , restoring his artistic intentions to the palette . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The man who will become the Joker is an unnamed engineer who quits his job at a chemical company to become a stand @-@ up comedian , only to fail miserably . Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie , he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant he previously worked at so that they can rob the card company next door . During the planning , the police inform him that his wife has died in a household accident . Grief @-@ stricken , the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan , but the criminals strong @-@ arm him into keeping his commitment to them . 
 At the plant , the criminals make him don a special mask to become the infamous Red Hood . Unknown to the engineer , the criminals plan to use this disguise to implicate any accomplice as the mastermind and to divert attention away from themselves . Once inside , they run into security personnel , and a shootout ensues . The criminals are gunned down and the engineer finds himself confronted by Batman , who is investigating the disturbance . 
 Terrified , the engineer jumps into the chemical plant 's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside . Once outside , he discovers , to his horror , that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk @-@ white , stained his lips ruby @-@ red and dyed his hair bright green . This disfigurement , compounded with the man 's misfortunes of that one bad day , drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker . 
 In the present day , the Joker kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and imprisons him in a run @-@ down amusement park , whose owner he has killed , and shoots and paralyzes his daughter Barbara ( alias Batgirl ) . His henchmen then strip Gordon naked and cage him in the park 's freak show . He chains Gordon to one of the park 's rides and forces him to view giant pictures of his wounded daughter , naked , hoping to drive Gordon insane in order to prove that the most upstanding citizen can go mad after having " one bad day . " Once Gordon has run the horrifying gauntlet , the Joker puts him on display in the freak show , ridiculing him as " the average man , " a naïve weakling doomed to insanity . 
 Batman 's attempts to locate Commissioner Gordon are unsuccessful until the Joker sends him a clue that leads him to the amusement park . Batman arrives to save Gordon , and the Joker retreats into the funhouse . Though traumatized by the ordeal , Gordon retains his sanity and moral code , and he insists that Batman capture the Joker " by the book " in order to show him that adhering to the legal process works . Batman enters the funhouse and faces the Joker 's traps , while the Joker tries to persuade his old foe that the world is " a black , awful joke " and thus not worth fighting for . He also states that it takes only " one bad day " to turn an ordinary man insane , and taunts Batman by correctly speculating that it was one bad day where he lost a loved one at the hands of a criminal that drove Batman into becoming a vigilante . Batman tracks down and subdues the Joker , tells him that Gordon survived everything he suffered at the Joker 's hands , and suggests that the Joker is alone in his madness . Batman then attempts to reach out to the Joker and offers to help his old foe recover and put an end to their everlasting war , which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death . The Joker declines , saying it is too late for that . He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke , and proceeds to tell the joke . Batman chuckles at the punch line , accompanying the Joker 's maniacal cackling as the police arrive . The laughter then stops as Batman and Joker disappear as the rain continues to fall . From the text itself , the ending is ambiguous : according to one view , the similar yet different adversaries , whom have been fighting for years , end all of their disputes by having a good laugh ; according to another view , Batman agrees with the Joker , breaking his neck out of panel , causing the laughter to stop abruptly . The ending was purposely left uncertain to allow the reader to decide what happened . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 The book explores Moore 's assertion that , psychologically , " Batman and the Joker are mirror images of each other " by delving into the relationship between the two . The story itself shows how the Joker and Batman came to terms with their respective tragic days , both eventually leading to their present lives and confrontation . Critic Geoff Klock further explained that " both Batman and the Joker are creations of a random and tragic ' one bad day . ' Batman spends his life forging meaning from the random tragedy , whereas the Joker reflects the absurdity of " life , and all its random injustice . " 
 The trials the Joker put Commissioner Gordon through were meant to serve as " proof that there is something buried deep within each lunatic , a nugget of insanity , that is simply waiting for the right moment to spring forth . " Unlike the Joker , Gordon kept his wits and moral code . The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots . The comic book , however , delves deeper in order to present Batman 's own psychology , how he was just as insane as the clown , and how he and the Joker perceived the world according to differing points of view , with the Joker 's interpreted through a joke . 
 The Joker serves as an unreliable narrator . He admits to his own uncertainty , as he has disparate memories of the single event ( " Sometimes I remember it one way , sometimes another ... If I 'm going to have a past , I prefer it to be multiple choice ! " ) , accentuating the comic 's depiction of " a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism ... "

 Although a one @-@ shot , The Killing Joke had an extraordinary impact on the DC Universe — most significantly , Barbara Gordon 's paralysis . DC officially retired the hero in the one @-@ shot comic Batgirl Special # 1 ( July 1988 ) . This eventually led to her identity as Oracle in the Birds of Prey series ( which was later adapted into a TV series of the same title that incorporated Killing Joke elements into its continuity ) and other DC Universe appearances . This event , along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly after The Killing Joke involving the Joker murdering Robin ( Jason Todd ) , Batman : A Death in the Family , leads Batman 's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level . The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later , Stephanie Brown . Gordon 's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three years in DC Comics ' 2011 line @-@ wide title relaunch , The New 52 , which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl . 
 The graphic novel won the Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album and garnered Alan Moore the Best Writer award in 1989 . Hilary Goldstein of IGN Comics praised The Killing Joke , calling it " easily the greatest Joker story ever told , " and adding that " Moore 's rhythmic dialogue and Bolland 's organic art create a unique story often mimicked but never matched . " IGN declared The Killing Joke the third @-@ greatest Batman graphic novel , after The Dark Knight Returns and Batman : Year One . James Donnelly of Pop Syndicate called The Killing Joke " one of the greatest comics of the 20th century , period . " Van Jensen of <unk> said , " Each time [ I read The Killing Joke ] I 'm amazed all over again at how Alan Moore and Brian Bolland teamed to pack such intensity , ferocity and humanity into those pages . B.L. Wooldridge of Batman in Comics called the graphic novel " an incredible story , with Moore at his best and awe @-@ inspiring art by painter Brian Bolland . " Comics historians Robert <unk> and Matthew K. Manning describe it as " the definitive Joker story of all time . " Manning additionally called it " one of the most powerful and disturbing stories in the history of Gotham City . " 
 Andy Shaw of <unk> had a more lukewarm response to The Killing Joke , saying that though " wonderfully executed , " it " suffer [ s ] from its reliance on the rules of the superhero story . " Seb Patrick of Den of Geek also had a mixed response , calling The Killing Joke " one of the most revered and influential ' Batman ' stories ever written and arguably the definitive Joker story , " but adding that it 's " not at the level of [ Alan Moore 's ] true masterpieces [ such as ] Watchmen , V for Vendetta , [ and ] The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . "

 In a 2000 interview , Moore said : " I don 't think it 's a very good book . It 's not saying anything very interesting . " In 2003 , he elaborated : 
 The Killing Joke is a story about Batman and the Joker ; it isn 't about anything that you 're ever going to encounter in real life , because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived . So there 's no important human information being imparted ... Yeah , it was something that I thought was clumsy , misjudged and had no real human importance . It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn 't really relate to the real world in any way . 
 In a 2006 interview with Wizard magazine , Moore was also critical about his decision to cripple Barbara Gordon : " I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the time - and if I remember , I spoke to Len Wein , who was our editor on the project ... [ He ] said , ' Yeah , okay , cripple the bitch . ' It was probably one of the areas where they should 've reined me in , but they didn 't . " 
 In the introduction to the story as it appears in the DC Universe : The Stories of Alan Moore trade paperback , Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a Batman annual story and ended up as a prestige @-@ format book . Bolland recalls that the idea for a one @-@ off Batman story focusing on the Joker — with Batman more of an incidental character — was his . Bolland says that in 1984 , DC editor Dick Giordano told him he could do any project for DC he wanted , and Bolland requested to do a Batman / Joker prestige book with Moore as writer . Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book , and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself ( John Higgins was the colorist ) . Bolland says that " the end result wasn 't quite what I 'd hoped . I don 't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan 's career . " March 2008 saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it : the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of The Killing Joke is completely recolored by Bolland himself . The book made The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2009 .

 Critic Mark Vogler wrote that The Killing Joke provided the Joker " with a sympathetic back story as it presented some of the villain 's most vile offenses . " Moore 's rendition of the Joker 's origin employs elements of the 1951 story " The Man Behind the Red Hood " ( Detective Comics # 168 ) , which established the concept of the Joker originally having been a thief known only as the Red Hood . The tragic and human elements of the character 's story , coupled with his barbaric crimes as the Joker , portray the character as more of a three @-@ dimensional human being . During an interview with Salon , Moore explained that Joker 's psychotic nature could have been caused by a " bad decision " in his life . 
 Much of the Joker 's backstory from The Killing Joke is also referenced in 2004 's " <unk> " ( Batman : Gotham Knights # 50 @-@ 55 ; reprinted with # 66 as Batman : Hush Returns ) , in which the events are observed and reported by the Riddler , who recounts that the pregnant wife of the pre @-@ accident Joker , who is called " Jack " prior to his accident , was kidnapped and murdered by the criminals in order to force his compliance . 
 = = = Feminist interpretations = = = 
 The book has been the subject of feminist critique , criticizing the treatment of Barbara Gordon . Author Brian Cronin notes that " [ many ] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much , and even Moore , in retrospect , has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out . " Author Sharon Packer wrote : " Anyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [ Gordon 's ] accident is advised to consult the source material ... Moore 's The Killing Joke is sadistic to the core . It shows Gordon stripped and mutilated , with before , during , and after photos of the attack displayed before her bound and gagged father , the police commissioner . She is more than merely disabled . " Gail Simone included the character 's paralysis in a list of " major female characters that had been killed , mutilated , and depowered " , dubbing the phenomenon " Women in Refrigerators " in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend 's mutilated body in his refrigerator . Author Jeffrey A. Brown , noted The Killing Joke as an example of the " relatively unequal violence [ female characters ] are subjected to . " in the major DC / Marvel comics industry . While male characters may be critically injured or killed , they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception , while " women on the other hand , are more likely to be casually , but irreparably , wounded such as when Barbara Gordon 's ( the original Batgirl ) spine was shattered by the Joker just for fun and has been restricted to a wheelchair for over a decade now . "

 In 2007 , Geoff Johns wrote a companion story to The Killing Joke entitled " No Joke " that appeared in the series Booster Gold . 
 In the story , Booster Gold is charged by Rip Hunter to go back in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker . Booster arrives at the carnival shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks , only to be attacked by them . He manages to escape ( after the Joker torments him ) , but arrives too late to save Barbara . Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara ( after having struck down Commissioner Gordon ) , Booster attacks the Joker in a rage ; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand , snapping several photos of Booster as well . Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed , but Booster demands to be sent back again . Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her , as it would ensure that she would become Oracle . 
 The story also reveals that Batman kept the photos of Barbara and Booster , and had been waiting until Booster came of age before confronting him . Batman thanks Booster for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship . Eventually , Dick Grayson , who becomes his mentor 's temporary successor as Batman , would also learn about this and offer his thanks as well .

 In 2010 , writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Cliff Chiang collaborated on a one @-@ shot story called " Ladies ' Night " , which was published in the anthology series The Brave and the Bold . The story is set shortly before The Killing Joke , and deals with Zatanna and Wonder Woman struggling to come to terms with the impending attack on Barbara after Zatanna has a precognitive dream about it . Like " No Joke , " the story heavily implies that the heroines cannot alter Barbara 's fate , despite their desire to do so , instead giving her a final night on the town before she loses the use of her legs . The story also implies that Wonder Woman served as the inspiration for Barbara Gordon 's eventual codename of Oracle .

 When DC comics relaunched its universe in 2011 , many of Batman 's stories were erased or altered , but The Killing Joke story was still intact . In the new continuity , Barbara Gordon recovered from the paralysis inflicted upon her by the Joker 's bullet , which lasted for four years . Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility , she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage . During Batman Eternal , Batgirl refers to her paralysis when she tracks a villain to the carnival where the Joker took Gordon after he had shot her , although she only confronts the Joker 's Daughter rather than the Joker himself as Joker is currently presumed dead . 
 On March 13 , 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker @-@ themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June , in celebration of the character 's 75th anniversary . Among them was a cover to Batgirl # 41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke . The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl , who has a red smile painted across her mouth . The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl 's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand , as if gesturing to shoot her . The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character 's history , especially when juxtaposed with the youthful , more optimistic direction of the series at the time . The hashtag # changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant . DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque , who stated , " My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art ... For that reason , I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled . "

 In 2011 , during Comic @-@ Con , actor Mark Hamill stated that he would be willing to voice the Joker for an adaption of The Killing Joke , encouraging fans to campaign for said adaptation , most notably in a tweet made on October 24 , 2011 . Since then , a Facebook page titled " Petition to get Mark Hamill to play the Joker in animated Killing Joke " has been set up by his fans . In 2013 , Bruce Timm also expressed a desire to create the project , saying it was only a possibility . On July 10 , 2015 , during the Justice League : Gods and Monsters panel at San Diego Comic @-@ Con , Bruce Timm announced that an animated film based on the novel is in development and slated to be released in 2016 .

 Influence on other films 
 Along with The Dark Knight Returns , Tim Burton has mentioned that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman : " I was never a giant comic book fan , but I 've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker . The reason I 've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read . I don 't know if it was dyslexia or whatever , but that 's why I loved The Killing Joke , because for the first time I could tell which one to read . It 's my favorite . It 's the first comic I 've ever loved . And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable . " 
 Director Christopher Nolan has mentioned that The Killing Joke served as an influence for the version of the Joker appearing in the 2008 feature film The Dark Knight . Heath Ledger , who played the Joker , stated in an interview that he was given a copy of The Killing Joke as reference for the role . 
 The story is referred to in a flashback scene in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies , Batman : Under the Red Hood . In the movie , the antagonist Red Hood lured Batman to the chemical factory where the Joker 's accident took place . Batman remembered the events like in the comic , where a fleeing Joker attempted to escape while trying to claim that he was set up but accidentally fell into the toxic waste and disfigured him . Red Hood called it Batman 's greatest failure . Jason Todd also refers to Joker crippling Barbara .

 Birds of Prey features a slight retelling of The Killing Joke in the series prologue . In this version Barbara is shot by the Joker , who clearly knows that she is Batgirl , after she opens her front door .

 The 2009 video game Batman : Arkham Asylum adapted a post @-@ The Killing Joke timeline , in that Barbara Gordon feeds Batman information as Oracle . Several references to the story are also made in the game . The Joker 's makeshift throne made of mannequins at the end of the game is almost identical to the one in the graphic novel . During the game , it is revealed that the Joker had been using e @-@ mail under the alias " Jack White , " which Batman identifies as " one of Joker 's oldest aliases . " The Joker even personally makes a knowing reference to the story : " There were these two guys in a lunatic asylum ... Oh hell with it , you 've heard that one before , haven 't you ? " 
 In the 2011 video game Batman : Arkham City , which is the sequel to Batman : Arkham Asylum , when the Joker 's interview tapes are found , he retells his origin from The Killing Joke . In this version , he reveals that the two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone . He apparently blames Batman for what happened to him . Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition , as he has read twelve different accounts of his past , all different , except for one detail : Batman . He then paraphrases a line from the book : " I like to keep things interesting . A wise man once told me that if you have to have an origin story , you 're better off making it multiple choice " . 
 In 2013 video game Injustice : Gods Among Us , a downloadable content Killing Joke pack includes three skins for the character from the story . It includes his Hawaiian attire , the Red Hood , and his hat and long coat . 
 In Batman : Arkham Origins , there are several references to The Killing Joke . When Batman enters a carnival @-@ esque room , Joker tells him he got a great deal on an out @-@ of @-@ service amusement park , " You should have seen the look on the real estate agent 's face when we shook hands on the deal ! " , alluding to Joker 's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run @-@ down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin . In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel , Joker is playable as the Red Hood , walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker , as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made . The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game was a reference to Batman 's talk with " Joker " in the beginning of the graphic novel . While promoting the game , Troy Baker , who voices the Joker in the game , recites a monologue from the graphic novel . 
 In Batman : Arkham Knight , while under the influence of Scarecrow 's latest toxin , Batman hallucinates the Joker 's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight , a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman , and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara 's head . In addition , the DLC side story Batgirl : A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke , including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run @-@ down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control .

 Lewis Nicola ( 1717 – August 9 , 1807 ) was an Irish @-@ born American military officer , merchant , and writer who held various military and civilian positions throughout his career . Nicola is most notable for authoring the Newburgh letter , which urged George Washington to assume a royal title . Born in Dublin , Ireland , Nicola had been an officer in the British Army , serving in Europe before immigrating to the Thirteen Colonies . Establishing a residence in Philadelphia with his family , Nicola opened a library in 1767 and was active in colonial philosophical organizations . As a result of his work to establish the American Philosophical Society , he was elected as one of its curators . When the American Revolution broke out , Nicola offered his services to the colonial government , which eventually appointed him to various positions with local forces . 
 In 1777 , Nicola proposed that the Continental Congress establish the Invalid Corps . The Congress accepted his proposal and appointed him as its commander . The Corps was stationed at various Pennsylvania locations before moving to West Point , New York . In 1782 , after the end of most hostilities but before the signing of the Treaty of Paris , Nicola wrote the Newburgh letter , which was received coldly by Washington . Returning to civilian life , Nicola nevertheless was still active in military affairs , and was recalled to service during the 1790s , despite his advanced age . During this period , he continued to research for the American Philosophical Society , writing an especially controversial document entitled The Divinity of Jesus Christ Considered , From Scripture Evidences , in which he claimed that the divinity of Jesus Christ is not supported by scripture . He died in 1807 , in the possession of only $ 55 .

 Very little is known of Nicola 's early years . He was born in 1717 in Dublin , Ireland to a British Army officer . His grandparents were Huguenot refugees , and he was 511 / 512 French and 1 / 512 Italian by blood . His parents provided him with a strong educational background and bought him a commission in January 1740 . Later into that year , he married his first wife , Christiana Doyle , on September 19 . During the 1740s , Nicola was stationed in various Irish cities : Galway , Derry , Cork , among others . He was briefly stationed in Flanders , Belgium , in 1745 before he moved back to Charles Fort near Kinsale . 
 = = First decade in Pennsylvania = = 
 Doyle died in August 1759 , and Nicola married his second wife , Jane Bishop , on April 18 , 1760 . Their family decided to move to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and they arrived August 1766 . Upon the arrival Nicola started his own dry goods store . This did not work , and he eventually opened a library in September 1767 . It started with nearly 200 to 300 volumes before expanding to over 1 @,@ 000 . Throughout the next couple of years , Nicola moved the library to different spots before finally settling to Spruce Street and renaming it " General Circulating Library " . 
 With the help of his friend John Morgan , Nicola was admitted into the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge . By the following year , he became a part of the committee to help a merger with the American Philosophical Society . The merger was completed in November 1768 , and Nicola was elected as one of the curators . At the start of the next year , Nicola decided to quit the dry food business for good and focus more on writing , stating " [ Magazines were ] the taste of the age , and found to possess many conveniences , such as gratifying the curiosity of the public , and serving as a repository for many small , though valuable pieces that would otherwise be lost to the world . " He began editing his new periodical , the American Magazine , or General Repository , and the first issue was published in January 1769 . This magazine , devoted to science , poetry , British and American news , folded in December after only nine issues . Nicola , however , continued to conduct research and write articles for the Society .

 Due to financial difficulties , Nicola and his family moved between various Pennsylvanian cities throughout the 1770s . Once the American Revolutionary War broke out , however , he realized that his military skills were probably most needed in Philadelphia . In July 1775 , Nicola was hired by the Pennsylvania Council of Safety to inspect the local defenses in place along the banks of the Delaware River . Since this was the only military position offered to him , in January 1776 Nicola opened a beer @-@ selling shop . Shortly thereafter , he opened a school to help children in various disciplines of mathematics and engineering . This endeavor was short @-@ lived , however , as the Pennsylvania Council of Safety gave him a second military position , this time as a barracks master . While attaining that position ( which he was granted in February ) , Nicola composed and presented to the Council of Safety a " Plan of a Powder Magazine " and saw to the repair of the city jailhouse , for which he was reimbursed $ 226 by the Continental Congress . On December 2 , 1776 , Nicola was made Town Major of Pennsylvania . 
 = = Tenure with the Invalid Corps = = 
 = = = Invalid Corps under Nicola in the early years = = = 
 In March 1777 , Nicola proposed to the Continental Congress the formation of an " Invalid Corps , " a group of men unfit for combat but still able to perform other military duties . In June , the Continental Congress accepted the proposal , appointing Nicola the commander of about 1 @,@ 000 troops divided into eight companies of soldiers . The Invalid Corps was stationed in Philadelphia for most part of the Revolutionary War , but it was forced to move once General William Howe advanced into the city in 1777 . 
 On September 25 , 1777 , the Invalid Corps retreated to Fort Mifflin . Due to sickness , lack of clean water , and worries about British incursions , it was recommended to Nicola that he move the Corps to Trenton , New Jersey . Upon arriving at Trenton , Nicola moved to defend locals ' property , seeing " a large vessel in the river [ near Bordentown ] with a very valuable Cargo belonging to Congress which was in danger of falling into the enemies hands " , and taking thirty men to claim the cargo . 
 Following its brief stay in Trenton , the Invalid Corps moved to Allentown , Pennsylvania , as suggested by Richard Peters on September 29 , 1777 . However , instead of Allentown , the Corps was eventually stationed at Easton and Bethlehem , Pennsylvania to assist in the management of hospitals and stores . Like the rest of the Continental Army , the Invalid Corps suffered harshly from the winter of 1777 to 1778 . After a brief period in the camp of Valley Forge in the spring of 1778 , the Invalid Corps moved back to their original quarters at Philadelphia , just after the British evacuated from it . 
 = = = Service prior to 1782 = = = 
 The Invalid Corps continued its many moves , including one from Pennsylvania to Boston . However , for the next three years , the Corps remained either in Philadelphia or the future Massachusetts capital . During this three @-@ year period , Nicola drew the " Plan of the English Lines near Philadelphia " , which showed the locations of important fortifications from the Delaware River to Schuylkill River as well as other locations of British military facilities . Following the drawing of " Plan " , Nicola submitted two papers where he obtained information from the British to Congress : " A Scheme for a Partisan Corps " and " Judicious remarks on a proposed reformation in the Army " . Moreover , he strengthened the Corps by recruiting soldiers around Philadelphia . 
 On June 13 , 1781 , Nicola and the Invalid Corps was given the order by Congress to move to West Point , New York . This , however , was difficult to accomplish . On June 26 , Nicola wrote a letter to George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them . Another reason hindering the move was pay ; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months . A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps . After their leave to Pennsylvania , John David <unk> , a captain of the Invalid Corps , sent a letter to Washington on July 20 , 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly . In the note , <unk> requested Nicola 's arrest . Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington , who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point . Washington , who did not show any favoritism to either , sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter . 
 Upon the arrival of the Invalid Corps at West Point , the charges were dropped , and Nicola was cleared of all charges . On August 4 , 1781 , Nicola complained to George Washington that the Corps would have great difficult during the winter time . Two months later on September 19 , Nicola complained to General Horatio Gates about McDougall 's lack of respect to the Corps . Eventually , Nicola proposed to Washington that the Invalid Corps should move back to Philadelphia ; however , for various reasons , Washington denied it . 
 During the Corps ' tenure at West Point , Nicola faced many challenges . Firstly , his troops did not act the way he wanted . In October 1777 , Nicola sent out an arrest warrant for Sergeant Major Jonathan Guy for giving uniforms of the Continental Army to the British . The other example was in April 1778 ; Nicola stopped robberies done by members of the Corps in Easton . Secondly , Nicola was unable to fill the higher ranks because of the lack of qualifications from the men . In a letter to Washington , Nicola wrote that without men , he was unable to " keep the men under proper discipline " . During court trials , Nicola had to borrow men from other units as the jury . The third problem was the lack of enlisted men for the Corps . 
 The final problem was the poor financial situation that Nicola was in . In a letter to the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7 , 1779 , Nicola asked for a pay raise , saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes . Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves . On February 5 , 1782 , the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major ; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time . During that same month and struggling for money , Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps . Even that , however , failed to give the Invalid Corps its money . 
 = = = The Newburgh letter = = = 
 On May 22 , 1782 , Nicola wrote the Newburgh letter to George Washington , from his army quarters in Newburgh , New York . Nicola used the first part of the letter to describe a financial hardship that both he and many of the men under his command were facing - their lack of pay . Most of the Army had been waiting for months — some even for years — for their pay from Congress . The justification for this was found in the Articles of Confederation , which allowed the Continental Congress to set up an army in time of war , but was not obligated to levy taxes . The right to collect taxes was reserved for the respective states , most of which were unable to afford the maintenance of an army . Nicola believed that this condition was the manifested weakness of a republic , writing , " When the benefits of a mixed government are pointed out and duly considered , will be examined readily adopted [ ... ] " . 
 Alluding to the person on Nicola wrote Washington , it is well recognized that " The same abilities which have lead us , through difficulties apparently insurmountable by human power , to victory and glory , those qualities that have merited and universal esteem and veneration Obtained the of an army , would be most likely to conduct and direct us in the smoother paths of peace . 
 After concluding his criticism of the republican form of government , Nicola suggested that Washington take the title of king . Recognizing that the terms " tyranny " and " monarchy " had too many negative connotations at the time , Nicola advised using an alternative title in the near future , " [ ... ] But if all other things were once adjusted I believe strong argument might be produced for admitting the title of king , Which I conceive would be attended with some material advantages . 
 Washington was aware that some feared he aspired to be an " American Cromwell " . In his reply , dated the same day he gave Nicola a decidedly clear answer , Washington said , " No incident in the course of the war in me triggers painful feelings as your message , that such ideas are circulating in the army , as you expressed it " . Washington mentioned that he knew not what part of his conduct could have given rise to such a petition , which he thought a " calamity " facing the United States . David Humphreys and Jonathan Trumbull , two of Washington 's aides , certified in a rare precautionary measure that proved the document to be genuine . 
 Nicola responded <unk> to the harsh rejection of his complaints and suggestions . On May 23 he replied to Washington , expressing his sadness at displeasing Washington , and claiming that " nothing had ever affected " him so greatly as his " reproof . " Furthermore , Nicola asked Washington to evaluate every mistake that he had committed . Washington 's answer to this and two other letters of apology written by Nicola on May 24 and 28 are not known . However , the relationship between Nicola and Washington soon returned to its prior normalcy . 
 = = Dissolution of the Invalid Corps and promotion = = 
 In November 1782 , Nicola complained to Washington about the fact that secretary at war General Benjamin Lincoln wanted the Invalid Corps dissolved , saying its costliness affected the military more than its benefits . Nicola argued against its dissolution ; he claimed that no other regiment had done more service than the Corps . Against the recommendation of Washington , the dissolution of the Invalid Corps was ordered by the Continental Congress in May 1783 . Between June and August , Nicola was back on the road to Philadelphia . There he resided for two months after the official conclusion of peace by the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) , serving as a commissioner in regard to the settlement of matters concerning him and his regiment . On November 27 , 1793 he was elevated to the rank of brigadier general . In June 1784 , Congress finally charged him , for a period of four and a half months , to draw up the certificates for members of his former command . 
 = = Final years = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1780s , Nicola advocated the construction of a stagecoach route between Philadelphia and Reading . Failing to secure the route , he planned to temporarily operate a guest house . For financial reasons , he instead became manager of the workhouse in Philadelphia in 1788 . In 1793 , Nicola became inspector of the Philadelphia city militia brigade . During the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 , he briefly returned to his former position as barrack master and commander of the city of Philadelphia . 
 During this period , Nicola was maintained his affiliation with the American Philosophical Society , serving multiple terms as curator and continuing with his research . In 1791 , he wrote a controversial pamphlet entitled , The Divinity of Jesus Christ Considered , From Scripture Evidences . This pamphlet concluded that Christ 's divinity cannot be found in scripture . Due to its controversial nature , Nicola considered publishing it in various forms , but eventually decided on attaching his name to the writing . 
 Nicola 's second wife died in 1797 , and he retired the following year . In 1798 , he moved to Alexandria , Virginia to be closer to his daughter . He died on August 8 , 1807 . Earlier in that year , because of financial troubles , he had added the words " any deficiency I presume the Cincinnati society will make good " to his will . At the time of his death , Nicola possessed only $ 55 .

 = Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 = 
 Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 ( ペルソナ3 , Perusona Surī ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Atlus , and chronologically the fourth installment in the Persona series , a subseries of the Megami Tensei franchise . Persona 3 was originally published in 2006 on the PlayStation 2 by Atlus in Japan ; the North American release of the game was delayed due to issues with the publication of the official art book . An add @-@ on disc titled Persona 3 FES , containing a " director 's cut " of the original game , as well as a new epilogue , was released alongside Persona 3 in Japan in 2007 , and in 2008 in other territories , with a re @-@ release of FES on the PlayStation Network in 2012 . 
 In Persona 3 , the player takes the role of a male high @-@ school student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad ( SEES ) , a group of students investigating the Dark Hour , a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of . During the Dark Hour , the player enters Tartarus , a large tower containing Shadows , creatures that feed on the minds of humans . To fight the Shadows , each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona , a manifestation of a person 's inner self . The game 's most iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their Personas : by firing a gun @-@ like object called an Evoker at their head . In addition to the standard elements of role @-@ playing games , Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games , as the game 's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year , making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle . 
 There are official soundtracks for Persona 3 , Persona 3 FES , and Persona 3 Portable , as well as an arrangement album containing music from multiple games in the Persona series . Music from the game has also been performed live at two concerts dedicated to the Persona series . Persona 3 has seen a manga adaption , multiple radio dramas . Critical reception of Persona 3 was mainly positive ; reviewers enjoyed the game 's social elements , while some found its combat and environments repetitive . Persona 3 FES 's epilogue was said to give narrative closure to the original game , although it was criticized for not featuring the simulation aspect of Persona 3 . 
 A PlayStation Portable version of Persona 3 , titled Persona 3 Portable was released in Japan on November 1 , 2009 , and in North America on July 6 , 2010 . The remake adds the ability to play as a female protagonist , new story elements and music , and a new interface designed for the PSP . In 2008 , an original non @-@ canon anime set 10 years after the events of Persona 3 , titled Persona : Trinity Soul , was released in Japan and later in North America . Two fighting games that continued the storyline of select members of <unk> , Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax , were released in 2012 and 2013 respectively . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Persona 3 combines elements of traditional role @-@ playing games and simulation games . The game follows the protagonist character , balancing their daily life of going to school and building relationships with other people with fighting evil beings known as Shadows during the mysterious Dark Hour . Each day is divided up between various time zones , the most common of which are " After School / Daytime " and " Evening " . With the exception of scripted events , such as plot progression or special events , the player is free to choose how each day is spent , with most activities causing time to pass on . The types of activities and characters that can be interacted with vary depending on the day of the week and time of day . Additionally , some activities are limited by the protagonist 's three attributes ; Academics , Charm , and Courage , which can be built by performing various activities or making certain correct choices . During the evening , players can choose to visit Tartarus , the game 's main dungeon , where they can build their party 's experience and gain new items . On the day of the full moon , players will participate in a boss battle in order to progress the story . 
 = = = Personas and Social Links = = = 
 The main element of the game are the Personas , various creatures and monsters which are associated with the Major Arcana of the Tarot . Each Persona has its own set of strengths and weaknesses , and possess various abilities , ranging from offensive and support abilities , to passive abilities that support the character . Whereas each of the game 's main characters has their own Persona , some of which change form as the story progresses , the protagonist is capable of wielding multiple Personas , which can be switched between during battles . New Personas can be created by visiting the Velvet Room and fusing together multiple Personas , passing along certain moves from the Personas used . The Personas that a player can create are limited by the current level of the protagonist . Personas can also be obtained from Shuffle Time following battles , and previously obtained Personas can be summoned from the Persona Compendium for a fee . The Velvet Room additionally allows players to take on quests , such as retrieving certain items , in order to obtain a reward . 
 New to the series are Social Links , bonds that are formed with several of the game 's characters , with each Social Link representing a specific Major Arcana . By spending time with these characters , these Social Links increase in rank . When creating a Persona of a particular Arcana , an experience bonus will be granted if that Arcana possesses a Social Link , with greater bonuses awarded depending on the rank . Performing certain activities or carrying a Persona of a respective Arcana can help bring a Social Link closer to increasing in Rank . <unk> out a Social Link gives players the ability to create specific Personas of each Arcana . Conversely , negative actions , such as incorrect dialogue choices or dating multiple characters , can result in a Reversed Social Link , which can prevent players from summoning Personas of that Arcana until fixed . In the worst @-@ case scenario , a Reversed Social Link can break , effectively removing all Personas of that Arcana from the game . 
 = = = Tartarus and Combat = = = 
 Tartarus is the game 's main dungeon , which can be visited during the evening , provided the conditions allow it ( e.g. the absence of some characters may prevent the player from visiting Tartarus that night ) . The player may order the other party members to split up to explore the area , or automatically attack Shadows on sight . Players will eventually come across boss floors , in which the player must defeat powerful Shadows in order to continue their progress . Additionally , certain floors halt further progress through the tower until the story progresses . Occasionally , innocent civilians will wander into Tartarus , winding up on certain floors . Rescuing these civilians safely before a full moon appears grants bonus rewards obtained from the police station . Spending too much time in Tartarus may cause characters to become " Tired " or " Sick " , which can affect their performance during battle . Additionally , if the protagonist becomes Tired or Sick , some activities , such as studying at night , may be hampered . Players can recover their status by taking certain items , visiting the infirmary , or going to bed early . 
 Battle occurs when the player comes into contact with a Shadow roaming the floor , with the battle party consisting of whoever is in close proximity . Attacking the Shadow without being noticed will give the player an advantage , whilst the enemy gains an advantage if the player is attacked first . Battles use the " Press Turn " system , in which both allies and enemies take turns to attack using weapons , items , or Persona abilities . Using the Tactics option , the player can assign specific battle AI to each party member ( in Persona 3 Portable , they may also choose to issue direct commands ) . Offensive attacks are divided into three physical types ; Strike , Slash , and Pierce , and six elements ; Fire , Ice , Electricity , Wind , Light , and Dark , attributes of which both Personas and Shadows may possess strengths and weaknesses against . Physical abilities use up HP whilst elemental and support magic use SP . By exploiting an enemy 's weakness or performing a critical attack , characters can knock the opponent down , granting that character an extra turn , though enemies can also take advantage of an ally 's weakness to gain an additional turn . If the player manages to knock all opponents down , they may be granted the opportunity to perform an All @-@ Out Attack , in which all able party members assault the enemies for massive damage . Allies who lose all of their HP can be revived using revival items and abilities , but if the protagonist loses all of their HP , the game will end . 
 When a battle is won , players gain experience points which are divided amongst the party members . Earning enough experience allows Personas to increase in level , granting improved stats and new abilities . Some Personas may also grant Skill Cards , which can be given to other Personas to teach them new abilities . Raising the protagonist 's level will allow higher level Personas to be summoned in the Velvet Room , as well as allow the player to carry more Personas . At the end of certain battles , a minigame known as Shuffle Time may appear , in which players select a card from a set that is shuffled around . These can grant bonuses , such as additional experience points , cash , or restored health , or give the player new Personas . However , selecting a cursed card will cause an extremely powerful monster , Death , to appear on the current floor .

 The story of Persona 3 takes place in a 2009 CE Japanese city called Iwatodai ( <unk> ) , built and funded by the Kirijo Corporation . Experiments carried out ten years ago created the Dark Hour , a period of time that exists between one day and the next . During this time , most people are transmogrified into coffins and are not aware of the Dark Hour ; however , there is a select group of people who aren 't . The Dark Hour bends reality ; Gekkoukan High School , where most of the characters attend school during the day , becomes a huge labyrinthine tower called Tartarus , and beasts known as Shadows roam the area , preying on the minds of those still conscious . The Shadows leave their victims in near @-@ catatonic states outside of the Dark Hour . To investigate and learn about the Dark Hour , Shadows , and Tartarus , the " Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad " , or SEES , was created . SEES is a group of high @-@ schoolers capable of summoning beings known as Personas to combat Shadows . The Persona 3 instruction manual describes Personas as being " a second soul that dwells deep within a person 's heart . It is an entirely different personality that emerges when a person is confronted with something from outside his world . " Persona @-@ users usually summon their Persona by firing a gun @-@ like object called an Evoker at their head . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The main character of Persona 3 is a silent protagonist , named by the player at the start of the game . He is a teenage boy , orphaned as a child , returning to the city he grew up in ten years prior to attend Gekkoukan High School . After learning of his ability to summon a Persona , he joins SEES , which is composed of students at his school : Yukari Takeba , a popular , cheerful girl ; Akihiko Sanada , a calm and collected senior who leads the school 's boxing team ; and Mitsuru Kirijo , the Student Council President and daughter of the head of the Kirijo Group , who provides backup during battle . As the game progresses , SEES gains several new members : Junpei Iori , a class clown and the Protagonist 's best friend ; Fuuka Yamagishi , a shy girl who replaces Mitsuru as a support character ; Aigis , a female android designed by the Kirijo Group to fight Shadows ; Ken <unk> , a middle schooler whose mother was killed by a Persona @-@ user ; Shinjiro Aragaki , a former member of SEES who quit due to past events ; and Koromaru , a dog capable of summoning a Persona .

 Persona 3 begins with the Protagonist transferring to Gekkoukan High School , and moving into a dorm in the city . After learning of his ability to summon a Persona , he is asked to join SEES , and is eventually elected its leader in combat . Additional members join SEES over time , all students attending Gekkoukan : Junpei , who had only recently discovered his ability to summon a Persona ; Akihiko , whose arm injury prevented him from fighting ; and Fuuka , who replaces Mitsuru as the team 's support member . After awakening to his Persona ability , the Protagonist is transported to the Velvet Room , which its proprietor , Igor , says is a realm between " dream and reality " . Igor explains to him that his Persona ability is special : he is the only member of SEES capable of wielding multiple Personas in battle . In @-@ game , the Velvet Room is where the player may fuse two or more Personas to create a new one . Igor also encourages the Protagonist to meet people and form bonds with them , known as Social Links . According to Igor , the power of his Social Links will determine his potential in combat . 
 On nights when the moon is full , the city is attacked by a Shadow more powerful than the ones found in Tartarus . After several of these incidents , Mitsuru is forced to reveal to the team the origin of Tartarus and the Dark Hour . Ten years earlier , the Kirijo Group , a research company founded by Mitsuru 's grandfather , began amassing and containing Shadows . They studied and performed experiments on them , in order to harness their power . However , the experiments went awry , allowing the Shadows to escape and assemble into twelve larger creatures . Each is affiliated with one of the twelve Major Arcana . SEES 's leader , Shuji Ikutsuki , informs them that , if they were to defeat all twelve of the greater Shadows , Tartarus and the Dark Hour would disappear forever . 
 As the year continues , the group adds two more Persona @-@ users to their team : Ken and Koromaru . While vacationing in Yakushima , Junpei , Akihiko , and the Protagonist encounter Aigis , who had recently escaped the laboratory where she was kept , despite having been deactivated for years . For reasons she cannot explain , she has a need to be near the Protagonist , even breaking into his dorm room at night to monitor him . Aigis is also enlisted in SEES . After defeating the twelfth and final Shadow , SEES learns that they had been misled by Shuji Ikutsuki . By destroying the greater Shadows , they have freed parts of a being known as Nyx , which will bring about the end of the world if it is fully restored . Nyx , or the " maternal being " , is the creator of Shadows ; she is drawn to Earth by The Appriser , or " Death " , a Shadow of the Death <unk> . SEES encounters The Appriser disguised as Ryoji Mochizuki , a recent transfer student to Gekkoukan High School . 
 The Shadow experiments performed ten years earlier created the Death Shadow , albeit in an incomplete state . Aigis , unable to defeat the Shadow , sealed it inside the Protagonist , who was a child at the time . By defeating the twelve greater Shadows , the Death Shadow was recreated . Its purpose is to usher Nyx into the world , who will bring about the extinction of the human race . Ryoji insists that Nyx cannot be defeated ; however , he offers SEES an alternative . If they were to kill him , their memories of the Dark Hour and Tartarus would vanish , allowing them to continue life unaware of their impending death . Aigis , who now realizes why she wanted to protect the Protagonist , begins to believe that she is useless . She urges SEES to kill Ryoji , as they cannot defeat Nyx . Through encouragement from her friends , however , she gains the resolve to join with SEES as they attempt to fight Nyx . 
 On December 31 , New Year 's Eve , the player must decide whether to kill Ryoji . If the protagonist kills him , the game cuts to Graduation Day , with the entirety of SEES ( barring Aigis ) losing their memories of the Dark Hour and the Shadows , ending on a dark note as they prepare to celebrate in blissful ignorance until Nyx inevitably brings about the fall . If he is spared , then the game continues , and on January 31 , SEES ascends to the roof of Tartarus to face Ryoji , who has transformed into the Nyx Avatar . While they are able to defeat him , Nyx continues to descend to Earth . As this is happening , the Protagonist is summoned to the Velvet Room , where Igor reminds him that the power of his Social Links would determine his potential . The Protagonist hears the voices of his friends encouraging him . The strength of his Social Links grants him the power of the " Universe " , allowing him to seal away Nyx from humanity . The world returns to normal , though the memories of the past year related to the Dark Hour are lost to the members of SEES . However , Aigis and the Protagonist do remember . On Graduation Day , the two go to the roof of the school , where the members of SEES had promised to meet should they stop Nyx and live to see their graduation . As Mitsuru gives her graduation speech , she and the rest of SEES suddenly regain their memories , and the group rush to the roof to fulfill the promise they all made . It is here that Aigis thanks the Protagonist for giving her a purpose in life : protecting him . 
 = = Development and design = = 
 Persona 3 began development in 2004 , after the completion of Shin Megami Tensei : Nocturne and Digital Devil Saga . In March 2006 , the first details on Persona 3 were unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsū . In addition to announcing the game 's Japanese release date of July 13 , the three @-@ page article detailed the game 's premise , combat systems , and the Social Link system ( known as " Community " in the Japanese version ) . It also profiled three characters — the Protagonist , Junpei , and Yukari — as well as their respective Personas : Orpheus , Hermes and Io . 
 The main character artist and art director for Persona 3 was Shigenori Soejima . Character artist for the previous Persona titles , Kazuma Kaneko , gave the job to Soejima so he could gain more experience . Soejima felt a degree of pressure when designing the characters as he did not want to disappoint the series ' fanbase . The goal was to make players of the Megami Tensei series feel gratified that they had supported the Persona series . In an interview , Soejima compared the game 's aesthetic and style to a fantastical manga , citing its use of mecha @-@ like Persona and Mitsuru 's flamboyant styling . Soejima returned to design the character Metis for FES . The anime cutscenes for Persona 3 and FES were animated by animation production company Point Pictures . 
 In an interview with the magazine Play , lead director for Persona 3 Katsura Hashino discussed why the decision was made to have party members be directed by an artificial intelligence : " I think it 's more fun to have the party members controlled by their AI , so each member 's characteristics and personality are on vivid display . There were no objections raised among the Persona 3 development team , either . " He also notes that the system " wasn 't well received " by players of the game . Later , the use of AI for the secondary party members was described as a stylistic choice representing the game 's theme of conquering the fear of death through " bonds " : each character was their own person , and the player could only influence things by interacting with them . Persona 3 does not include the negotiation elements of previous Persona or Megami Tensei games , which allowed players to talk to enemies during a battle to recruit them , earn money , or obtain items . However , the social elements of Persona 3 ( and its successor , Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 4 ) are considered the equivalent of the negotiation system by the development team . Maragos said in a 1UP.com interview that " negotiation isn 't gone ... And [ it ] still factors into Persona Fusion ; it 's still a big part of the game . I feel like it 's disguised , but it 's there . " 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 The localization of Persona 3 was handled by Yu Namba and Nich Maragos . During this process , the team worked to leave as much of the original Japanese content intact , continuing a trend started with Persona 2 : Eternal Punishment . One of the ideas had by the team for Persona 3 was to use it as a medium for introducing Japanese culture to a western audience . While localizing Persona 3 for English @-@ speaking countries , the honorifics used by the characters in the original Japanese script were retained . According to Maragos , their use " [ added ] so much more meaning to the text " . In an interview with RPGamer , project editor Yu Namba explained that during the process of translation , some of the Japanese humor , " things that made absolutely no sense in western culture … were replaced with jokes that at least somewhat parallel the originals . " One of the changes that needed to be made was to the school tests , which were based around questions on the English language . A similar change was Mitsuru 's second language : in the original version it was English , but for the localized version her second language was changed to French . This choice was influenced by her cultured appearance . In addition , in @-@ game references to the original Shin Megami Tensei were altered to references to Revelations : Persona . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack for Persona 3 was composed entirely by Shoji Meguro , with the sole exception of " <unk> Act " , which was composed by Yosuke <unk> . It was released as a two disc soundtrack in Japan by Aniplex on July 19 , 2006 . A selection of tracks from the full soundtrack was bundled with the North American release of the game . An arranged album , titled Burn My Dread <unk> : Persona 3- , was also released in Japan by Aniplex on April 18 , 2007 . It contains eleven arrangements of tracks from Persona 3 , as well as an extended version of the song " Burn My Dread . " Meguro stated that the development of Persona 3 was one of his first opportunities to fully realize his music in video games . The soundtrack features a high use of vocals , though Meguro did not consider this as special or exceptional . A tune from previous Persona titles he rearranged was " Aria of the Soul " , the theme of the Velvet Room . The game 's battle theme , " Mass Destruction " , was originally just a prototype , but the reception to it was so positive that it went into the final game . In the past , the hardware limitations of the original PlayStation required him to compose music in 100 @-@ 200 kilobyte samples , which he felt made the music sound " pretty cheap " . The move to the PlayStation 2 allowed for real @-@ time streaming of music . Meguro considers this " the point at which [ he ] was finally able to express [ his ] music without making any compromises " . He was also worried about the pronunciation of the English lyrics . 
 Meguro returned to compose new music for Persona 3 : FES . Released in Japan by Aniplex on May 2 , 2007 , the soundtrack contained the original score for FES , as well as arrangements of music from earlier games in the Persona series . " The Snow Queen " , composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya , is a remix of the theme in Revelations : Persona . " Maya 's Theme " , composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya , and " Time Castle " , composed by Toshiko Tasaki , are remixes of tracks from Persona 2 : Innocent Sin . Persona 3 Portable contains new background music , which can be heard if the player chooses to control the game 's new female protagonist .

 Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 FES ( <unk> , Perusona Surī <unk> ) is an add @-@ on disc for Persona 3 containing updates to the original game , as well as a new epilogue in which the player controls Aigis . FES was released in Japan on April 19 , 2007 , as both a stand @-@ alone game , and with the " director 's cut " version of Persona 3 . Overseas , the combined edition was published in North America by Atlus U.S.A. on April 22 , 2008 , and in Europe by Koei on October 17 , 2008 . According to the game 's director , Katsura Hashino , the subtitle " Fes " is derived from the word " festival " . This version of the game was re @-@ released as a PS2 Classic on PSN for the PS3 in 2012 . Players of the original Persona 3 are given the option of transferring certain data from the original version 's save file , such as the player 's compendium , social @-@ related stats , and maxed Social Link items . 
 The expansion to Persona 3 , in addition to adding new content to the main game ( referred to as " The Journey " , or " Episode Yourself " in the Japanese version ) , includes an epilogue to the original story titled " The Answer " ( " Episode Aegis " in the Japanese version ) . The core gameplay of The Answer is similar to that of The Journey , although the Social Link system has been removed , and the player does not attend school . 
 = = = = The Answer = = = = 
 The events of The Answer begin on March 31 , shortly after the end of the original game . During the opening sequence , it is revealed that the Protagonist has died ; the other characters speculate that his death is related to his defeating Nyx . The school year has ended , and the dorm is to be closed down soon . Aigis reveals to the group that she will not be attending school next year . During their last dinner party , the SEES members discover that they are trapped in their dorm , and that the day March 31 is repeating itself . Later , a large door @-@ like hole opens in the floor of the dorm , and SEES is attacked by Metis , an anti @-@ shadow weapon similar to Aigis . In the midst of fighting Metis to protect her friends , Aigis 's Persona , Athena , transforms into Orpheus , the original Persona of the Protagonist . She also gains the Protagonist 's Wild Card ability . Aigis is able to subdue Metis , whose actions were an attempt to end the time skip and save Aigis , who she calls her " sister " . 
 Underneath the dorm is the Abyss of Time , the cause of the time skip . The Abyss contains seven doors , the insides of which contain multi @-@ floor dungeons , similar in design to Tartarus ; it is in these areas that the game 's combat takes place . At the top of each dungeon , the characters witness an event from the past of a member of SEES . After seeing several of these flashbacks , the characters discern that the event shown in each door relates to how that person had awakened to their Persona . At the top of the seventh and final door , SEES fights a Shadow @-@ like version of the Protagonist . After defeating it , each of them obtain a key . By combining the keys , they would be able to end the time skip and leave the dorm . However , Metis presents SEES with an alternative : instead of unlocking the front door of the dorm , they may also use the keys to travel back in time , to before the fight against Nyx and the death of the Protagonist . Now unable to agree on how to use the keys , the characters determine that they must fight each other to decide . Aigis , Fuuka and Metis claim all eight keys , which fuse into the Final Key . After debating on what to do now , they discover a third , new door in the Abyss of Time , which the group uses ( without the Final Key ) to travel to the moment the Protagonist sealed Nyx from the world . 
 Metis explains that the purpose of the seal created by the Protagonist was not to seal away Nyx herself ( who is not inherently evil ) , but to prevent humanity 's despair from calling out to Nyx and bringing about the Fall once more . The subconscious will of mankind to despair and wish for death constantly rebirths a monster called Erebus that summons Nyx to destroy the world ; Metis implies that Erebus 's contact with Nyx is what caused the Fall ( that was prevented by SEES ) . SEES realizes that the wishes that created Erebus also came from them , and so they fight it , and are able to defeat it . Mitsuru points out that Erebus will return , as humans will never stop wishing for death . After breaking the time skip and exiting through the front door of the dorm with the Final Key , Metis , Aigis , and the rest of SEES are summoned to the Velvet Room , much to Igor 's ( pleasant ) surprise . It is here they learn of Metis 's true origins : that she is a manifestation of a part of Aigis 's personality . Distraught over the death of the Protagonist , she no longer wanted to live like a human , and wished to return to being a machine . However , after being set free from the Abyss of Time , Aigis changes her mind , deciding to continue to attend school , something she had chosen not to do earlier .

 Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 Portable ( ペルソナ3 <unk> , Perusona Surī <unk> ) , an enhanced port of Persona 3 for the PlayStation Portable , was released in Japan on November 1 , 2009 , and released in North America on July 6 , 2010 . It came to most of Europe on 29 April 2011 and the UK on 28 April 2011 . The announcement in Famitsū revealed that the player would have the option to play as a female character . This selection alters some aspects of the story : the first Persona gained by the Protagonist , Orpheus , has a different appearance ; Igor 's assistant in the Velvet Room , Elizabeth , can be replaced with a male equivalent named Theodore . The gender choice also alters some aspects of the Social Link stories . In addition to the new playable character , there are two new difficulty levels to select from alongside the original game 's three . Persona 3 Portable only includes the story of the original Persona 3 ; however , general changes have been made to the plot , regardless of character choice . 
 The game 's revised battle system draws on elements added in Persona 3 's successor , Persona 4 . In combat , the player is able to directly control every character , as an alternative to utilizing the game 's artificial intelligence . The ability to guard has been added , and allies will take fatal attacks for the Protagonist , preventing his or her death . Outside of Tartarus , instead of navigating the game world by directly controlling the Protagonist , the player guides an on @-@ screen cursor around an area , allowing interaction with characters and objects . The game includes the voice acting of the original game , although characters are not shown in the world , instead being represented by on @-@ screen portraits . In addition , the anime cutscenes seen in the original Persona 3 were replaced to feature in @-@ game graphics . Shoji Meguro composed 10 new musical tracks for Persona 3 Portable ; with the majority of them being written for the female protagonist 's playthrough . Several cameos of characters from Persona 4 have been added to Persona 3 Portable , including Yukiko Amagi , a playable character from Persona 4 . It also features a cameo from Vincent Brooks , the protagonist of Catherine .

 Persona Q : Shadow of the Labyrinth is a dungeon crawler RPG developed for the Nintendo 3DS . It features both the characters from Persona 3 and the ones from Persona 4 , and also includes some gameplay elements from the Etrian Odyssey series . The Persona 3 campaign starts two weeks before October 4 , so Shinjiro is alive and available as a playable character . Just as SEES prepares to enter Tartarus that night , they are pulled into the Velvet Room and sent to a school they have never seen before . While searching the area they meet the <unk> Zen and Rei and the Investigation Team , the latter of whom have also been pulled into the strange school : they must now work together in order to escape . The game was released in Japan on June 5 , 2014 , North America on November 25 , 2014 and Europe on November 28 , 2014 .

Atlus issued a press release explaining that they were delaying the game so as maintain the quality of the package , which would have been " irreparably compromised " if they had " revise [ d ] or abandon [ ed ] the deluxe package . " 
 Persona 3 FES was first released alongside the original game in two forms : the " Regular Edition " — containing both the " director 's cut " version of Persona 3 , and the new epilogue — as two separate discs , and the " Append Edition " , containing only the epilogue , on a single disc . Persona 3 and its expansion were released simultaneously in Japan on April 19 , 2007 . At the time , Atlus had not announced plans to release FES outside Japan . This announcement did not come until February 2008 , when the game 's North American release date was revealed to be April 22 , 2008 . An exclusive Amazon.com limited edition bundle was released on November 28 , 2008 , containing Art of Persona 3 artbook , Persona 3 soundtrack disc and the FES edition in a cardboard sleeve . The FES edition of the game was also released on PSN on April 10 , 2012 .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Persona 3 received positive reviews upon its release , earning a Metacritic score of 86 . Shane Bettenhausen of 1UP.com called the game a " refreshingly new take on the MegaTen [ Megami Tensei ] concept " , and " the best RPG hitting the PS2 this year . " He praised the " excellent " AI created to direct the actions of party members during battle , which he felt created " the series ' speediest and most dynamic battle system to date . " Jeff Haynes from IGN criticized the system , finding that it would occasionally result in the death of the player 's character , which causes a game over . 
 GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9 @.@ 0 , calling it " a rare supernatural delicacy " stating it 's an RPG that fans of the genre shouldn 't miss out on . GameSpy 's Patrick Joynt praised the social elements of Persona 3 , calling the game 's Social Links " almost universally fascinating . " While he suspected the simulation elements would " probably be the biggest hurdle " for fans of role @-@ playing or Megami Tensei games , in his review he wrote that he " can 't stress enough how well @-@ done it is . " Heidi Kemps of GamesRadar found the game 's teenage themes to be " a refreshing change " from those of other games in the genre , as they touch on " the social awkwardness common at that point in life . " Game Informer 's Joe Juba found the game 's environments to be weak , as " most of the game takes place within one tower [ Tartarus ] . " He also in his review noted that the game 's roots in the Megami Tensei series would come across as foreign to new players . " If you don ’ t know anything about fusing Personas , or simply that ' <unk> ' means ' ice attack , ' you have some catching up to do . " 
 Persona 3 : FES received a score of 89 on Metacritic , slightly higher than that of Persona 3 . The plot of The Answer provides " much @-@ needed narrative closure " to the story of The Journey , according to Shane Bettenhausen . Kevin VanOrd called FES a " wonderfully enhanced version of an already @-@ great RPG " ; in his review , he recommends the game to new players and those who had already finished the original game . The gameplay of The Answer was criticized by several reviewers for not including the social elements of the original game . VanOrd found the new chapter to be " less interesting " because of this . Jeff Haynes commented that the change " harkens back to a classic , more hardcore RPG experience of fighting and grinding " , while done at the expense of what " made Persona 3 so intriguing in the first place . " The reviews of GameSpy and IGN reiterated issues found with the original game , such as the inability to directly control party members in battle . 
 While some critics like IGN criticized Persona 3 Portable for " losing some of its polish " , it was as acclaimed as FES , receiving an 89 out of 100 from Metacritic , making it the third best reviewed PSP game on the website . It was praised for , despite having been released twice already , being an adventure worth playing again . This was echoed by GamesRadar , IGN , 1UP.com and GamePro . It received a score of 32 / 40 from Famitsu ; one reviewer wrote that the remake includes " enough differences in the Social Links to make it fun even for old players . " , and perfect scores from websites such as Destructoid and GamePro . GameTrailers went on to nominate the game for " Best PSP Game " in their awards , losing to God of War : Ghost of Sparta and " Best RPG " , losing to Mass Effect 2 . Three websites specific to coverage of RPGs honored it in annual award postings , namely RPGamer ( Best Re @-@ release ) , RPGFan ( Best Traditional RPG on Handheld ) , and RPGLand ( Best Port ) . 
 Shane Bettenhausen considered the inclusion of Evokers " a ballsy and shocking move " on the part of Atlus , but felt their inclusion created " an edgy <unk> that fits perfectly with the overall dark tone " of the game . Similarly , Joe Juba thought the concept fit " perfectly " with the game 's " dark tone " . Jeff Haynes found the animations of characters using their Evokers to be " intriguing and shocking at the same time " . While previewing Persona 3 for GameSpot , Kevin VanOrd said that the continued use of Evokers " never gets old and it never gets any less awesome to watch , and considering that you could play this for fifty , sixty , seventy , eighty hours or more , that 's saying something . " Atlus U.S.A. did not remove the Evokers from Persona 3 for its worldwide release , despite the possible controversy . Nich Maragos said on 1UP.com 's Retronauts podcast that the company did not receive any criticism for their inclusion , however . " There was never any Jack Thompson @-@ ing … we didn 't get any letters from concerned parents . " 
 Persona 3 was named the best role @-@ playing game of 2006 by Famitsu , and of 2007 by GameSpot and RPGFan . GameSpy gave the title its 2007 PS2 RPG of the Year award and placed it second in the 2007 PS2 Top 10 Games of the Year . IGN placed Persona 3 FES fifteenth in their feature " The Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time " . 1UP.com 's 2007 game awards , which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly , included Persona 3 , given the award for " Most controversial game that created no controversy " . In 2010 , Persona 3 ended up coming first place in RPGamer 's " Top RPGs of the Decade " list , and second place in RPGFan 's " Top 20 RPGs of the Past Decade " list behind Shin Megami Tensei : Digital Devil Saga & Digital Devil Saga 2 . According to IGN 's Top 100 RPGs of All Time , Persona 3 ranks 69th .

 The Phillips Exeter Academy Library in Exeter , New Hampshire , U.S. , with 160 @,@ 000 volumes on nine levels and a shelf capacity of 250 @,@ 000 volumes , is the largest secondary school library in the world . It is part of the Phillips Exeter Academy , an independent boarding school . 
 When it became clear in the 1950s that the library had outgrown its existing building , the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional design for the new building . Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design , the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965 . In 1997 the library received the Twenty @-@ five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects , an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given to no more than one building per year . 
 Kahn structured the library in three concentric square rings . The outer ring , which is built of load @-@ bearing brick , includes all four exterior walls and the library carrel spaces immediately inside them . The middle ring , which is built of reinforced concrete , holds the heavy book stacks . The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks . 
 = = History and services = = 
 The first library at Phillips Exeter Academy was a single small room . A member of the class of 1833 remembered it as containing " old sermons and some history , scarcely ever read " . Even as late as 1905 the library had only two rooms and 2 @,@ 000 volumes . 
 In 1912 the Davis Library was added to the campus with space for 5 @,@ 000 volumes . Although a major improvement , its atmosphere was inhospitable by the standards of later generations . Stacks were locked to students , for example , and the librarian 's office was located at the entrance to the stacks to maximize control over entry . Decisions about book selections and the library 's program were in the hands of an all @-@ male faculty committee instead of the female librarian . 
 In 1950 Rodney Armstrong became librarian , the first with a graduate degree in library science . One of his first moves was to open the stacks to students . That solved one problem , but the real difficulty was the lack of space . The library contained 35 @,@ 000 volumes at that point , many of them stored in cardboard boxes for lack of shelf room . After years of effort , Armstrong eventually succeeded in bringing a new library to the academy . 
 Architect Louis Kahn was chosen to design the new library in 1965 , and it was ready for occupancy in 1971 . Architectural historian Vincent Scully acknowledged its architectural significance by using a photo of it as the frontispiece for his book Modern Architecture and Other Essays . 
 On November 16 , 1971 , classes were suspended for a day , and students , faculty , and staff moved books ( the library had 60 @,@ 000 volumes by this time ) from the old Davis Library into the new library . 
 Henry Bedford , who became librarian shortly after the new library was occupied , supervised the transition not only to the new building but also to a new way of operating a library . Staff librarians were encouraged to see themselves as co @-@ instructors with the regular faculty and to put less emphasis on <unk> library patrons . A piano was installed and the library began sponsoring lectures and concerts . 
 In 1977 Jacquelyn Thomas became librarian , the first with full faculty status . By 2006 she oversaw a staff of seven , all with graduate degrees in library science . During Thomas ' tenure the library 's collection and programming grew to a size appropriate to a small liberal arts college . Today the library houses 160 @,@ 000 volumes on nine levels and has a shelf capacity of 250 @,@ 000 volumes , making it the largest secondary school library in the world . The library also contains a collection of works by alumni as well as the Academy Archives . 
 The library was the first building on campus to be computerized thanks to the foresight of Armstrong and Kahn , who supplied the library with sufficient conduit space for the cabling needed by the coming computer revolution . 
 In 1995 , the library was officially named the Class of 1945 Library , honoring Dr. Lewis Perry , Exeter 's eighth principal , who served from 1914 to 1946 . 
 = = Choosing Louis Kahn as architect = = 
 The project to build a new and larger library began in 1950 and progressed slowly for several years . By the mid @-@ 1960s , O 'Connor & Kilham , the architectural firm that had designed libraries for Barnard , Amherst and West Point , had been chosen to design the new library and had drafted plans with traditional architecture . Richard Day arrived as the new principal of the academy at that point , however , and found their design to be unsatisfactory . He dismissed them , declaring his intention to hire " the very best contemporary architect in the world to design our library " . 
 The school 's building committee was tasked with finding a new architect . Influential members of the committee became interested in Louis Kahn at an early stage , but they interviewed several other prominent architects as well , including Paul Rudolph , I. M. Pei , Philip Johnson and Edward Larrabee Barnes . Kahn 's prospects received a boost when Jonas Salk , whose son had attended Exeter , called Armstrong and invited him to visit the Salk Institute in California , which Kahn had recently built to widespread acclaim . Kahn was awarded the commission for the library in November 1965 . 
 Kahn had already thought deeply about the proper design for a library , having earlier submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University . He also expressed a deep reverence for books , saying , " A book is tremendously important . Nobody ever paid the price of a book , they only paid for the printing " . Describing the book as an offering , Kahn said , " How precious a book is in light of the offering , in light of the one who has the privilege of the offering . The library tells you of this offering " . 
 The building committee carefully considered what they wanted in a new library and presented their ideas to Kahn in an unusually detailed document that went through more than fifty drafts . The early designs included some items that were eventually rejected , such as a roof garden and two exterior towers with stairs that were open to the weather . They were removed from the plans when the building committee reminded Kahn that neither of those features would be practical in New England winters . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The library has an almost cubical shape : each of its four sides is 111 feet ( 33 m ) wide and 80 feet ( 24 m ) tall . It is constructed in three concentric areas ( Kahn called them " doughnuts " ) . In the words of Robert McCarter , author of Louis I. Kahn , " From the very beginning of the design process , Kahn conceived of the three types of spaces as if they were three buildings constructed of different materials and of different scales – buildings @-@ within @-@ buildings " . The outer area , which houses the reading carrels , is made of brick . The middle area , which contains the heavy book stacks , is made of reinforced concrete . The inner area is an atrium . 
 The library 's heating and cooling needs are supplied by the nearby dining hall , which Kahn built at the same time as the library , but which is considered to be of less architectural significance . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The building committee 's document specified that the new library should be " unpretentious , though in a handsome , inviting contemporary style " . Kahn accordingly made the building 's exterior relatively undramatic , suitable for a small New England town . Its facade is primarily brick with teak wood panels at most windows marking the location of a pair of wooden carrels . The bricks are load @-@ bearing ; that is , the weight of the outer portion of the building is carried by the bricks themselves , not by a hidden steel frame . Kahn calls this fact to the viewer 's attention by making the brick piers noticeably thicker at the bottom where they have more weight to bear . The windows are correspondingly wider toward the top where the piers are thinner . Kahn said , " The weight of the brick makes it dance like a fairy above and groan below . " 
 The corners of the building are chamfered ( cut off ) , allowing the viewers to see the outer parts of the building 's structure , the outer " doughnut . " The Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects says , " Kahn sometimes perceived a building as enclosed by ' plate @-@ walls , ' and to give emphasis to this structural form , he interrupted the plates at the corner , leaving a gap between them . The Library at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter , New Hampshire ( 1967 – 1972 ) is a classic example " . Each of these four brick " plate @-@ walls , " which house the library carrels , is 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) deep . 
 At the top of the exterior walls is a row of openings similar to the windows below except that these openings are above the roof and have no glass . Vincent Scully said that Kahn was drawn to architecture based on " solid , almost primitive , masonry masses with voids in them without glass . " The bottoms of these window @-@ like openings are 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) above the floor of an arcade that follows the perimeter of the top of building . 
 Another arcade circles the building on the ground floor . Kahn disliked the idea of a building that was dominated by its entrance , so he concealed the main entrance to the library behind this arcade . His original design , however , called for landscaping with a paved forecourt that would have indicated the entrance without disrupting the symmetry of the facade . Architectural historian William Jordy said , " Perverse as the hidden entrance may seem , it emphatically reinforces Kahn 's statement that his design begins on the periphery with the circle of individual carrels , each with its separate window . " 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 A circular double staircase built from concrete and faced with travertine greets the visitor upon entry into the library . At the top of the stairs the visitor enters a dramatic central hall with enormous circular openings that reveal several floors of book stacks . At the top of the atrium , two massive concrete cross beams diffuse the light entering from the clerestory windows . 
 Carter Wiseman , author of Louis Kahn : Beyond Time and Style , said , " The many comparisons of the experience of entering Exeter 's main space to that of entering a cathedral are not accidental . Kahn clearly wanted the students to be humbled by the sense of arrival , and he succeeded . " David <unk> , who worked as an architect for Kahn , said , " for Lou , every building was a temple . Salk was a temple for science . Dhaka was a temple for government . Exeter was a temple for learning . " 
 Because the stacks are visible from the floor of the central hall , the layout of the library is clear to the visitor at a glance , which was one of the goals the Academy 's building committee had set for Kahn . 
 The central room is 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 8 m ) high , as measured from the floor to the beginning of the roof structure , and 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) wide . Those dimensions approximate a ratio known as the Golden Section , which was studied by the ancient Greeks and has been considered the ideal architectural ratio for centuries . 
 The circle and the square that are combined so dramatically in the atrium were considered to be the paradigmatic geometric units by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius . He also noted that the human body is proportioned so that it can fit in both shapes , a concept that was famously expressed with a combined circle and square by Leonardo da Vinci in his drawing Vitruvian Man . 
 The specifications of the Academy 's building committee called for a large number of carrels ( the library has 210 ) and for the carrels to be placed near windows so they could receive natural light . The latter point matched Kahn 's personal inclinations perfectly because he himself strongly preferred natural light : " He is also known to have worked by a window , refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days . " Each pair of carrels has a large window above , and each individual carrel has a small window at desk height with a sliding panel for adjusting the light . 
 The placement of carrel spaces at the periphery was the product of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University . There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers , usually with book stacks on the periphery of the library and reading rooms toward the center . Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light . For Kahn , the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look : " A man with a book goes to the light . A library begins that way . He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light . " Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks , with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels . The book stacks also look out into the atrium . 
 The inherent massiveness of the brick " plate @-@ wall " structure of the outer part of the library helps to create the cloistered atmosphere that Kahn felt was appropriate for library carrels . While explaining his proposal for the library at Washington University , Kahn had used the example of the cloistered carrels at the monastic library at Dunham , England , to explain his " desire to find a space construction system in which the carrels were inherent in the support which harbored them ... Wall @-@ bearing masonry construction with its niches and vaults has the appealing structural order to provide naturally such spaces . " 
 = = Architectural interpretations = = 
 Architectural experts sometimes differ in their interpretations of Kahn 's design . Why , for example , are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive ? Carter Wiseman says , " While they appear to be — and indeed are — structural , they are far deeper than necessary ; their no @-@ less @-@ important role was to diffuse the sunlight coming in from the surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium . " Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story , asserting that " the concrete X @-@ shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect . " Kathleen James @-@ Chakraborty goes even further : " Above , in the most sublime gesture of all , floats a concrete cross brace , illuminated by clerestory windows . Its weight , which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker , revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details . " Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester , which he designed a few years earlier . 
 Another issue is the extent to which Kahn deliberately introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins . Kahn himself spoke of " wrapping ruins around buildings " , although in the context of another project . In his essay " Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome , " Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings , including this library , saying , " And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire , Kahn won 't even let it become a building ; he wants it to remain a ruin . The walls don 't connect at the top . They remain like a hollow shell " . <unk> <unk> , on the other hand , avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects . In it , while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn 's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh , <unk> wrote , " This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution , rather than the formal desire to ' create ruins , ' as some critics have suggested . " In the very next paragraph <unk> describes the chamfered corners of the library at Phillips Exeter by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials .

 Trials HD is an Xbox Live Arcade game developed by RedLynx and published by Microsoft Game Studios . It was released on August 12 , 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade and was later re @-@ released in a retail pack alongside Limbo and ' Splosion Man in April 2011 . It is a 2.5D puzzle / racing game . The player must guide a trial motorcycle with exaggerated physics through various obstacles to reach each stage 's finish line . On September 6 , 2012 it was announced that a Microsoft Windows version of Trials HD would be bundled inside a special version of Trials Evolution , dubbed Trials Evolution : Gold Edition — although this version changes the physics of the game . It is the third game in the series . On February 11 , 2016 , Microsoft added Trials HD as part of its backwards compatibility program for Xbox One . 
 The game was well received by critics , averaging 86 @.@ 1 % at GameRankings and 86 / 100 at Metacritic , two video game aggregate sites . In 2009 it received the Best Overall Arcade Game and Best Innovation awards , voted on by the Xbox 360 community . In September 2010 IGN listed Trials HD sixteenth in their top twenty @-@ five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time . The game was a commercial success , with sales exceeded two million units factoring in collective downloadable content sales . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Trials HD the player controls a rider on a physics @-@ based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles . The objective is to complete the course as fast as possible and with as few crashes , known in the game as faults , as possible . The game uses 3D graphics , but is played on a 2D plane , so the rider can only move forwards and backwards . Players can also control the bike 's pitch at slow speeds or while in the air . 
 The game has a variety of courses in a range of difficulties from beginner to extreme . There are a total of thirty @-@ five courses in the game , and players can replay completed courses to attempt a faster time . Tournament mode sees the player attempt to complete a number of courses in sequence , trying to achieve a fast overall time with minimal faults . Twelve skill games can also be unlocked which place the player in different challenges . These include things such as riding inside or on top of a large spherical cage , achieving as many flips as possible within a set time limit , or towing a trailer with two large bombs as far as possible while keeping them from exploding by impact . Players earn medals based on their completion time , number of faults , and in the case of skill games , other specialized criteria . 
 When connected to Xbox Live , the player can view their performance in relation to players in their friends list . This is done by an in @-@ game meter which displays the closest friend to the player 's time which adjusts based on whether the player is leading or trailing the friend 's course time . Trials HD includes a level editor that allows players to construct their own courses and share them with players in their friends list . Every course in the game was created using the level editor , which allows users to create professional @-@ quality levels . It also features leaderboards for each of the game 's courses and modes . For each course the fastest five thousand times are able to be viewed as replays . During the replay the viewer can view that recorded player 's controller presses , allowing them to learn patterns and skills from it .

 Trials HD is the second 2.5D game in the Trials series , following Trials 2 : Second Edition . The game is based on the popular flash games from the same series . It was released on August 12 , 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade . RedLynx developed Trials HD using an in @-@ house engine coupled with a modified version of Bullet Physics Library which was optimized to utilize the Xbox 360 's CPU and vector units . RedLynx applied the physics system to give a realistic feel , but to maintain the enjoyment of a video game , they tweaked the physics to " bend the reality in just the proper way . " RedLynx saw this as a " crucial thing in making Trials such a fun and addictive game " Previous Trials games used a much simpler in @-@ house physics engine , however for Trials HD developers opted to use the Bullet library and devote one of the 360 's cpu cores entirely to physics . Developers also improved on the Trials 2 engine by adding more advanced lighting and real time soft shadows . 
 Levels created for Trials HD were designed using the same in @-@ game level editor that allows players to make user @-@ based content . All of the tools and abilities the developers had at their disposal can be used by the community . In an interview with Eurogamer , RedLynx 's Lead Programmer Sebastian Aaltonen stated that there were no plans to port the game to other platforms , adding " Trials HD technology has been specially designed for the Xbox 360 feature @-@ set . " The voice work for the game was done by three Pennsylvanian voice actors , Rake Yohn , Brandon <unk> , and Art Webb . 
 Trials HD was announced June 1 , 2009 at a Microsoft luncheon during E3 2009 . It was released August 12 , 2009 as part of the Xbox Live Summer of Arcade . On December 23 , 2009 the first downloadable content , known as the Trials HD Big Pack , was released . The content features twenty three new courses , new objects for the game 's built @-@ in level creator and new achievements . A second downloadable content pack was announced for the game in July 2010 . The Trials HD Big Thrills Pack features forty new courses made by RedLynx , but unlike the Trials HD Big Pack it also features ten user created courses . These ten courses are to be decided from entries to the Big Thrills Track Creation Competition . The top three contestants were awarded prizes of $ 5 @,@ 000 , $ 3 @,@ 000 , and $ 1 @,@ 000 , respectively . Winners were announced on November 15 , 2010 . The Big Thrills Pack was released December 1 , 2010 .

 Trials HD was generally well received by game critics . Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report average scores of 86 @.@ 1 % and 86 / 100 , respectively . In its first month , the title sold over 300 thousand units . On September 14 , 2010 RedLynx announced that Trials HD had surpassed 1 @.@ 3 million units in sales . Sales of the first downloadable content pack have also exceeded 360 thousand , with the second pack selling over 90 thousand units . On May 27 , 2011 RedLynx announced that sales have exceeded two million units . In 2009 , Trials HD received two awards voted on by the Xbox 360 community , Best Overall Arcade Game and Best Innovation . In a September 2010 ranking , IGN listed Trials HD sixteenth in their top twenty @-@ five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time . It was also awarded a perfect score by Xbox World 360 magazine . 
 Reviewers generally praised the game 's replay value . IGN 's Daemon Hatfield remarked that Trials HD had " truckloads of content " adding that the game 's features " really take advantage of what can be done with Xbox Live . " GameTrailers staff also praised the amount of content in the game stating that it was an excellent value for the price . Eurogamer stated that " it 's a game built for endless replay and community expansion beyond that . " The game 's leaderboards , especially the ability to have a view of where other players were at a certain time during a run , were widely praised by Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb . 
 One of the primary criticisms given by critics was Trials HD 's steep difficulty curve . Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb stated that he wished the difficulty curve was " a little smoother . " Daemon Hatfield of IGN further commented on the game 's difficulty , stating " It 's when you get stuck trying to get over some small hill and you see that fault counter in the top left corner counting up [ ... ] that the game starts being more frustrating than fun . " GameSpy 's Anthony Gallegos added that the " limited number of tries per track feels arbitrary . " He was also critical of the game 's file sharing system , noting that instead of a repository from which to download tracks that sharing is limited to those in the player 's friends list . Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot also agreed that the difficulty on the latter tracks was " ridiculously hard " and shared disappointment in the file sharing system . 
 = Zanzibar red colobus = 
 The Zanzibar red colobus ( Procolobus kirkii ) is a species of red colobus monkey endemic to Unguja , the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago , off the coast of Tanzania . It is also known as Kirk 's red colobus after Sir John Kirk , the British Resident of Zanzibar who first brought it to the attention of zoological science . It is now classified as an endangered species and in the mid @-@ 1990s was adopted as the flagship species for conservation in Zanzibar . The population trend is still decreasing , and because this species is only located in the archipelago , conservationists are attempting to work with the local government to devise a proper , effective strategy to protect the population and habitat . The species has been reclassified twice ; it was previously in the genus Colobus , and more recently in the genus Procolobus . 
 = = Evolutionary history and taxonomy = = 
 The Zanzibar red colobus , Procolobus kirkii , population on Zanzibar , represents a population of red colobus that is believed to have been isolated on the island after sea levels rose toward the end of the Pleistocene epoch . Furthermore , it is suggested through mitochondrial analysis , that phylogenetic groups within the red colobus have been genetically isolated from another since the Pliocene . 
 Examining cranial morphology has shown that P. kirkii has diverged from mainland Procolobus to its own species . It has experienced an acceleration in morphological evolution of size which is suggested to be the result of insularity on the island and environmental pressures such as competition , habitat , predation and / or resource availability . There has been no evidence for population bottlenecks in the species . 
 The smaller cranium of P. kirkii in contrast to the mainland colobus monkey , is consistent with Foster 's rule ( also known as the island rule ) in which the original ( larger ) animal becomes smaller over time when there is limited resources . Males tend to have pedomorphic traits which include a shorter face , large orbits and an enlarged neurocranium . It is not certain how long ago and where this evolutionary change occurred . 
 Through molecular analyses , it is indicated that P. kirkii is more closely related to the <unk> red colobus ( P. <unk> ) compared to other red colobus species . This analysis has also placed the divergence of P. kirkii from its sister species P. <unk> at about 600 @,@ 000 years ago , which actually allows for an older evolutionary age compared to the previous assumption that it had become its own species around the last glacial period . The species has been reclassified twice ; it was previously in the genus Colobus , and more recently in the genus Procolobus . 
 An alternative common name is Kirk 's red colobus after Sir John Kirk ( 1832 – 1922 ) , the British Resident of Zanzibar who first brought it to the attention of zoological science . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 This Old World monkey 's coat ranges from dark red to black , accented with a black stripe along the shoulders and arms , and a pale underside . Its black face is crowned with long , white hair , and features a distinguishing pink mark on its lips and nose . Also , the Zanzibar red colobus has a long tail used only for balancing — it is not prehensile . Sexual dimorphism is generally decreased in the species , meaning the females have little difference in their body size and colour from their male counterparts . Females usually outnumber the males in their groups . The species has a notably small cranium and rotund body shape , with males potentially reaching over 12 kg and females , 10 kg . In adults , highly differentiated facial features help them to distinguish each other in a group . 
 The word " colobus " comes from Greek <unk> , meaning " he cut short " , and is so named because of the significant reduction in size , or complete lack of an opposable thumb in comparison to other primates . To make up for this , they have four long digits that align to form a strong hook , allowing them to easily grasp branches and climb . 
 Locals on the island have called the Zanzibar red colobus <unk> <unk> which means " poison monkey " in Swahili because of their strong smell unlike other monkeys . This has caused people to hold negative views of the monkey and even to say it has an evil influence on trees on which they feed , ultimately killing the trees . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 The Zanzibar red colobus is found in three forests of the Zanzibar archipelago . It displays a wide habit tolerance , but it is mainly an arboreal species and prefers drier areas over wet ones . Its habitats include coastal thickets and coastal rag scrub , but it can also be found in agricultural areas and in mangrove swamps ; the latter provides food year @-@ round . When found in agricultural areas , the monkey is more used to humans and comes closer to the ground . 
 About 1 @,@ 600 to 3 @,@ 000 individuals remain , and currently , 50 % of the monkeys found on the islands live outside protected zones . The largest and most significant area of protection and habitat for the monkey is in <unk> National Park , which provides 25 km2 ( 9 @.@ 7 sq mi ) of land reserve . It is located on the main island and the populations here have been greatly studied in regards to both their ecology and behavior . Even so , many groups have been found in <unk> ( Swahili for " farmland " ) within close proximity to the park . In these <unk> adjacent to the park , higher densities of the red colobus have been reported living here in more cohesive groups , compared to inside the park reserve . The incidence of some of these monkeys living permanently outside the zone of the protected park reserve can increase the endangerment of the groups . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The groups consist of up to four adult males and many adult females ; typically yielding a 1 : 2 ratio of males to females . Young of varying ages are also incorporated in the group . The number of monkeys in a group can range from 30 to 50 individuals . The species is a very social animal , and can often be observed playing and grooming during the rest periods between meals . Unlike females , in a group , males actually maintain close bonds , acting together in defense of their group and even in grooming each other . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Feeding is also a group activity . It begins to feed in the morning , and is more active during the cooler parts of the day . Loud calls from males indicate the group is ready to move to another tree to feed . This monkey is mainly a <unk> , and on average , half of the leaves consumed are young leaves . They also eat leaf shoots , seeds , flowers , and unripe fruit . It has also been found eating bark , dead wood , and soil . It is one of the few species that do not eat ripe fruits ; it has a <unk> stomach with four chambers specific for breaking down plant materials , however it cannot digest the sugars contained in mature fruits . Because the monkey feeds on young leaves ( though not limited to them ) , there are instances where it consumes charcoal , which is believed to aid their digestion of the toxins ( possibly phenolic compounds ) found in the young leaves of the Indian almond tree and mango tree . The habit of consuming charcoal is thought to be a learned behavior presumably passed on from the mother to her offspring . It has been noted , however , that not all populations on the islands carry out the behavior , but that it is rather mostly done by those who consume more perennial and exotic foliage . 
 Since some populations use mangroves as a source of food , it is natural for the monkey to consume more sodium chloride ( NaCl ) . Because of this , those populations have been observed to drink water directly from tree @-@ holes , or licking water off of leaves . This innovative behavior shows the adaptation of the monkey to novel ecological and environmental circumstances . 
 In the dry season , one of the staple foods , Indian almond tree , as previously mentioned , drops its leaves and can cause the monkey to go beyond park boundaries in order to extend its feeding range . This puts the already endangered colobine at more risk . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Males usually reach sexual maturity at about 3 @-@ 3 @.@ 5 years old , while females reach it at about two years old . Females approaching estrous can be easily identified because of the swelling and bright red coloration of the genital area . This signals to males that the given female is ready for mating . Moreover , just prior to mating , males will use their fingers to probe the female 's birth canal . This is immediately followed by sniffing the area because estrogen and progesterone can be detected by this method , further helping the male conclude if the female is indeed ready to breed . 
 Gestation is about 6 months for colobus monkeys and one female has about 1 – 2 new @-@ born every two years . Parental care is intense and often , the role is shared by multiple females of the group . It is observed that about 76 % of offspring are born between September and December . Infanticide has also been noted on occasion when a new male joins a given group that has infants . 
 Research has suggested that the ability for dietary expansion , which consuming charcoal partly allows , explains the higher birth rates and densities due to resource availability . Birth rates for those living in mangroves are higher than colobus monkeys living in coral rag forests . 
 There are higher birthing rates between October – December for colobines on Uzi Island and then January – February for those in <unk> , located on the eastern side of the main island . Infant mortality can be significantly high with half of the infants born not reaching more than six months of age . The birth rates themselves , however , are actually decreased in comparison to mainland colobus monkeys and interbirth intervals are longer as well . Research has suggested that this is a consequence of disturbed habitats in which mainland colobi are not so affected . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 The red colobus species have a smaller larynx compared to other members of the Colobinae subfamily . The male 's call is more of an alto or soprano in contrast to the low bass of a male 's in black @-@ and @-@ white colobus species . The Zanzibar red colobus is non @-@ territorial in nature and as so does not typically make loud , territorial threat calls . Zanzibar red colobus distress and warning calls are the " bark " , " <unk> " , or " wheet " . One of the loudest calls from the monkey is heard when he expresses his dominance over the group and when checking the sexual status of his females . 
 The call heard most often by people in or near <unk> Forest is the ' alerting signal ' . This is an attention @-@ getting call that is derived from the progression call . <unk> and grunts are made when there are changes in the surrounding environment such as changes in weather or animal movement in proximity to the group . With most arboreal animals , there are two different alerting calls , one for when a predator is on land , and another when there is an aerial predator . However , because of the lack of larger birds of prey in Zanzibar , such calls are not often witnessed . The young , on the other hand , because of their smaller size and vulnerability , do at times make such calls when they see shadows . 
 Because the Zanzibar red colobus is extremely social , it has a specific call for when it is alone for a certain amount of time upon which it feels vulnerable or threatened . The young are typically the ones to make such a call that sounds like a loud scream , but adults are occasionally likely ( when deemed necessary ) to make some variation of the call as well . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 A number of factors have contributed to the monkey 's endangered status . First , an increase in deforestation has resulted in a significant reduction in resources and habitat ; second , it is hunted for meat and pet markets . To counteract the decline in population , various attempts have been made to protect the species . In 1974 , specimens were moved to <unk> Forest on Pemba Island to try to re @-@ establish the monkey 's population . It had been found , however , that 20 years after the translocation to the island only one group of Zanzibar red colobus was found and with few sightings and interviews with locals , the population was estimated to be between 15 and 30 individuals . Researchers concluded that the group had certainly survived but did not increase in number possibly due to adverse relations with humans . Some locals in Pemba hold superstitions against the monkey because of the idea that it brings bad luck upon farmers . This may explain the reason that they have not significantly grown in population size . 
 On Uzi and <unk> Islands , the Zanzibar red colobus is subject to extensive habitat destruction , particularly with coral rag forests . There is also reported poisoning , netting , and disappearance of monkeys as well as other with animals . 
 Various attempts have been made for conservation of the species . One project was with the World Wildlife Fund , specifically in Menai Bay which is located just west of Uzi Island . Second , the Wildlife Conservation Society has funded conservation projects intended for the colobine but in both cases , there has been no apparent action that was directly supportive of the monkey . In the mid @-@ 1990s the Zanzibar red colobus was adopted as the flagship species for conservation in Zanzibar . 
 The African Convention has played a role in the conservation of the animal by categorizing it as ' Class A. ' According to the document African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources , ' Class A ' is described as : 
 species in Class A shall be totally protected throughout the entire territory of the Contracting States ; the hunting , killing , capture or collection of specimens shall be permitted only on the authorization in each case of the highest competent authority and only if required in the national interest or for scientific purposes . 
 It has been suggested that an important way to promote conservation of the monkey is to simply spread awareness about it – that it is not a harmful animal and that it can actually be good for the region 's economy because it draws tourism . This has been the case on the island of Unguja ( Zanzibar ) . Furthermore , it would be necessary to establish and designate protected zones .

 " Tennis the Menace " is the twelfth episode of the twelfth season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 11 , 2001 . In the episode , the Simpsons build a tennis court in their backyard and are ridiculed by the entire town because of Homer 's inferior tennis ability . Homer therefore tries to please Marge by entering the two into a tournament , but they quickly turn into rivals when Marge replaces Homer with Bart as her partner . 
 The episode features guest appearances from tennis professionals Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras , and sisters Venus and Serena Williams as themselves . " Tennis the Menace " was directed by Jen Kamerman and written by Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , who also directed the Williams sisters ' performance . The animators of The Simpsons experimented with digital ink and paint on " Tennis the Menace " , making it the second episode of the series to be animated using the process . 
 " Tennis the Menace " has received generally positive reviews from critics with particular praise for its guest stars . Around eight million American homes tuned in to watch " Tennis the Menace " during its original airing , and in 2009 it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the twelfth season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Springfield Retirement Castle holds a talent show , which the Simpson family attends . Grampa wins the show after performing his version of the song " What 's New , Pussycat ? " . He wins a free autopsy , so the Simpsons visit a funeral salesman to claim the prize . While there , Homer decides to buy a casket and a tombstone for Grampa . He also discovers that a certain kind of tombstone is produced from the same amount of cement as a tennis court , and this gives him the idea to build a tennis court in the family 's backyard . 
 The court is very popular with Springfield 's residents , but these residents mock Homer and Marge for losing all the time , thanks to Homer 's poor play . Marge pleads with Homer to take the game seriously ; however , Homer is too oblivious to how bad he is at tennis . Homer tries to please Marge by entering Krusty 's celebrity tournament , the " Krusty <unk> Klassic " . Marge , tired of being laughed at , ditches Homer and enters with Bart as her new partner . Homer is outraged that he was abandoned for a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy , and tries to get revenge by entering the tournament with Lisa as his partner , despite Lisa 's disapproval . 
 Because of this , the Simpson family begins to argue and compete against each other . The tournament takes place and in the stands are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras , Venus Williams , and Serena Williams . At the tournament , Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams . In response , Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner . Ultimately , Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi respectively . This forces the family to go back to the bench and resume their normal places in the family ; as they enjoy the exhibition of top @-@ class tennis , they agree that it is better to watch things than to do things and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras ' wallet .

 " Tennis the Menace " was written by Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham and directed by Jen Kamerman as part of the twelfth season of The Simpsons ( 2000 – 2001 ) . Maxtone @-@ Graham considers himself to be a bad tennis player and he has always wanted to win against his mother in a tennis match . This served as the inspiration for the episode , as he thought " family dynamics around tennis would be a fun show . " Maxtone @-@ Graham did a lot a research for the scenes at the beginning of the episode where the Simpsons visit a funeral salesman at a cemetery . 
 He read Jessica Mitford 's book The American Way of Death Revisited , which discusses the funeral industry , and was able to take a tour with funeral salesmen at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles . At the time , he did not reveal that this was for research , and instead pretended to have a dying relative . According to Maxtone @-@ Graham , the tour helped him find out " all about urns versus coffins , and cremation . I asked sort of questions about , ' Well , do the bodies smell ? ' They were very nice and gave me all the answers . It was quite fascinating . " 
 The opening of " Tennis the Menace " is what Maxtone @-@ Graham describes as a " screw you " beginning , as the viewer has " no idea that the twist is going to be tennis " . The part of the story revolving around tennis does not begin until around eight minutes into the episode . The Simpsons show runner Mike Scully has said that he thought this was " probably too long to wait before getting the story started . " 
 Maxtone @-@ Graham has similarly said that while he thinks these type of openings " are kind of funny " , they may be best avoided . However , Scully liked the fact that the staff included a comment in the episode on its " screw you " beginning by having Homer say " I 'll bet you didn 't see that coming ! " to the viewers when he decides to get the tennis court . The writers had a number of alternate endings to " Tennis the Menace " before deciding on the one eventually used . For instance , at one point , the family was to return home to watch the match in which Serena and Sampras faced off against Venus and Agassi on television . The staff changed it to the final one because they did not want it to feel like the episode petered out . 
 " Tennis the Menace " features guest appearances from Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras , and sisters Venus and Serena Williams . All of them appeared as themselves . Executive producer Al Jean directed Sampras , who Jean thought delivered his lines " very naturally " , while Maxtone @-@ Graham directed the Williams sisters . Agassi recorded his lines in the summer of 2000 . The Williams sisters , however , recorded their lines in Los Angeles sometime in the winter of 2000 – 2001 . According to Maxtone @-@ Graham , the sisters were " incredibly nice and incredibly generous with their time . " 
 This is the second episode — after season seven 's " Radioactive Man " ( 1995 ) — to be animated with digital ink and paint . This kind of digital coloring would not be used permanently on the show until the season fourteen episodes " Treehouse of Horror XIII " and " The Great Louse Detective " ( 2002 ) . It was used on " Tennis the Menace " primarily to test the technique . The reason for the long gap between this episode and " The Great Louse Detective " was that the staff of The Simpsons wanted to refine the look some more before doing it full @-@ time .

 The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 11 , 2001 . It was viewed in approximately eight million households that night . With a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 2 , the episode tied the X @-@ Files episode " Medusa " for the 41st place in the ratings for the week of February 5 – 11 , 2001 . The episode was the fourth highest @-@ rated broadcast on Fox that week ( together with " Medusa " ) , following episodes of Temptation Island , Ally McBeal , and Boston Public . On August 18 , 2009 , " Tennis the Menace " was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Twelfth Season . Staff members Mike Scully , Al Jean , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , John Frink , Don Payne , Matt Selman , Max Pross , as well as television writer and producer Philip Rosenthal , participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode . 
 Critics have given " Tennis the Menace " generally positive reviews . Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 list of the show 's " Top 10 Sporting Episodes " . Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that the plot of the episode " allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual . It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don 't get in recent seasons . 
 Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it , the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves . Homer had some wonderful lines , too , such as , ' Take your hands off me . They feel like salad tongs . ' Overall , a very funny episode . " In July 2007 , Simon Crerar of The Times listed Agassi 's performance as one of the thirty @-@ three funniest cameos in the history of the show . 
 In his review of the twelfth season of The Simpsons , Jason Bailey of DVD Talk wrote that the staff members ' " habit of using the first act as a red herring , only semi @-@ connected to the rest of the show , is ingenious and hilarious [ ... ] They 'd been doing this kind of thing for years , but it still plays ; what 's more , they 've begun to acknowledge it , and wink about it . " 
 He noted the scene from this episode in which Homer tells the viewers that " I 'll bet you didn 't see that coming ! " , adding that a " moment like that is The Simpsons at its best : smart , knowing , and ridiculously funny . " Also reviewing the twelfth season , DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson was less positive , commenting : " I ’ d love to report that ' Menace ' disrupts the string of mediocre episodes [ before it in the season ] , but I can ’ t . Like its predecessors , it offers a moderately enjoyable experience , but that ’ s the best it can do . Expect a few chuckles and little else . " 
 = Onneca Fortúnez = 
 Onneca Fortúnez or <unk> Fortúnez ( c . 848 – after 890 ) was a Basque princess from the Kingdom of Pamplona , later known as the Kingdom of Navarre . She was the daughter of Fortún Garcés of Pamplona and his wife <unk> . At the time of Onneca 's birth , which occurred between 848 and 850 , the Iberian Peninsula was largely under the domination of the Muslim Umayyad dynasty . Only the northern kingdoms of Asturias and Pamplona remained under Christian rule , perpetuating the Hispano @-@ Roman Visigothic traditions . Onneca was a member of the Íñiguez dynasty , named after her great @-@ grandfather <unk> Arista , who founded the Kingdom of Pamplona . 
 Information about Onneca 's life is sketchy . Biographical details about her come from two main sources : the Roda Codex and the accounts of Muslim <unk> historians , who refer to Onneca by the Arabic name Durr ( <unk> ) , meaning " pearl " . Onneca is primarily known for marrying into the Umayyad dynasty . Although matrimonial unions between Christian slave @-@ concubines and Muslim rulers were common , Onneca 's case is one of the few examples of a Christian princess marrying into Muslim royalty . Her marriage created family ties between the Christian and Muslim ruling families of the Iberian peninsula , initially leading to close collaboration between the Christian House of Íñiguez and the Muslim Umayyads . The political effects resulting from Onneca 's marriages continued to be felt long after her death , which occurred at an unknown date .

 Onneca 's father Fortún Garcés , the then heir to the throne of Pamplona , was captured in 860 in the town of Milagro during a punitive expedition led by Muhammad I , the Muslim emir of Córdoba , against the small Kingdom of Pamplona . The expedition resulted in the devastation of the Christian kingdom 's territory and the seizure of three castles by the Muslim forces . <unk> Garcés , nicknamed al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) by the Muslims because he was one @-@ eyed , was taken to Córdoba where he was detained for two decades in gilded captivity . Onneca accompanied or followed her father to Córdoba , where she was wedded to Muhammad I 's son Abdullah around 862 / 863 . It is not known when or how she came to Córdoba . She may have been captured with her father , or sent to join her father at the emir 's court at a later date . Onneca was presumably still a teenager when she bore Abdullah a son named Muhammad in 864 . As Abdullah 's wife , Onneca became known as Durr . According to some sources , she converted to Islam . 
 In addition to Muhammad , Onneca bore Abdullah two daughters : al @-@ Baha ' and Fatima the Younger . Abdullah became emir in 888 , and Onneca 's son Muhammad was named heir to the throne . However , Muhammad was assassinated by his younger half @-@ brother al @-@ Mutarrif on 28 January 891 . There is disagreement among historians as to whether al @-@ Mutarrif acted on his own or at the instigation of his father Abdullah . Al @-@ Mutarrif himself was beheaded in 895 under orders of his father . As a result , Muhammad 's son Abd @-@ ar @-@ Rahman , who was born three weeks prior to his father 's assassination , was the one who succeeded his grandfather Abdullah as emir of Córdoba . Known in the West as Abd @-@ ar @-@ Rahman III , he later elevated himself to the position of caliph . 
 Onneca was thus the paternal grandmother of Abd @-@ ar @-@ Rahman III , who inherited from her as well as from his mother <unk> hailing from the Pyrenees ( probably a Basque ) European facial features such as blue eyes and light reddish hair that he attempted to alter ( notably through hair coloring ) in order to look more typically Arab . 
 = = Marriage to Aznar Sánchez de Laron = = 
 In about 880 , after two decades in Córdoba , Onneca abandoned her Muslim family , and returned with her father to Pamplona , to which he would shortly succeed . Shortly after her return , Onneca married her first cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron . Together they had a son and two daughters , probably born between 880 and 890 : Sancho , Toda and Sancha . Their son Sancho Aznar is only known from the Roda Codex genealogies and may have died young . Their daughters Toda and Sancha would both become queens consort of Pamplona by marrying into the Jiménez dynasty , which came to power in 905 after displacing Onneca 's father Fortún Garcés from the throne . Toda married Sancho I Garcés , thus uniting the royal houses of Íñiguez and Jiménez . Toda 's sister Sancha was wedded to Sancho I Garcés ' brother and successor Jimeno Garcés , and was later killed in France by her son García Jiménez . 
 = = Alternative chronology = = 
 The Roda Codex , the sole source for Onneca 's Christian marriage , places this union with her cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron before her marriage , as a widow , to Abdullah of Córdoba . Based on this , French historian Évariste Lévi @-@ Provençal developed a chronology for Onneca 's life that placed her birth date around 835 . Lévi @-@ Provençal believed that Onneca did not accompany her father when he returned to Pamplona in 882 , either because she had already died , or because she had converted to Islam and chose to remain in Abdullah 's harem . However , such a chronology is problematic since it implies that Onneca 's children by Aznar were born before or only shortly after her father 's capture in 860 , thus making Onneca 's daughter Toda <unk> a <unk> at the time of her son García Sánchez I 's birth ( which is known to have occurred in either 919 or 922 ) , and nearly a centenarian at the time of her 958 visit to Cordoba . Therefore , most historians addressing the question have concluded that the Roda Codex was in error with regard to the order of Onneca 's two marriages .

 Onneca 's historical importance stems from the fact that she provided an important genealogical link between the Muslim caliphs of Córdoba and the Christian kings of Pamplona , as well as between the first two royal dynasties of Pamplona .

 Le Dernier Combat ( French pronunciation : ​ [ lə <unk> kɔ ̃ ba ] , English : The Last Battle ) is a 1983 post @-@ apocalyptic French film . It was the first feature @-@ film to be directed by Luc Besson , and also features Jean Reno 's first prominent role . Music for the film was composed by Éric Serra . The film was the first of many collaborations between Besson , Reno and Serra . A dark vision of post @-@ apocalyptic survival , the film was shot in black and white and contains only two words of dialogue . It depicts a world where people have been rendered mute by some unknown incident . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film opens to a shot of an abandoned office , where the main character ( Pierre Jolivet ) , who is only identified as ' The Man ' in the end credits , is having intercourse with a sex doll . The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles , but returns to his dwelling empty handed , where he works on building a makeshift aircraft . The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in , which is surrounded by a desert wasteland . A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland . They hold a man , ' The Dwarf ' ( Maurice Lamy ) , captive , and force him to retrieve water for them . The Man , who has been observing the survivors , makes his way to their camp , stabs their leader , ' The Captain ' ( Fritz <unk> ) and retrieves a car battery . Survivors pursue The Man , though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft . 
 'The Brute ' ( Jean Reno ) is seen approaching a hospital with a box containing canned food . The Brute rings a bell , and ' The Doctor ' ( Jean <unk> ) , instructs him to place the canned goods on the ground and back away from the door . The Doctor then takes the goods and closes the door before The Brute can get inside . 
 The Man 's aircraft crash lands at night . The following morning he continues on foot . The Brute returns to the hospital with a new box of items , though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door open long enough for him to enter the building . The plan works , however , once back inside the building The Doctor pulls a lever which closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering . The Man finds an abandoned bar , get himself heavily intoxicated and passes out . When he awakes , he ventures outside where he is amazed that it is raining fish . While searching for a way to cook the fish , The Man encounters The Brute . A fight ensues ; the Brute gains the upper hand though The Man is able to escape . 
 The Man , now badly injured , wanders around until he finds The Doctor . The Doctor treats The Man and cooks him some fish . The Doctor inhales a form of gas that allows him to , with some difficulty , say a single word : Bonjour . The Man also takes the gas and is able to reply with the same word . Both are ecstatic about being able to speak . The Man and the Doctor bond over table tennis and painting , before The Man ventures outside into a sandstorm to retrieve a painting he found in the bar . The Brute , who has been living in the bar , returns and notices the painting is missing . 
 The Doctor prepares some food and blindfolds The Man . He leads The Man to a part of the hospital where a woman is kept , and gives her the food . The Brute sets fire to the front door of the hospital , though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames . The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again , and The Man gives her a wrapped gift . They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate , though are able to scare him off . 
 The Doctor and The Man prepare food for the woman , yet this time The Doctor permits the man to not be blindfolded , and encourages him to comb his hair . Meanwhile it is revealed that The Brute has breached the iron gate to the hospital . The Doctor is killed on the way to the woman when chunks of rock rain down from the sky . The Man , who does not know how to find the woman without The Doctor , attempts to locate her , though he is confronted by The Brute . A fight ensues , with The Man eventually killing The Brute . The Man then locates the woman 's room , though is devastated when he discovers that The Brute had already killed her . 
 The Man repairs his aircraft , and flies back to the original survivors he encountered . He kills their new leader and frees The Dwarf . The Dwarf shows the Man where The Captain keeps his concubine ( Christiane Krüger ) . The Man greets her with a warm smile , which she returns .

 Writing in the book The Films of Luc Besson , Susan Hayward , director of Film Studies at the University of Exeter , considered Le Dernier Combat and The Fifth Element to be Besson 's two film 's which focus on the theme of environmental damage , as waste and pollution are visible throughout both films . Capitalism was also considered to be a theme ; consumer commodities were said to be signs of death , such as the abandoned cars in the desert and the floating washing machines in a flooded abandoned factory .

 Besson described the film as an " imaginary excursion " , stating he got the inspiration for the film from an abandoned cinema he saw in Paris . Thinking of all the other abandoned buildings there must be in Paris , Besson decided to create a world where all these places were together , and combined this idea with a previous suggestion that he make a feature @-@ length version of his 1981 debut short film , L <unk> Dernier . Le Dernier Combat was primarily filmed in Paris , with scenes depicted as begin in the desert filmed in Tunisia . Locations for filming in Paris included a former Électricité de France building that was demolished the day after filming was completed , and the derelict area where the Bibliothèque nationale de France was later constructed . The film was shot in black and white and contains only two words of dialogue .

 The film attracted 236 @,@ 189 viewers at the French box office . Time Out gave a favourable review , calling the film a " welcome addition to the post @-@ holocaust barbarism [ film ] boom . " Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review , stating " While the film ’ s heart is syrupy @-@ sentimental ( who ’ s shocked ? ) , its surfaces are clean , incremental , reverently silent — appropriate , given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak . " Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it " a bravura first film , using the simplest means , yet managing to incorporate humor , pathos , suspense and even a well @-@ articulated definition of basic human needs . " Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review , stating : " The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt , but it is also an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to say . Another John Carpenter is born , which is by no means a bad thing . "

 = Yakovlev Yak @-@ 15 = 
 The Yakovlev Yak @-@ 15 ( Russian : <unk> <unk> @-@ 15 ; NATO reporting name : Feather , USAF / DOD designation Type 2 ) was a first @-@ generation Soviet turbojet fighter developed by the Yakovlev design bureau ( OKB ) immediately after World War II . It used a reverse @-@ engineered German Junkers Jumo 004 engine . Along with the Swedish Saab <unk> , it was one of only two jets to be successfully converted from a piston @-@ powered aircraft and enter production . 280 aircraft were built in 1947 . Although nominally a fighter , it was mainly used to qualify piston @-@ engine @-@ experienced pilots to fly jets . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Development and description = = = 
 On 9 April 1945 , the Council of People 's Commissars ordered the Yakovlev OKB to develop a single @-@ seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single German Jumo 004 engine . To save time , Yakovlev based the new design ( known as the Yak @-@ 3 @-@ Jumo or Yak @-@ Jumo ) on the latest version of his successful Yakovlev Yak @-@ 3 piston @-@ engined fighter . The piston engine was removed and the jet engine was mounted underneath the forward fuselage so that its exhaust exited underneath the middle of the fuselage . To protect the fuselage , a steel heatshield was added to its bottom . The deeper forward part of the fuselage gave the aircraft a " pod @-@ and @-@ boom " configuration . Very few changes were made to the metal fuselage other than at the aircraft 's nose . This was recontoured to accommodate the armament of two 23 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) Nudelman @-@ Suranov NS @-@ 23 autocannon , an additional fuel tank above the engine and the engine itself . No changes were made to the wings other than the elimination of the air intakes for the oil cooler and the bending of the front wing spar into an inverted U @-@ shape to clear the engine . The vertical stabilizer was slightly enlarged , but the tail plane was unmodified . The conventional landing gear was also unmodified other than the tail wheel which now used several steel leaf springs as shock absorbers . The Yak @-@ Jumo carried a total of 590 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 300 lb ) of fuel . 
 Taxi tests began in October 1945 , but the heatshield proved to be too short and the heat from the engine exhaust melted the duralumin skin of the rear fuselage as well as the rubber tire of the tailwheel . Modifications to rectify the problems took until late December . By this time a second prototype had been completed with a solid steel tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane . After a few taxiing tests , it was transferred to the Central <unk> Institute ( TsAGI ) for full @-@ scale <unk> testing that lasted until February 1946 . On the 26th of that month , the Council of People 's Commissars issued requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of 770 km / h ( 480 mph ) at sea level and a speed of 850 km / h ( 530 mph ) at an altitude of 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 400 ft ) . It should be able to climb to that altitude in four and a half minutes or less and it should have a range of 500 kilometers ( 310 mi ) at 90 % of maximum speed . Two prototypes were to be ready for flight testing on 1 September . 
 According to aviation historians Bill Gunston and Yefim Gordon , representatives from Yakovlev and the Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich OKB tossed a coin on 24 April 1946 to determine which aircraft would be the first Soviet jet to fly . Yakovlev lost and the Yak @-@ Jumo made one circuit of the airfield before landing . The manufacturer 's flight testing of the aircraft was completed on 22 June , but its early success caused the Council of Ministers to issue a new requirement on 29 April for two aircraft powered by the Soviet @-@ built RD @-@ 10 engine ( known as the Yak @-@ 15 , Yak @-@ <unk> or Yak @-@ RD ) . Aside from the new engine , the requirement differed from the previous one only in a range of 700 kilometers ( 430 mi ) at optimum cruise speed and a reduction of the maximum ceiling to 14 @,@ 000 meters ( 45 @,@ 930 ft ) . Two prototypes were ordered to be available for flight testing on 1 September 1946 . 
 Yakovlev was able to adapt the two existing prototypes to the RD @-@ 10 with little trouble and one aircraft participated in the August 1946 Tushino flypast . The day after the aerial display , Joseph Stalin summoned Artem Mikoyan and Aleksandr Yakovlev to his office and ordered that each OKB build 15 aircraft to participate in the 7 November parade in Red Square commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution . Factory No. 31 in <unk> was chosen to build the new aircraft because it was still building conventional Yak @-@ 3s and could easily switch to the jet fighter . All 15 aircraft were built before the deadline , although they lacked any armor , were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament , and had an incomplete avionics outfit . The parade was canceled and two of the aircraft were modified with a single 23 mm cannon and began State acceptance trials which lasted until April 1947 . 
 The tests revealed a number of problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak @-@ 3 limited the top speed of the aircraft , the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield , the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine , and the aircraft was very short @-@ ranged . Despite these problems , the Yak @-@ 15 proved to be very easy to fly , even for pilots accustomed to piston @-@ engined fighters , and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer . 
 Even before the State acceptance trials were completed , the Council of Ministers ordered the aircraft into production in December 1946 . 50 aircraft were to be built between January and April 1947 , equally split between single @-@ seat aircraft and two @-@ seat trainers , armed with only a single cannon . The trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single @-@ seaters . Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947 . A total of 280 Yak @-@ 15s were produced through the end of the year , exclusive of prototypes . The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR , Poland , Romania , Hungary , and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers . The aircraft 's manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout the late 1940s . 
 A single prototype of the two @-@ seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 in the fall of 1946 . The prototype did not begin manufacturer 's flight testing until 5 April 1947 , even though the primary differences from the single @-@ seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a common , sideways @-@ opening , canopy . The trainer was initially designated as the Yak @-@ Jumo <unk> , but it was eventually designated as the Yak @-@ 21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak @-@ <unk> , Yak @-@ <unk> or Yak @-@ <unk> . Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak @-@ 17 with its tricycle undercarriage . 
 One Yak @-@ 15 was used to test a prototype aerial refueling system in 1949 , although the installation on the fighter and the Tupolev Tu @-@ 2 bomber used as the tanker were both dummies to test procedures and fit .

 On 29 April 1946 , five days after the Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich I @-@ 300 and the Yak @-@ Jumo made their first flights , the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new aircraft similar to the Yak @-@ Jumo , using the RD @-@ 10 engine with improved aerodynamics . This generally resembled the original aircraft , but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils , the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted . 
 The back of the seat was armoured and the pilot was also protected by a bullet @-@ proof windscreen . The entire canopy was also redesigned to accommodate the new windscreen . The landing gear could not be housed in the thin wings so it was redesigned to retract into the fuselage . Low and high wing loading wing versions were considered , but the low wing loading 15 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 160 sq ft ) wings were chosen for the prototype . 
 At an altitude of 5000 meters , the Yak @-@ 17 @-@ RD10 , as the new fighter was designated , was expected to have a top speed of 822 km / h ( 511 mph ) ; a significant improvement over that of the production Yak @-@ 15 . The aircraft was completed on 3 September and ground tests lasted until 26 September , but it never flew as the Yak @-@ 15 had already been ordered into production and its conventional landing gear was already deemed obsolete .

 = Thutmose I = 
 Thutmose I ( sometimes read as Thothmes , <unk> or Tuthmosis I , meaning Thoth @-@ Born ) was the third pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt . He received the throne after the death of the previous king , Amenhotep I. During his reign , he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia , pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before . He also built many temples in Egypt , and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings ; he is the first king confirmed to have done this ( though Amenhotep I may have preceded him ) . 
 He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II , who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II 's sister , Hatshepsut . His reign is generally dated to 1506 – 1493 BCE , but a minority of scholars — who think that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records , and thus the reign of Thutmose I , were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes — would date his reign to 1526 – 1513 BCE . 
 = = Family = = 
 It has been speculated Thutmose 's father was Amenhotep I. His mother , <unk> , was of non @-@ royal parentage and may have been a lesser wife or concubine . Queen Ahmose , who held the title of Great Royal Wife of Thutmose , was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I ; however , she was never called " king 's daughter , " so there is some doubt about this , and some historians believe that she was Thutmose 's own sister . Assuming she was related to Amenhotep , it could be thought that she was married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession . However , this is known not to be the case for two reasons . Firstly , Amenhotep 's alabaster bark built at Karnak associates Amenhotep 's name with Thutmose 's name well before Amenhotep 's death . Secondly , Thutmose 's first @-@ born son with Ahmose , <unk> , was apparently born long before Thutmose 's coronation . He can be seen on a stela from Thutmose 's fourth regnal year hunting near Memphis , and he became the " great army @-@ commander of his father " sometime before his death , which was no later than Thutmose 's own death in his 12th regnal year . Thutmose had another son , <unk> , and two daughters , Hatshepsut and <unk> , by Ahmose . <unk> died before his father , and <unk> died as an infant . Thutmose had one son by another wife , <unk> . This son succeeded him as Thutmose II , whom Thutmose I married to his daughter , Hatshepsut . It was later recorded by Hatshepsut that Thutmose willed the kingship to both Thutmose II and Hatshepsut . However , this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut 's supporters to legitimise her claim to the throne when she later assumed power . 
 = = Dates and length of reign = = 
 A heliacal rising of Sothis was recorded in the reign of Thutmose 's predecessor , Amenhotep I , which has been dated to 1517 BC , assuming the observation was made at Thebes . The year of Amenhotep 's death and Thutmose 's subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived , and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars . However , if the observation were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis , as a minority of scholars promote , Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC . Manetho records that Thutmose I 's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months ( or 13 Years ) as a certain <unk> in his Epitome . This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign bearing his cartouche found inscribed on a stone block in Karnak . Accordingly , Thutmose is usually given a reign from 1506 BC to 1493 BC in the low chronology , but a minority of scholars would date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC 
 = = Military achievements = = 
 Upon Thutmose 's coronation , Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule . According to the tomb autobiography of Ahmose , son of Ebana , Thutmose traveled up the Nile and fought in the battle , personally killing the Nubian king . Upon victory , he had the Nubian king 's body hung from the prow of his ship , before he returned to Thebes . After that campaign , he led a second expedition against Nubia in his third year in the course of which he ordered the canal at the first cataract — which had been built under <unk> III of the 12th Dynasty — to be dredged in order to facilitate easier travel upstream from Egypt to Nubia . This helped integrate Nubia into the Egyptian empire . This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king 's son Thure : 
 Year 3 , first month of the third season , day 22 , under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt , Aakheperre who is given life . His Majesty commanded to dig this canal after he found it stopped up with stones [ so that ] no [ ship sailed upon it ] ; 
 Year 3 , first month of the third season , day 22 . His Majesty sailed this canal in victory and in the power of his return from overthrowing the wretched Kush . 
 In the second year of Thutmose 's reign , the king cut a stele at Tombos , which records that he built a fortress at Tombos , near the third cataract , thus permanently extending the Egyptian military presence , which had previously stopped at Buhen , at the second cataract . This indicates that he already fought a campaign in Syria ; hence , his Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of his second regnal year . This second campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned . Although it has not been found in modern times , he apparently set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River . During this campaign , the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose . However , after he returned , they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions . Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of <unk> , near Apamea in Syria , and returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates , " that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream . " The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had ever encountered which flowed from the north , which was downstream on the Nile , to the south , which was upstream on the Nile . Thus the river became known in Egypt as simply , " inverted water . " 
 Thutmose had to face one more military threat , another rebellion by Nubia in his fourth year . His influence accordingly expanded even farther south , as an inscription dated to his reign has been found as far south as <unk> , which was south of the fourth cataract . During his reign , he initiated a number of projects which effectively ended Nubian independence for the next 500 years . He enlarged a temple to <unk> III and Khnum , opposite the Nile from Semna . There are also records of specific religious rites which the viceroy of El @-@ <unk> was to have performed in the temples in Nubia in proxy for the king . He also appointed a man called Turi to the position of viceroy of Kush , also known as the " King 's Son of Cush . " With a civilian representative of the king permanently established in Nubia itself , Nubia did not dare to revolt as often as it had and was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings .

 Thutmose I organized great building projects during his reign , including many temples and tombs , but his greatest projects were at the Temple of Karnak under the supervision of the architect Ineni . Previous to Thutmose , Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform , with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road . Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple . Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple 's main road , along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway . Outside of this , he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall . Between pylons four and five , he had a hypostyle hall constructed , with columns made of cedar wood . This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples , and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh , an Egyptian symbol of creation . Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues , each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt . Finally , outside of the fourth pylon , he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks , although one of them , which now has fallen , was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later . The cedar columns in Thutmose I 's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III , however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself . Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I 's hypostyle hall . 
 In addition to Karnak , Thutmose I also built statues of the Ennead at Abydos , buildings at Armant , Ombos , el @-@ Hiba , Memphis , and Edfu , as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia , at Semna , Buhen , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Thutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the Valley of the Kings . Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb , and presumably to build his mortuary temple . His mortuary temple has not been found , quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut 's mortuary temple at Deir el @-@ Bahri . His tomb , however , has been identified as KV38 . In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body , however , may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut , KV20 , which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it . 
 = = Death and burial = = 
 Thutmose I was originally buried and then reburied in KV20 in a double burial with his daughter Hatshepsut rather than KV38 which could only have been built for Thutmose I during the reign of his grandson Thutmose III based on " a recent re @-@ examination of the architecture and contents of KV38 . " The location of KV20 , if not its original owner , had long been known since the Napoleonic expedition of 1799 and , in 1844 , the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had partially explored its upper passage . However , all its passageways " had become blocked by a solidified mass of rubble , small stones and rubbish which had been carried into the tomb by floodwaters " and it was not until the 1903 @-@ 1904 excavation season that Howard Carter , after 2 previous seasons of strenuous work , was able to clear its corridors and enter its double burial chamber . Here , among the debris of broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages were the remnants of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari which formed part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I ; one of the vases contained a secondary inscription which states that Thutmose II " [ made it ] as his monument to his father . " Other vessels which bore the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor , Thutmose II , as well as fragments of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king as well as other vessels which bore her royal name of ' Maatkare ' which would have been made only after she took the throne in her own right . 
 Carter , however , also discovered 2 separate coffins in the burial chamber . The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut " was discovered open with no sign of a body , and with the lid lying discarded on the floor ; " it is now housed in the Cairo Museum along with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest . A second sarcophagus , was found lying on its side with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall nearby ; it was eventually presented to Theodore M. Davis , the excavation 's financial sponsor as a gesture of appreciation for his generous financial support . Davis would , in turn , present it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston . The second quartzite sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of " the King of Upper and Lower Egypt , Maatkare Hatshepsut . " However , when the sarcophagus was complete , Hatshepsut decided to commission an entirely new sarcophagus for herself while she donated the existing finished sarcophagus to her father , Thutmose I. The stonemasons then attempted to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re @-@ carved with the name and titles of <unk> I instead . This quartzite sarcophagus measures 7 feet long by 3 feet wide with walls 5 inches thick and bears a dedication text which records Hatshepsut 's generosity towards her father : 
 Thutmose I was , however , not destined to lie alongside his daughter after Hatshepsut 's death . Thutmose III , Hatshepsut 's successor , decided to <unk> his grandfather in an even more magnificent tomb , KV38 , which featured another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I and inscribed with texts which proclaimed this pharaoh 's love for his deceased grandfather . Unfortunately , however , Thutmose I 's remains would be disturbed late during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was plundered ; the sarcophagus ' lid was broken and all this king 's valuable precious jewellery and grave goods were stolen . 
 Thutmose I 's mummy was ultimately discovered in the Deir el @-@ Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut , revealed in 1881 . He had been interred along with those of other 18th and 19th dynasty leaders Ahmose I , Amenhotep I , Thutmose II , Thutmose III , Ramesses I , Seti I , Ramesses II , and Ramesses IX , as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I , Pinedjem II , and Siamun . 
 The original coffin of Thutmose I was taken over and re @-@ used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty . The mummy of Thutmose I was thought to be lost , but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero , largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III , believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy # <unk> . This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations , revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time , almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made during the course of the Eighteenth dynasty . 
 Gaston Maspero described the mummy in the following manner : 
 The king was already advanced in age at the time of his death , being over fifty years old , to judge by the incisor teeth , which are worn and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full . The body , though small and emaciated , shows evidence of unusual muscular strength ; the head is bald , the features are refined , and the mouth still bears an expression characteristic of shrewdness and cunning . 
 What has been thought to be his mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . However , in 2007 , Dr. Zahi Hawass announced that the mummy which was previously thought to be Thutmose I is that of a thirty @-@ year @-@ old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest . Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death , it was determined that the mummy was probably not that of King Thutmose I himself .
