 No Stairway is the debut studio album of Glassine , the musical project of Danny Greenwald , first released online and later issued on cassette worldwide by the label Patient Sounds , in April and August of 2015 , respectively . The title is a reference to a line from the 1992 film Wayne 's World . The album garnered significant attention from music journalists for its compositional and production technique . In two Guitar Center stores , Greenwald tapped people playing instruments on his iPhone , and used snippets of these low @-@ quality trackings as loops or synth patches , playing some of them through effects pedals or 4 @-@ track machines . The " dystopian " environment of Guitar Center shops and his desire to record something without a budget while in New York City is what inspired his idea to use samples of recordings of people playing instruments and build compositions out of them . On Fact 's year @-@ end list of best Bandcamp releases , No Stairway came in at number 19 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Raised in Columbia , Maryland , Greenwald first went to a Guitar Center store at age 14 to buy his first electric guitar . However , he rarely went to the former shop and instead bought equipment from local stores like Atomic Music in Beltsville , Maryland for most of his life . He disliked Guitar Center for its " dystopian " and " unpleasant " environment , which was one of the major parts of him being influenced to make No Stairway : " I wanted to take something unattractive and be able to extract beauty from it . I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud . I wanted to inspect little nuances , capture them , and paint with them . " While living in New York City , there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great @-@ sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software . While waiting for a train , he went at a Guitar Center shop near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom . At the store , he heard someone playing a song by Green Day on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument 's poor tone : 
 I remember thinking like , ' what if I could feed that through these weird reverb pedals I have at home ? ' ' Would it sound any different ? ' and it sort of hit me ' why don 't I just record other people playing and then sort of use as my paint ' . 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 Greenwald first tried to take control of the sounds from the expensive synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them , but was unimpressed with the results . On a later visit to the shop , he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album ; he taped a guy who " was just going for it on a drum kit " , lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used . The singer described how he felt while editing the sample : " I started to hear some kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish . ” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn , and then at a shop in Baltimore . Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song , Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later . Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home . Some snippets were played through a 4 @-@ track tape recorder , others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches . These recordings were put together , EQ 'd , mixed and mastered in Pro Tools . Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together , as he tried to " connect things that were seemingly un @-@ <unk> . " The end result was an album that featured ambient , dub , new @-@ age , experimental and post @-@ vaporwave styles .

 No Stairway was first self @-@ released on Bandcamp and Glassine 's official SoundCloud page on April 17 , 2015 @.@ n the same year , on August 6 , record label Patient Sounds distributed the album on cassette . The title of the album is a reference to the line " No stairway , denied " from the 1992 comedy film Wayne 's World . Live at Guitar Center , an album by <unk> musician Noah Wall that also used Guitar Center recordings , was released slightly before the Glassine album on April 6 . When Greenwald and Patient Sounds accidentally found out about Wall 's record , he almost didn 't want to release No Stairway , feeling " gutted " someone had already made an album with an identical concept to his project . However , when the label made Wall aware of Greenwald 's release , he was very excited about the album and his support got Greenwald motivated again to distribute his record . Greenwald has not sent No Stairway to the company despite suggestion to do so from his relatives . 
 A Tiny Mix Tapes journalist praised the album 's style as " some post @-@ vaporwave produced faux melodic ambiance that ’ s all at once subconscious music and next @-@ level field recording . And the esoterica and nostalgic level of listening here is completely outta @-@ whack when paired with the idea that <unk> of these samples are <unk> in the same genre or created ( potentially ) by the same person . " Critic Jesse Locke featured it on his column for Aux " No Rest for the Obsessed " , suggesting that listeners will wanted repeated hearings of Greenwald 's album unlike Live at Guitar Center . Jayson Greene , scoring No Stairway a 7 @.@ 2 out of ten in his review for Pitchfork , called the album along with Wall 's record " slight redemptive " reminders of Guitar Center 's commercial success during the 1990s pre @-@ Internet period , which contrast with a current time where the chain of retailers may shut down quickly due to extreme financial decrease . He called Greenwald 's editing of such low @-@ quality sound recordings as " impressive and even a little bewildering , but the knowledge proves unnecessary . " In May 2015 , Fact magazine honored the record as one of their favorite Bandcamp releases for the month of April , and on their year @-@ end list of " 20 best Bandcamp releases " , it was ranked number 19 . In The Fader 's " Top 2 Reasons Guitar Center Still <unk> " , No Stairway was number two and Live at Guitar Center topped the list .

 = Professional wrestling in New Zealand = 
 Professional wrestling in New Zealand has been promoted in the country from the early 20th century . In 1919 , Gisborne <unk> became the first national heavyweight champion , though the title was not recognized by the National Wrestling Association until 1925 , and promoter Walter Miller began running events under the Dominion Wrestling Union banner ten years later . 
 It was not until the years following the Second World War that professional wrestling enjoyed its first golden age . Pat O 'Connor , a one @-@ time NWA and AWA World Heavyweight Champion , was one of the earliest stars of that era . During the 1960s and 1970s , other wrestlers from New Zealand also travelled to the United States , where they enjoyed similar success in the National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wide Wrestling Federation . American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand during this period and were well received by the public . The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was also defended several times in the country ; in 1984 Ric Flair won the title from Harley Race in Wellington and Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting in Auckland to unify the title with Australia 's WWA World Heavyweight Championship in 2003 . 
 As in the United Kingdom , its popularity was helped through a weekly television show , On the Mat , that showcased many wrestlers from around the world in the 1970s and early 1980s . Although professional wrestling in New Zealand declined following the 1980s wrestling boom , it still maintained a presence in the industry . Retired wrestler and promoter Steve Rickard briefly served as President of the NWA during the mid @-@ 1990s . Jason Conlan , a New Zealand @-@ born cartoonist known as Pro Wrestling Illustrated 's " Mr. J " , began drawing a popular comic strip for the publication in 1995 . Sharon Mazer of Auckland University of Technology wrote a series of articles on professional wrestling and published Professional Wrestling : Sport and Spectacle in 1998 . Since 2003 , its popularity has returned following the emergence of several independent promotions , and with it the reappearance of televised wrestling , bringing professional wrestling back into the popular culture of New Zealand .

 = = = Early years ( 1900 – 1920s ) = = = 
 Though wrestling bouts had been held as early as the 1860s , modern professional wrestling would not take shape until around the turn of the 20th century . Georg Hackenschmidt toured the country performing against local wrestlers in exhibition bouts in 1905 and 1910 . In 1919 , Gisborne <unk> defeated Frank Findlay for the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship , though it became vacant shortly afterwards . The first officially recognized champion was Maori wrestler Ike Robin who won the title in Auckland on 17 March 1925 , and held it until his retirement the following year ; the title continued to be defended for almost 70 years . 
 Prior to his retirement , Robin and Stanislaus Zbyszko , a one @-@ time World Heavyweight Champion , faced each other in a three @-@ match series at the Auckland Town Hall in 1926 . One of their matches lasted for several hours before ending in a time limit draw which , according to the New Zealand Railways Magazine , had " gone on for many weary hours and when midnight Saturday chimed and Sunday commenced the match had to cease " . Despite the vast geographic distances , professional wrestling as practiced in the South Pacific region followed along the same lines as professional wrestling in Canada and the United States . 
 = = = Association with the NWA ( 1930s – 1940s ) = = = 
 In 1929 , the country 's first professional wrestling promotion , the Dominion Wrestling Union , was established . It was originally under the control of the New Zealand Wrestling Union , a governing body which oversaw both amateur and professional wrestling , until hiring American @-@ born promoter Walter Miller in 1935 . Miller , who had been in the wrestling business since 1914 , was able to bring in some of the top stars in the US throughout the 1930s and 1940s . In 1937 , the promotion featured Dr. Gordon McKenzie , Tom Meade , Don <unk> , Hal <unk> , Ray Richards , Sam Stein , Jack <unk> , John Spellman , <unk> Kirilenko , King Kong Cox , Chief Little Wolf , Frank Marshall , Rusty <unk> , Glen Wade , Joe Woods , Frank Judson , Don Noland , Vie Christy , Francis <unk> and Ed " Strangler " Lewis . The American wrestlers , who then travelled by boat , spent the three @-@ week trip in training prior to their arrival . Canadian wrestler George Walker claimed the New Zealand @-@ version of the British Empire / Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship upon his arrival in New Zealand in 1929 . Former Canadian Olympian Earl McCready was recognized as champion when Walker left to compete for a rival promotion in 1935 , and legitimised his claim to the title by defeating Walker on 9 November 1937 ; his second and last reign lasted from 1940 to 1953 . Other stand @-@ out stars included Dean <unk> , Ken Kenneth , John <unk> and African @-@ American wrestler Jack <unk> . 
 It was Lofty Blomfield , however , who was arguably New Zealand 's most popular wrestler of the period . He was the first New Zealand Amateur Heavyweight Wrestling Champion in 1931 and the first undisputed New Zealand Heavyweight Champion seven years later . During the late @-@ 1930s , Blomfield was to have met NWA World Heavyweight Champion Bronko Nagurski in a first @-@ ever " champion vs. champion " match . Miller negotiated with NWA promoters Toots Mondt , Lou Daro and Tony <unk> for Nagurski to travel to New Zealand in exchange for the largest guarantee ever offered a boxer or wrestler in the Southern Hemisphere . It was believed at the time that the event would attract more than 40 @,@ 000 people . Though Nagurski ultimately cancelled the trip at the last minute , Blomfield followed the world champion to Canada where the two wrestled to a time limit draw in Vancouver on 17 March 1938 . Blomfield was the first New Zealander to challenge for the NWA World title . In October of that year , he won a tournament to become the undisputed New Zealand Heavyweight Champion . Blomfield held the title for over a decade until his retirement on 7 June 1949 . Throughout his career , Blomfield vigorously defended professional wrestling and denied frequent charges that matches were rigged . Four decades later , Blomfield became the first wrestler to be inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame . To date he remains the only wrestler , amateur or professional , to be an inductee . 
 The same year of Blomfield 's retirement , a number of New Zealand @-@ born wrestlers left for Europe where they became major stars on the continent during the next few years . Ernie " Kiwi " Kingston , a student of Olympic wrestler Anton <unk> , was considered one of the best heavyweights in Europe and a main rival of British Heavyweight Champion Bert <unk> . A few were especially popular in the United Kingdom such as Ray Clarke , who also had a notable rivalry with <unk> , Bob Russell and Russ Bishop . While many of these men were regarded as some of the most formidable wrestlers during the late 1940s and 1950s , they most often remained unknown in their native country .

 After the end of World War II , amateur and professional wrestling enjoyed widespread popularity in New Zealand popular culture . Part of this of was due to its radio broadcasts from live events both prior to and after the war . By 1956 , professional wrestling had surpassed the then @-@ national sport of rugby in popularity and was the most popular spectator sport in New Zealand with the exception of horse racing . The Wellington Town Hall Concert Chamber was one of the more popular postwar venues for wrestling events . Within a few years , New Zealand champions were traveling oversees as far as Western Canada . 
 Pat O 'Connor , a champion amateur wrestler who had competed at the Pan American and the British Empire Games , was discovered by visiting American wrestlers Joe <unk> and Butch Levy and taken back to Minneapolis , Minnesota , where he eventually became a major star in the National Wrestling Alliance and the American Wrestling Association . On 9 January 1959 , O 'Connor defeated Dick Hutton in St. Louis , Missouri to become the first wrestler from New Zealand to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . Over the next 20 years , many other wrestlers from New Zealand became big name stars in the United States . Abe Jacobs was among the first to follow O 'Connor to the US and later challenged him for the NWA World title in New York . This was the first time two New Zealanders fought for a world heavyweight championship , and on foreign soil . 
 In 1959 , Miller died and was succeeded by Steve Rickard who ran the Dominion Wrestling Union for two years until starting All Star Pro @-@ Wrestling in 1962 . Fellow wrestler John da Silva also began a rival promotion , Central Wrestling Association , around this time but it eventually closed in the early 1970s . After Miller 's death , regular appearances by American wrestlers declined considerably , though a few still managed to arrive each year . In that time , a number of local stars were developed in New Zealand including Tony Garea , Peter Maivia , Al <unk> , and The Sheepherders . From other parts of the world came Australian wrestlers Ron Miller and Larry O 'Day of World Championship Wrestling , Robert Bruce from Scotland , Canadians Gordon Nelson and George <unk> , and André the Giant . South Pacific Wrestling , another small promotion started by referee Ernie Pinches , produced Johnny Garcia and <unk> <unk> during the 1970s . 
 By the end of the decade , Rickard and Australian wrestling promoter Jim Barnett managed to attract foreign stars back to the Pacific . American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand as well and were well received by the public . In 1972 , Big Bad John , Bulldog Brower , Les Wolff , King Curtis <unk> , Spiros Arion , Mark Lewin , Thunderbolt Patterson , Sweet Daddy Siki , Tarzan Tyler , Dewey Robertson and Haystacks Calhoun all toured New Zealand . Calhoun and his wife in particular made numerous television appearances , press interviews and visited schools . The debut of Rickard 's On the Mat during this period , a counterpart of Britain 's World of Sport , replaced the once popular radio broadcasts and showcased many New Zealand and international stars including Pat Barrett , The Destroyer , Man Mountain Link , Les Thornton , Leo Burke , Ripper Collins , Rick Martel , Tiger Jeet Singh , Ali <unk> , Abdullah the Butcher , and Siva <unk> . <unk> 's tournament victory over John DaSilva in 1978 marked the first time a Samoan wrestler won a New Zealand championship on New Zealand television , and the first to hold the national title since 1964 ; An official member of the NWA since 1972 , the NWA World title was also defended in Rickard 's promotion . Peter Maivia nearly won the NWA World title from then @-@ champion Harley Race in 1979 . This title changed hands between Ric Flair and Harley Race in Wellington , New Zealand and Geylang , Singapore in 1984 but these would not be acknowledged by the NWA for several years . 
 While Peter Maivia , Tony Garea and The Sheepherders left for the US in the 1970s , stars from the National Wrestling Alliance and the World Wide Wrestling Federation regularly toured the country including Don Muraco , Toru Tanaka , Mr. Fuji and Rocky Johnson . New Zealand was among the places future WWE superstar Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson lived in with his father Rocky while growing up . Japanese wrestlers too , such as Giant Baba , the Great Togo and midget wrestler Little Tokyo , also visited New Zealand . There <unk> also other wrestling promotions going one out of Hamilton which was called Big Time Wrestling which was around from the 1970s to the 1990s .

 Though the retirements of O 'Connor and Garea left a void , talents such as Ox Baker , Tor Kamata , Al Perez , Rip Morgan , Samoan Joe , Johnny Garcia , Bruno Bekkar and A.J. Freely remained in New Zealand during the 1980s and early 1990s . Likewise , wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation often toured New Zealand and Australia such as The Bushwhackers ( formerly The Sheepherders ) and Lanny Poffo . These stars continued to be seen in New Zealand via On the Mat until the early 1980s . 
 As American wrestling went into a slump following the wrestling boom of the 1980s , All Star Pro @-@ Wrestling closed in the 1990s , after 30 years . A few small independent promotions sprang up after All @-@ Star 's close , specifically the Arena Wrestling Alliance ( 1990 ) , Wai @-@ Kato Wrestling Association ( 1991 – 1992 ) and the International Wrestling Federation ( 1993 ) , though these were all short @-@ lived . By 1998 , professional wrestling in New Zealand was all but non @-@ existent . However , many New Zealand wrestlers and personalities maintained a strong presence in the industry . Steve Rickard served as President of the NWA from 1995 to 1996 . New Zealand @-@ born cartoonist Jason Conlan , also known as Pro Wrestling Illustrated 's " Mr. J " , began drawing a monthly comic strip for the publication around this time . Sharon Mazer , associate professor of Theatre & Performance Studies at Auckland University of Technology , wrote a series of articles on professional wrestling focused on what was then the WWF and research done at the Unpredictable Johnny Rodz School of Professional Wrestling ( Gleason 's Gym , Brooklyn ) . In 1998 , she wrote Professional Wrestling : Sport and Spectacle . Mazer also contributed to author Nicholas Sammond 's Steel Chair to the Head : The Pleasure and Pain of Professional Wrestling ( 2005 ) . Children 's science fiction author Debbie Renner claimed to have once competed under the name " Tasmanian Devil " prior to becoming a full @-@ time writer . In celebration of the coming Millennium , Abe Jacobs was featured on a special commemorative edition of the New Zealand ten dollar note by the Chatham Islands Note Corporation . 
 The New Zealand Pro Wrestling Informer ( <unk> ) , an online resource for New Zealand professional wrestling , appeared in 1999 , and was one of the earliest professional wrestling @-@ related websites to appear on the Internet . Between 2003 and 2008 , it interviewed numerous wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and World Wrestling Entertainment . Among those included retired foreign wrestlers who had previously competed in New Zealand as well as younger upcoming wrestlers such as Samoa Joe and Bobby Lashley .

 On 25 May 2003 , Auckland hosted a " champion vs. champion " match , in which NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting to unify Australia 's WWA World Heavyweight Championship . Mania Pro Wrestling , the first wrestling promotion since the close of Rickard 's All Star Pro @-@ Wrestling , was established in Auckland mid @-@ 2000 , following the success Mania Female Fighting Academy had enjoyed with their blend of stunt fighting and mat wrestling . Wellington promoter and former professional wrestler Martin Stirling took an interest in the return of the artform , and established Wellington Pro Wrestling in October 2003 . Early 2003 in Auckland the scene changed , as the collective of wrestlers who made up Mania Pro Wrestling , after a disagreement over the running of the company , established their own brand away from the Fighting Academy , known now as Impact Pro Wrestling . In January 2005 , Stirling changed his promotions title to New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling . 
 WWE held their first live event tour in New Zealand on March 4 , 2006 at the Westpac Stadium . This was the WWE Smackdown Road to WrestleMania 22 Tour , which featured a main event triple threat match between Kurt Angle , Undertaker and Mark Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship . 
 WWE continued to tour New Zealand as a result of 23 @,@ 875 people attending the first event in 2006 . 
 Competition emerged in the New Zealand wrestling industry during May 2006 in Wellington , when Rip Morgan split from Stirling 's company and Kiwi Pro Wrestling was established , made up of a number of Stirling 's former stars . These new promotions also brought back televised wrestling , which had been absent since the days of Rickard 's On the Mat , with the debut of <unk> Ignition and <unk> 's Off the Ropes . 
 The decade saw cooperation between New Zealand and Australian promoters as well . In 2007 , Peter Ball 's Major Impact Wrestling merged with New Zealand 's Impact Pro Wrestling to form a sister promotion in Australia , Impact Pro Wrestling Australia . That same year , Dominic Ferrari 's New Aussie Wrestling took part in an inter @-@ promotional " Australia vs. New Zealand " supercard with Kiwi Pro Wrestling . In 2008 , the Australasian Wrestling Federation made two trips to New Zealand , performing using their own talent and members of New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling .

 In July 2006 , The Telegraph reported that Miller would be allowed to leave Manchester United , should the Red Devils receive a suitable offer . It was made clear that Miller was not part of Alex Ferguson 's plans when , despite the huge number of senior players missing , he was still only a substitute in the opening game of the Red Devils ' tour of South Africa against Orlando Pirates on 16 July 2006 .

Miller quickly established himself in the Hibs first team , with Graham Spiers describing him as the " king of Hibs " after a 1 – 1 draw against Rangers at Ibrox . His early performances for Hibs were rewarded with the Scottish Premier League player of the month award for October 2009 . 
 Miller 's form mirrored the rest of the Hibs team as it went into a slump in 2010 , leading to the departure of Hughes . New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards . Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller , who he described as a top @-@ level player .

 " Better than Today " is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eleventh studio album , Aphrodite ( 2010 ) . The track was originally written and produced by Nerina Pallot and Andy Chatterley for Pallot 's 2009 extended play , Buckminster Fuller EP . It was re @-@ recorded by Minogue in 2009 , and received additional production by Stuart Price . Musically , " Better than Today " is a pop song that emulates other styles using guitars , synthesizers and drum programming . 
 " Better than Today " was released on 3 December 2010 as the album 's third single . It was not as successful as Minogue 's preceding releases . After debuting on the chart early with album downloads , it peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 32 , making it her lowest placing since " The One " in 2008 . The single was released in Australia on 28 February 2011 . It debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 55 , making it her third single to miss the top @-@ fifty , after " Finer Feelings " in 1992 ( number 60 ) and " Get Outta My Way " in 2010 ( number 69 ) . Despite under @-@ performing in the United Kingdom and Australia , it became Minogue 's sixth number @-@ one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her third consecutive number @-@ one single from the album Aphrodite on that chart . 
 " Better than Today " received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics . They applauded the dance @-@ oriented lyrics , comparing the track 's composition to Minogue 's works in the early 1990s on Rhythm of Love and the songs of the Scissor Sisters . Many critics praised the song as a part of the album , but did not believe it was strong as an independent single . An accompanying music video , directed by Minogue and her tour staff , was released on 19 November 2010 . The video reflected the fashion and choreography of the performances done during her 2009 For You , For Me Tour , where she debuted the song . Reception for the video was mainly positive , with most publications noting its similarities to Minogue 's previous music videos .

 " Better than Today " was written and produced by married couple Nerina Pallot and Andy Chatterley . The song was originally included on Pallot 's project Buckminster Fuller EP in February 2009 . After hearing Pallot 's work , Minogue 's A & R contacted her manager . Pallot stated when Minogue called her later , she " really didn 't believe it was her " , continuing , " when [ Minogue ] came to the studio in a nasty part of London I thought : ' OK , she really does want to do this ' . " Pallot and Chatterley were the first two writers and producers to work with Minogue when recording sessions for Aphrodite began in April 2009 . " Better than Today " was one of the prominent results of the collaboration . Pallot commented on working with Minogue , calling her " accommodating and lovely and approachable and normal [ sic ] " . Subsequent sessions Minogue had with the duo were not as successful . After Parlophone president Miles Leonard made Stuart Price the executive producer over the album in December 2009 , Price and Jake Shears ( a friend and former collaboration partner of Price and Minogue ) began to re @-@ produce the album . After being retooled by Price , " Better than Today " was left as one of only two remaining collaborations Minogue had with Pallot and <unk> , along with the album 's title track . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Better than Today " is a pop song with many additional styles , including rock , funk , soul and country . It also incorporates the use of the electric and acoustic guitar , synthesizers and drum programming by both Pallot and Chatterley . According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation , it is set in common time with a tempo of 110 beats per minute . Minogue 's version is composed in the key of F major with her vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of A4 to the high @-@ note of F6 . The chord progression F @-@ E ♭ <unk> @-@ Dm @-@ E ♭ -F follows throughout her edition while the middle eight remains in F ( Pallot 's version did not contain a middle eight ) . 
 Many comparisons have been made on the song 's style . Popjustice compared " Better than Today " to the style used in Minogue 's 1990 album Rhythm of Love . Hannah Kim of the Korea JoongAng Daily stated the track adds on to a " classic 70s disco sound " . When reviewing the album , Ian Wade of BBC Music called the song a " tech @-@ country strut " . Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that without research , it " bears the musical fingerprint " of Shears . " It 's got that ' Laura ' bounce ... And the bit where Kylie goes way up high ? Well you 've heard the verses to ' I Don 't Feel Like Dancin ' ' right ? Sonically similar ... " Christel Loar of PopMatters and Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised the lyric in the song , " What 's the point in living if you don 't wanna dance ? " Levine specifically applauded Pallot and <unk> for " coming up with probably the <unk> Kylie lyric ever " .

 The song has received positive and mixed reception from critics . Reviews in context of the album were usually positive . In a review of Aphrodite , Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called " Better than Today " a standout track on the album . Wade of BBC Music also gave a favorable review , saying the track " throws up imagery of line @-@ dancing cyborgs " . Loar of PopMatters labeled it a " sugary bounce " . However in contrast to the positive album reviews , Nick Ward of The Nelson Mail was not impressed . He said that there is no " oomph " that " would have made [ ' Better than Today ' ] complete " . 
 When " Better than Today " became a single , reviews for the song itself were mixed . McAlpine of BBC said " the relentless swaggering momentum " of the track " gets a little wearing " . He continued , " At some point , something ELSE needs to happen , y 'see [ sic ] . No matter how many times Kylie 's voice swoops up high and skips back down again , no matter how firmly she pushes herself into those demanding choruses ; it begins like Tigger and ends like a route march around an aerobics class . " He gave the single three out of five stars . Popjustice , while stating the song is " rather enjoyable " , added that it is a " no @-@ harm @-@ intended album track " instead of " the big balls @-@ out I 'm @-@ bloody @-@ Kylie comeback single " . They remarked at a later date , saying that they were " slightly alarmed " when the song became a single . Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as " a fun electro number " , but it " sadly doesn 't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead @-@ out track " . Originally in an album review , Levine of Digital Spy called the tune " as uplifting a dance @-@ pop ditty as we 're likely to hear all year " . In a single review , Levine re @-@ evaluated the song , stating that it is not " the freshest confection you 'll sample this party season " but he continued , calling it " sweet , seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again " . He gave the single four out of five stars .

 During the week of 20 November 2010 , " Better than Today " made its UK Singles Chart debut at number 67 . This was based purely on digital sales from the album as the single was not released until 3 December 2010 . The day before its release , it reached a new peak of number 40 , before dropping to number 63 , only to go on to peak at number 32 on 18 December 2010 . As a result , " Better than Today " is one of Minogue 's lowest charting singles in the United Kingdom . It proved to be her least successful UK charting since 2008 's " The One " which peaked at number 36 . The single had similar results in other European countries , peaking at number 27 in Scotland and number 63 in France . 
 In the United States , " Better than Today " debuted at number 44 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart . It rose to number @-@ one on the issue date entitled 5 March 2011 , not only becoming Minogue 's sixth number @-@ one single on the chart , but also her third consecutive number @-@ one from the Aphrodite album on that chart . At the time , Minogue also held the third spot on the chart with " Higher " , her collaboration with British recording artist Taio Cruz , becoming the first artist to claim two of the top three spots at the same time in the American dance chart 's history . 
 " Better than Today " was released digitally in Minogue 's native Australia on 28 February 2011 and physically on 18 March 2011 . It made its debut on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 55 . This proved to be her third single to miss the top @-@ fifty along with " Finer Feelings " ( 1992 ) , which peaked at number 60 , and " Get Outta My Way " ( 2010 ) , which peaked at number 69 . 
 In a March 2011 interview with Perth Now , Minogue expressed disappointment with the commercial performance of her singles from Aphrodite . Minogue said , 
 " It 's confusing . I felt a little let down with my releases from Aphrodite , ... I was caught out like a lot of artists were , with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days . I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old @-@ fashioned . I 'm pretty computer @-@ savvy , something didn 't feel right , but no one said anything to me . " 
 Consequently , after acknowledging that both " Better than Today " and " Get Outta My Way " charted poorly across the world , she announced there would be no more singles released from the album . However , " Put Your Hands Up " was released in late May 2011 following a press release from Astralwerks , Minogue 's North American record label .

 Minogue premiered the video for " Better than Today " at her official website on 19 November 2010 . The video was directed by Minogue herself with help from her tour staff , including her long @-@ time stylist and friend William Baker . The video resembles performances of the song done during her 2009 For You , For Me Tour , featuring the same dances by choreographer Tony Testa . 
 The video begins with Minogue dancing on a stage surrounded by laser beams . As the first verse starts , she is surrounded by female dancers wearing pink wigs as shoulder pads and a band wearing Pac @-@ Man helmets . She is wearing a blue bodysuit with fringed material on top and silver , spiked Louboutin stilettos similar to the golden ones featured in the video for " Get Outta My Way " .

Gary Pini of Paper described the set of the music video as being " designed by Murakami and Pac Man " with " a cool microphone stand the shoots out laser beams " . Bradley Stern of MuuMuse described it as a mixture of the music videos for " 2 Hearts " and " The One " . He continued , " ... the video for " Better Than Today " kicks Kylie 's X Factor performance up ten notches with laser lights , bright neon animations , extra furry pink shoulders – and of course , killer spiked heels . " <unk> was reminded of the music video for " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " . " I love that she 's brought back her ' Can 't Get You Out of My Head ' robots with an updated Tron feel to them . " They added that the video was " nothing special or ground breaking " .

 Minogue premiered " Better than Today " by adding it to the set list of her 2009 For You , For Me Tour . Prior to performing the song on the first tour date in Oakland , she said , " I know it 's taken me a little long to get [ to the United States ] , so I thought I 'd give you guys a first ... " Rolling Stone commented on Minogue 's background singers during the song , saying they had " the evening 's most striking fashion innovation " : neon pink wigs worn as shoulder pads . After the tour stop in Chicago , John Dugan of Time Out said that the performance was his " favorite song of the night " . 
 To promote the single , Minogue took on a number of television performances . Most of these performances resembled ones from the tour and the music video as well .

She wore a red , fringed cocktail dress with small cut @-@ outs in the waist and the silver heels featured in the music video . She received a standing ovation from all four judges ; Dannii Minogue , who is a judge on the show and Minogue 's sister , gave her praise . She called the performance a " ten out of ten " .

 = Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury = 
 Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil on canvas painting by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907 . It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club at the suggestion of chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win . Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players . With the exception of short @-@ term loans , the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999 , at which time it was moved to the Lord 's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance . In 2006 , Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction . The piece is currently on display at Lord 's Cricket Ground in London . 
 = = Commissioning = = 
 Kent County Cricket Club won the 1906 County Championship , gaining 78 % of the points available in their completed matches , above the 70 % achieved by second @-@ place Yorkshire County Cricket Club . This was Kent 's first victory since the County Championship had been instituted in 1890 . At a celebratory dinner in London , the Kent chairman , George Harris , 4th Baron Harris , suggested that the club commission a painting to celebrate the championship victory . 
 Kent selected Albert Chevallier Tayler as the artist ; he had earlier painted Lord Harris batting for Kent in 1905 . Tayler was paid 200 guineas by Kent for the painting , with an additional royalty for reproductions that could bring the total as high as 350 guineas . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Lord Harris expressed his view that the painting should show an action shot of a match at the St Lawrence Ground , Canterbury , and suggested that the bowler in the painting should be Kent 's Colin Blythe . Kent had only played three matches at Canterbury during the 1906 season ; of those it was decided that the subject of the painting would be Kent 's match against Lancashire County Cricket Club . That match was part of the Canterbury Cricket Week , and Blythe had taken eight wickets , making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict . Tayler decided that he would show the second day of the match , at an hour prior to lunchtime . 
 The painting shows the view from the boundary of the <unk> Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with Canterbury Cathedral visible in the background . The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to Johnny Tyldesley . Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could feature all of Kent 's eleven players while keeping them recognisable and reasonably sized . 
 To ensure accuracy , Tayler arranged sittings with each member of the Kent team and made an effort to paint each one true to life . He initially planned to include non @-@ striking Lancashire batsman Harry Makepeace , but when Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting , Tayler used another Lancashire player , William Findlay , as the batsman . Findlay had not actually played in that particular match , but he was available to visit Tayler 's London studio as he had been newly @-@ appointed secretary of the Surrey County Cricket Club after his retirement from active cricket competition at the end of 1906 . 
 = = Reception and display history = = 
 Tayler completed the painting in 1907 . By this time , 192 advance engravings of the painting had been ordered , ensuring that Tayler would be well compensated for the work . When the painting was unveiled , it was praised for its accuracy , use of lighting , and shade . In 1908 , a limited print signed by Tayler and Lord Harris was created ; further prints were made by Kent in 1990 and 2000 , and each was signed by current players of their respective times , including Colin Cowdrey , E.W. Swanton , Les Ames and Matthew Fleming . As a result of its popularity , the painting was lent out for display at Rectory Field , Blackheath and Lord 's Cricket Ground . The painting is viewed by cricket fans and historians as a notable illustration of the Golden Age of cricket in the Victorian and Edwardian periods before the First World War . Cricket historian E. W. Swanton praised the painting , singling it out as " one of the finest ever portrayals of distinguished identifiable cricketers in action " . 
 The painting was predominantly displayed in the pavilion of the St. Lawrence Ground . However , in 1999 it was lent to Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) after Kent were unable to continue to afford its insurance . The MCC hung the painting in the Lord 's Pavilion while Kent retained one of the prints for display in the St. Lawrence Ground pavilion in place of the original . In 2005 , with Kent finding itself in debt , the club announced their intention to sell the painting . When questioned by Kent members about the proposed sale , Kent chairman Carl Openshaw said that it was being done because he felt the painting no longer particularly benefited the cricket club as many of Kent 's members already owned reproductions of the painting . Openshaw also stated that the painting would not be sold if it did not achieve an " appropriate sum " . 
 The painting was auctioned at Sotheby 's in 2006 . With a guide price of £ 300 @,@ 000 to £ 500 @,@ 000 , the painting was sold for £ 680 @,@ 000 . This was a record price for a cricket painting . It was bought by the Andrew <unk> Art Foundation run by Bath Rugby chairman Andrew <unk> ; the foundation is known for keeping " important British paintings in the public eye in Britain " . The painting 's new owner lent it to the MCC so it could be kept on display at Lord 's in keeping with Openshaw 's preference that the painting remain at Lord 's . The sale of the painting contributed to a £ 293 @,@ 000 profit for Kent in their 2006 financial year . On display in the Long Room in the Lord 's Pavilion , the painting has been used as the background for a number of publicity photographs for the England cricket team , including the unveiling of new England captains . 
 = Disappointed ( Ivy song ) = 
 " Disappointed " is a song recorded by American indie rock band Ivy . It was released as the second single from their third studio album , Long Distance ( 2000 ) . It was released exclusively to the United States on July 10 , 2001 by Nettwerk . The release was simultaneous with the release of ' " Edge of the Ocean " . The track was written by Dominique Durand , Adam Schlesinger , and Andy Chase , while production was handled by the latter two and Peter Nashel . 
 The single received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who found it " memorable " and admired Durand 's vocals . Similar to Ivy 's previous material , " Disappointed " is an indie pop and indie rock song . For promotion of the song , Ivy performed it live on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien in 2001 . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 It took several years for Ivy to finalize the material included on the album due to the birth of lead singer <unk> Durand and musician Andy Chase 's daughter , Justine , in 1999 . During the recording and writing processes for the album , Ivy experienced several unexpected events . Following their drop from Epic Records in 1999 , the recording suffered further delays after their New York City studio burned down . After being without a record label , they considered signing to Japanese music group EastWest to strengthen their fan base . However , independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album ; Ivy signed with both labels and began preparing it for a national release . 
 During recording sessions for the song , Adam Schlesinger and Chase played around with the idea of incorporating new genres into their music ; in an interview with Billboard , Ivy stated " the first songs [ we ] recorded were jangly and simple and straight @-@ ahead . We started gravitating toward the groovier , slightly more melancholy stuff . It works well with Dominique 's voice . " With the exploration , Ivy began crafting " stronger " songs , that were less atmospheric to their previous studio album Apartment Life ( 1997 ) , but contained more " infectious melodies " . 
 = = Composition and promotion = = 
 " Disappointed " was written by Durand , Schlesinger , and Chase , while production was handled by Schlesinger , Chase , and Peter Nashel . The song is an indie pop and indie rock song , similar to Ivy 's signature sound . AllMusic claimed the single 's " taut rhythm and slinky guitars provide a sleekly sexy backdrop for Durand 's wistful vocals . " A reviewer from indie blogger Baby Sue called it a " strange and haunting composition with an unforgettable chorus . " The track was released as a digital download on July 10 , 2001 , alongside " Edge of the Ocean " ; both singles were released to adult alternative radio on the same day . 
 To promote Long Distance , Ivy performed " Disappointed " live on an episode of Late Night with Conan O 'Brien in 2001 . For the performance , the band members wore large , insulated coats and t @-@ shirts . Chase and Schlesinger provided backup vocals for Durand , while Chase played the guitar and Schlesinger played the keyboards .

 " Disappointed " received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics . Jonathan Cohen from Billboard praised the track and commented that " Durand 's sensual vocals are beguiling as ever " . A reviewer from CMJ New Music Monthly enjoyed " the lazy float " of the track , further commenting that " Durand 's near @-@ catatonic delivery [ is ] not a bad idea . " AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine complimented the single 's production and Durand 's vocals , while Heather Phares of the same agency enjoyed the intimacy of the song .

 = Music of Final Fantasy IX = 
 The music of the video game Final Fantasy IX was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu . It was his last exclusive Final Fantasy score . The Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack , a compilation of all music in the game , was originally released on four Compact Discs by DigiCube in 2000 , and was re @-@ released by Square Enix in 2004 . A Best Of and arranged soundtrack album of musical tracks from the game entitled Final Fantasy IX : Uematsu 's Best Selection was released in 2000 by Tokyopop Soundtrax . Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS , an album of music from the game 's full motion videos and extra tracks , was released by DigiCube in 2000 and re @-@ released in 2004 , and a collection of piano arrangements of pieces from the original soundtrack arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi and performed by Louis <unk> was released as Piano Collections Final Fantasy IX in 2001 . 
 The game 's soundtrack is best known for " Melodies of Life , " the theme song of the game , performed by Emiko Shiratori in Japanese and English . The song was released as a single by King Records in 2000 . The soundtrack was based around a theme of medieval music , and was heavily inspired by previous Final Fantasy games , incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks . The music was overall well received ; reviewers found the soundtrack to be both well done and enjoyable , though opinions were mixed as to the reliance on music of previous games . Several tracks , especially " Melodies of Life " and " Vamo ' Alla Flamenco " , remain popular today , and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series , as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups . 
 = = Creation and influence = = 
 In discussions with director Hiroyuki Ito , Uematsu was told " It 'd be fine if you compose tracks for the eight characters , an exciting battle track , a gloomy , danger @-@ evoking piece , and around ten tracks or so . " However , Uematsu spent an estimated year composing and producing " around 160 " pieces for Final Fantasy IX , with 140 appearing in the game . 
 Uematsu composed with a piano , and used two contrasting methods : " I create music that fits the events in the game , but sometimes , the event designer will adjust a game event to fit the music I 've already written . " Uematsu felt previous games Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII had a mood of realism , but that Final Fantasy IX was more of a fantasy , so " a serious piece as well as silly , fun pieces could fit in . " He felt the theme was medieval music , and was given a two @-@ week break to travel in Europe for inspiration - " looking at old castles in Germany and so on . " However , the music was not entirely composed in the medieval mode , as Uematsu claims that " it would be unbalanced " and " a little boring " . He aimed for a " simple , warm " style and included uncommon instruments such as a kazoo and dulcimer . Uematsu also included motifs from older Final Fantasy games " because Final Fantasy IX was returning to the roots , so to speak " and incorporated ideas such as " the old intro for battle music " and arranged the Volcano theme from Final Fantasy and the Pandemonium theme from Final Fantasy II , as well as others from the series . Uematsu has claimed several times that Final Fantasy IX is his favorite work , as well as the one he is most proud of . He also stated in the liner notes for the Final Fantasy IX : Original Soundtrack album that he was " glad that [ he ] was able to join this project . "

 " FINAL FANTASY IX " Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the game , composed , arranged and produced by Nobuo Uematsu . It spans four discs and 110 tracks , covering a duration of 4 : 46 : 31 . It was first released on 30 August 2000 by DigiCube , and subsequently re @-@ released on 10 May 2004 by Square Enix . The lyrics for the theme song to the game , " Melodies of Life " , were written by Hiroyuki Ito for the Japanese version and Alexander O. Smith for the English version . The song was performed in both languages by Emiko Shiratori . 
 The album reached # 4 on the Japan Oricon charts , and sold 101 @,@ 000 copies as of January 2010 . The album was well received ; many reviewers found that it was a " good " soundtrack , though not without faults . Josh <unk> and Roko <unk> of Soundtrack Central especially liked it , finding it to be " a blessing for Final Fantasy music " , and both Patrick Gann of RPGFan and Isaac Engelhorn of Soundtrack Central felt it was Uematsu 's second @-@ best work to date , behind only the soundtrack of Final Fantasy VI . Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan , however , found that the heavy reliance of the soundtrack on music and themes from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks resulted in a sense of " stretched creativity " and " a bit of blandness " , though he still felt it was not " a bad soundtrack ... [ but ] not really a great soundtrack . " Other reviewers , however , such as Engelhorn and Tyler <unk> of Final Fantasy Symphony , enjoyed the fact that it pulled from previous soundtracks , feeling that it gave the album " the classic feel of the older Final Fantasies " while still being " original and beautiful " .

 = Bodiam Castle = 
 Bodiam Castle ( / <unk> / ) is a 14th @-@ century moated castle near Robertsbridge in East Sussex , England . It was built in 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge , a former knight of Edward III , with the permission of Richard II , ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the Hundred Years ' War . Of quadrangular plan , Bodiam Castle has no keep , having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts . Its corners and entrance are marked by towers , and topped by crenellations . Its structure , details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle 's design as well as defence . It was the home of the Dalyngrigge family and the centre of the manor of Bodiam . 
 Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of <unk> , until their line became extinct , when the castle passed by marriage to the Lewknor family . During the Wars of the Roses , Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster , and when Richard III of the House of York became king in 1483 , a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle . It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead , but it is thought that Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance . The castle was confiscated , but returned to the <unk> when Henry VII of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485 . Descendants of the <unk> owned the castle until at least the 16th century . 
 By the start of the English Civil War in 1641 , Bodiam Castle was in the possession of Lord Thanet . He supported the Royalist cause , and sold the castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament . The castle was subsequently dismantled , and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by John Fuller in 1829 . Under his auspices , the castle was partially restored before being sold to George Cubitt , 1st Baron Ashcombe , and later to Lord Curzon , both of whom undertook further restoration work . The castle is protected as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Monument . It has been owned by The National Trust since 1925 , donated by Lord Curzon on his death , and is open to the public . 
 = = Background = = 
 Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father 's estates through the practice of primogeniture , hence he had to make his own fortunes . By 1378 , he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land @-@ owning family . From 1379 to 1388 , Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county . By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate ( build a castle ) , the Hundred Years ' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years . Edward III of England ( reigned 1327 – 1377 ) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais . Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies – groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder . He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel , Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III . After fighting under the Earl of Arundel , Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles , a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100 @,@ 000 gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder . It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle ; he returned to England in 1377 . 
 The Treaty of Bruges ( 1375 ) ensured peace for two years , but after it expired , fighting resumed between England and France . In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II . During the war , England and France struggled for control of the English Channel , with raids on both coasts . With the renewed hostilities , Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England 's south coast , and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion . There was internal unrest as well as external threats , and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 . The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held . In 1385 , a fleet of 1 @,@ 200 ships – variously cogs , barges , and galleys – gathered across the English Channel at Sluys , Flanders ; the population of southern England was in a state of panic . Later in the year , Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house . 
 = = Construction and use = = 
 ... Know that of our special grace we have granted and given licence on behalf of ourselves and our heirs , so far as in us lies , to our beloved and faithful Edward Dalyngrigge Knight , that he may strengthen with a wall of stone and lime , and crenellate and may construct and make into a Castle his manor house of <unk> , near the sea , in the County of Sussex , for the defence of the adjacent country , and the resistance to our enemies ... In witness of which etc . The King at Westminster 20 October . 
 Dalyngrigge 's licence from Richard II permitted him to refortify his existing manor house , but instead he chose a fresh site to build a castle on . Construction was completed in one phase , and most of the castle is in the same architectural style . Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly , probably because of the threat from the French . Stone castles were usually time @-@ consuming and expensive to build , often costing thousands of pounds . Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387 , and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle 's construction . It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge 's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor . It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed , but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392 ; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle , as he was dead by 1395 . 
 <unk> 's estates , including the castle , were inherited by his son , John Dalyngrigge . Like his father , John enjoyed the favour of the king and was described as the " King 's Knight " ; in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100 marks by the king . He died on 27 September 1408 ; his will ensured that his property belonged to his widow , Alice . John and Alice had no children , so on her death in 1443 the estates and castle were passed on to Richard Dalyngrigge , John 's cousin . Richard died without issue , so in accordance with John 's will the estates passed on to Richard 's sister Philippa in 1470 . She was married to Sir Thomas Lewknor , from a prominent Sussex family who owned land all over the country . 
 Sir Thomas Lewknor was a supporter of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses , which began in 1455 . When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483 , Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men @-@ at @-@ arms in southeast England . In November 1483 , Lewknor 's uncle and Thomas Howard , the Earl of Surrey , were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle , where Lewknor was based . It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead , and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance . His property was confiscated , and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle . On Henry VII 's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked , and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor . However , not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542 . Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family . Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries , there is little to indicate how it was used in this period , or if the family spent much time in it . 
 Following Sir Roger Lewknor 's death in 1543 , his estates were divided among his descendants , and the castle and manor were split . John Levett of <unk> purchased the castle in 1588 . In 1623 , most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton , later Earl of Thanet . His son , John Tufton , 2nd Earl of Thanet , inherited Nicholas 's property on his father 's death in 1631 ; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639 . John Tufton was a supporter of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War , and led an attack on Lewes , and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath . Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643 , and more in 1644 , as well as fining him £ 9 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 today ) . To help pay his fine , Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for £ 6 @,@ 000 ( £ 930 @,@ 000 today ) in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell , a Parliamentarian . 
 = = Picturesque ruins = = 
 After the Civil War , Powell was made a baronet by Charles II . Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled ( slighted ) , it was probably after it was bought by Powell . During and after the Civil War , many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused . Not all were destroyed completely , and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure . At Bodiam , it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican , the bridges , and the buildings inside the castle . When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675 , Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son , also called Nathaniel . After the second Nathaniel , the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow , his daughter @-@ in @-@ law . 
 In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle . For over a century , Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the Webster family . It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period . The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid @-@ 18th century , when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy . Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures . 
 The third Sir Godfrey Webster began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815 , and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and 24 acres ( 10 ha ) of the surrounding land to John ' Mad Jack ' Fuller for £ 3 @,@ 000 ( £ 240 @,@ 000 today ) . Fuller repaired one of the towers , added new gates to the site , and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century ; he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials . George Cubitt , later Baron Ashcombe , purchased the castle and its 24 acres ( 97 @,@ 000 m2 ) from Fuller 's grandson in 1849 , for over £ 5 @,@ 000 ( £ 470 @,@ 000 today ) . Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started . He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864 , and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site , which had almost entirely collapsed . Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy , the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry , and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left . 
 Lord Curzon decided that " so rare a treasure [ as Bodiam Castle ] should neither be lost to our country nor desecrated by irreverent hands " . Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle , but Cubitt did not wish to sell . However , after Cubitt 's death , Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt 's son , and he bought Bodiam Castle and its lands in 1916 . Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919 , and with architect William Weir restored parts of the castle . The moat , on average about 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) deep but 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) deep in the southeast corner , was drained and 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) of mud and silt removed ; during excavations the original footings of the bridges to the castle were discovered . Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle . There were excavations in the interior , and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower . Vegetation was cleared , stonework repaired , and the original floor level re @-@ established throughout the castle . A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker . Bodiam Castle was given to the National Trust in 1925 . 
 The National Trust continued the restoration work , and added new roofs to the towers and gatehouse . Excavations were resumed in 1970 , and the moat was once again drained . Bodiam Castle was used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in an establishing shot identifying it as " Swamp Castle " in the " Tale of Sir Lancelot " sequence . The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England carried out a survey of the earthworks surrounding Bodiam Castle in 1990 . In the 1990s , Bodiam Castle was at the centre of a debate in castle studies over the balance between militaristic and social interpretations of such sites . The arguments focused on elements such as the apparent strength of the defences – such as the imposing moat – and elements of display . It has been suggested that the moat could have been drained in a day because the embankment surrounding it was not substantial , and that as such it did not pose a serious obstacle to an attacker . Also , the large windows in the castle 's exterior were defensive weak points . The castle is a Scheduled Monument , which means it is a " nationally important " historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change . It is also a Grade I listed building , and recognised as an internationally important structure . Today the castle is open to the public , and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions , nearly 170 @,@ 000 people visited in 2014 . In the opinion of historian Charles Coulson , Bodiam " represents the popular ideal of a medieval castle " . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Location and landscape = = = 
 The castle 's location was ostensibly chosen to protect England 's south coast from raids by the French . A landscape survey by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that if this were the case , then Bodiam Castle was unusually sited , as it is far from the medieval coastline . 
 The area surrounding Bodiam Castle was landscaped when the castle was built , to increase its aesthetic appeal . Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam as one of the best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle . The water features were originally extensive , but only the moat survives , along with the earthworks left over from its construction . Roughly rectangular , the moat is supplied by several springs , some of them within it , which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s . A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle 's walls , but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape . The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence . The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect , giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour . Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable , and considers it the equal of the 13th @-@ century castles of Edward I in Wales , such as Caerphilly Castle . 
 The castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat . The postern gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat 's south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge . The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge , but the original route would have included two bridges : one from the main entrance to an island in the moat , and another connecting the island to the west bank . For the most part the bridge was static , apart from the section closest to the west bank , which would have been a drawbridge . The island in the moat is called the Octagon , and excavations on it have uncovered a garderobe ( toilet ) , suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island , although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified . The Octagon was connected to a barbican by a bridge , probably a drawbridge . The castle 's 28 toilets drained directly into the moat , which in the words of archaeologist Matthew Johnson would have been effectively an " open sewer " . 
 = = = Exterior and entrance = = = 
 A quadrangular castle , Bodiam is roughly square @-@ shaped . This type of castle , with a central courtyard and buildings against the curtain wall , was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century . Bodiam Castle has been described by military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle . There are circular towers at each of the four corners , with square central towers in the south , east , and west walls . The main entrance is a twin @-@ towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle . There is a second entrance from the south ; the postern gate is through a square tower in the middle of the south wall . The towers are three storeys high , taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high . 
 Between the Octagon and the main gatehouse in the north wall was a barbican , of which little survives – just a piece of the west wall – although the structure was originally two storeys high . The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican 's north gate , although there are no hinges for gates . The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation , probably a guard room . Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway . 
 The gatehouse in the castle 's north wall is three storeys high ; now reached by a static bridge , it was originally connected to the barbican by a drawbridge . The top of the gatehouse is machicolated , and the approach is overlooked by gun @-@ loops in the gatehouse towers . The gatehouse is the only part of the castle which has gun @-@ loops , and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military . There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them . The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises . Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway , although it leads nowhere . The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder @-@ holes . Murder @-@ holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers , similar to machicolations , or to pour water to extinguish fires . 
 Just above the gate , there are three coats of arms carved in relief into the arch ; from left to right they are the arms of the <unk> , Dalyngrigge , and <unk> families . The <unk> family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge 's wife ; the <unk> were relations of the <unk> . Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest . Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate ; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles , who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years ' War , but those flanking it are blank . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 Although the exterior of Bodiam Castle has largely survived , the interior is ruinous . The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls . However , remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle . The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family , high @-@ status guests , the garrisons , and servants . The south range of the castle consisted of the great hall , the kitchens , and associated rooms . The great hall , to the east of the centrally located postern gate , was 24 by 40 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 by 12 @.@ 2 m ) and would have been as tall as the curtain wall . To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery , linked to the great hall by a screens passage . The three standing arches gave access to different rooms , the pantry , buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range . This layout was typical of large medieval houses . The great hall was the social centre of the castle , and where the lord would have entertained guests . The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor , and above was a room of unknown purpose . The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine , while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen . To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable , the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat . In the southwest tower was a well , from which water would have been drawn for the household . 
 Along the east wall is a chapel , a hall , and an antechamber . To accommodate the chapel , the curtain wall near the northeast corner projects 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) further into the moat than the rest of the wall along the east side . Immediately south of the chapel was the main accommodation for the lord and his family . The buildings were two storeys high and incorporated a basement . The exact layout of the rooms is unclear . 
 Arranged along the west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen ; it is not certain what these were used for , although it is probable that these were intended to provide for the household 's retainers . The " retainers ' hall " had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall . Also , whereas the great hall had a large fireplace , the " retainers ' hall " had none . The hall was adjacent to the kitchen , to which it was directly connected , with no screens passage in between . Above the " retainers ' hall " , which was confined to the ground floor , was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose . 
 East of the main gatehouse was a two @-@ storey building with a basement . The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation . The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain . The sparse arrangement , with little provision for lighting , has led to suggestions that it was used as stables , however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables . The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above @-@ ground floors , and there was a basement underneath . 
 = Galilean moons = 
 The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter — Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto . They were discovered by Galileo Galilei around January 1610 and were the first group of objects found to orbit another planet . Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus . They are among the largest objects in the Solar System with the exception of the Sun and the eight planets , with radii larger than any of the dwarf planets . Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System , and is even bigger than the planet Mercury . The three inner moons — Io , Europa , and Ganymede — are in a 4 : 2 : 1 orbital resonance with each other . 
 The Galilean moons were discovered in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope , which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever . Galileo 's discovery showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye . More importantly , the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then @-@ accepted Ptolemaic world system , or the geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth . 
 Galileo initially named his discovery the <unk> Sidera ( " Cosimo 's stars " ) , but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius . Marius discovered the moons independently at the same time as Galileo , and gave them their present names , which were suggested by Johannes Kepler , in his Mundus Jovialis , published in 1614 .

 As a result of improvements Galileo Galilei made to the telescope , with a magnifying capability of 20 × , he was able to see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before . This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what came to be known as the Galilean moons . 
 On January 7 , 1610 , Galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of Jupiter 's moons . At the time , he saw only three of them , and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter . He continued to observe these celestial orbs from January 8 to March 2 , 1610 . In these observations , he discovered a fourth body , and also observed that the four were not fixed stars , but rather were orbiting Jupiter . 
 Galileo 's discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye . More importantly , the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then @-@ accepted Ptolemaic world system , which held that Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it . Galileo 's Sidereus Nuncius ( Starry Messenger ) , which announced celestial observations through his telescope , does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism , a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe . Nevertheless , Galileo accepted the Copernican theory . 
 A Chinese historian of astronomy , Xi <unk> , has claimed that a " small reddish star " observed near Jupiter in 362 BCE by Chinese astronomer Gan De may have been Ganymede , predating Galileo 's discovery by around two millennia . 
 = = = Dedication to the Medicis = = = 
 In 1605 , Galileo had been employed as a mathematics tutor for Cosimo de ' Medici . In 1609 , Cosimo became Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany . Galileo , seeking patronage from his now @-@ wealthy former student and his powerful family , used the discovery of Jupiter 's moons to gain it . On February 13 , 1610 , Galileo wrote to the Grand Duke 's secretary : 
 " God graced me with being able , through such a singular sign , to reveal to my Lord my devotion and the desire I have that his glorious name live as equal among the stars , and since it is up to me , the first discoverer , to name these new planets , I wish , in imitation of the great sages who placed the most excellent heroes of that age among the stars , to inscribe these with the name of the Most Serene Grand Duke . " 
 Galileo asked whether he should name the moons the " <unk> Stars " , after Cosimo alone , or the " Medician Stars " , which would honor all four brothers in the Medici clan . The secretary replied that the latter name would be best . 
 On March 12 , 1610 , Galileo wrote his dedicatory letter to the Duke of Tuscany , and the next day sent a copy to the Grand Duke , hoping to obtain the Grand Duke 's support as quickly as possible . On March 19 , he sent the telescope he had used to first view Jupiter 's moons to the Grand Duke , along with an official copy of Sidereus Nuncius ( The Starry Messenger ) that , following the secretary 's advice , named the four moons the Medician Stars . In his dedicatory introduction , Galileo wrote : 
 Scarcely have the immortal graces of your soul begun to shine forth on earth than bright stars offer themselves in the heavens which , like tongues , will speak of and celebrate your most excellent virtues for all time . Behold , therefore , four stars reserved for your illustrious name ... which ... make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of Jupiter ... like children of the same family ... Indeed , it appears the Maker of the Stars himself , by clear arguments , admonished me to call these new planets by the illustrious name of Your Highness before all others . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Galileo initially called his discovery the <unk> Sidera ( " Cosimo 's stars " ) , in honour of Cosimo II de ' Medici ( 1590 – 1621 ) . At Cosimo 's suggestion , Galileo changed the name to <unk> Sidera ( " the Medician stars " ) , honouring all four Medici brothers ( Cosimo , Francesco , Carlo , and Lorenzo ) . The discovery was announced in the Sidereus Nuncius ( " Starry Messenger " ) , published in Venice in March 1610 , less than two months after the first observations . 
 Other names put forward include : 
 I. <unk> ( for the " prince " of Tuscany ) , II . <unk> ( after Vittoria della Rovere ) , III . <unk> ( after Cosimo de ' Medici ) and IV . <unk> ( after Duke Ferdinando de ' Medici ) – by Giovanni Battista Hodierna , a disciple of Galileo and author of the first ephemerides ( <unk> Ephemerides , 1656 ) ; 
 <unk> Jovis , or Jovis <unk> – by Johannes Hevelius ; 
 Gardes , or Satellites ( from the Latin <unk> , <unk> , meaning " escorts " ) – by Jacques <unk> . 
 The names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius , who discovered the moons independently at the same time as Galileo : he named them at the suggestion of Johannes Kepler after lovers of the god Zeus ( the Greek equivalent of Jupiter ) : Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto , in his Mundus Jovialis , published in 1614 . 
 Galileo steadfastly refused to use Marius ' names and invented as a result the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays , in parallel with proper moon names . The numbers run from Jupiter outward , thus I , II , III and IV for Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto respectively . Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it . The numbered names ( Jupiter x ) were used until the mid @-@ 20th century when other inner moons were discovered , and Marius ' names became widely used . 
 = = = Determination of longitude = = = 
 Galileo was able to develop a method of determining longitude based on the timing of the orbits of the Galilean moons . The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance , and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude . The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship ; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the <unk> . The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re @-@ map France . 
 = = Members = = 
 Some models predict that there may have been several generations of Galilean satellites in Jupiter 's early history . Each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into Jupiter and been destroyed , due to tidal interactions with Jupiter 's proto @-@ satellite disk , with new moons forming from the remaining debris . By the time the present generation formed , the gas in the proto @-@ satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons ' orbits . Other models suggest that Galilean satellites formed in a proto @-@ satellite disk , in which formation timescales were comparable to or shorter than orbital migration timescales . Io is anhydrous and likely has an interior of rock and metal . Europa is thought to contain 8 % ice and water by mass with the remainder rock . These moons are , in increasing order of distance from Jupiter : 
 = = = Io = = = 
 Io is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and , with a diameter of 3 @,@ 642 kilometers , the fourth @-@ largest moon in the Solar System . It was named after Io , a priestess of Hera who became one of the lovers of Zeus . Nevertheless , it was simply referred to as " Jupiter I " , or " The first satellite of Jupiter " , until the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 With over 400 active volcanos , Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System . Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains , some of which are taller than Earth 's Mount Everest . Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System ( which have a thick coating of ice ) , Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core . 
 Although not proven , recent data from the Galileo orbiter indicate that Io might have its own magnetic field . Io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) . If a surface data or collection vessel were to land on Io in the future , it would have to be extremely tough ( similar to the tank @-@ like bodies of the Soviet Venera landers ) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from Jupiter . 
 = = = Europa = = = 
 Europa , the second of the four Galilean moons , is the second closest to Jupiter and the smallest at <unk> @.@ 6 kilometers in diameter , which is slightly smaller than the Moon . The name comes from a mythical Phoenician noblewoman , Europa , who was courted by Zeus and became the queen of Crete , though the name did not become widely used until the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 It is one of the smoothest objects in the Solar System , with a layer of water surrounding the mantle of the planet , thought to be 100 kilometers thick . The smooth surface includes a layer of ice , while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water . The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it , which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life . Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity . Life may exist in Europa 's under @-@ ice ocean , perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth 's deep @-@ ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok . Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean . So far , there is no evidence that life exists on Europa , but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there . 
 The prominent markings that criss @-@ cross the moon seem to be mainly albedo features , which emphasize low topography . There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young . Some theories suggest that Jupiter 's gravity is causing these markings , as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter . Also , volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa , and even geysers have been considered as a cause . The color of the markings , reddish @-@ brown , is theorized to be caused by sulfur , but scientists cannot confirm that , because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa . Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core . It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen . 
 = = = Ganymede = = = 
 Ganymede , the third Galilean moon is named after the mythological Ganymede , cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus 's beloved . Ganymede is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System at <unk> @.@ 4 kilometers in diameter , which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world . It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere , likely created through convection within the liquid iron core . 
 Ganymede is composed primarily of silicate rock and water ice , and a salt @-@ water ocean is believed to exist nearly 200 km below Ganymede 's surface , sandwiched between layers of ice . The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat at some time in its past than had previously been proposed . The surface is a mix of two types of terrain — highly cratered dark regions and younger , but still ancient , regions with a large array of grooves and ridges . Ganymede has a high number of craters , but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them . The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O , O2 , and possibly O3 ( ozone ) , and some atomic hydrogen . 
 = = = Callisto = = = 
 Callisto is the fourth and last Galilean moon , and is the second largest of the four , and at <unk> @.@ 6 kilometers in diameter , it is the third largest moon in the Solar System . Callisto was a daughter of the <unk> King <unk> and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis . It does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating . Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices , which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons . It is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System , and one major feature is a basin around 3000 km wide called Valhalla . 
 Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen . Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths greater than 100 kilometers . The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbor life . However , this is less likely than on nearby Europa . Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter . 
 = = Comparative structure = = 
 Fluctuations in the orbits of the moons indicate that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter . Callisto , the outermost and least dense of the four , has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io , the innermost and densest moon , has a density intermediate between rock and iron . Callisto has an ancient , heavily @-@ cratered and unaltered ice surface and the way it rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed , suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice . This may well have been the original structure of all the moons . The rotation of the three inner moons , in contrast , indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above . They also reveal significant alteration of the surface . Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers . Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature , suggesting a thinner ice crust . Finally , Io , the innermost moon , has a sulfur surface , active volcanism and no sign of ice . All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior . The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet . In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice , allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface . In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed . In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed . In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space .

 Jupiter 's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a <unk> disk , a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk . They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean @-@ mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter 's history . 
 Simulations suggest that , while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment , over time a substantial fraction ( several tenths of a percent ) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it . However , the disk mass of only 2 % that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites . Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean @-@ mass satellites in Jupiter 's early history . Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter , due to drag from the disk , with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula . By the time the present ( possibly fifth ) generation formed , the disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons ' orbits . The current Galilean moons were still affected , falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io , Europa , and Ganymede . Ganymede 's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io . 
 = = Visibility = = 
 All four Galilean moons are bright enough that they could be sighted from Earth without a telescope , if they were farther away from Jupiter . ( They are , however , easily visible with even low @-@ powered binoculars . ) They have apparent magnitudes between 4 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun , and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction . The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness . The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter , which is close to the limit of human visual acuity . Ganymede and Callisto , at their maximum separation , are the likeliest targets for potential naked @-@ eye observation . 
 = The Boat Race 1935 = 
 The 87th Boat Race took place on 6 April 1935 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Umpired by former Oxford rower Robert Bourne , Cambridge won by four and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 48 seconds . The record twelfth consecutive victory took the overall record in the event to 46 – 40 in Cambridge 's favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1934 race by four and a quarter lengths , and led overall with 45 victories to Oxford 's 40 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Cambridge 's coaches were D. H. E. McCowen ( who had rowed in the 1932 race ) and , according to the rowing correspondent for The Times , " two eminent Metropolitan coaches " in R. A. Nisbet and C. H. Rew . Oxford were coached by Francis Escombe and Peter Haig @-@ Thomas , both of whom previously coached the Light Blues , and former Light Blue rower Kenneth Payne ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races ) . The race was umpired by former Oxford rower and boat club president Robert Bourne who had stroked the Dark Blues to four consecutive victories between 1909 and 1912 , while the finishing judge was C. W. Kent . Both boats were made by Sims and both crews used Ayling 's oars . 
 The rowing correspondent for The Times noted that " neither crew is exceptionally fast " and suggested that Oxford 's heavier crew would out @-@ perform Cambridge , who he claimed " will be seen at their best in calm conditions " . As a result of Oxford 's practice rows during the period running up to the race , former Dark Blue rower E. P. Evans , writing in The Manchester Guardian , stated " Cambridge are now at the zenith of their power and are not likely to improve , whilst Oxford are still in the stages of reaching perfection " . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 13 lb ( 81 @.@ 9 kg ) , 4 @.@ 375 pounds ( 2 @.@ 0 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge saw four participants with Boat Race experience return to the crew , including cox Noel Duckworth . The Light Blue crew also included a pair of brothers in <unk> and Desmond Kingsford . Oxford 's crew also contained four former Blues , including P. R. S. Bankes and John Couchman , both of whom were rowing in their third consecutive race . All of the race participants were registered as British .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . The umpire Bourne started the race at 2 : 48 p.m. in strong and gusty wind , and rough water . The Light Blues made the quicker start , out @-@ rating Oxford by three strokes within the first minute , and led by half a length . Thirty seconds later , Cambridge were clear and were further ahead by Craven Steps . By the end of the Fulham Wall , Duckworth steered directly towards the Surrey shore in an attempt to find shelter from the conditions . A spurt from the Dark Blues made no difference to the gap and Cambridge passed the Mile Post almost two lengths ahead . Another spurt from Oxford at Harrods Furniture Depository once again made no impact on the deficit and Cambridge passed below Hammersmith Bridge with a lead of three lengths . 
 Intelligent steering from C. G. F. Bryan , the Oxford cox , saw the Dark Blues " hugging the Surrey bank " to reduce the Cambridge lead to about a length by Chiswick Eyot . It was short @-@ lived however , as Bryan steered back over towards the Middlesex side of the river , losing his crew a length in doing so and moving into rougher water , and by Chiswick Steps , the Light Blues were four and a half lengths ahead . Cambridge 's stroke Ran Laurie called for a spurt and by the time they passed under Barnes Bridge they were five lengths ahead . They crossed to the Middlesex side of the river before passing the finishing post with a lead of four and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 48 seconds . It was a record twelfth victory for the Light Blues and took the overall record in the event to 46 – 40 in their favour . Former Oxford rower E. P. Evans , writing in The Manchester Guardian , stated that Cambridge " won in the easiest manner possible , having led from start to finish " and described the race as a " fiasco " . The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that " never was it so obvious after the first few strokes that there was only one crew in the race ... Oxford 's form was too bad to be true . " 
 = Sharon Kay Penman = 
 Sharon Kay Penman ( born August 13 , 1945 ) is an American historical novelist , published in the UK as Sharon Penman . She is best known for the Welsh Princes trilogy and the Plantagenet series . In addition , she has written four medieval mysteries , the first of which , The Queen 's Man , was a finalist in 1996 for the Best First Mystery Edgar Award . Her novels and mysteries are set in England , France , and Wales , and are about English and Welsh royalty during the Middle Ages . The Sunne in Splendour , her first book , is a stand @-@ alone novel about King Richard III of England and the Wars of the Roses . When the manuscript was stolen she started again and rewrote the book . 
 Her work is generally well received , with the more recent novels reaching the New York Times Bestseller List . Critics have praised her meticulous research of settings and events presented in her fiction , as well as the characterizations . 
 = = Career = = 
 Born in New York City , Penman grew up in New Jersey . She received her bachelor 's degree from the University of Texas at Austin , where she majored in history . She also received a Juris Doctor ( J.D. ) degree from Rutgers University School of Law , and worked as a tax lawyer before becoming a writer . While a student , Penman researched and wrote The Sunne in Splendour that chronicled the life of Richard III . When the 400 @-@ page manuscript was stolen from her car , Penman found herself unable to write for the next five years . She eventually rewrote the book and by the time the 936 page book was published in 1982 she had spent 12 years writing it , while practicing law at the same time . Of practicing law , she admits she " considered it penance . " Penman lives in New Jersey , and in the early 1980s moved to Wales to research her second book , Here Be Dragons . She has a second home in the Welsh mountains where , she says , the history inspires her and provides material for her novels . 
 = = Writing career = = 
 The Sunne in Splendour is about the end of England 's War of the Roses . In the book , Penman characterizes King Richard III as a healthy , if misunderstood , ruler . She chose to write Richard 's character in such a way after becoming fascinated with his story and researching his life , both in the United States and in the United Kingdom , which led her to believe that " his was a classic case of history being rewritten by the victor . " 
 Once finished with The Sunne in Splendour she claims to have become " hopelessly hooked " on writing . She had plenty of material to be written about the " rebellious sons and disgruntled brothers and conniving kings and willful queens " of the Plantagenets and hoped to write as many as a dozen books on the subject . After the publication of The Sunne in Splendour , Penman began work on the Welsh Trilogy , set primarily in Wales . The " Welsh Trilogy " was followed by the " Plantagenet series " , which presents the events of the life of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine . 
 Penman 's settings are all in the Middle Ages ; the Welsh Princes trilogy is set in the 13th century , two centuries earlier than The Sunne in Splendour . During her research for Here Be Dragons , the first book in the series , she became fascinated with the complexity of the role of women in medieval society ; for example , Welsh women at the time had a great deal more independence than the English women . Whether in Wales or in England , a noble wife had responsibility for a household , complete with household knights , whom the wife relied upon to keep the household safe . 
 In 1996 Penman published the first in the series of medieval mystery novels . Penman 's first mystery , The Queen 's Man , was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America . Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels : " By the time I 'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept , I was in danger of burning out . For the first time in nearly two decades , my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag . So I decided I needed a change of pace , and since I am a long @-@ time mystery fan , it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write . Once that idea took root , it was probably inevitable that I 'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine , surely one of history 's most memorable women . " 
 Set in the 12th century , Penman presents the young Justin de Quincy as a medieval sleuth . In the first book he is elevated to the status of " queen 's man " by Eleanor of Aquitaine . The Queen 's Man and Cruel as the Grave depict the period after King Henry II 's death , as Eleanor , about age 70 , rules the Angevin empire with one son ( Richard ) in captivity , and another son ( John ) hovering at the edge of power . The third novel in the series , The Dragon 's Lair , is set during the same period , but Penman shifts the locale to northwest England and north Wales . And finally , in the most recent novel of the series , Prince of Darkness , Penman continues to show the conflict between mother and sons , and weaves in de Quincy 's conflicts as well . 
 In addition to the Edgar Award , Penman is the winner of the 2001 Career Achievement Award for Historical Mysteries from Romantic Times . 
 = = Welsh Princes trilogy = = 
 Here Be Dragons ( 1985 ) is the first of Penman 's trilogy of novels about the medieval princes of Gwynedd . Of the novel , Penman states , “ I think Dragons is so popular because it was virgin territory for most readers . The saga of the Plantagenets was much better known , but not many people were familiar with medieval Wales or its princes . And then , too , the story of Llewelyn the Great and Joanna , King John ’ s illegitimate daughter , is a remarkable one , which struck an emotional chord with many readers . ” 
 In Falls the Shadow ( 1988 ) Penman chronicles the family relationships of King Henry III and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Simon de Montfort . Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead her to the conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning . As Penman explains : ' “ After I ’ d finished Here Be Dragons , I knew I wanted to continue the story … At first I ’ d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr ’ s grandson , Llewelyn ap Gruffydd , who later wed Simon ’ s daughter . I soon realized , though , that this was too much to tackle in one book , that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel . So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn " . 
 Penman 's characterization of Simon de Montfort is that of a man increasingly disillusioned by his sovereign , who rebels in 1263 , becomes regent to Henry III , and attempts to reestablish rights granted under the Magna Carta . In addition to the story of Simon de Montfort and his wife , Eleanor the Countess of Pembroke and sister to King Henry III , the novel presents characters such as the Welsh ruler Llywelyn Fawr and London 's <unk> . 
 Of her research for Falls the Shadow , Penman explains : " I did a great deal of on @-@ site research , visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow , visiting the Reading Room at the British Library , the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth , and local reference libraries … Here at home , I made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia , which has an excellent medieval selection . But it really helped to see the scenes for myself . At Lewes , we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed . It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs , gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen " . 
 The Reckoning ( 1991 ) chronicles the reign of England 's King Henry III in Penman 's final volume of the series that began with Here Be Dragons . The conflict between the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd who is the grandson of Llewelyn the Great of Here Be Dragons , and England 's King Henry III is one subplot . Additionally , Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen , daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III ; her betrothal to Llewellyn ( negotiated prior to de Montfort 's death ) ; and the conflict between Ellen and her cousin Edward , soon to become King Edward , who opposes the betrothal . 
 = = Plantagenet series = = 
 The Plantagenet series focuses on the Angevin King Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine , beginning with the sinking of the White Ship , the marriage of the Empress Maude and Geoffrey of Anjou , and Henry 's birth and childhood in When Christ and His Saints Slept . Of Henry and Eleanor , Penman explains : 
 Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine were larger than life , legends in their own lifetimes . He was one of the greatest of the medieval kings , and she was the only woman to wear the crowns of both England and France . They loved and fought and schemed on a stage that stretched from the Scots border to the Mediterranean Sea . Their children were branded by contemporaries as " The Devil ’ s Brood , " but they founded a dynasty that was to rule England for three hundred years . 
 My first novel in their trilogy [ sic ] , When Christ and His Saints Slept , traces the beginning of their tempestuous union . Time and Chance continues their story at high noon . From the <unk> of Wales to a bloodied floor at Canterbury Cathedral , theirs was an amazing story , and I very much enjoyed being along for the ride ! 
 When Christ and His Saints Slept introduces the genesis of the Plantagenet dynasty as Queen Maude fights to secure her claim to the English throne . In the 15 years she spent writing three novels and four mysteries set during the period of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine Penman claims she found no villains . Instead she focused on the human characteristics : she believes Henry II was a brilliant king but a bad father . Of Eleanor of Aquitaine , she claims she was a " law unto herself " , and Penman was intrigued by the role of a medieval queen . 
 Time and Chance ( 2002 ) , a New York Times Bestseller , continues the story of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband , and focuses on the rift between Henry II and Thomas Becket . Time and Chance spans a 15 @-@ year period from 1156 to 1171 as Henry II became estranged from his wife ( although Eleanor and Henry have eight children during thirteen years ) , and from his close friend and advisor Thomas Becket . King Henry 's decision to elevate Becket to the Archbishop of Canterbury becomes a fulcrum for discord between Henry and Eleanor . 
 The Devil 's Brood ( 2008 ) opens with the conflict between Henry II , his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine , and their four sons , which escalates into a decade of warfare and rebellion pitting the sons against the father and the brothers against each other while Eleanor spends the period imprisoned by Henry . Penman places the characters against a tightly woven tapestry of medieval life , personal conflict , and dramatic characters . 
 The Devil 's Brood was supposed to be the final volume in Penman 's Plantagenet series , but the " Angevins were not ready to go quietly into that good night . " Lionheart ( 2011 ) is about the children of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine . The book focuses on Richard the Lionheart 's Crusades in the Holy Land and on what happened to Eleanor when she was finally released after spending sixteen years in a confinement that was ordered and enforced by her husband . A King 's Ransom is about the second half of Richard 's life , during and following his imprisonment , ransom , and life afterward . 
 = = Writing characteristics = = 
 Penman 's approach to her novels is to present meticulously researched medieval life and history as everyday life , and to present the nobility as fallible . Set against a backdrop of political tension , power struggles , war , and hardship , the main characters confront personal drama such as conflict in love , conflict between family members , conflict with God , and conflict in friendship , as well as conflicted loyalties between family , self , king and country . A Library Journal review praises Penman 's attention to detail in which she " combines an in @-@ depth knowledge of medieval Europe with vivid storytelling , re @-@ creating the complex events and emotional drama of the 12th – 15th centuries . " 
 Although set in the 12th and 13th centuries , Penman sets the characters and narrative in her novels in medieval sites that still exist and can be visited , including castles , churches and archeological areas . Areas such as Aber Falls and Dolwyddelan Castle have important scenes in Penman 's novels . In Devil 's Brood , Penman sets the characters in scenes in a variety of medieval royal residences , castles and abbeys , in England and present day France , many of which still exist such as the Château de Chinon , Fontevrault Abbey , and Chateau de <unk> .

 The Pan American Games sports comprise all the sports contested in the Summer Olympic Games . In addition , traditional and popular sports throughout the Americas which are not contested at the Olympic Games are also contested such as bowling and baseball . As of 2015 , the Pan American Games included 36 sports with 51 disciplines and 364 events . The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Pan American Games to another . 
 = = Sports , disciplines , events = = 
 For purposes of Pan American Games competition , the Pan American Sports Organization ( PASO ) makes a distinction between sports and disciplines . A sport , in Pan American Games terms , is a single or group of disciplines as represented by an international governing body , namely an International Federation . For example , aquatics , represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation , is a sport at the Pan American Games that includes the swimming , diving , synchronized swimming and water polo disciplines . 
 Canoe slalom is the only Olympic discipline not on the Pan American Games program . It was , in fact , scheduled to be held at both the 2007 and 2011 Pan American Games , but due to the small number of countries competing in the discipline , the event was dropped . However , the discipline is scheduled to make its debut at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto , Canada . 
 Medals are awarded on a per @-@ event basis ; there can be one or more events per sport or discipline . In fact , besides baseball , rugby sevens , and softball , every current Pan American Games discipline has at least two events . 
 = = = Changes = = = 
 A sport or discipline appears on the Pan American Games program if it is included on the Olympic program . For the traditional Pan American Games sports , PASO determines if they are widely practised around the Americas ; that is , the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport 's prevalence . PASO 's requirements reflect participation in the Pan American Games as well , especially more stringent toward men ( as they are represented in higher numbers ) . 
 Previous Pan American Games have included sports which are no longer present on the current program , like futsal and polo . 
 The International Olympic Committee voted on October 9 , 2009 , during the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen , to elevate both rugby sevens and golf as official Olympic sports and to include them in the Olympics , beginning with the 2016 Olympic Games . With this development , rugby sevens made its debut at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara , and golf was played at the 2015 Pan American Games . During a PASO general assembly in 2015 , surfing was included into the 2019 Pan American Games programme .

 Midsomer Norton / <unk> <unk> / is a town near the Mendip Hills in Bath & North East Somerset , England , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south @-@ west of Bath , 10 miles ( 16 km ) north @-@ east of Wells , 10 miles ( 16 km ) north @-@ west of Frome , and 16 miles ( 26 km ) south @-@ east of Bristol . It has a population of 10 @,@ 997 . Along with Radstock and Westfield it used to be part of the conurbation and large civil parish of Norton Radstock , but is now a town council in its own right . It is also part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset . 
 Midsomer Norton is characterised by the River Somer which runs the length of the town centre , the river itself was regenerated with new plant life during the summer of 2012 in a bid to improve the aesthetics of the town centre . The Town has a long history which can be seen through a number of early churches which remain , but really started to grow and become a transport hub with the development of the Somerset coalfield . For many years the coalmines provided employment for local men until they ceased operations in the 1960s , around the same time that the town 's two railway stations also closed . Afterwards , good employment opportunities still remained for the town with elements of the print industry , and although some of these plants have also now begun to close , overall employment levels in the area remain very high . 
 Midsomer Norton provides shopping and service industries for the surrounding areas and supports several music venues and bands . The town has four primary schools and two large secondary schools . Midsomer Norton is home to a leisure centre , several sports clubs and provides youth opportunities such as Scouts and Guides . It has been the birthplace or home to several notable people . 
 = = History = = 
 " Norton " means ' north enclosure ' from the Old English , while the use of its forename to distinguish it from other ' <unk> ' is of late origin and not mentioned until 1334 . Sources point to the town being situated midway between two branches of the Somer river ; the Somer itself and Wellow Brook , which joins the Somer a short distance to the east near Radstock . 
 The spelling " <unk> Norton " may be a variation 
 Eilert Ekwall wrote that the village " is said to be so called in allusion to the festival held at midsummer on the day of St. John , the patron saint . " 
 John Wesley wrote of the appalling local road conditions which ensured it was reachable " only in midsummer . " As Simon Winchester notes in his book The Map that Changed the World , " ... the roads on this part of Somerset were atrocious , thick with mud and as rough as the surface of the moon " . 
 In some church records the town is referred to as ' Norton <unk> ' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton , and this may be because of the local Priory 's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546 . 
 The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton . 
 Following the Norman Conquest William the Conqueror gave large parts of north Somerset , including the manor or Norton to Geoffrey de Montbray , bishop of Coutances , and Norton was held under him by <unk> . From about 1150 until 1300 the manor was held by Alured de Lincoln . From 1387 the manor was held by the family of Thomas West , 1st Baron West and his descendants . 
 The Duchy of Cornwall owned most of the mineral rights around Midsomer Norton and various small pits opened around 1750 to exploit these . Coal mining in the Somerset coalfield gave the town and area its impetus as an industrial centre . 
 Around 1866 an obelisk Crimean War monument with two marble plaques , was built at the site of St Chad 's well , by the mother of Frederick Stukeley Savage for the benefit of the poor . The obelisk was in the grounds of Norton House , a Georgian mansion built by Thomas Savage , an investor in coalmines in the area , in 1789 . The house itself has since been demolished but other features of its estate are still visible at Silver Street Nature reserve ( see below ) . 
 = = Governance = = 
 There are 2 electoral wards in the town from which Midsomer Norton elects its own Town Council with an elected Mayor . It is part of the North East Somerset constituency , which elects a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament . 
 The Palladian council offices were built in the mid to late 18th century . The Town Hall was built in an Italianate style in 1860 by Thomas Harris Smith . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The main geological feature in this area of the Mendip Hills south of Hallatrow consists of Supra @-@ Pennant Measures which includes the upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone . The relics of the industrial past are very evident within the area , including the distinct conical shape of the Old Mills batch overlooking the town . Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer which rises to the west of <unk> and on the Wellow Brook which rises near the village of Ston Easton . The town therefore occupies two valleys of the Mendip Hills and these merge west of Radstock . The combined river then flows east reaching the River Avon near Midford , thence to Bath and through Bristol into the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth . 
 On the southern fringes of the town is the 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) Silver Street Local Nature Reserve , on the site of the estate of Norton House , an eighteenth century mansion built by the coalmine @-@ owning Savage family but demolished in 1937 @-@ 8 . It contains a broad @-@ leaf woodland around several ponds , a restored nineteenth @-@ century wellhead that supplied water to the house , and a grassland field . The woodland is leased to the Somerset and Dorset Heritage Railway Trust by Bath and North East Somerset Council and the meadow in the stewardship of Somervale School . 
 Along with the rest of South West England , the Midsomer Norton has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England . The annual mean temperature is about 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) with seasonal and diurnal variations , but the modifying effect of the sea , restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom . January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) and 2 ° C ( 36 ° F ) . July and August are the warmest , with mean daily maxima around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . In general , December is the dullest month and June the sunniest . The south @-@ west of England enjoys a favoured location , particularly in summer , when the Azores High extends its influence north @-@ eastwards towards the UK . 
 Cloud often forms inland , especially near hills , and reduces exposure to sunshine . The average annual sunshine is about 1 @,@ 600 hours . Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection . In summer , convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year . Average rainfall is around 800 – 900 mm ( 31 – 35 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , with June to August having the lightest ; the prevailing wind direction is from the south @-@ west . 
 = = Midsomer Norton flood alleviation scheme = = 
 For many years , the centre of Midsomer Norton was prone to flooding . Sometimes several times a year , the Somer rose up during prolonged rainfall and flooded shops , particularly where the high street is at its lowest point in the middle between Martin ’ s newsagent and the former Palladium cinema . 
 To prevent future <unk> , a major flood alleviation tunnel — completed in 1977 – was constructed beneath the high street to remove excess water when the town centre was threatened with flooding . The infrastructure comprises a sluice gate situated at the top of the high street near Somervale School through which the water is carried under the town via a pre @-@ cast concrete culvert several metres in diameter to an outlet further downstream at <unk> . Since it began operation , no flooding has occurred to the high street and an Environment Agency report confirms that the relief scheme remains in good condition and continues to serve to its 100 @-@ year standard . 
 Despite the success of the scheme , some outlying areas of the town are now rated at increased risk of flooding from Wellow Brook due to climate change and the increased provision of housing in the vicinity . In 2008 a new monitoring station was installed at nearby Welton through which data on water pressure and flood levels can be collected via metal tubes placed in the river linked to a telemetry box . This facility is now providing the Environment Agency with extremely useful information for use in future assessments of flood risk . 
 = = Industry and commerce = = 
 For hundreds of years mining was an important industry for the area , and there were a number of mines in Midsomer Norton , e.g. Old Mills , Norton Hill , and Welton . However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around , not easily worked . Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum . The coming of the railways , particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ( S & D ) in 1874 , transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area . 
 The last pit in the town , at Norton Hill , closed in 1966 . Despite modernisation in the early 1960s , this final pit lapsed into unprofitability due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages . 
 One of the town 's most successful companies was <unk> , manufacturer of prefabricated classrooms , founded and run as a family firm from 1912 . It was acquired by <unk> in 1980 before its main factory site in Charlton Road in the town was demolished in the 1990s . 
 Midsomer Norton traditionally hosted other industries and became a major manufacturing centre for printing and packaging . Some 2 @,@ 000 people ( 27 % of total employment ) work in this industry locally . Following the decline of mining , these companies expanded on local trading estates and in Welton . The sites of the disused collieries in the area have subsequently been developed for light industry . 
 In recent years some of the larger firms have disappeared or relocated , with poor transport links being cited as a handicap . A large packaging company , Alcan Mardon closed in 2006 , although the social club remains . Another extremely important plant , <unk> Purnell , based in nearby Paulton also closed the same year with the loss of 400 jobs . In August 2011 , the town 's largest remaining employer , Welton , Bibby & Baron , the largest producer of recyclable paper bags in Europe , announced the closure of its site in Welton , which it occupied for 150 years . The company , known locally as ‘ Welton Bag ’ plans to move to larger premises at Westbury in Wiltshire , but promises to transfer all 400 jobs to the new site . 
 The business parks remain busy however , and the town and environs has its share of national trading companies including supermarkets and retail outlets . The town 's High Street has free parking . Many inhabitants commute to Bath and Bristol for employment and shopping . 
 Dial @-@ a @-@ Ride services for the elderly and handicapped are well used , along with the local Community minibus set up by the local Rotary Club in 1967 under Midsomer Norton & Radstock Community Service Vehicle Trust . This vehicle is for use primarily by organisations in the area serving the disabled and infirm . 
 = = The railways = = 
 The town was previously served by a station on the Somerset and Dorset Railway ( S & D ) but this closed in 1966 , and by a second station on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway at Welton in the valley . The railways were separate , the S & D being administered by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway companies ( later the London Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway ) and the North Somerset being run by and then owned by the Great Western Railway . The stations were both called " Midsomer Norton and Welton " ( the B & NSR station was originally called just " Welton " ) ; under British Railways , the S & D station was renamed as Midsomer Norton South after a short period as Midsomer Norton Upper ; and is currently being restored with occasional open weekends with engines in steam . The Somerset & Dorset Railway Heritage Trust one day hopes to operate steam trains for a mile up to <unk> Tunnel but there remains much to do before this can happen . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Midsomer Norton ’ s railway station has been memorialised , along with many other stations , in a famous song associated with railway closures , Slow Train , with lyrics by Michael Flanders and music by Donald Swann : 
 Children ’ s author Roald Dahl , prior to his writing fame , used to sell kerosene in Midsomer Norton and the surrounding area in the 1930s . He described the experience vividly in his autobiographical work Boy : Tales of Childhood ( published 1984 ) : 
 The Waugh family connection with Midsomer Norton began when Dr Alexander Waugh , father of Arthur Waugh and grandfather of Evelyn Waugh and Alec Waugh moved to Island House , which had been built in the early 18th century , in The Island in the centre of the town in 1865 . The family later moved to a house in Silver Street . As a boy , Evelyn Waugh spent his summer holidays in Midsomer Norton with his maiden aunts . He later described his visits there : “ I suppose that in fact I never spent longer than two months there in any year , but the place captivated my imagination as my true home never did . ” 
 The Palladium cinema was opened as the Empire in 1913 in a building which had previously been a brewery . It closed in 1993 and various attempts were made to turn it into a club and shop , before Wetherspoons announced in January 2015 that they had acquired the site and intended to seek planning and licensing permission to convert it to a pub . The town was left without cinema for almost two decades . Cinema was brought back to the town under the Palladium name in 2012 with a new community cinema at the Town Hall . In 2013 , permanent cinema equipment was installed in the building and there are now regular film screenings of both modern and classic films . 
 The town is commemorated in “ The Sheriff of Midsomer Norton ” a song by local Somerset band The Wurzels . Midsomer Norton hosts the only unofficial carnival on the West Country Carnival circuit . Originally , floats travelled through the main High Street but road improvements put paid to the larger vehicles and for many years the procession was held on the main Fosseway through Westfield . Since 2014 however , the carnival has returned to the High Street following changes made to the traffic layout . 
 The town ’ s free newspaper is the Midsomer Norton , Radstock & District Journal . The other local weekly paper is the Somerset Guardian , which is part of the Daily Mail and General Trust . The monthly magazine , the Mendip Times , also includes local features . Somer Valley FM ( <unk> and online ) is the Community Radio for the district . There is also a community website where residents can discuss local issues called Midsomer Norton People . 
 On 17 @-@ 18 June 2016 the town 's first ever LGBT Pride celebration event was held .

 Regular concerts and events are held in the town in both local community buildings and local pubs and bars . 
 A popular live music venue in the town is The <unk> .

It plays host to its own internet radio station that specialises in playing local underground rock and punk music . 
 On the first Friday of every month the Paradis Palm Court Trio perform free classical concerts in the Town Hall . Choir concerts ( male voices in particular ) command a local following and the Lions club is a promoter of such attractions usually held in the Methodist or Parish churches . 
 There are a number of thriving local brass bands . In 2006 Midsomer Norton hosted the European Open Marching and Show Band Championship which saw many bands from all over Europe visit the town .

 Anthony Horowitz , the original writer of Midsomer Murders , borrowed part of the name of the town when he adapted Caroline Graham ’ s Chief Inspector Barnaby series for television in 1997 . Although the series itself is primarily filmed in picturesque villages in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire , Horowitz chose the name after looking at a map of Somerset , believing that it sounded quintessentially English . Although no filming of the show has ever taken place in Midsomer Norton or the surrounding parishes , some names of other nearby locations have been used by the producers in creating their fictional county of Midsomer , including Midsomer Wellow ( Wellow ) , Midsomer Magna ( Chew Magna ) , Midsomer Morton and the main settlement of <unk> ( <unk> ) . Despite some occasional confusion , there is no other link between Midsomer Norton and the television series .

 The Old Priory , which was a hotel and restaurant , dates from the early to mid 17th century . Another old building is the Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost , which is a 15th @-@ century tithe barn converted by the famous architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott . It is a grade II * listed building . The local Catholic community are served by Benedictine monks from nearby Downside Abbey , coming under the Diocese of Clifton . 
 The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist has a tower dating from the 15th century , although the upper stages are from the 17th century , but the rest was rebuilt in Gothic Revival style by John Pinch the younger in 1830 – 1831 and was extended in the 20th century with new chancel and lady chapel . It is a grade II * listed building . The churchyard includes a memorial to the 12 miners killed in 1839 when their rope was severed . St. John 's is part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells . The Patronage vests in Christ Church , Oxford . 
 The Methodist Church in the town 's High Street celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2009 . In 1746 , John Wesley 's travelling preachers , based in Bristol were invited in the mid @-@ 1700s to support the local society , the man himself first coming in 1767 . By the middle of the 1800s , the congregation had outgrown the original chapel erected in 1775 in <unk> Road ( now demolished ) . In the 1990s , the present church building and adjoining hall were totally refurbished and linked , the facilities being well used by the local community . Local Methodists are part of the Bristol District of the Methodist Church and in the North East Somerset & Bath Circuit . 
 The Baptist Church have their building in Welton but hold their Sunday morning service at Somervale School now in order to accommodate their growing congregation . 
 The Salvation Army meet in their citadel at Stones Cross . There is a successful Scout group , the 1st Midsomer Norton Scout Group based at Radstock Road , providing scouting to around 140 boys and girls per week , and a similarly popular Guide group a short distance away at Rock Hall .

 First schools for children up to 11 include Midsomer Norton Primary , St. John 's Church of England , Welton Primary , <unk> Primary and Westfield Primary . In addition , St <unk> Catholic Primary School on the edge of Midsomer Norton with a ' Midsomer Norton , Radstock ' postal address , is actually part of the neighbouring Somerset County Council 's education service . 
 There are two local secondary schools . Norton Hill School has approximately 1 @,@ 400 students from the age of 11 to 18 . In 1999 it became a Technology College and in 2007 changed specialism to become a Maths and Computing College . In 2006 Norton Hill was also awarded a second specialism as a Language College . The school was described by Ofsted in 2007 as outstanding in every respect . The school has received both the Sportsmark Award by Sport England and <unk> Silver Award . Somervale School which has foundation status , is a specialist Arts College . In 2008 , the school was the first in Bath and North East Somerset to win the Eco @-@ Schools Silver Award . The number of pupils on the school roll has fallen to 603 . This fall prompted the school to propose a federation with nearby Norton Hill School in March 2009 called the Midsomer Norton Schools Partnership [ 1 ] . This is now in place with Alun Williams as the overall head teacher of both schools within the federation . In October 2010 the federation was confirmed as an academy . Both secondary schools were awarded ' Good ' by Ofsted in January 2013 . The two schools share one sixth form called the Midsomer Norton Sixth Form which is based across the two sites . 
 The town is served by a further education college , the Somer Valley branch of Bath College , in neighbouring Westfield . It serves 1 @,@ 000 full @-@ time students and 5 @,@ 000 part @-@ time students . The College has steadily expanded since it opened in the 1940s to serve the Somerset coalfields . As a Community College , it has expanded its range of vocational programmes , and has become an established part of the community . The college works with local employers to provide training programmes that meet the needs of both employers and employees . This ranges from short skills workshops , through to <unk> , BTEC , Higher National Diplomas and apprenticeships .

 = California 's 12th congressional district election , 1946 = 
 An election for a seat in the United States House of Representatives took place in California 's 12th congressional district on November 5 , 1946 , the date set by law for the elections for the 80th United States Congress . In the 12th district election , the candidates were five @-@ term incumbent Democrat Jerry Voorhis , Republican challenger Richard Nixon , and former congressman and Prohibition Party candidate John Hoeppel . Nixon was elected with 56 % of the vote , starting him on the road that would , almost a quarter century later , lead to the presidency . 
 First elected to Congress in 1936 , Voorhis had defeated lackluster Republican opposition four times in the then @-@ rural Los Angeles County district to win re @-@ election . For the 1946 election , Republicans sought a candidate who could unite the party and run a strong race against Voorhis in the Republican @-@ leaning district . After failing to secure the candidacy of General George Patton , in November 1945 they settled on Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon , who had lived in the district prior to his World War II service . 
 Nixon spent most of 1946 campaigning in the district , while Voorhis did not return from Washington D.C. until the end of August . Nixon 's campaign worked hard to generate publicity in the district , while Voorhis , dealing with congressional business in the capital , received little newspaper coverage . Voorhis received the most votes in the June primary elections , but his percentage of the vote decreased from his share in the 1944 primaries . At five debates held across the district in September and October , Nixon was able to paint the incumbent as ineffectual and to suggest that Voorhis was connected to communist @-@ linked organizations . Voorhis and his campaign were constantly on the defensive and were ineffective in rebutting Nixon 's contentions . The challenger defeated Voorhis in the November general election . 
 Various explanations have been put forward for Nixon 's victory , from national political trends to red @-@ baiting on the part of the challenger . Some historians contend that Nixon received large amounts of funding from wealthy backers determined to defeat Voorhis , while others dismiss such allegations . These matters remain subjects of historical debate .

 Since its creation following the 1930 census , the 12th district had been represented by Democrats . The 12th stretched from just south of Pasadena to the Orange and San Bernardino county lines , encompassing such small towns as Whittier , Pomona and Covina . The area has since been entirely absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis , but at the time it was principally agricultural . The freeway system had barely touched the 12th district ; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner . 
 In 1932 , John Hoeppel was elected to represent the 12th district . In 1936 , Hoeppel was vulnerable as he had been convicted for trying to sell a nomination to West Point . Voorhis defeated Hoeppel in the Democratic primary and easily won the general election . Voorhis , who gained a reputation as a respected and hard @-@ working representative , nicknamed " Kid Atlas " by the press for taking the weight of the world on his shoulders , was loyal to the New Deal . 
 The 12th district leaned Republican , the more so after 1941 when the Republican @-@ dominated California State Legislature attempted to gerrymander Congressman Voorhis out of office by removing strong Democratic precincts in East Los Angeles from the district during the decennial redistricting . The revamped 12th district had little industry and almost no union influence . Voorhis was left with such Republican strongholds as San Marino , where he did not campaign , concluding that he would receive the same number of votes whether he visited there or not . Despite the maneuvers of the Republicans in the legislature , Voorhis was re @-@ elected in 1942 , receiving 57 % of the vote , and won with a similar percentage two years later . Voorhis had not faced strong opposition prior to 1946 . In his initial election , Voorhis benefited from the Roosevelt landslide of 1936 . His 1938 opponent was so shy that Voorhis had to introduce him to the crowd at a joint appearance . In 1940 , he faced Captain Irwin <unk> , a little @-@ known commandant of a military school , and his 1942 opponent , radio preacher and former Prohibition Party gubernatorial candidate Robert P. Shuler , " embarrassed GOP regulars " . In 1944 , the 12th district Republicans were bitterly divided , and Voorhis easily triumphed . 
 = = = Republican search for a candidate = = = 
 As Voorhis served his fifth term in the House , Republicans searched for a candidate capable of defeating him . Local Republicans formed what became known as the " Committee of One Hundred " ( officially , the " Candidate and Fact @-@ Finding Committee " ) to select a candidate with broad support in advance of the June 1946 primary election . This move caused some editorial concern in the district : The Alhambra Tribune and News , fearing the choice of a candidate was being taken away from voters in favor of a small group , editorialized that the committee formation was " a step in the wrong direction " and an attempt to " shove Tammany Hall tactics down our throats " . 
 The Committee initially wooed State Commissioner of Education ( and former Whittier College president ) Walter Dexter . Dexter was reluctant to give up his state post to run and sought a guarantee that he would receive another job if his candidacy failed . He continued to consider running for several months without reaching a decision , frustrating local Republicans . As Dexter <unk> , Republicans tried to get General George Patton to run , though they were not certain if the general was a Republican . However , a day after the Los Angeles Times speculated on the run , Patton announced from Germany his intent to " keep completely out of politics " . The Committee also contacted Stanley Barnes , a rising young Republican attorney and former football star at the University of California , Berkeley . Barnes declined to be considered , skeptical of the chances of defeating Voorhis . 
 With little progress made on securing a high @-@ profile candidate , Committee working groups held interviews . Of the eight men who applied , the most prominent was former congressman John Hoeppel , who promised to keep " the Jews and the niggers " out of the district . On October 6 , 1945 , the Monrovia News Post reported that while Dexter seemed the likely candidate , " of course anything can happen in politics and generally does " . The News Post stated that other names discussed by the Committee included " Lt. [ sic ] Richard Nixon , <unk> , of Whittier . " Congressman Voorhis wrote his father and political adviser , Charles Voorhis , on October 15 , " I understand the General has decided not to run in the 12th district . Dr. Dexter would , in my opinion , be hard to beat . But at least it would be a clean , decent campaign , and I 'm not so sure I wouldn 't prefer that even if I lost . " Herman Perry , Whittier Bank of America branch manager and Nixon family friend , wrote to Nixon , who was then a lieutenant commander in the Navy , telling him he should apply for the Committee 's endorsement . Nixon replied enthusiastically . When Dexter finally turned the Committee down , he recommended Nixon , his onetime student . Dexter died only days later of a heart attack , and Patton died in an auto accident before the 1946 campaign began . 
 At the time , Nixon was stationed in Baltimore , Maryland , using his legal training to deal with military contract terminations . On November 1 , 1945 , he flew to California to meet influential Republicans and give a speech at a Committee meeting . The meeting was advertised throughout the district and was open to any potential candidate . However , the advertisements for the meeting noted that Nixon would be flying in to speak . A number of potential rivals also showed up at the meeting on November 2 , 1945 , including a local judge and assemblyman . Nixon , who spoke last , was " electrifying " , according to one Committee member . When the Committee met to vote on November 28 , Nixon received over two @-@ thirds of the vote , which was then made unanimous . Committee chairman Roy Day immediately notified the victor of the Committee 's endorsement . 
 Nixon was already arranging to research Voorhis 's record and to meet with Republican leaders in Washington , including House Minority Leader ( and future Speaker ) Joseph W. Martin , Jr . The newly minted candidate wrote to Day regarding Voorhis , " His ' conservative ' reputation must be blasted . But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive , progressive group of speeches which tell what we want to do , not what the Democrats have failed to do ... I 'm really hopped up over this deal , and I believe we can win . " However , " wheelhorse " Republicans deemed Nixon 's campaign hopeless . Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent . Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon , but hoped that his son would retain a large part of the Quaker vote . The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again , writing , " It is just another campaign that we have to go through ... In any event , we have nothing to worry about now . "

 Nixon was discharged from the Navy at the start of 1946 . Within days , he and his wife Pat Nixon , the latter almost eight months pregnant , returned to Whittier . They initially moved in with the candidate 's parents , Frank and Hannah . Nixon returned to his old law firm , but spent most of his time campaigning . Roy Day , chairman of the now @-@ dissolved Committee , appointed himself as Nixon 's campaign manager . This self @-@ appointment dismayed the candidate somewhat , and Nixon unsuccessfully sought to replace Day . 
 Voorhis had been in Washington since August 1945 , attending to congressional business . He did not return to the district until August 1946 , well after the June primary . By his own account , he was busy dealing with : 
 [ The a ] <unk> of the Social Security Act , the Case Labor bill , the British loan , terminal leave pay for soldiers , and several appropriation bills [ and ] the most important problem our country had ever faced in all its history — the problem of what to do about atomic energy . I felt sure that the people of the district would rather have me stay on the job than come home to campaign . 
 Beginning in February , the Republican hopeful began a heavy speaking schedule , addressing civic groups across the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) district . Nixon 's efforts to get publicity were aided by the birth of his daughter Tricia in late February . The new father was extensively interviewed and photographed with his infant daughter . Congressman Voorhis 's office sent the Nixons a government pamphlet entitled Infant Care , of which representatives received 150 per month to distribute to their constituents . When Richard Nixon sent his rival a note of thanks in early April , the congressman responded with a letter proposing that the two debate once Congress adjourned in August . 
 In mid @-@ March , Nixon was approached by former congressman Hoeppel , who hated Voorhis . Hoeppel offered to enter the Democratic primary in exchange for a payment of several hundred dollars plus the promise of a civil service job once the Republican was elected . After consulting with his aides , Nixon turned him down . Subsequently , Hoeppel filed as a Prohibition Party candidate . Voorhis was privy to these events through an informant close to the former representative , and was convinced that Roy Day had arranged to pay Hoeppel 's filing fee . The congressman feared that Hoeppel would serve as a stalking horse for Nixon , sparing the Republican from any " mudslinging " . Voorhis responded to Hoeppel 's filing with a letter to his campaign manager , Baldwin Park realtor Jack Long , stating that " it would be worthwhile for us to try our level best to beat him in the Prohibition primary by a write @-@ in campaign " . 
 On March 18 , two days before the filing deadline , Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic primaries under California 's cross @-@ filing system . Voorhis also filed in the two major party primaries . Under cross @-@ filing , if the same candidate won both major party endorsements , he would be effectively elected , with only minor party candidates to stand against him . Day advanced the $ 200 ( the current equivalent of $ 2 @,@ 230 ) for Nixon 's filing fees , later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed . 
 By late March , Nixon 's stock speeches to civic groups were becoming worn . Day hired political consultant Murray Chotiner for $ 580 for the primary campaign , and the consultant warned that unless new life came into the campaign , it was in serious danger . In the following years , Chotiner was to become Nixon 's campaign manager , adviser , and friend in an association that lasted until Chotiner 's death a few months before President Nixon 's 1974 resignation . 
 Chotiner arranged for stories in local papers alleging that Voorhis had been endorsed by " the PAC " , hoping that voters would take that to mean the Congress of Industrial Organizations 's Political Action Committee ( CIO @-@ PAC ) . The CIO was a labor federation which later merged with the American Federation of Labor to form the AFL @-@ CIO . It had been organized in 1943 and took left @-@ wing stands ; its PAC was seen as a communist front organization by some . A second PAC , the National Citizen 's Political Action Committee ( NCPAC ) was also affiliated with the CIO , but was open to those outside the labor movement . Among the 1946 members of the NCPAC were actors Melvyn Douglas and Ronald Reagan . Both PACs had been headed by the late labor leader , Sidney Hillman , and the two organizations shared office space in New York City . While the CIO 's national leadership decried communism ; some of the local CIO @-@ PAC branches were dominated by Communist Party members . The CIO @-@ PAC , which had endorsed Voorhis in 1944 , refused to back him again . The Southern California chapter of the NCPAC endorsed Voorhis on April 1 , 1946 . Chotiner 's strategy was to conflate the two PACs in the public eye . 
 <unk> by the PAC controversy , the Republican campaign gained new life as Nixon returned to the lecture circuit . After Nixon spoke to a Lions Club meeting on May 1 , a worried Voorhis supporter wrote to the congressman , " He carried the group by storm . He is dangerous . You will have the fight of your life to beat him . " 
 The primary was held on June 4 , 1946 . Both Voorhis and Nixon won his own party 's primary , with Voorhis garnering a considerable number of votes in the Republican poll . When all the votes from all primaries were added together , Voorhis outpolled Nixon by 7 @,@ 000 votes . Voorhis 's total percentage of the vote decreased from 60 % in the 1944 primaries to 53 @.@ 5 % in 1946 . Hoeppel survived the write @-@ in campaign to advance to the general election . 
 = = General election = = 
 Following a two @-@ week vacation in British Columbia after the primary , Nixon returned to the 12th district . The Republican began the general election campaign by replacing Roy Day with South Pasadena engineer Harrison McCall as campaign manager . As Chotiner was increasingly distracted by his position as Southern California campaign manager for the ( successful ) reelection bid of Republican Senator William Knowland , the Nixon campaign added publicist William Arnold . Voorhis , on the other hand , remained in Washington , dealing with Congressional business and generating little publicity . He corresponded with his father and with his campaign manager , Jack Long , by letter . Voorhis hoped to return to California in mid @-@ August but while returning from Washington in August , he was forced to have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden , Utah . Voorhis spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation and did not return to the district until the end of August . Voorhis wrote later , " I can 't say I was exactly ' ready for the fray ' . But the ' fray ' was certainly ready for me . " 
 = = = South Pasadena debate = = = 
 Nixon did not reply to Voorhis 's April debate proposal . In May , the congressman wrote to Long as Nixon 's campaign initially made the alleged PAC endorsement an issue . Voorhis suggested that Nixon be challenged to debates as a matter of urgency . Long responded in June , saying that though Nixon was known as a champion debater during his Whittier College days , " with your age and experience the general public might not take kindly to your challenging a boy like Nixon " . Long advised awaiting a challenge from Nixon . By August , the two campaigns had settled on a debate to be held before a veteran 's group in Whittier on September 20 . However , the " Independent Voters of South Pasadena " ( <unk> ) , headed by future Voorhis biographer Paul Bullock , announced a September 13 town meeting on campaign issues at South Pasadena Junior High School . The <unk> 's actual purpose in having the meeting was to get a vulnerable Republican assemblyman ( who declined his invitation ) to debate his Democratic rival , but Senate and 12th district Republican and Democratic candidates were invited . Given that the debate sponsors were liberals , some of Nixon 's aides advised him to refuse , but he overrode them . Voorhis also accepted ; when it was suggested to him later he should have sent a spokesman , he responded , " I suppose so , but I just couldn 't bring myself to refuse . " Both Senate candidates declined their invitations , with Senator Knowland sending Chotiner in his place , while Democratic candidate Will Rogers , Jr. sent Representative Chester E. Holifield of the neighboring 19th district . 
 The town meeting attracted a packed crowd of over a thousand , with Nixon supporters distributing anti @-@ Voorhis literature at the door . The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates , followed by Voorhis . Nixon , who had notified organizers that he would be late due to another commitment , arrived during Voorhis 's speech , and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk . He then came onstage , shook hands with Voorhis , and delivered a fifteen @-@ minute address . A question @-@ and @-@ answer period then followed , with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration , and about his views on monetary policy . After the representative responded , a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making " false charges " about the supposed Voorhis CIO @-@ PAC endorsement . In response , Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group 's endorsement of Voorhis . The congressman was unaware of the endorsement ; those of his aides in the know had " completely forgotten " to tell him . Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis , asking him to read it for himself . Voorhis came from his seat and took it , and ( according to Bullock , who served as timekeeper at the debate ) " mumbled " that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO @-@ PAC . Nixon reclaimed the document , and began to read out names of the members of the boards of directors of the two groups , " It 's the same thing , virtually , when they have the same directors . " The crowd began to cheer Nixon , who later wrote , " I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point " , and to jeer Voorhis , who wrote , " They 'd boo and laugh at my remarks , and this disturbed me . " 
 In the midst of the turmoil , Prohibition Party candidate Hoeppel came down the aisle ( according to Bullock , possibly drunk ) and demanded to know why he had been excluded from the debate . He was permitted to ask one question , of Voorhis , and the evening ended . According to Bullock , " the magnitude of Nixon 's triumph did not immediately dawn on us . " Congressman Holifield had grasped it , and when Voorhis asked him , " How did it go ? " he responded , " Jerry , he cut you to pieces . " 
 = = = Additional debates = = = 
 On September 19 , Voorhis wired the NCPAC 's Los Angeles and New York offices , requesting that " whatever qualified endorsement the Citizens PAC may have given me be withdrawn " . By this time , newspapers across the district had printed Nixon 's charges , along with a Nixon advertisement castigating Voorhis for allegedly accusing Nixon of lying about the PAC endorsement . According to Nixon biographer Roger Morris , the repudiation of NCPAC endorsements did not help Voorhis , as his actions " would seem to many a half @-@ guilty shedding of sinister backing he never had . To the end , as Chotiner had calculated , the PACs were hopelessly entangled . " The Nixon campaign distributed 25 @,@ 000 thimbles labeled " Nixon for Congress / Put the needle in the P.A.C. " 
 The second debate was held at Patriotic Hall in Whittier on September 20 . As the debate was sponsored by the Whittier Ex @-@ Servicemen 's Association , attendance was limited to veterans . The candidates debated the best way of dealing with the postwar housing shortage . Voorhis favored restricting building of commercial structures to free up materials for housing , while Nixon urged the removal of all building restrictions . When Nixon repeated his PAC allegations , Voorhis noted his request to the NCPAC , stating that he could not be held responsible for its actions . According to Morris , the debate ended as a draw , or perhaps even a Voorhis victory . Chotiner convinced Nixon that he needed to run an aggressive campaign to the end , and McCall challenged the Voorhis campaign to as many as eight additional debates , of which three were actually held . 
 The debates captured the interest of the public in the district and attracted large crowds . The candidates were compared to Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas , who had famously debated in their 1858 senatorial campaign , and bands played marches as each candidate entered the venue . The two candidates ' third meeting was held at Bridges Auditorium in Claremont on October 11 . Voorhis was , by his own admission , " awfully tired " . The candidates discussed labor policy , and Nixon " scored " by detailing a policy for dealing with public strikes that Voorhis too late realized was taken from a bill he had drafted . Nixon took Voorhis aside after the debate and lambasted him for addressing him as " Lieutenant Commander Nixon " , accusing him of pandering to former enlisted men 's dislike of officers . 
 In the fourth debate , on October 23 at Monrovia High School , Nixon attacked Voorhis ' congressional record . The challenger alleged that in the previous four years , Voorhis only had been able to pass a single bill through Congress and into law . The bill in question transferred jurisdiction over rabbit farming from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture . Nixon chided , " One has to be a rabbit to get effective representation in this congressional district . " Voorhis responded that he had sponsored an act to employ the physically handicapped , but Nixon stated that it was not a law , but a joint resolution . Nixon restated his allegation regarding Voorhis and the PAC ; Voorhis retorted that he had repudiated the NCPAC endorsement . Nixon parried with a comment that Voorhis 's voting record " earned him the endorsement , whether he wanted it or not " . Nixon also contended that in 46 votes , Voorhis had almost entirely followed the CIO @-@ PAC agenda . Distraught , Voorhis stayed up until 4 am studying the votes Nixon had taxed him with . He concluded that due to duplications , there were actually only 27 roll calls in question , on many of which he had opposed the CIO @-@ PAC position . The congressman also found that the votes " friendly " to the CIO @-@ PAC included one authorizing a school lunch program . 
 The final debate took place October 28 at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium , to an overflow crowd in excess of a thousand . Voorhis went on the attack , charging Nixon with misrepresenting the " 46 votes " to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues . The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for " the person on a pension trying to keep up with the rising cost of living ... the white @-@ collar worker who has not had a raise ... Americans have had enough , and they have come to the conclusion that they are going to do something . " Nixon sat down to thunderous applause , and the San Gabriel Sun described Voorhis : " He pauses , breathes heavily , scans the audience with tired eyes , adjusts his glasses nervously with both hands , and then strikes the podium with an open hand . "

 In mid October , the Nixon campaign unveiled an advertisement which foreshadowed his run for Senate four years later . After stating that Nixon , at the South Pasadena debate , confronted the congressman with " a <unk> copy of his endorsement by the communist @-@ dominated PAC " , the ad stated , " Among the extreme left @-@ wingers with whom Voorhis kept company in voting the PAC line are Helen Gahagan Douglas , Vito Marcantonio ... " On October 29 , the Alhambra Post @-@ Advocate and Monrovia News @-@ Post printed identical pieces entitled " How Jerry and Vito voted " , comparing the California congressman 's voting record with that of Marcantonio , a leftist New York congressman . In 1950 , a similar comparison between the voting record of Marcantonio and Democratic Senate nominee Douglas , printed on pink paper , came to be known as the " Pink Sheet " . 
 The Nixon campaign continued to run newspaper ads touching on the PAC issue . One ad suggested Radio Moscow had urged the election of the CIO slate . Others touched on Voorhis 's past registration as a Socialist , and stated that his congressional record " is more <unk> and Communistic than Democratic " . The Democrats brought James Roosevelt and other prominent Democrats into the district to campaign for Voorhis . Nixon proposed that his wartime acquaintance , former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen campaign for him . However , the candidate could not get permission from the California Republican committee for Stassen to visit . Voorhis publicized a letter he had received from the Republican governor , Earl Warren , praising him for a disability insurance proposal he had made . Nixon supporters asked Warren for a letter praising Nixon , or at least a retraction of the Voorhis letter . Warren refused , saying that Voorhis deserved the compliment , and Nixon would not receive an endorsement . This conflict began a contentious relationship between Nixon and Warren which lasted until Warren 's death shortly before Nixon 's resignation as president . 
 No polls had been taken during the campaign . On election night , Voorhis took an early lead in the vote count , but was soon overtaken by his challenger , whose margin increased as the night went on . Nixon defeated Voorhis by over 15 @,@ 000 votes . The Republican won 19 of the 22 municipalities in the district , including Voorhis 's home town of San Dimas . Voorhis won the Democratic strongholds of El Monte and Monterey Park , as well as rural Baldwin Park . Time magazine 's post @-@ election issue came out in mid @-@ November , and it praised the future president for " politely avoid [ ing ] personal attacks on his opponent " .

 The day after the election , Voorhis issued a concession statement , wishing Nixon well in his new position , and stating : 
 I have given the best years of my life to serving this district in Congress . By the will of the people that work is ended . I have no regrets about the record I have written . I know the principles I have stood for and the measures I have fought for are right . I know , too , that , in broad outline at least , they are vital to the future safety and welfare of our country . I know the day will come when a lot more people will recognize this than was the case on November fifth . 
 Former congressman Hoeppel , who gathered just over one percent of the vote , wrote Nixon after the election , stating that he had never expected to win , and that his purpose had been " to expose what I considered to be the alien @-@ minded , un @-@ American , PAC , Red , congressional record of the Democratic incumbent " . Despite any hard feelings , Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946 . Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis 's office , and parted , according to Voorhis , as friends . In 1971 , Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again . Voorhis 's final letter as a congressman , written on December 31 , was to his father , who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career . Representative Voorhis wrote , " It has been primarily due to your help , your confidence , your advice ... above all to a feeling I have always had that your hand was on my shoulder . Thanks ... God bless you . " 
 Voorhis never ran again for political office , working as an executive in the cooperative movement for twenty years after his defeat . Hoeppel continued as publisher and editor of National Defense magazine , a publication for veterans , until his 1960 retirement , and died in Arcadia in 1976 at age 95 . Nixon served two terms in the House , and in 1950 was elected to the United States Senate , continuing his political rise , which would lead him to the White House in 1969 .

 The 12th district race of 1946 was little noticed at the time . As Nixon became prominent , the 1946 race was scrutinized more closely . Nixon biographer Herbert Parmet noted , " Except for Nixon 's subsequent reputation , what happened in California 's Twelfth would have been indistinguishable from campaigns across the country to elect the Eightieth Congress . " Jonathan Aitken , also a biographer of Nixon , attributes the later scrutiny to " the unexpected toppling of a liberal icon and [ the Democratic Party 's ] regret over the meteoric rise of the new Republican hero who won the seat " . 
 Nixon 's defeat of Voorhis has been cited as the first of a number of red @-@ baiting campaigns by the future president which elevated him to the House , the Senate , the Vice Presidency , and eventually put him in position to run for president . Nixon , in his 1978 memoir , stated that the central issue in the 1946 campaign was " the quality of life in postwar America " , and he won because voters " had ' had enough , ' and they decided to do something about it " . Voorhis , in his 1947 memoir , indicated that the " most important single factor in the campaign of 1946 was the difference in general attitude between the ' outs ' and the ' ins ' . Anyone seeking to unseat an incumbent needed only to point out all the things that had gone wrong and all the trouble of the war period and its aftermath . " 
 In later years , Voorhis had more to say about the reasons for his defeat . In 1958 , he alleged that voters had received anonymous phone calls saying that he was a communist , that newspapers had stated that he was a fellow traveler , and that when Nixon got angry , he would " do anything " . In November 1962 , after Nixon 's defeat in the California gubernatorial race , Voorhis appeared on Howard K. Smith 's News and Comment program on ABC in the episode entitled " The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon " and complained about the way Nixon had conducted himself in the 1946 race . Voorhis 's appearance was overshadowed by the controversial participation of Nixon adversary Alger Hiss . In 1972 , Voorhis authored a book , The Strange Case of Richard Milhous Nixon , in which he stated that Nixon was " quite a ruthless opponent " whose " one cardinal and unbreakable rule of conduct " was " to win , whatever it takes to do it " . In 1981 , three years before his death , Voorhis denied in an interview that he had been endorsed by the NCPAC . 
 In his memoirs , Voorhis alleged that in October 1945 , " a representative of a large New York financial house " journeyed to California to meet with a number of influential Californians and " bawl them out " for allowing Voorhis , whom the New Yorker supposedly described as " one of the most dangerous men in Washington " , to remain in Congress . In an early draft of his memoir , Voorhis wrote that he had documentation showing that " the Nixon campaign was a creature of big eastern financial interests " . Nixon biographer Roger Morris suggested that the amount the Nixon campaign reported " was only a small fraction of what actually went into the campaign . " According to Morris , the Committee of One Hundred represented wealthy interests , and Nixon benefited from " the University Club ... the corporate levies , the vastly larger forces arrayed against Voorhis " . Nixon himself addressed this point in his memoir : 
 As I moved up the political ladder , my adversaries tried to picture me as the hand @-@ picked stooge of oil magnates , rich bankers , real estate tycoons and conservative millionaires . But a look at the list of my early supporters shows that they were typical representatives of the Southern California middle class : an auto dealer , a bank manager , a printing salesman , and a furniture dealer . 
 Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman , writing in 1999 , nine years after Morris , disagreed with the latter 's conclusions . Gellman argued that the Committee was a " grassroots " group which was " far from sophisticated " in its efforts to find a candidate . Parmet wrote that the campaign was not well financed , " Nixon had to learn that money would be scarce until he became a winner ... The Nixon campaign of 1946 did look like a shoestring affair . " Aitken points out that Nixon spent no money on radio advertising during the campaign . 
 Other allegations center on Murray Chotiner , painting him as the evil genius of the campaign . Voorhis , for example , in his 1972 book , deemed himself " the first victim of the Nixon @-@ Chotiner formula for political success . " Several writers , including Kenneth Kurz in his book , Nixon 's Enemies , and Ingrid Scobie in her biography of Helen Douglas , Center Stage , describe Chotiner incorrectly as Nixon 's 1946 campaign manager . Part of this inflation is due to Chotiner himself , who , in later years , lost no opportunity to exaggerate his role in the 1946 race , to the annoyance of Day and McCall . According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose , " Nevertheless , the legend grew . In the eyes of Nixon 's critics , as a candidate he was merely a front man for Chotiner 's evil manipulations . But it simply was not so . " 
 A number of biographies on Nixon or Voorhis , or which otherwise touch on the 1946 campaign , state with varying degrees of certainty that during the final weekend of the campaign , anonymous calls were made to district households . The caller would ask " Did you know Jerry Voorhis is a communist ? " and then hang up . According to Bullock , there was a phone bank staffed by workers who had responded to a newspaper ad , run by the Nixon organization in Alhambra . Bullock cites as his source for this Zita Remley , a " Voorhis admirer " , who stated that her niece had worked there . Though the niece died before Bullock 's book was written , according to Bullock , Remley 's " reputation for veracity is unchallengeable " .

 Nixon spent most of 1946 campaigning in the district , and worked hard to extend his name recognition beyond his hometown of Whittier . In 1952 , as Nixon ran for vice president , the Madera News @-@ Tribune set forth its view of why Nixon beat Voorhis , " He rang doorbells , he talked on street corners and in auditoriums , he kissed babies , patted old ladies on the cheek , and otherwise made himself known wherever and whenever two people would stop and listen to him . He made friends with the press and radio , he went out of his way to be congenial and likable . " Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used , Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1931 . 
 Starting in the primary , the Nixon campaign made determined efforts to woo the district 's newspapers . The campaign targeted smaller papers , especially the small weekly newspapers that were distributed for free ; Republican surveys found that these were widely read and trusted . Nixon supporter and Republican National Committeeman from California McIntyre <unk> arranged to buy ads on behalf of the Nixon campaign on condition that the newspaper run an editorial at its direction ( most of the papers were , in any event , Republican in their outlook ) . These efforts paid off ; 26 of the 30 newspapers serving the district endorsed Nixon . According to Nixon biographer Morris , Voorhis was given no coverage in newspapers , or limited to small paid advertisements . The paper owners told the Voorhis campaign that , with the postwar paper shortage , space had to be saved for regular customers . 
 Voorhis 's campaign , described by Bullock as " traditionally amateurish and poorly put together " , was slow to perceive the threat presented by Nixon and remained continually on the defensive . In 1971 , in an article marking the 25th anniversary of the campaign , Voorhis acknowledged that " I never had much of an organization ; frankly , there was no form to it . And we needed it badly in 1946 . " In the same article , the Los Angeles Times described Voorhis 's campaign as " undermanned , underfinanced , outgunned , outmaneuvered and he apparently was on the wrong side of most of the issues of the day " . His one avenue of outreach in the press was his newspaper column , People 's Business , which ran in most local newspapers . In July 1946 , Voorhis chose to suspend this column lest it be thought that he was using it as a means of campaigning . According to Gellman , this weakened Voorhis 's political outreach . 
 One blunder identified by Gellman was Voorhis 's decision to debate Nixon , as it raised the challenger 's profile to the same level as the incumbent 's . This decision was described by Morris as " quiet hubris " . Nixon later stated , " In 1946 , a damn fool incumbent named Jerry Voorhis debated a young unknown lawyer , and it cost him the election . " Gellman itemized Voorhis 's other errors : " He never established a viable Democratic organization ; instead he relied on his father and friends to evaluate voters ' likely habits . Rather than return to campaign in the primary when he recognized Nixon 's attractiveness , he remained in the capital , allowing Nixon to court newspaper publishers and reporters as well as constituents who wanted to have firsthand contact with their congressional representative . Even when Voorhis returned to the district , he made one blunder after another . " 
 Ambrose summed up his chapter on the 1946 campaign : 
 For Whittier and the 12th district , Nixon 's first campaign produced the first Nixon haters and the first group of Nixon supporters . This was a consequence of his campaigning style and his penchant for polarizing his constituents over basic issues . The numbers of both groups would grow in the years ahead , until virtually everyone in the nation belonged to either one or the other .

 = 1892 – 93 Small Heath F.C. season = 
 The 1892 – 93 season was the twelfth season of competitive association football played by Small Heath F.C. , an English football club based in Birmingham . After finishing in third position in the Football Alliance in 1891 – 92 , Small Heath was one of 12 clubs elected to the newly formed Second Division for the 1892 – 93 Football League season . 
 During the season , the team scored 90 goals at an average of four goals per game , beat Walsall Town Swifts 12 – 0 to set a club record League victory which , as of 2012 , still stands , remained undefeated on their own ground throughout the season , and won the last nine matches of the League season to take the Second Division title at their first attempt . Promotion to the First Division was not automatic , even for the champions , but depended on the results of test matches between the top three Second Division and bottom three First Division teams . Small Heath lost to Newton Heath , the 16th @-@ placed First Division team , after a replay , so were not promoted , although the teams placed second and third were . 
 Small Heath entered the 1892 – 93 FA Cup at the first round proper , and lost in that round to First Division club Burnley . In local competitions , they were eliminated by Aston Villa in the semi @-@ final of the Birmingham Senior Cup and the final of the Mayor of Birmingham 's Charity Cup . Small Heath also played several friendly matches during the season , including benefit matches for players Harry Morris , Caesar Jenkyns and Fred Speller . 
 Small Heath used 19 different players in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and had ten different goalscorers . Three players , Fred Wheldon , Tommy Hands and Billy Ollis , appeared in every League match . The top scorer was inside @-@ forward Wheldon with 25 League goals , a total which made him the Second Division 's leading scorer , and the other four first @-@ choice forwards all reached double figures . Chris Charsley became the first Small Heath player to represent the England national football team , and Fred Jones was capped for Wales . 
 = = Background = = 
 Small Heath Football Club 's 1891 – 92 season had been relatively successful after several years of declining interest . On the field , they finished third in the Football Alliance . Off it , the Annual General Meeting of the club , held at Jenkins Street Board School in July 1892 , heard that " skilful management , good matches , and capital ' gates ' " had combined to produce a statement of financial affairs " distinctly creditable to managers and players " , and the directors were to be congratulated . The club 's application for election to the Football League First Division when it was expanded to 16 clubs was unsuccessful , but it was one of 12 clubs , mostly from the previous season 's Football Alliance , elected to compete in the inaugural season of that league 's Second Division . Alfred Jones had been acting as club secretary on a voluntary basis since 1885 , when payment of players was first permitted . Prior to entering the Football League , the board of directors appointed him as the club 's first paid official , as secretary @-@ manager . Caesar Jenkyns captained the team . 
 All the regular first @-@ team members during the previous season – goalkeepers Chris Charsley and George Hollis , backs Tom Bayley and Fred Speller , half @-@ backs Ted Devey , Caesar Jenkyns and Billy Ollis , and forwards Jack Hallam , Tommy Hands , Harry Morris , Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon – remained with the club . Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short , and the long @-@ serving Charlie Simms , who was by 1892 employed as the first @-@ team trainer , but retained his playing registration for emergencies . Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath , forward Harry Edwards , signed from Singer 's of Coventry , and centre @-@ forward Frank Mobley , who joined soon after the start of the season , also from Singer 's . They played in the same kit as in the previous season : royal blue shirts and stockings with white knickerbockers .

 Small Heath opened their first season in the Football League at home to Burslem Port Vale . The match was due to kick off at 3 : 30 pm , but the visitors arrived half an hour late . Small Heath won the toss and , with the dual benefit of a strong wind behind them and their opponents having only ten men because their centre @-@ forward Billy Beats had missed his train , had most of the play in the first half . After a near @-@ miss by Tommy Hands , their first goal came as " the right wing took the ball in front of goal , and after a little <unk> it was sent between the posts " ; the goal was credited to Fred Wheldon . Port Vale rallied , and the game , " more vigorous than scientific " , was even until Small Heath scored twice just before half @-@ time . In the second half , with the advantage of the wind , Port Vale pulled a goal back , but the final score was 5 – 1 . 
 Small Heath made the short trip to Walsall Town Swifts for their first away match of the season . In a " hard @-@ fought " game , Wheldon opened the scoring after 25 minutes with a " swift oblique shot " after all five forwards broke in a line . Walsall equalised with a scrappy goal from a corner , and attempted to impose themselves on the game , but the visitors ' combination play held them at bay . Small Heath regained the lead when Walsall defender Alf Pinches headed into his own goal under pressure in a crowded goalmouth . In the second half , team captain Caesar Jenkyns increased the visitors ' lead following a corner , and as the players of both sides tired , the play became disjointed , both goalkeepers had several saves to make , and a Walsall goal was disallowed for offside . 
 A benefit match for Harry Morris , who had been a regular first @-@ team player since 1885 and captained the club in the 1891 – 92 season , produced an " exciting contest " against a Birmingham and District eleven which Small Heath won 4 – 3 . The visit to Sheffield United proved less productive . The home side opened the scoring early on , and " only good half @-@ back and back play by the visitors prevented the United greatly increasing the lead " . In the second half , with " a brilliant sun shining in the faces of their opponents " , the play was more even , and Jack Hallam came close to equalising , but Sheffield United made the score 2 – 0 three minutes from time , when Harry Hammond ran through the Small Heath defence and scored with a " magnificent shot " . 
 A comfortable victory against Lincoln City , with two goals from Wheldon and one each from Jenkyns and debutant Frank Mobley , all scored before half @-@ time , left Small Heath in fourth place in the division with three wins from their September programme . According to the Birmingham Daily Gazette , Mobley , " a determined player , though on the small side , [ who ] passes well to his wings " , made a " very favourable impression for a first appearance " . 
 = = = October = = = 
 October began with a 3 – 2 defeat at Grimsby Town . The home side , who " showed a clear superiority " in the first half , led 3 – 1 at half @-@ time , and though Wheldon pulled one back from a free kick against the run of play , Small Heath did well to prevent Grimsby adding to their lead . Two days later they played a close game away to Burton Swifts in " dismal " weather ; Small Heath led at half @-@ time , Burton equalised 20 minutes into the second half , but Small Heath regained the lead and held on for a 3 – 2 win . 
 Their next game was an open affair at home to Crewe Alexandra , in which the accuracy of Crewe 's shooting let them down . Despite playing against the wind , Small Heath led 2 – 0 by half @-@ time , a lead extended to 6 – 0 by the close in a one @-@ sided second half . Each goal was scored by a different player : Billy Walton , Hallam , Ted Devey , Wheldon , Hands and Mobley , of whom the Birmingham Daily Post suggested he had " the making of an excellent centre forward " . Against division leaders Ardwick at Manchester , the home club took a two @-@ goal lead by the interval , aided by some poor shooting by the visitors . Wheldon scored in the second half , and then a heavy rain- and hailstorm began , blowing into the faces of the Ardwick players . Wheldon scored again and Small Heath pressed hard , but their shooting failed to improve , and they were fortunate not to lose the game when a shot from William Lambie hit the crossbar . 
 Charsley put up a good performance playing on the winning side for the Midlands against a Lancashire and the North XI in a trial match for the Football League representative team . Although getting a hand to the first shot on target , from Sunderland 's Jimmy Hannah , he could only turn it onto the underside of the bar and into the net . Early in the second half , he made a smart double save to thwart the same club 's John Campbell , first from a " fast shot low down " and then from the rebound . Later on , Charsley held on to the ball in a scrimmage and needed the assistance of Sheffield Wednesday full @-@ back Tom Brandon to keep from carrying the ball over the line . 
 In Small Heath 's last game in October , at home to Darwen , a 3 – 2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full @-@ back Fred Speller . Soon after kickoff . Speller was in the act of kicking the ball when the onrushing William Campbell collided with him , knocking him to the ground . A police constable administered first aid before the player , whose leg was broken , was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital . On a heavy pitch in poor condition , it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball , and Small Heath 's decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen 's attackers were frequently caught offside . In the second half , Small Heath 's forwards took control , and repeated attacks resulted in goals from Hallam and from Hands after Hallam had struck the bar . Darwen 's committee decided not to proceed with a protest lodged " on account of the bankings at the corners of the field " , despite " the Small Heath ground hardly reflect [ ing ] credit on a club which holds such an important position in the football world " . The win meant Small Heath overtook Darwen to reach second place in the division . 
 = = = November = = = 
 Because of other teams ' FA Cup engagements , Small Heath played only twice in the League during November . A comfortable victory by four goals to one at Bootle on 5 November took them to the top of the table , one point clear of Ardwick who lost at Grimsby . Their next game was less straightforward . At home to Burton Swifts , the visitors ' superior finishing gave them a 2 – 0 lead at half @-@ time ; the second half was quite the opposite . Mobley scored from a Hallam cross after ten minutes , " shot after shot was sent in to the Burton goal " , and eventually , with ten minutes left , Walton headed home the equaliser . The crowd 's vocal support and the home side 's " desperate efforts to win " were rewarded by Caesar Jenkyns with a late header . 
 Billy Walton scored the only goal of a friendly match against First Division team Derby County , in which Small Heath gave a first opportunity to brothers Arnold and Fred Jones . In the first half , Derby 's attacks were foiled by the defensive tactics of the Small Heath half @-@ backs , on fine form , and Wheldon twice hit the post . Derby , who had the better of the second half , appeared to score from a free kick , but the goal was disallowed because the ball had not been touched on its way to the net . That apart , Small Heath 's defence held out , and Hollis , in goal for the unavailable Charsley , " defended brilliantly " . The next weekend , they enjoyed a comfortable 4 – 1 win against Gainsborough Trinity . Despite playing only friendlies in the second half of the month , Small Heath retained their lead in the division , level on points with Darwen having played one game fewer . 
 = = = December = = = 
 In their first League match for three weeks , Small Heath played out a 1 – 1 draw with Sheffield United . Wheldon 's positional sense left him free to receive a pass from Mobley and score after only five minutes , and then the game went from end to end , both sides attacking but failing to score . Full @-@ back Fred Jones turned up late , but once he did take the field he was kept busy by the Sheffield forwards . The visitors had much the better of the second half ; " shot after shot rained upon the Small Heath goal , and it was only by swarming round Charsley that the Coventry road men kept the ball out . " With 11 minutes left , the ball was dribbled from the goal @-@ line into midfield , then passed from flank to flank before a cross from Drummond found Davies who scored the equalising goal . 
 A top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ table clash followed as Small Heath visited Darwen in what the Blackburn Standard described as " the most exciting game that has been played on the Darwen ground for years " . In icy conditions , Small Heath scored early , again just before the interval , and a combination of home goalkeeper Kenyon and defender Orr presented them with a third soon afterwards ; Darwen scored three times in the last 12 minutes to take the game 4 – 3 . The same newspaper suggested that were it not for the " grand player " Charsley 's " magnificent display , the Birmingham club would have met with a severe thrashing " . The win gave Darwen a three @-@ point lead in the table , having played one more game than Small Heath . 
 Small Heath returned to winning ways the following week at home to Walsall Town Swifts , producing what remains , as of 2012 , their record League victory : they won 12 – 0 . Six goals came in each half , three from Mobley , three by Walton , whose third was the culmination of a " brilliant run " , and two each from the other three forwards , Hallam , Wheldon and Hands . The goalscoring continued on Christmas Eve with a 6 – 0 victory at Northwich Victoria , and a 3 – 1 home win against Crewe Alexandra which meant Small Heath would begin the new year at the top of the table . On Boxing Day , they visited Aston Villa for a friendly attended by 7 @,@ 000 spectators . Without both Charsley and George Hollis , trainer Charlie Simms played in goal as Villa won 3 – 2 with the last kick of the game . 
 = = = January = = = 
 Simms made his Football League debut at Lincoln City in place of Caesar Jenkyns , who had missed his train . In bitterly cold weather , after snow had been cleared from the pitch , Lincoln took advantage of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill , and took a 2 – 1 lead . On change of ends , Small Heath came back into the game , and scored twice in the last quarter of an hour to take the game 4 – 3 . 
 On a hard and dangerous playing surface , Small Heath had much the better of the game against Northwich Victoria . The visitors scored first , which only served to settle the home side . The forwards dominated , the remainder of the first half being " practically a bombardment of the Northwich goal " . After Hallam used his pace to equalise , inside @-@ left Wheldon was actively involved in the rest of the goals . Hallam just failed to reach the rebound from Wheldon 's shot , and full @-@ back Billy Ollis headed home from a Wheldon cross . The same player 's shot across goal was tapped in by Walton , and a goal was awarded despite the Northwich goalkeeper 's claim that the ball had not crossed the line . Wheldon himself scored the fourth with a " brilliant shot " , then he and Hands ran the ball upfield before crossing for Hallam to score with a header . In the second half , Wheldon scored Small Heath 's sixth from 30 yards ( 27 m ) , before the pace of the game dropped and Northwich scored a consolation with a long @-@ range cross @-@ shot . 
 After the match , 150 guests attended a dinner at the Old Royal Hotel in central Birmingham " in order that the shareholders and friends of the Small Heath Club might meet the players and congratulate them of their achievements and wish them still further success " . Walter Hart , the club 's chairman , spoke of the good character of the players , most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football , suggesting that " a man who had nothing to do but loaf about from week 's end to week 's end was not ready for play , and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football " . He praised the players ' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them to the top of the division , and encouraged them to resist the temptation to sign for other clubs , insisting that " whatever money [ the club ] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and ... the club could do as well for its players , if they only clung together , as any club in the country " . In reply , captain Caesar Jenkyns agreed that the players ' efforts meant they " deserved all the praise that had been bestowed on them " , and promised they would do their utmost to beat First Division club Burnley the following week in the FA Cup . 
 Despite media predictions of an upset , their utmost proved insufficient , though in the Dart 's opinion , " Small Heath deserve [ d ] all praise for the splendid fight they made with the Burnley eleven , who are all great players on their own ground . " Playing downwind , Burnley scored after half an hour from a scrimmage under the crossbar , and doubled their lead on the stroke of half @-@ time . In the second half , " dangerous fouls " were given against both sides . Small Heath continued to play a neat passing game but were kept at bay by Burnley 's strong defence and the offside rule . 
 Small Heath 's final game of January was a 3 – 1 defeat of Burton Swifts in the Birmingham Cup . They went into February with a three @-@ point lead over Darwen , each club having only four League games left to play . Sheffield United , in third place , eight points behind with five games in hand , were the only other team with a chance of overtaking them for the divisional title . 
 = = = February = = = 
 With no competitive fixture for the first two weekends of the month , friendlies were arranged against First Division Bolton Wanderers , at home , and Royal Arsenal away . With Charsley , a serving police officer , unavailable , regular full @-@ back Fred Jones played in goal , giving an opportunity to triallist Arthur Littleford at right @-@ back , as Small Heath beat Bolton 4 – 3 , the visitors having a goal disallowed late on in the game . " In the presence of a large company " , Arsenal won 3 – 1 . 
 When Small Heath finally returned to League football , their forwards , " conspicuous for some really beautiful passing " on a soft and slippery playing surface , gave them a 6 – 2 victory over Bootle . The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent accepted that their local team was not going to win the title , for " Small Heath can scarcely be dislodged except by a very great reversal of form such as is not likely to come about " , though still expected Sheffield United to finish in the top three . 
 Chris Charsley became the first Small Heath player to play for England , and only the second , after Caesar Jenkyns for Wales , to represent his country at full international level , when he took the field against Ireland on 27 February at Aston Villa 's ground in Perry Barr , Birmingham . Although a strong team , it was composed solely of amateurs . Charsley had little to do , as England won the match 6 – 1 , but a series of four saves in quick succession " demonstrated his ability between the sticks to everyone 's satisfaction " . 
 Back in the League , Hollis took Charsley 's place in goal , as customary in the latter 's absence . The heavy ground did not suit the visitors , Grimsby Town , and the Small Heath forwards ' hard @-@ working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three . The following week , the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking <unk> @-@ workers . Around 1 @,@ 500 spectators watched a match between <unk> and <unk> @-@ workers ' elevens , followed by a second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter , whose poor health prevented him playing , and the recently retired Small Heath forward Eddy Stanley , who led his team to a 9 – 3 victory . Small Heath went into March with a four @-@ point lead over Darwen , each club having only two League games left to play , but the former 's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United , in third place , ten points behind with five games in hand , were the only team still able to overhaul them . 
 = = = March = = = 
 Small Heath fielded eight of their regular starting eleven in a friendly against First Division Nottingham Forest . A close and exciting game , which featured " both goal @-@ keepers displaying wonderful cleverness and resource " , was won by Forest with a late goal . In their first competitive fixture of the month , the quarter @-@ final of the Birmingham Cup , they beat Wednesbury Old Athletic , a team from the Birmingham & District League , by five goals to nil in a match " characterised by a good deal of rough play " . A " fairly strong " team suffered a rare home defeat in a friendly against Middlesbrough of the Northern League . Jack Hallam appeared to score in the first half , but the referee disallowed the goal , having spotted that Hallam had knocked the ball in with hand rather than head , and Middlesbrough went on to score twice without reply in the second period . 
 Fred Jones missed the Middlesbrough match because of international duty . Selected among the reserves for Wales ' match against Scotland , he was required to play after both first @-@ choice backs dropped out . The Liverpool Mercury reported that he had " a wretched game at back and completely disorganised the Welsh defence " , as Scotland won 8 – 0 , while according to the Wrexham Advertiser , " some @-@ one said that he appeared to have made a resolve before he went on the field not to kick the ball " . 
 On 20 March , Small Heath played West Bromwich Albion in a benefit match for captain Caesar Jenkyns . Teddy Jolley made his first appearance for the club , and a relatively strong side whose forwards " were very quick on the ball , and passed remarkably well " , notably Wheldon , who " as usual , played brilliantly " , won 5 – 0 in front of about 4 @,@ 000 spectators . In an uneventful penultimate League match of the regular season , Small Heath won 3 – 0 at the Athletic Ground against Burslem Port Vale , Walton opening the scoring just before half @-@ time with a penalty kick . The Sheffield & Rotherham Independent now predicted that Sheffield United would win their remaining four matches , all away from home , to take the divisional title on goal average .

 Despite competition from holiday entertainments which included the Military Tournament at Bingley Hall , <unk> 's circus at Curzon Hall , the fairground , variety shows and dancing at Aston Lower Grounds , and boating and other amusements in the public parks , a large attendance was expected at Small Heath 's last League match of the season , on a fine Easter weekend at home to Ardwick . Ardwick took an early lead , which Hands came close to equalising after a clever passing move with Wheldon . Just before the interval , Wheldon forced a corner , from which the ball was rushed across the line . In the second half , Small Heath went all out in attack , and after the Ardwick goalkeeper had made several saves , Walton scored with a header , and Hallam made it three from a Walton pass . Ardwick pulled one back , but Small Heath 's " admirable defence " held out " by watchfulness and combination " for a gratifying result for the supporters . On Easter Monday they visited Middlesbrough where they lost 2 – 1 to the Ironopolis club in a friendly . 
 The next Saturday saw the meeting with Aston Villa in the semifinal of the Birmingham Senior Cup . Both clubs fielded full first teams , Small Heath missing only Walton , for whom Harry Edwards proved a " very indifferent " substitute . In front of 15 @,@ 000 spectators at Aston Lower Grounds , Small Heath outplayed their First Division opponents for the first half hour , and had several chances which they failed to take , but Aston Villa improved thereafter , winning 5 – 0 after a quite one @-@ sided second half . 
 On the Monday , Darwen visited Small Heath to play a benefit match for Fred Speller , who had been injured playing against that club in October . Unfortunately for the beneficiary , the attendance was affected by the semi @-@ final of the Mayor 's Charity Cup between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion being played the same day . Friendlies against First Division Stoke and West Bromwich Albion produced wins by 4 – 2 and 4 – 1 respectively , and Sheffield United 's failure to beat Walsall in their last League match of the season confirmed Small Heath as inaugural Second Division champions . Ahead of the promotion test match , against 16th @-@ placed First Division team Newton Heath at Stoke 's Victoria Ground , the Birmingham Daily Gazette was sure that " all the good wishes of Midland sportsmen will go with the Heathens for their success after a consistently good season 's performance " . 
 Small Heath forced several early corners , but then conceded on the break when Alf Farman scored from a Tommy Fitzsimmons pass . Towards half @-@ time , they had chances from a scramble in front of the Newton Heath goal , and pressed hard after the interval , the persistence of Wheldon eventually securing an equaliser " after brilliant work by all of the Small Heath forwards " . " Capital defensive play " by both teams prevailed thereafter , and the match was drawn . The Manchester Guardian noted the contrast in attacking style , as " the Small Heath players were playing a most scientific game , but the rushes of Newton Heath were often very dangerous " , and the Gazette 's reporter felt that half @-@ backs George Short and , particularly , Jenkyns had been " inclined to take matters a little too easily " in the first half . 
 Two days later , Small Heath , with Jack Lee and Bernard Pumfrey in the forward line instead of Walton and Mobley , and Littleford standing in at back , played a similarly depleted Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi @-@ final of the Mayor of Birmingham 's Charity Cup . Hands scored Small Heath 's opening goal , but sustained a leg injury after about half an hour ; although he continued for a time , he was struggling , and could not complete the game . Despite the numerical disadvantage , Lee scored twice for Small Heath to take the tie 3 – 1 . 
 Harry Morris replaced the injured Hands at outside left for the test match replay at Olive Grove , Sheffield . Newton Heath had a goal disallowed for handball before Wheldon opened the scoring with a powerful shot from distance . After several attacks at each end – Tom Bayley cleared off the line and Wheldon hit the foot of a post – Farman equalised after 37 minutes with a penalty awarded against Bayley for handball . Soon after half @-@ time , Newton Heath took the lead from a goalmouth scramble , within a minute a pass from Hallam found Walton who equalised , but in the end Small Heath were overrun . With 18 minutes remaining , goals from Joe Cassidy , Jimmy Coupar and Farman made the final score 5 – 2 , ensuring that Small Heath would remain in the Second Division for another year . 
 In the final of the Mayor 's Charity Cup at the Lower Grounds – Small Heath 's last competitive match of the season , and their fourth in eight days – Hallam opened the scoring from the rebound after a long shot hit the post in the first attacking move of the game . Aston Villa took a 2 – 1 lead , Small Heath equalised in the second half , but Villa scored the winning goal after torrential rain had driven " a great many " of the spectators from the ground . 
 = = Summary and aftermath = = 
 Small Heath went through the season unbeaten at Coventry Road . In the League , they scored 90 goals , at a rate of more than 4 goals per game , and all five first @-@ choice forwards reached double figures . The leading scorer was Fred Wheldon , with 25 goals from the 22 League fixtures and 1 in the test match , a total which made him the top scorer for the Second Division . Wheldon , Tommy Hands and Billy Ollis were ever @-@ present in the League , and Caesar Jenkyns and Jack Hallam missed only one game apiece . 
 Unable to dislodge Wheldon or Billy Walton from the inside forward position , Harry Edwards chose to leave at the end of the season . Tom Bayley was released , and Fred Jones left for Lincoln City after losing his place at left back to Bernard Pumfrey . Harry Morris retired to concentrate on his plumbing business . Fred Speller attempted a comeback , appearing twice for the first team in September 1893 , but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career . 
 Speculation by " people who profess to believe that these test matches will not be played at all , and that if they are , and a First Division team is knocked out , the rules will be circumvented in some way " proved unfounded . The League 's Annual General Meeting heard proposals that the First Division be expanded to either 20 or 18 teams . Both motions were seconded by Small Heath – not surprisingly , after they as champions had failed to gain promotion while the teams in second and third place had succeeded – but both were defeated , thus confirming that the team would play in the Second Division for the 1893 – 94 season . Small Heath were to finish that season as runners @-@ up and , this time , achieved promotion to the First Division via the test matches .

 Day of the Tentacle , also known as Maniac Mansion II : Day of the Tentacle , is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts . It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion . The game 's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle — a sentient , disembodied tentacle — from taking over the world . The player takes control of the trio and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history . 
 Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co @-@ led the game 's development , their first time in such a role . The pair carried over a limited number of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development . Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States . Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine . 
 The game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD @-@ ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success . Critics focused on its cartoon @-@ style visuals and comedic elements . Day of the Tentacle has featured regularly in lists of " top " games published more than two decades after its release , and aspects have been referenced in popular culture . A remaster of Day of the Tentacle was developed by Schafer 's current studio , Double Fine Productions , and released on March 22 , 2016 for the PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita , Windows and OS X.

 Day of the Tentacle follows the point @-@ and @-@ click two @-@ dimensional adventure game formula , first established by the original Maniac Mansion . Players direct the controllable characters around the game world by clicking with the computer mouse . To interact with the game world , players choose from a set of nine commands arrayed on the screen ( such as " pick up " , " use " , or " talk to " ) and then on an object in the world . This was the last SCUMM game to use the original interface of having the bottom of the screen being taken up by a verb selection and inventory ; starting with the next game to use the SCUMM engine , Sam & Max Hit the Road , the engine was modified to scroll through a more concise list of verbs with the right mouse button and having the inventory on a separate screen . 
 Day of the Tentacle uses time travel extensively ; early in the game , the three main protagonists are separated across time by the effects of a faulty time machine . The player , after completing certain puzzles , can then freely switch between these characters , interacting with the game 's world in the separate time periods . Certain small inventory items can be shared by placing the item into the " Chron @-@ o @-@ Johns " , modified portable toilets that instantly transport objects to the other time period , while other items are shared by simply leaving the item in a past time period to be picked up by a character in a future period . Changes made to a past time period will affect a future one , and many of the game 's puzzles are based on the effect of time travel , aging of certain items , and alterations of the time stream . For example , one puzzle requires the player , while in the future era where Purple Tentacle has succeeded , to send a medical chart of a Tentacle back to the past , having it used as the design of the American flag , then collecting one such flag in the future to be used as a Tentacle disguise to allow that character to roam freely . 
 Day of the Tentacle was the first LucasArts game to adopt the philosophy of " never die or get stuck " ; LucasArts staff felt the player should not be punished for his or her inability to solve a puzzle . For comparison , earlier LucasArts adventures did make it possible for characters to be killed or the player to take actions that would render the game <unk> , although they were still far less harsh than Sierra 's adventure games which were almost infamous for their frequent and easy deaths . 
 The whole original Maniac Mansion game can be played on a computer resembling a Commodore 64 inside the Day of the Tentacle game ; this practice has since been repeated by other game developers , but at the time of Day of the Tentacle 's release , it was unprecedented . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Five years after the events of Maniac Mansion , Purple Tentacle — a mutant monster and lab assistant created by mad scientist Dr. Fred Edison — drinks toxic sludge from a river behind Dr. Fred 's laboratory . The sludge causes him to grow a pair of flipper @-@ like arms , develop vastly increased intelligence and a thirst for global domination . Dr. Fred plans to resolve the issue by killing Purple Tentacle and his harmless , friendly brother Green Tentacle , but Green Tentacle sends a plea of help to his old friend , the nerd Bernard Bernoulli . Bernard travels to the Edison family motel with his two housemates , deranged medical student Laverne and roadie Hoagie , and frees the tentacles . Purple Tentacle escapes to resume his quest to take over the world . 
 Since Purple Tentacle 's plans are flawless and unstoppable , Dr. Fred decides to use his Chron @-@ o @-@ John time machines to send Bernard , Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge @-@ o @-@ Matic machine , thereby preventing Purple Tentacle 's exposure to the sludge . However , because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine , the Chron @-@ o @-@ Johns breaks down in operation . Laverne is sent 200 years in the future , where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules the world from the Edison mansion , while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past , where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution . Bernard is returned to the present . To salvage Dr. Fred 's plan , Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine , while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron @-@ o @-@ John pods by plugging them in . To overcome the lack of electricity in the past , Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred 's ancestor , Red Edison , to build a <unk> to power his pod , while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit . The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron @-@ o @-@ Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks . 
 Eventually , Bernard uses Dr. Fred 's family fortune of royalties from Maniac Mansion to purchase a real diamond , both Laverne and Hoagie manage to power their Chron @-@ o @-@ Johns , and the three are reunited in the present . Purple Tentacle arrives , hijacks a Chron @-@ o @-@ John and takes it to the previous day to prevent them from turning off the sludge machine ; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod . With only one Chron @-@ o @-@ John pod left , Bernard , Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day , while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together , referencing the film The Fly . Upon arriving , the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three @-@ headed monster , their bodies merging into one during the transfer . Meanwhile , Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless of versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge @-@ o @-@ Matic from being deactivated . Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge @-@ o @-@ Matic , turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening . Returning to the present , Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes ; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house . The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle @-@ shaped American flag , one of the more significant results of their tampering in history .
