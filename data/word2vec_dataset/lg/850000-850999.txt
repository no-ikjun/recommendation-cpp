 Following Malayan independence from Britain in 1957 , proposals to federate the states of Malaya , Sabah , Sarawak , Brunei , and Singapore led to tensions with Indonesia . In late @-@ 1962 the Indonesian president , Sukarno , had begun military operations in an attempt to destabilise the new state , including an attempt to seize power in the independent enclave of Brunei in December . Following the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 , hostilities grew with military activity increasing along the Indonesian side of the border in Borneo , as small parties of armed men began infiltrating Malaysian territory on propaganda and sabotage missions . Carried out by Indonesian irregular " volunteers " , these operations continued throughout 1963 . However , by 1964 Indonesian regular army ( TNI ) units had also become involved . 
 Although not initially agreeing to send troops to Borneo in the opening stages of the Indonesia @-@ Malaysia Confrontation , the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve ( FESR ) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack . 3 RAR , which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca , was subsequently used to mop up two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964 . These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent , and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests , subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo , in addition to a battery of artillery , an engineer construction squadron , and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment . 
 During the early phases , British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the border , and to protect population centres . However , by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive , under the codename Operation Claret . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Opposing forces = = = 
 As part of these operations , British @-@ Commonwealth reconnaissance and special forces patrols frequently crossed the border into the Kalimantan in order to detect Indonesian forces about to enter Sarawak . Initially penetration was limited to 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) , while later it was extended to 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) , and yet again to 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) . Conventional forces were then tasked to act on this information to ambush or otherwise attack the Indonesians . Uncertain of where British @-@ Commonwealth forces might strike next , the Indonesians were increasingly forced to devote their resources to protecting their own positions , reducing their ability to conduct offensive operations , although these continued on a much reduced scale . Given the sensitivity of Claret operations and the potential consequences if they were exposed they were controlled at the highest level , and were highly classified at the time , with the participants sworn to secrecy . When casualties were suffered they were reported as having occurred within Malaysian territory . 
 3 RAR formally relieved a British Army battalion , the 1 / 7th Gurkhas , in the Bau area of Sarawak on 22 March 1965 , although they had mounted a number of familiarisation patrols inside Malaysian territory over the proceeding weeks . Joining the West Brigade , the Australians were initially deployed in a series of company bases along the border , guarding the approaches to the capital Kuching just 31 miles ( 50 km ) away . Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bruce McDonald , the battalion was deployed with three of its four rifle companies forward at <unk> ( A Company ) , Bukit Knuckle ( B Company ) and Serikin ( C Company ) in order to cover the border areas , with the fourth company ( D Company ) remaining in reserve at Bau along with Battalion Headquarters . On average , each company operated on a frontage of around 7 @,@ 700 yards ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) . In support in West Brigade was the British 4th Light Regiment , equipped with 105 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L5 pack <unk> and 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) medium guns . Included were the guns of 102nd Field Battery , Royal Australian Artillery , which had recently been deployed to West Sarawak . 
 By late April the Australians began their first cross @-@ border reconnaissance patrols . Opposing them were a number of Indonesian units , including elements of the <unk> Para Komando Angkatan Darat ( RPKAD ) and the Diponegoro Division , normally based in <unk> 7 in central Java . These units were among the best in the TNI . In April 1965 two Indonesian battalion combat teams from the 5th Brigade were deployed in the 3 RAR area of operations , designated ' H ' BTP and ' J ' BTP , while a third battalion , ' I ' BTP , was concentrated further to the east ; in total 3 @,@ 050 men under the overall command of Colonel <unk> . These units were supported by at least two detachments of artillery , equipped with anti @-@ aircraft machine @-@ guns and 81 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) mortars .

 = = = First ambush , 27 May 1965 = = = 
 The first Australian fighting patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons , 5 and 11 Platoons , from B Company and a forward observation party , departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle under the command of Major William Broderick . The patrol — designated Operation Article — involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river . After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale . The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re @-@ entrant below , talking loudly and firing random shots , seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security . 
 The following morning Broderick moved the company down the spur line in order to establish a firm base , while Beale moved 5 Platoon forward . Four 7 @.@ 62 mm <unk> Bren light machine @-@ guns were incorporated into the patrol . The Australians encountered a track , beyond which lay the river , while to the north across a shallow creek , movement of the Indonesians could still be heard . The presence of the Indonesians so close to the Australian position made the chances of detection too great and as such no more troops were brought forward . Instead , Beale deployed his platoon into two positions , one covering the track with two Brens in order to secure it from the Indonesians in the re @-@ entrant , as well as another position on a bend in the river . Only the sentry on the right @-@ hand flank , Private Lawrence Jackson , could see around the bend , which narrowed to just 33 yards ( 30 m ) at that point . 
 At 11 : 32 am , after occupying the position for only 40 minutes , motors were heard approaching along the river , with two 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) motor boats coming into view . Each vessel contained five armed and uniformed Indonesian soldiers , including one fair haired European , who was later identified as a Dutch mercenary . The Australians had not been detected and allowed the boats to draw closer before the ambush was sprung . With the boats just 38 yards ( 35 m ) away they opened fire , raking them with automatic fire which emptied the boats of their occupants . The first boat sank and the second drifted down stream . Two Indonesians were observed swimming for the far bank and were subsequently shot , with the other eight also killed . Unknown to the Australians , however , two more boats had been following the first two , and as the third boat rounded the bend in the river Private Jackson engaged the Indonesians , killing all five occupants from a range of just 11 yards ( 10 m ) . The fourth vessel subsequently pulled quickly to the shore out of sight of the remainder of the Australians , with Jackson engaging it with two grenades and small arms fire before his weapon jammed . 
 The action had lasted just two minutes to this point , yet already a party of approximately 10 Indonesians across the river began to engage the Australians with heavy automatic fire , although it was largely inaccurate . Beale ordered a withdrawal to link up with the rest of B Company , with the ambush party subsequently rejoining the rest of 5 Platoon while 11 Platoon covered their withdrawal . The forward observation officer subsequently called in a defensive artillery fire mission onto the abandoned position , reducing the volume of Indonesian fire and allowing the Australians to break contact . Shortly after an Indonesian 81 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) mortar began to fire , dropping rounds into the jungle towards Siding , away from B Company 's escape route . Elements of D Company and Support Company had been deployed so as to support the withdrawal , and the patrol subsequently recrossed the border into Sarawak without further incident , returning to Bukit Knuckle later that evening . 
 No Australian casualties were incurred and at least 15 Indonesians were believed to have been killed . Later that night an Indonesian radio broadcast announced that 23 Indonesian military personnel had been accidentally killed during a training exercise . Jackson was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his " complete disregard for his own safety , [ which ] prevented the Indonesians from landing on the near bank and attacking the other members of the ambush . He contributed much to the overwhelming success of the engagement " ; while Beale received the Military Cross for " his personal bravery , inspiring leadership , judgment and skill " . Further Claret operations followed in quick succession , making June the most intensive month of the Australian battalion 's tour in Borneo , and its most successful . 
 = = = Second ambush , 12 June 1965 = = = 
 On 10 June a patrol — designated Operation Faun Fare — consisting of 7 Platoon , C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest , accompanied the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson , the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party , left the company base at Serikin to mount an ambush on the Sungei Koemba river . The site of the ambush was to be a little further downstream from the successful action the previous month , being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding . The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position early the next morning and proceeded to wait . During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered , as were three more the next morning . 
 At 10 : 45 am on 12 June Private Haines , a sentry on the left hand flank , warned of the approach of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank . The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage . Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen , Private Sneddon , on the extreme left , engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine @-@ gun fire , killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him . Haines subsequently killed a fourth , while a fifth Indonesian continued past him , followed by five others , who then engaged the Australians . The Indonesian patrol continued to advance , taking them towards the rear of the Australian positions . 
 Hodgkinson worked his way around to the left towards the Indonesian line of approach , subsequently engaging and killing two more , and wounding a third . Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon , hooking around Hodgkinson and counter @-@ attacking the remaining Indonesians , killing the previously wounded soldier and one other . Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come . Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment , including a Browning Automatic Rifle , three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition . Dressed in US steel helmets , green shirts and blue and khaki shorts , the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion . 
 The Australians then withdrew , calling in a defensive fire artillery mission onto the abandoned ambush position in order to allow them to break contact . Later , Indonesian small arms fire was heard to emanate from the same area and a further nine rounds were called in to bombard the site . The patrol harboured for the night , recrossing the border without incident the following day and returning to Serikin . The Australians suffered no casualties , while eight Indonesians were killed and one was seriously wounded . For his leadership of C Company throughout 3 RAR 's deployment , which " [ brought ] out those highest qualities expected of professional soldiers " , Hodgkinson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire on 24 May 1966 . 
 As a consequence , the Indonesians planned to increase their activity against the <unk> , <unk> and Bukit Knuckle areas , while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian . In response , Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak , and these would later result in further fighting . Perhaps in <unk> , Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border , firing 13 rounds , while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11 : 00 am . There were no casualties . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 In addition to inflicting significant casualties on Indonesian forces , the successful Australian ambushes on the Sungei Koemba , and later at <unk> , in May and June allowed 3 RAR to dominate the border area , while also providing early warning of Indonesian incursions into Sarawak . Following these actions Major General George Lea , the British Director of Operations , ordered a short pause in offensive operations in order to observe the effects . Indonesian mortar attacks on company bases in the 3 RAR area of operation , which had been heavy throughout May and June , ceased soon afterwards . Following the resumption of Claret operations the Australian battalion later followed this up with another profitable mission at <unk> on 12 July , contributing to the wider success of the British @-@ Commonwealth forces in slowly asserting control on the war . 
 Overall , Operation Claret was largely successful in gaining the initiative , inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians and keeping them on the defensive , before being suspended late in the war . Generally British Commonwealth units on their first tour in Borneo were not allowed to undertake such audacious operations however , and consequently , although highly successful the actions of 3 RAR in their first and only tour may not have been representative of those by more experienced Gurkha and British battalions . Denied during the war , these incursions were only publicly disclosed by Britain in 1974 , while the Australian government did not officially acknowledge its involvement until 1996 . 3 RAR carried out 32 Claret operations in total , including 12 reconnaissance patrols and 20 ambushes or fighting patrols , although the majority never resulted in contact . In contrast , Indonesian activity was usually small @-@ scale and aimed to challenge incursions rather than to attack them . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 3 RAR completed its tour in August 1965 and returned to Camp Terendak , being relieved in West Brigade by the 2 / 10th Gurkhas . During its four months in Borneo the Australian battalion had suffered three men killed and five wounded , the bulk of which occurred during two separate land mine incidents . The 2 / 10th Gurkhas subsequently fought a number of heavy engagements against the Indonesians , including an action at Bau on 21 November 1965 , during which 24 Indonesians were killed for the loss of three Gurkhas . One of the Gurkhas , Lance Corporal <unk> Limbu , was later awarded the Victoria Cross ; the only such decoration of the conflict . Meanwhile , the 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 4 RAR ) arrived in Malaysia in September 1965 to replace 3 RAR in the FESR , with the battalion returning to Australia in October . After a period of training the new battalion deployed to Sarawak in April 1966 where it also operated from a series of company bases around Bau . However , by this time the war was winding down as peace negotiations had begun between Malaysia and Indonesia , and although 4 RAR was involved in a number of contacts , its tour was less eventful .

 Kapitän zur See ( Captain ) Wolfgang August Eugen Lüth ( 15 October 1913 – 14 May 1945 ) , was the second most successful German U @-@ boat ace of World War II . His career record of 46 merchant ships plus the French submarine Doris sunk during 15 war patrols , with a total displacement of 230 @,@ 781 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was second only to that of Korvettenkapitän ( Lieutenant Commander ) Otto Kretschmer , whose 47 sinkings totaled 274 @.@ 333 GRT . 
 Lüth joined the Reichsmarine in 1933 . After a period of training on surface vessels , he transferred to the U @-@ boat service in 1936 . In December 1939 he received command of U @-@ 9 , which he took on six war @-@ patrols . In June 1940 he took command of U @-@ 138 for two patrols . In October 1940 he transferred again , this time to the ocean @-@ going submarine U @-@ 43 for five war @-@ patrols . After two patrols on U @-@ 181 , the second being his longest of the war , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds . He was the first of two U @-@ boat commanders to be so honored during World War II , the other recipient being Albrecht Brandi . 
 Lüth 's last service position was commander of the naval academy at Mürwik a part of Flensburg . He was accidentally shot and killed by a German sentry on the night of 13 / 14 May 1945 . Lüth was given the last state funeral in the Third Reich , the only U @-@ boat commander to be so commemorated .

 Lüth was a Baltic German born in Riga in the Russian Empire . He went to the <unk> Gymnasium there and after he had received his Abitur ( school leaving certificate ) , he studied Law for three semesters at the Herder @-@ Institut . With his parents approval he joined the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1933 as an <unk> ( Officer Candidate ) . After he underwent basic military training in the 2nd department ( II . Abteilung ) of the standing ship division ( <unk> ) of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund ( 1 April 1933 – 29 June 1933 ) , he was transferred to the training ship Gorch Fock ( 30 June 1933 – 23 September 1933 ) attaining the rank of Seekadett ( Naval Cadet ) on 23 September 1933 . He initially served with the surface fleet , going on a nine @-@ month training tour around the world in the light cruiser Karlsruhe from 24 September 1933 to 27 June 1934 . He advanced in rank to Fähnrich zur See ( Midshipman ) on 1 July 1934 and served for a year aboard the light cruiser Königsberg ( 22 March 1936 – 31 January 1937 ) , attaining the rank of Oberfähnrich zur See ( Senior midshipman ) on 1 April 1936 and Leutnant zur See ( Ensign ) on 1 October 1936 . 
 In February 1937 he transferred to the U @-@ boat arm and was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See ( Lieutenant [ junior grade ] ) on 1 June 1938 . In July he was appointed 2nd Watch Officer of U @-@ 27 ( 3 July 1938 – 23 October 1938 ) . He sailed on a patrol in Spanish waters during the civil war in that country on the U @-@ boat tender Erwin <unk> ( 13 April 1939 – 18 May 1939 ) . In October he was appointed the 1st Watch Officer of U @-@ 38 under the command of Kapitänleutnant ( Lieutenant ) Heinrich Liebe , who during the course of World War II would earn the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . Lüth was on patrol with U @-@ 38 from 19 August 1939 until 18 September , ( the war started on 1 September ) .

 On 30 December 1939 Lüth took command of U @-@ 9 , a Type IIB U @-@ boat . He went on six patrols with this boat , achieving steady success . His first victim , following the premature ignition of a smoke float , was the Swedish merchantman Flandria , which he sank in January 1940 . This surface attack was carried out while U @-@ 9 's bridge was filled with onlooking crew members . Other sinkings included the surfaced French submarine Doris on 9 May 1940 and seven merchant ships with a total of 16 @,@ 669 gross register tons ( GRT ) . Two of Lüth 's officers on U @-@ 9 would be awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross .

 On 27 June 1940 Lüth took command of U @-@ 138 , a Type <unk> , with which he sank four ships on his first patrol , totalling 34 @,@ 644 GRT . In October , after having returned from his second patrol , on which he fired a torpedo at ( but missed ) the Norwegian merchant steamer SS <unk> ( 4 @,@ 562 GRT ) , sank the British merchant steamer SS Bonheur ( 5 @,@ 327 GRT ) and damaged the British motor tanker British Glory ( 6 @,@ 993 GRT ) . Lüth was mentioned for the first time in the Wehrmachtbericht , ( the daily report by the High Command of the German Armed Forces regarding the military situation on all fronts ) , on 23 September 1940 and received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for his achievements on 24 October 1940 .

 On 21 October 1940 Lüth took command of U @-@ 43 , a long range Type IX U @-@ boat . He carried out five patrols with this boat , totaling 204 days at sea , sinking 12 ships adding up to 64 @,@ 852 GRT . On 1 January 1941 he was promoted to Kapitänleutnant . Lüth , because of his experience — like many other top commanders — was tasked with training future U @-@ boat commanders . These trainees often came along on single war @-@ patrols , which would be their last exercise before they received their own command . Kapitänleutnant Erich Würdemann was one such trainee and sailed onboard U @-@ 43 from April to July 1941 . Würdemann would be awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross as commander of U @-@ 506 in 1943 before he was killed in action on 14 July 1943 .

 U @-@ 43 was due to depart Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown , west Africa , but early on 4 February 1941 , she sank while tied to the <unk> , an old sailing ship which was used as a floating pier .

To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U @-@ Boote ( BdU — U @-@ boat command headquarters ) directive , a hatch had been left open , allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room . Two petty officers were found to be most at fault ; but Lüth , as captain , was ultimately responsible . However , no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth 's career does not appear to have been affected .

 On 9 May 1942 Lüth was given command of a long @-@ range Type IXD @-@ 2 U @-@ boat , U @-@ 181 . He left on his first patrol in September 1942 , departing from Kiel for the Indian Ocean and waters off South Africa . In October he reached the sea lanes outside Cape Town and spent a month patrolling the area , sinking 12 ships for 58 @,@ 381 GRT before returning to Bordeaux in France , in January 1943 . On 13 November 1942 he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . On 31 January 1943 , Lüth other Kriegsmarine officers traveled to the Wolf 's Lair , Hitler 's headquarters in Rastenburg , present @-@ day Kętrzyn in Poland , for the Oak Leaves presentation . Following the presentation , Hitler met with Dönitz and Vizeadmiral Theodor Krancke in private . In this meeting , Hitler appointed Dönitz as Oberbefehlshaber der Marine ( Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief ) of the Kriegsmarine following Raeder 's resignation on 30 January 1943 . On the return flight to Berlin , Dönitz informed Lüth and the other officers present of this change in command . 
 In March 1943 Lüth set out for a second patrol off South Africa and in the Indian Ocean , in particular the waters around Mauritius . This patrol lasted 205 days ( 23 March 1943 – 14 October 1943 ) making it the second longest of the war . ( The longest combat patrol of World War II was 225 days in length , this was achieved by Eitel @-@ Friedrich Kentrat as commander of the U @-@ 196 . ) Lüth sank 10 ships totaling 45 @,@ 331 GRT on this patrol , which turned out to be his last . While at sea he was promoted to Korvettenkapitän on 1 April 1943 , and on 15 April received news that he had been awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . 
 U @-@ 181 rendezvoused with the supply ship Charlotte Schliemann east of Mauritius to refuel on 21 June . Also present were U @-@ 177 , under the command of Robert <unk> , U @-@ 178 ( Wilhelm <unk> ) , U @-@ 196 ( Eitel @-@ Friedrich Kentrat ) , U @-@ 197 ( Robert Bartels ) and U @-@ 198 ( Werner Hartmann ) . The commanders exchanged experiences and discussed the problem of torpedo failures . On 9 August of the same year and while still on patrol , Lüth was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds . On 15 July 1943 , Lüth sunk the British collier Empire Lake and noted in his logbook . " Five men have been left floating on a piece of wreckage . Due to the high sea and 180 @-@ mile distance from land they will probably not be saved . " 
 Lüth nominated two crew members of U @-@ 181 for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross after this patrol . The chief engineer Kapitänleutnant Carl @-@ August <unk> and 2nd Watch Officer Johannes <unk> both received the Knight 's Cross for their achievements .

 After five years of operational U @-@ boat service , including 15 war @-@ patrols and over 600 days at sea , Lüth took command of 22nd U @-@ boat Flotilla stationed at Gotenhafen in January 1944 . This was a training unit for U @-@ boat commanders . In July 1944 he took command of the 1st Department of the Marineschule Mürwik ( Mürwik Naval Academy ) in Flensburg . He was promoted to Fregattenkapitän ( Commander ) on 1 August 1944 and became the commander of the entire Marineschule in September .

 British Forces had occupied Flensburg on 5 May 1945 ; initially nothing changed in the daily routine at the Mürwik Naval Academy . Returning drunk in the night of 13 / 14 May 1945 , Lüth failed to respond to the sentry 's challenge and was shot in the head by 18 @-@ year @-@ old seaman Mathias Gottlob , a German guard . The password of the day was " Tannenberg . " The officer in charge immediately informed Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz , whose adjutant , Fregattenkapitän Walter <unk> @-@ Neurath , who had accepted the call , initially thought that it was a bad joke . <unk> @-@ Neurath then informed Lüth 's brother , Joachim Lüth , as the two siblings were staying together . It was he who informed Lüth 's wife and their four children that Lüth had died . 
 Dönitz contacted the British city commander of Flensburg , Colonel Roberts , asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral , which Roberts approved . That funeral , ( the last such of the Third Reich ) , was held for Lüth on 16 May 1945 with Adolf Hitler 's successor as Head of State , Reichspräsident and Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz , delivering the eulogy . 
 Dönitz ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting . Four officers under the command of a Navy Judge conducted the court martial . Mathias Gottlob stated that , in accordance with his orders , he had asked for the password three times without response from the person , whom he could not visually identify in the darkness . Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip . The chain of events was confirmed by <unk> Karl Franz , who was leading the watch at the time .

 Chris Candido was an American professional wrestler who worked for TNA starting in 2005 . At TNA 's Lockdown PPV event on April 24 , 2005 , Candido teamed with Lance Hoyt to face Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match . During the encounter , Candido suffered an injury which was later diagnosed as a dislocated ankle , broken tibia , and a broken fibula which required surgery . Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate , screws , and pins placed in his ankle to fix the problem with him being sidelined from competing for two to three months in order to heal . However , Candido hoped to be fully recovered in six to eight weeks . On April 28 , Candido was rushed to the hospital after he collapsed , where he died a short time later . The cause of death was released by Candido 's brother Johnny as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior . 
 TNA released a public statement on April 29 , regrading the subject . TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April 29 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! as well as at TNA 's Hard Justice PPV event on May 15 . The April 29 episode of Impact ! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido . At Hard Justice , a ten @-@ bell salute was held while a photo of Candido , a pair of boots , and one @-@ half of the NWA World Tag Team Championship positioned on a steel chair sat in the center of the ring . A portion of the Lockdown DVD sale profits were donated by TNA to the Chris Candido Memorial Fund . TNA originally planned to remove Candido 's match from the DVD , but were given the blessing of his family to include it on the publication . A tribute to Candido was included on the DVD by TNA . 
 The tournament was announced in August 2005 by TNA editor Bill Banks . He revealed the official name for the competition , the " 2005 Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament " , and that TNA were planning on it being an annual contest . Banks also announced the format of the tournament involved veteran wrestlers teaming with young wrestlers in order to compete . The idea behind the contest was explained on the August 19 episode of Impact ! prior to the opening bout of the tournament . The tournament was set up in a way to mimic Candido 's role at the time of his death . Prior to his death , the veteran Candido was managing the young tag team of The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) . Candido managed the team to winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship from America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ; AMW ) on the April 29 episode of Impact ! , which had been taped on April 25 prior to his death . 
 In the tournament , eight tag teams were determined at random , with one veteran wrestler being placed with a younger wrestler from the company . The competition was also referred to as the " Chris Candido Memorial Cup Tournament " . The teams chosen at random were Abyss ( veteran ) and Shark Boy ( young ) , Alex Shelley ( young ) and Sean Waltman ( veteran ) , B.G. James ( veteran ) and Cassidy Reilly ( young ) , Chris Sabin ( young ) and Shocker ( veteran ) , Kip James ( veteran ) and Petey Williams ( young ) , Konnan ( veteran ) and Lance Hoyt ( young ) , Mikey Batts ( young ) and Simon Diamond ( veteran ) , and last of all Ron Killings ( veteran ) and Sonjay Dutt ( young ) . On the August 26 episode of Impact ! , NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko announced that a Four Way Elimination Tag Team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship was planned for TNA 's Unbreakable PPV event on September 11 , in which The Naturals would defend against AMW , Team Canada ( A @-@ 1 and Eric Young ) , and the winners of the Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament .

 The Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament featured seven matches involving different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match . 
 The tournament consisted of three rounds : the quarterfinals , semifinals , and finals . All three rounds were broadcast on Impact ! . All three rounds were taped on August 16 and aired on the August 19 , August 26 , September 2 , and September 9 episodes of Impact ! . 
 Quarterfinals 
 The first two matches of the quarterfinals took place on the August 19 episode of Impact ! . The team of Chris Sabin and Shocker were pitted against the team of Mikey Batts and Simon Diamond in the first . Sabin and Shocker won the bout after Sabin slammed Batts back @-@ first into the mat with his signature Cradle Shock maneuver and followed with the pin at 7 minutes and 1 second . In the second , the team of B.G. James and Cassidy Reilly fought the team of Ron Killings and Sonjay Dutt . Dutt won the match at 4 minutes and 14 seconds for his team after a 450 ° aerial splash onto Reilly and the pin . 
 The last two were held on the August 26 episode of Impact ! . The team of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman faced Abyss and Shark Boy in a bout lasting 4 minutes and 10 seconds . Shelley pinned Shark Boy after slamming him face @-@ first into the mat with his signature <unk> maneuver . The second encounter was between the team of Lance Hoyt and Konnan and the team of Kip James and Petey Williams . The team of Hoyt and Konnan won the bout after Hoyt pinned Kip following a boot to the face at 6 minutes and 49 seconds . 
 Semifinals 
 The semifinals were held on the September 2 episode of Impact ! . Shelley and Waltman defeated the team of Hoyt and Konnan in the first semifinal match at 4 minutes and 22 seconds . During the match , Hoyt hit Waltman with a boot to the face and went for the pin , but the referee was distracted by Kip James who came down to ringside . Hoyt went to get the referee , giving Waltman the ability to hit him in the groin and follow @-@ up by slamming him face @-@ first into the mat with his signature X @-@ Factor maneuver . 
 In the second semifinal match , Sabin and Shocker defeated Dutt and Killings at 7 minutes and 49 seconds . During the contest , Sabin accidentally hit his teammate Shocker in the face . This led to some confusion in the match , allowing Killings to get a near @-@ fall on Sabin . This was later resolved , with Sabin getting the pin on Dutt via la magistral . 
 Finals 
 The final round occurred on the September 9 episode of Impact ! , with Sabin and Shocker versus Shelley and Waltman . This contest lasted 7 minutes and 20 seconds . Sabin and Shelley started off the match , with Shelley dominating Sabin with mat submission holds . The wrestling left the ring as Waltman performed a somersault splash to the ringside area onto Shocker and Sabin . Later , Sabin ascended to the top @-@ rope to perform a dropkick onto Shelley , to only have Shelley dodge out of the way , resulting in Sabin hitting his partner Shocker instead . After checking on Shocker , Sabin turned around and was met with a kick to the jaw from Shelley . Sabin left the ring after this due to a legitimate injury . With Shocker left and the referee attending to other matters , Waltman hit Shocker in the groin and followed by performing his X @-@ Factor maneuver to gain the pinfall victory and to win the tournament . 
 With Shelley and Waltman 's victory , they became the first winners of the expected annual tournament . They also gained entry into the Four Way Elimination Tag Team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship scheduled for Unbreakable .

 James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch felt that Chris Sabin and Shocker versus Simon Diamond and Mikey Batts was " solid wrestling " and a " nice opening match " for the tournament . When it came to the second match of the tournament , B.G. James and Cassidy Reilly versus Ron Killings and Sonjay Dutt , Caldwell felt that James and Killings " undermined the spirit of the Candido tournament " by dancing mid @-@ way through their encounter . Caldwell commented on the pairing of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman for the tournament , saying they were a " natural fit working together " and expressing hope that they would be a permanent fixture after the tournament concluded . Regarding the semifinal matches , Caldwell thought Sabin and Shocker versus Dutt and Killings was a " solid match with a nice mini @-@ storyline involving Sabin and Shocker having a miscommunication before settling their differences to win the match . " As for the finals , Caldwell stated that Shelley and Waltman versus Sabin and Shocker was a " standard tag match " but it was " effective in telling the story of Waltman and Shelley doing whatever it takes to win while Shocker and Sabin continued to have differences that finally caused Shocker to go off . " Caldwell concluded by saying that " Waltman and Shelley have impressed as a legit tag team since their first round match in the tournament , " going on to say that he hoped for a Waltman and Shelley victory at Unbreakable to " give the tag division a fresh team to build around . "

 Chris Sabin 's jaw was broken in the final round match . Sabin needed serious medical assistance afterwards backstage due to excessive bleeding from the mouth . Sabin had to cancel an August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla ( PWG ) appearance as a result . Shelley was also injured while taking part in the tournament . He suffered a legitimate back injury , but ended up appearing at the PWG show that Sabin was forced to miss . There , he aggravated the injury further , forcing him to miss two Ring of Honor shows for which he was scheduled . 
 At Unbreakable , The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) defeated the teams of Alex Shelley and Johnny Candido , America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) , and Team Canada ( A @-@ 1 and Eric Young ) to remain champions in a Four Way Elimination Tag Team match . Johnny was a replacement for Waltman who missed the event due to undisclosed reasons . Shelley began the bout alone , until Johnny , who was in attendance along with several of Candido 's family members , jumped the railing to join Shelley as his tag team partner by taking a tag from Shelley . A bit later , Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll @-@ up pin , thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest . 
 Waltman was not used again by TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15 , 2006 . There , Waltman defeated Raven in a Raven 's Rules match , forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline . Waltman was not used by the company due to management being angered by his failure to participate at Unbreakable . Despite him not showing up to the event , Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete , but did not arrive at the arena in time . 
 = Antlia = 
 Antlia ( / <unk> / ; from Ancient Greek <unk> ) is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere . Its name means " pump " in Latin ; it represents an air pump . Originally Antlia <unk> , the constellation was established by Nicolas @-@ Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century , though its name was later abbreviated by John Herschel . Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship Argo Navis , Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north . 
 Antlia is a faint constellation ; its brightest star is Alpha Antliae , an orange giant that is a suspected variable star , ranging between apparent magnitudes 4 @.@ 22 and 4 @.@ 29 . S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system , changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other . Sharing a common envelope , the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star . Two star systems with known exoplanets , HD <unk> and WASP @-@ 66 , lie within Antlia , as do NGC 2997 , a spiral galaxy , and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy . 
 = = History = = 
 The French astronomer Nicolas @-@ Louis de Lacaille first described the constellation in French as la Machine <unk> ( the Pneumatic Pump ) in 1751 – 52 , commemorating the air pump invented by the French physicist Denis Papin . De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10 @,@ 000 southern stars during a two @-@ year stay at the Cape of Good Hope , devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe . He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment . Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single @-@ cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin 's initial experiments , while German astronomer Johann Bode chose the more advanced double @-@ cylinder version . Lacaille Latinised the name to Antlia <unk> on his 1763 chart . English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844 , noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion . This was universally adopted . The International Astronomical Union adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations in 1922 . 
 Although above the horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks , Antlia 's stars were too faint to have been included in any ancient constellations . The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis , the Ship of the Argonauts , which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763 . Ridpath reports that due to their faintness , the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis . 
 = = = In non @-@ Western astronomy = = = 
 Chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes , and incorporated its stars into two different constellations . Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of " Dong 'ou " , which represented an area in southern China . Furthermore , Epsilon , Eta , and Theta Antliae were incorporated into the celestial temple , which also contained stars from modern Pyxis . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Covering 238 @.@ 9 square degrees and hence 0 @.@ 579 % of the sky , Antlia ranks 62nd of the 88 modern constellations by area . Its position in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 49 ° N. Hydra the sea snake runs along the length of its northern border , while Pyxis the compass , Vela the sails , and Centaurus the centaur line it to the west , south and east respectively . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union , is Ant . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of twelve segments ( illustrated in infobox at top @-@ right ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between <unk> <unk> and 11h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 24 @.@ 54 ° and − 40 @.@ 42 ° .

 Lacaille gave nine stars Bayer designations , labelling them Alpha through to Theta , including two stars next to each other as Zeta . Gould later added a tenth , Iota Antliae . Beta and Gamma Antliae ( now HR 4339 and HD <unk> ) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930 . Within the constellation 's borders , there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . The constellation 's two brightest stars — Alpha and Epsilon Antliae — shine with a reddish tinge . Alpha is an orange giant of spectral type Stellar classification # Class <unk> that is a suspected variable star , ranging between apparent magnitudes 4 @.@ 22 and 4 @.@ 29 . It is located 370 ± 20 light @-@ years away from Earth . Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun , it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and on its way to becoming a Mira variable star , having converted all its core fuel into carbon . Located 710 ± 40 light @-@ years from Earth , Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa , that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun , and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns . It is slightly variable . At the other end of Antlia , Iota Antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III . 
 Located near Alpha is Delta Antliae , a binary star , 430 ± 30 light @-@ years distant from Earth . The primary is a blue @-@ white main sequence star of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 5 @.@ 6 , and the secondary is a yellow @-@ white main sequence star of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 9 @.@ 6 . Zeta Antliae is a wide optical double star . The brighter star — Zeta1 Antliae — is 410 ± 40 light @-@ years distant and has a magnitude of 5 @.@ 74 , though it is a true binary star system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes 6 @.@ 20 and 7 @.@ 01 that are separated by 8 @.@ 042 arcseconds . The fainter star — Zeta2 Antliae — is 380 ± 20 light @-@ years distant and of magnitude 5 @.@ 9 . Eta Antliae is another double composed of a yellow white star of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 5 @.@ 31 , with a companion of magnitude 11 @.@ 3 . Theta Antliae is likewise double , most likely composed of an A @-@ type main sequence star and a yellow giant . S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system that varies in apparent magnitude from 6 @.@ 27 to 6 @.@ 83 over a period of 15 @.@ 6 hours . The system is classed as a W Ursae Majoris variable — the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former . Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1 @.@ 94 times and a diameter 2 @.@ 026 times that of the Sun , and the secondary has a mass 0 @.@ 76 times and a diameter 1 @.@ 322 times that of the Sun . The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material . The system is thought to be around 5 – 6 billion years old .

His sister was born in 1969 ; the family moved one year later . Ebner attended Secondary School for eight years , and his first writing experiences date back to this time ; at the age of twelve he wrote a short theater play and rehearsed it with his friends at school . However , the play was never performed . 
 In 1982 , after a one @-@ month university trip to Tours , France , Ebner began studying Romance languages , German philology , and translation at the University of Vienna . At this time he was already working for a literary circle and Viennese literature magazine . After graduation in 1988 and 1989 he concentrated on various professional careers , such as translation , foreign language teaching and IT projects . In the 1990s , Ebner published articles and books on software and networking topics ; while these books were written in German , he also wrote some articles in English . In 1999 , he spent six weeks in North Carolina , and was the co @-@ author of a book in English about PC servers . 
 In 2001 , while studying European economics at a Viennese university of applied sciences , he authored a paper about Islamism in Europe , which was published in Germany in 2001 .

Excerpts of a Catalan Diary , containing travel journals and comments on Catalan culture , were published in 1987 , and in several essays he discusses Catalan culture . 
 Increasing professional obligations after the birth of his first son in 1987 coincided with a reduction in his literary output . During the 1990s he instead focused his attention on his novel <unk> <unk> . Two early versions of this novel 's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die <unk> in 1994 ( Der Schreiber von Aram ) and 1997 ( Das Gesetz ) . These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions . The publishing list on Ebner 's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004 , but seventeen are listed from between 2005 and 2008 . 
 Ebner has additionally written narrative fiction ( novels , short stories , short prose ) , essays and poems . His poetry is written in German and Catalan .

 Ebner 's short stories in particular cover a multitude of topics , which , as critic Julia Rafael states , treat actual and socially relevant problems . She describes the stories included in the anthology Lose as " somewhat imploding " and says that " phantasms , irony and humor have their place , too " . Moreover , Ebner 's metaphors have been described as " passing beyond reality without losing ground " . According to journalist Paul C. <unk> , Ebner 's writing style is characterized by very careful and acerbic wording . Each sentence has a melody ; his short prose especially sounds lyrical . <unk> compares Ebner 's sentences to " Japanese paintings – every word has been chosen with special care " . Austrian writer and critic Wolfgang Ratz made a similar observation , drawing attention to " the <unk> of Ebner 's speech " and " his affinity with formal details " , while singling out the sarcastic stridency of the critical stories .

 In 1982 , Ebner was awarded the Youth Prize for Literature ( Großer Österreichischer Jugendpreis ) for his novella Das <unk> ( The Stigma ) , which had attracted the attention of Austrian critic and jury member Hans Weigel . Weigel compared Ebner to Austria 's 19th century novella writer Ferdinand von Saar . The novella tells the story of a young community servant who , through his service , becomes acquainted with a seemingly bewildered pensioner ; a Viennese Jew whose bewilderment is a direct consequence of his experiences in a concentration camp during the Third Reich . One year later , the novella was published in several parts in Israel 's German newspaper Israel @-@ Nachrichten . The jury of the <unk> <unk> 2005 pointed out Ebner 's precise language and his " consequent work on wording " . In 2007 , Ebner 's poem , " a <unk> and sick " , became one of the Mentioned Poems at the International Poetry Prize <unk> . The jury referred to the " metropolitan <unk> " in the poem which describes a " <unk> " whose " meal consists of loneliness " : 
 In 2008 , Ebner was awarded the Wiener Werkstattpreis for his short story " Der <unk> Last " ( " The Wings ' Burden " ) , which describes a seven @-@ year @-@ old girl who suffers from cancer . Another award @-@ winning essay , " Was blieb vom Weißen Ritter ? " ( " What Remains of the White Knight ?

 = Battle of Lone Pine = 
 The Battle of Lone Pine ( also known as the Battle of <unk> <unk> ) was fought between Australian and Ottoman Empire forces during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War , between 6 and 10 August 1915 . The battle was part of a diversionary attack to draw Ottoman attention away from the main assaults against Sari Bair , Chunuk Bair and Hill 971 , which became known as the August Offensive . The Australians , initially at brigade strength , managed to capture the main Ottoman trench line from the battalion that was defending the position in the first few hours of the fighting ; however , the fighting continued for the next three days as the Ottomans brought up reinforcements and launched numerous counterattacks in an attempt to recapture the ground they had lost . As the counterattacks intensified the Australians brought up two fresh battalions . Finally , on 9 August the Ottomans called off any further attempts and by 10 August offensive action ceased , leaving the Australians in control of the position . Nevertheless , despite the Australian victory , the wider August Offensive of which the attack had been a part failed and a situation of stalemate developed around Lone Pine which lasted until the end of the campaign in December 1915 when Allied troops were evacuated from the peninsula .

 The Lone Pine battlefield , named for a solitary Turkish pine that stood there at the start of the fighting , was situated near the centre of the eastern line of the Australian and New Zealand trenches around Anzac Cove on a rise known as " 400 Plateau " that joined " Bolton 's Ridge " to the south with the ridge along the east side of " Monash Valley " to the north . Being towards the southern end of the area around Anzac Cove , the terrain in the Lone Pine region was comparatively gentle and the opposing trenches were separated some distance with a flat no @-@ man 's land intervening . Due to its location relative to the beachhead and the shape of the intervening ground , Lone Pine 's importance lay in the fact that its position provided a commanding view of the Australian and New Zealand rear areas . From the 400 Plateau it was possible to observe as far south as Gaba Tepe and its possession would have afforded the Ottomans the ability to place the approaches to the Second Ridge under fire , preventing the flow of reinforcements and supplies from the beachhead to the forward trenches . 
 The main part of the Australian position at Lone Pine was centred around a feature known as " The Pimple " , where a salient had developed at the point where the Australians ' position was closest to the Ottoman line . To the east of the salient , opposite The Pimple , the Ottoman line extended from the head of a gully — known as " Owen 's Gulley " by the Australians — south for 400 yards ( 370 m ) towards the neck of Bolton 's Ridge and continued south along a spur called " Sniper 's Ridge " . Because of the salient around The Pimple , the Ottomans had focused on developing the trenches along the flanks of the position more than the centre , and had placed the firing positions in the centre in depth in order to gain the advantage of being able to pour enfilade fire upon any attacking force . At the rear of the Ottoman line , near Owen 's Gully , was a depression called " The Cup " that was not visible from the Australians ' position on The Pimple . Despite overflights of the area by British reconnaissance aircraft in June , the Australians were unaware of The Cup 's existence , and at the time of the attack they believed this area to be flat and to consist of further trench lines . In reality it was actually a reserve area where the Ottomans had established a regimental headquarters and sited a series of bivouacs in terraces and at the time of the attack there were large numbers of reinforcements camped there .

 Prior to the battle , isolated fighting around Lone Pine had begun early in the Gallipoli campaign . At around 7 : 00 a.m. on the first day of the Australian and New Zealand landings at Anzac Cove , 25 April 1915 , elements of the Australian force had pushed through to Lone Pine in an effort to destroy an Ottoman artillery battery that had been firing down upon the landing beach . Before the Australians could engage the battery , the Ottomans had withdrawn to a ridge to the south @-@ west , which the Australians later dubbed " Third Ridge " ( or " Gun Ridge " ) . Pressing further inland , troops from the 6th Battalion had attempted to reach the ridge , crossing a wide valley ( later known as " Legge Valley " ) , but they were pushed back when an Ottoman regiment , the 27th , had launched a counterattack from the south @-@ east towards Lone Pine at 10 : 00 a.m. , with the objective of retaking the 400 Plateau . Rolling up the 6th Battalion , the Ottomans pushed the Australians back to Pine Ridge , a finger of land that jutted south from Lone Pine towards Gaba <unk> . Taking heavy casualties , the Australians withdrew north to Lone Pine , where they were able to establish a defensive position . As reinforcements were brought up from New Zealand units , in the afternoon a second Ottoman regiment , the 77th , arrived and heavy hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting ensued before the counterattack was blunted . Further fighting around Lone Pine continued throughout the early stages of the campaign , but eventually a stalemate developed in which neither side was able to advance and static trench warfare began . 
 In early July 1915 , while making plans for an offensive to break the deadlock that had developed around the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landings in April , the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps , Lieutenant General William Birdwood , had determined that an attack at Lone Pine could be used to divert Ottoman attention away from a main attack that would be launched further north around Sari Bair , Chunuk Bair and Hill 971 . The Australian 1st Infantry Brigade was chosen to undertake the attack , and consisted of about 3 @,@ 000 men , under the command of Colonel Nevill Smyth . Along with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades , the 1st Infantry Brigade was part of the Australian 1st Division . The division 's commander was Brigadier General Harold Walker , a British officer who had replaced Major General William Bridges as temporary commander after Bridges had been killed by a sniper in May . Walker did not like the idea of launching an attack at Lone Pine , let alone a mere diversion , but when General Sir Ian Hamilton , the British commander , insisted the attack proceed , through thorough planning , Walker endeavoured to give his troops the best chance of success possible on such an unfavourable battleground . 
 The Ottoman forces opposing the Australians at Lone Pine consisted of two battalions from the 47th Regiment , under the command of Tevfik Bey . These battalions amounted to a total of about 1 @,@ 000 men , of which 500 were positioned in the trenches along the front , while another 500 were positioned further back in depth . Sitting further back in divisional reserve , to the north @-@ east on " Mortar Ridge " , was a battalion from the 57th Regiment , which had been relieved from its position on the front line north of Lone Pine by an Arab battalion of the 72nd Regiment . The positions north and south of the Ottoman line at Lone Pine were held by the 125th Regiment at Johnston 's Jolly in the north and the 48th Regiment in the south along Pine Ridge .

 = = = Preparation = = = 
 The width of the front of the attack was 160 yards ( 150 m ) and the distance between the two trench lines was about 60 – 100 yards ( 55 – 91 m ) . To reduce the distance to be crossed , the Australians projected a number of tunnels towards the Ottoman trenches from The Pimple . Immediately after the attack , one of these tunnels was to be opened along its length to make a communications trench through which reinforcements could advance without having to cross the exposed ground . Some of the attackers would have to make the advance over open ground from the Australian trench line . To provide some measure of protection for these men , three mines were set by engineers to make craters in which they could seek shelter . The preliminary bombardment was stretched over three days — initially confined to a limited " slow shoot " , building up to a final intense bombardment an hour before the assault — and was successful in cutting much of the barbed wire that the Ottomans had placed in front of their position . The preparation stage of the attack began at 2 : 00 p.m. on 6 August , when the Australians detonated the three mines they had dug in front of the Ottoman lines , in an attempt to create cover for the advancing troops . Two and a half hours later the final heavy preliminary bombardment commenced , with Australian , British and New Zealand artillery batteries firing on the Ottoman trench line , while naval gunfire support from the British cruiser HMS Bacchante provided counter @-@ battery fire on Ottoman artillery positioned along Third Ridge . Retreating into tunnels which had been cut as part of mining operations , the majority of the forward Ottoman troops were able to find shelter from the bombardment that lasted for an hour . 
 While the artillery prepared the ground for the attack , behind the Australian lines the assault formations moved up towards The Pimple . Smyth sited his brigade headquarters at a position called " Brown 's Dip " , which was about 200 metres ( 220 yd ) south of the firing line . Due to the small front along which the attack was to be launched , the initial assault was to be undertaken in three waves by the 2nd , 3rd and 4th Battalions while the 1st Battalion was to remain back at Brown 's Dip in reserve , ready to be brought up to consolidate any gains or respond in the event of a counterattack . Once the 1st Battalion had taken up its position , the assault battalions moved through them towards the forward line at The Pimple . Once the attack was launched , half the force would go via tunnels that had been dug out into no man 's land , while the other half would simply go " over the top " . By 5 : 00 p.m. all the troops had taken up their positions and as the barrage came to a conclusion , the tunnels were opened and final preparations were made . 
 Each soldier in the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of ammunition for his rifle , along with rations for one day , and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask . The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition , but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack . In support , each battalion had four Vickers medium machine @-@ guns , which had been issued with 3 @,@ 500 rounds , and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1 @,@ 200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack . A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions . 
 = = = Initial assault = = = 
 At 5 : 30 p.m. the Australian 1st Infantry Brigade attacked as the first wave of 1 @,@ 800 men threw themselves forward . To their north , the troops of the 2nd Infantry Brigade laid down suppressing fire on the supporting Ottoman troops at Johnston 's Jolly , while the 3rd Infantry and 2nd Light Horse Brigades held the line opposite Sniper 's Ridge . Half the force went via the prepared tunnels and half crossed the exposed ground between the trench lines . Dubbed the " Daisy Patch " , it amounted to a distance of about 100 metres ( 110 yd ) and it was raked with Ottoman artillery and small arms fire . From his headquarters overlooking the fighting , the senior Ottoman commander <unk> Pasa , began to co @-@ ordinate the response , passing orders for reinforcements to be brought up and calling down artillery . Casualties among the first wave of attackers were " relatively light " as the defenders in the front line of Ottoman trenches were still sheltering from the preliminary bombardment and had not had time to return to their fire steps after it had been lifted . 
 When the Australians reached the Ottoman trenches they found them roofed with pine logs with no easy entrance , which had not been identified by aerial reconnaissance during the planning stages . As the Ottoman defenders recovered from the artillery barrage , they began firing at the Australians through specially cut holes at point blank range . As the second and third waves of the attack came up , some of the Australians fired , <unk> and bayoneted from above , while some found their way inside through gaps or by lifting the logs , which were in places as thick as 4 inches ( 10 cm ) by 9 inches ( 23 cm ) . Others ran on past to the open communications and support trenches behind , where they were able to gain access to the trenches ; about 70 Ottoman troops were captured as they attempted to escape and ran into the Australians entering the trenches . Small groups of Australians managed to push through to The Cup where they were stopped by Ottoman troops who were hastily assembled to defend their regimental headquarters . In the ensuing fighting there , almost all of the Australians were killed , while a handful were taken prisoner . 
 In the Ottoman trenches , the darkness and cramped conditions led to considerable confusion amongst the attackers . Due to concerns of shooting their comrades , the Australians were unable to fire their rifles initially , and the fighting devolved into a melee as the soldiers attacked each other with bayonets and grenades . The first Australians to enter the position were picked off by the defenders , but as the Australians established themselves in strength , they were able to break into the position before the defenders that had been sheltering in the tunnels behind the front line were able to fully respond . Over the space of half an hour the Australians took control of the position and , after ejecting the remaining Ottomans from the main trench , they established a number of defensive positions along the line . These amounted to positions in the communication trenches on the flanks of the captured ground and about seven or eight posts in the centre that were " isolated " but connected by hastily dug saps . 
 For the Australians , the attack had been successful , as they had gained possession of the main Ottoman line , and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains . Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet , they settled down to wait for the first counterattack . As they did so , the brigade reserve — the 1st Battalion — was brought up . Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack , the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions ; despite being behind the recently captured position , the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine @-@ gun fire , which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks . Nevertheless , in company lots , the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions , while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line . 
 = = = Ottoman counterattacks = = = 
 Shortly after dark , around 7 : 00 p.m. , the first Ottoman counterattack came after a group from the 1st Battalion , 57th Regiment , under Major <unk> Bey , arrived to reinforce the battalions of the 47th . Attacking with hand grenades , the fighting took place in the complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system . The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding . The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines . They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could , often with the bodies of the dead , to thwart raids . Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps , and where possible the wounded were evacuated , however , the fighting was so intense , the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie at the bottom of the trench . 
 Throughout the night of 6 / 7 August , the Ottomans brought up reinforcements from the 5th Division 's 13th Regiment under Ali Riza Bey , which marched from <unk> , south @-@ east of the position known to the Australians as " Scrubby Knoll " . The 9th Division , under German Colonel Hans Kannengiesser , also received orders to begin moving towards Lone Pine from its position between Helles and Anzac from <unk> Pasa . Although the 9th Division was later diverted , after 8 : 00 p.m. the 15th Regiment , from the 5th Division , under the command of Ibrahim <unk> , was committed to the fighting , moving south from its position around the Kurt Dere , near Chunuk Blair . 
 For the next three days the Ottomans continued to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost . In total three regiments were dispatched . The Australians also brought up reinforcements , moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades — the 7th and 12th Battalions — to hold the 1st Brigade 's gains . Throughout 7 August , the fighting devolved into a series of hand grenade duels . To keep up the supply , Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins : over 1 @,@ 000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August . The fighting continued throughout the night of 7 / 8 August as the 47th Regiment , launched a determined counterattack ; suffering heavy casualties , including the regimental commander , Tewfik Bey , the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front @-@ line trenches , but succeeded in regaining some of the ground in the north and also pushed the Australians back a little way from The Cup . 
 As Ali Riza Bey , the commander of the 13th Regiment , took charge of the Ottoman effort around Lone Pine , the <unk> continued into the next day as the Ottomans began to prepare for a large @-@ scale counterattack . Throughout the morning the remaining Australian positions overlooking The Cup were abandoned before the fighting stopped briefly as both the Australians and Ottomans evacuated their wounded and removed the dead from the front @-@ line . By this time the 1st and 2nd Battalions , which had been defending the heavily counterattacked southern flank , had suffered so many casualties that they were withdrawn from the line , with the 7th Battalion moving into their positions late in the afternoon . The 3rd , 4th and 12th Battalions remained holding the north and centre of the Australian line . 
 Further attacks were mounted by the Ottomans all along the Australian line after 3 : 00 p.m. , but after dark they focused their efforts on the 7th Battalion 's position in the south ; there the Ottomans succeeded in taking part of the Australian line late in the night , and fierce hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting followed until early in the morning of 9 August as the Australians retook these positions . More grenade attacks were launched by Ottoman troops later that morning and as the Australian trenches were brought under fire from the Ottoman positions around Johnston 's Jolly , an attack was launched at the junctions between the Australian battalions . Achieving a break @-@ in in the centre , they reached the 1st Infantry Brigade 's headquarters — which had advanced forward from Brown 's Dip following the initial gains — where the brigade commander , Smyth , joined the defence that eventually drove them back . Around midday the Ottomans put in another attack , but this too was repulsed . The positions on the southern Australian flank continued to be subjected to <unk> , so the 5th Battalion was brought up to relieve the 7th . The 2nd Battalion , having received a brief respite , also came forward , replacing the 4th Battalion with the support of a dismounted squadron from the 7th Light Horse Regiment . As the fresh units settled in , the Australians prepared for renewed fighting along the line . In the end , the expected attack never came and finally , late in the afternoon of 9 August , the Ottoman commanders called off further attempts to dislodge the Australians . The next day , the fighting " subsided " as both the Ottomans and the Australians worked to consolidate their positions . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The fighting was " some of the fiercest " the Australians experienced during the campaign to that point . The ground captured during the battle amounted to a total of about 150 metres ( 160 yd ) across a 300 @-@ metre ( 330 yd ) front . Amidst scenes of considerable devastation , the Australian divisional commander , Walker , believed the result " disastrous " . The higher commanders believed it to have been a tactical success , however , with Hamilton describing it as a " desperate fine feat " . Though a tactical victory for the Australians in terms of the fact that they remained in possession of the ground captured , and had managed to draw off some Ottoman reinforcements , nevertheless the wider repercussions of the attack at Lone Pine weighed heavily on the outcome at Chunuk Bair . Sent north to reinforce Lone Pine , due to the effectiveness of the Australian attack , Kannengiesser 's 9th Division was directed instead to proceed on to Chunuk Bair where , at the time , there was only one Ottoman artillery battery and a covering force of 20 infantrymen . His force arrived in time to seriously delay the New Zealand attack , and ultimately the wider offensive of which the battle was a part failed . Afterwards , a stalemate situation developed on the Gallipoli peninsula although there were brief periods of localised fighting . In September , the troops of the Australian 1st Division who had taken the position at Lone Pine were relieved by the 23rd and 24th Battalions . 
 Dominated by the heights of Baby 700 , the position was regularly shelled and was subsequently described by one Australian soldier , Trooper Ion Idriess , as " the most dangerous spot " in the Australian lodgement and it ultimately proved a " liability " for the troops tasked with holding it . Opposed by troops from the Ottoman 47th Regiment , for the remaining three months of the campaign , the two Australian battalions would alternate their positions in the front line as the Ottoman and Australians engaged in mining and <unk> operations against each other 's positions . The stalemate continued as both the Australians and Ottomans lacked the strength to mount a determined attack and this situation ultimately lasted until the Allied evacuation in December 1915 . 
 In most sources , Ottoman losses are estimated at between 5 @,@ 000 – 6 @,@ 000 , although Kenan Celik from Çanakkale <unk> Mart University , has placed their losses as high as 7 @,@ 164 , broken down as 1 @,@ 520 killed , 4 @,@ 700 wounded , 760 listed as missing and 134 captured by the Australians . These included the commanding officers of both the 47th and 15th Regiments . Of the Australian force that had launched the attack , almost half became casualties . Australian losses during the battle amounted to 2 @,@ 277 men killed or wounded , out of the total 4 @,@ 600 men committed to the fighting over the course of the battle . These represent some of the highest casualties of the campaign . The toll was particularly heavy amongst the Australian officers ; both the commanding officers of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were killed leading their troops . After the battle , the dead were so thick on the ground that one Australian , Captain Harold Jacobs of the 1st Battalion , remarked " [ t ] he trench is so full of our dead that the only respect that we could show them was not to tread on their faces , the floor of the trench was just one carpet of them , this in addition to the ones we piled into Turkish dugouts . " Later , over 1 @,@ 000 dead were removed from Australian position to be hastily buried . 
 Seven Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the fighting at Lone Pine , including four men from the 7th Battalion , which had been rushed forward to help relieve the 1st Brigade at the height of the Ottoman counterattacks . One of the recipients was Corporal William Dunstan , who after the war became the general manager of The Herald newspaper in Melbourne . Another VC recipient was Captain Alfred Shout who had already earned the Military Cross and been Mentioned in Despatches earlier in the Gallipoli campaign . He was mortally wounded at Lone Pine and was later buried at sea . The other VC recipients were Privates Leonard <unk> and John Hamilton , Corporal Alexander Burton and Lieutenants Frederick Tubb and William Symons . 
 After the war , an Australian military historical mission was sent to Gallipoli , led by Charles Bean . On Bean 's advice the Australian government sought permission from the newly formed Turkish Republic to establish an official war cemetery in the area . In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified , and through its provisions the Lone Pine cemetery was established in the area , dubbed the Daisy Patch by the Australians . There are a total of 1 @,@ 167 graves in the cemetery and as of 2012 , the identities of 471 bodies interred in the cemetery remain unknown . Also standing within the cemetery 's grounds is the Lone Pine memorial . It is the main Australian and New Zealand memorial at Gallipoli and commemorates all the Australian and some of the New Zealanders who died during the campaign , including those who have no known grave and those buried at sea . 
 As a result of the battle 's significance to the Australians , Lone Pine is the site of the annual Australian Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli . After the service Australian visitors congregate at the memorial to remember all their countrymen who fought and died at Gallipoli . At the New Zealand National World War I Museum , there is an exhibit for the Battle of Lone Pine , and there is also one in the Australian War Memorial . Memorial " Lone Pine " trees have also been planted in Australia , New Zealand and Gallipoli to commemorate the battle and the Gallipoli campaign in general , seeded from specimens taken from Gallipoli . There are also many places in Australia named after the battle . 
 = Pacific electric ray = 
 Tetronarce californica also known as the Pacific electric ray is a species of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae , endemic to the coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California to British Columbia . It generally inhabits sandy flats , rocky reefs , and kelp forests from the surface to a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) , but has also been known to make forays into the open ocean . Measuring up to 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) long , this species has smooth @-@ rimmed spiracles ( paired respiratory openings behind the eyes ) and a dark gray , slate , or brown dorsal coloration , sometimes with dark spots . Its body form is typical of the genus , with a rounded pectoral fin disc wider than long and a thick tail bearing two dorsal fins of unequal size and a well @-@ developed caudal fin . 
 Solitary and nocturnal , the Pacific electric ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity for the purposes of subduing prey or self @-@ defense . It feeds mainly on bony fishes , ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night . Reproduction is aplacental viviparous , meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk , later supplemented by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . Females bear litters of 17 – 20 pups , probably once every other year . Care should be exercised around the Pacific electric ray , as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver . It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species under Least Concern , as it is not fished in any significant numbers . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Pacific electric ray was described by American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres , the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences , who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science . Ayers published his account in 1855 , in the inaugural volume of the Academy 's Proceedings ; no type specimens were designated . In 1861 , Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce , on the basis of its smooth @-@ rimmed spiracles . Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of Torpedo . Closely similar electric rays found off Peru , Chile , and Japan may be the same as this species . Other common names used for this ray include California torpedo ray , Pacific torpedo , or simply electric ray or torpedo ray . This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The only electric ray found off western North America , the Pacific electric ray occurs as far south as Sebastian Vizcaino Bay in Baja California , and as far north as the Dixon Entrance in northern British Columbia . It is most common south of Point Conception , California , with the rays north of the Point perhaps representing one or more separate populations . 
 Off California , the Pacific electric ray is generally encountered at a depth of 3 – 30 m ( 10 – 100 ft ) , while off Baja California it is typically observed at a depth of 100 – 200 m ( 330 – 660 ft ) . It has been reported from as deep as 425 m ( 1 @,@ 394 ft ) . This species prefers temperatures of 10 – 13 ° C ( 50 – 55 ° F ) . It frequents sandy flats , rocky reefs , and kelp forests . However , one individual has been videotaped 17 km ( 11 mi ) west of Point Pinos , Monterey County , California , swimming 10 m ( 33 ft ) below the surface in water 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) deep ; this and other observations suggest that this species makes periodic excursions away from shallow coastal habitats into the epipelagic zone . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Pacific electric ray has a soft , flabby body devoid of dermal denticles . It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1 @.@ 2 times as wide as long , with a nearly straight front margin and a pair of kidney @-@ shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin . The eyes are small and followed by smooth @-@ rimmed spiracles ; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1 @.@ 8 times the distance between the spiracles . There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth , which is arched with deep furrows at the corners . The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width , and three times that of the distance between the nostrils . There are 25 – 28 upper tooth rows and 19 – 26 lower tooth rows ; each tooth is tiny and smooth , with a single sharp cusp . 
 Two dorsal fins are present , with the first more than twice the size of the second and positioned opposite the large pelvic fins . The tail is short and stocky , terminating in a large , triangular caudal fin with a nearly straight trailing margin . This ray is dark gray , slate , or brown above , sometimes with small darker spots that increase in number with age ; the underside is white . Males attain a maximum known length of 0 @.@ 9 m ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) , and females 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) . The maximum recorded weight is 41 kg ( 90 lb ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 With a sizable oily liver and low @-@ density tissues , the Pacific electric ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover in the water column with very little effort . <unk> power is provided by the muscular tail , while the disc is held rigid . Telemetry studies have shown that this species swims primarily at night , when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief , and spends most of the day in nearby open areas buried in sediment . It is nomadic and solitary , though several individuals may rest within the same area . 
 Like other members of its family , the Pacific electric ray produces powerful electric shocks for attack and defense . Its paired electric organs are derived from muscle and comprise approximately 15 % of its total weight , consisting of many thousands of jelly @-@ filled " electric plates " stacked hundreds @-@ high into vertical hexagonal columns . These columns function essentially like batteries connected in parallel ; a large adult ray can generate some 45 volts of electricity with a power output of one kilowatt , due to low internal resistance . The electric organs discharge direct current in pulses , each lasting 4 – 5 ms . When attacking prey , in the first few moments the ray normally produces pulses at a rate of 150 – 200 per second , slowing down over time . Over a thousand pulses may be produced in all , depending on how long it takes for the prey to be subdued . The pulse rate increases with water temperature . 
 Because of its large size and formidable defenses , The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals . There is a record of one being fed upon by a killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) off Santa Catalina Island . The Cooper 's nutmeg ( <unk> cooperi ) is a specialized parasite of this ray , and possibly other bottom @-@ dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark ( Squatina californica ) . The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray 's surface mucus ; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood . Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius <unk> , the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi , and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium <unk> . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Pacific electric ray feeds mainly on bony fishes , including anchovies , herring , hake , mackerel , croakers , rockfishes , <unk> , kelp bass , and flatfishes , but will also take cephalopods and invertebrates given the opportunity . Its jaws are highly distensible , allowing it to swallow surprisingly large prey : one female 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) long has been observed ingesting a silver salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) nearly half her length . During the day , the Pacific electric ray is an ambush predator : when a fish approaches its head , the ray " jumps " forward from its resting place and folds down its disc to envelop it , while delivering strong shocks . Once the fish is subdued , the ray repositions itself to swallow it head @-@ first . The entire process takes about two minutes . 
 At night , when many diurnal fishes descend from the water column and become inactive a short distance above the bottom , the Pacific electric ray switches to an active hunting strategy . It stalks fish by slowly swimming or simply drifting through the water ; when it closes to 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of the prey , it lunges forward and again envelops the prey within its disc while delivering shocks . To better secure the fish within its disc , the ray will make short kicks with its tail that sometimes send it into barrel rolls or somersaults . Finally , the stunned prey is maneuvered to the mouth with ripples of the disc . In one recorded case , a 75 cm ( 30 in ) long female captured and consumed a 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) long jack mackerel ( <unk> <unk> ) in under ten seconds . Nighttime seine net sampling at the surface of Monterey Bay has captured Pacific electric rays in surprising numbers , suggesting that they rise upward from the bottom to feed on small fishes . 
 Though the Pacific electric ray will feed at any hour , it responds to prey much more quickly at night than during the day . Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions , when its eyes are largely useless . Instead , it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food . Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes . Mechanical sensory cues , detected via the lateral line , also play an important role : this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster @-@ moving prey even if a closer food item was available . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The Pacific electric ray exhibits aplacental viviparity , with the developing embryos at first receiving nourishment from yolk , and later from histotroph ( " uterine milk " , enriched with proteins , fat , and mucus ) produced by the mother and delivered through specialized outgrowths of the uterine lining . Mature females have two functional ovaries and uteruses . Reproduction occurs year @-@ round , with males apparently capable of mating every year and females every other year . The gestation period is unknown . Reported litter sizes range from 17 to 20 ; at least the number of ova , and perhaps also the number of young , increases with the size of the female . 
 The newborns measure 18 – 23 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) long and double their size in the first year of life , adding around 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) to their length . Male grow faster than females but reach a smaller ultimate size . Sexual maturity is attained at a length of 65 cm ( 26 in ) and age of seven years for males , and a length of 73 cm ( 29 in ) and age of nine years for females . The oldest documented individuals are 16 years of age , and extrapolating from growth curves the maximum lifespan of this species may be upwards of 24 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The shock generated by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human . It should be treated with caution , especially at night when it is active , and has been known to charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed . It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities , but may have been involved in several unexplained , fatal diving accidents . This species fares poorly in captivity , as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium . Since 2000 , the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food . 
 The Pacific electric ray and its relatives are used as model organisms for biomedical research , because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase . In the 1970s and 1980s , acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled electric ray ( T. marmorata ) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced , in what is considered to be a landmark success in the field of neurobiology . This led to a number of further advances , one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis . A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes ; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers . Otherwise , this ray has no economic value . It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries , and on hook @-@ and @-@ line by sport anglers . These activities appear to have little impact on its population , leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council . 
 = Togo women 's national football team = 
 The Togo women 's national football team is a FIFA @-@ recognised team that represents Togo in international football competition . Togo have played five FIFA @-@ recognised matches , all in 2006 , and are currently unranked . They have not competed in major regional and international tournaments . While the country has under @-@ 17 and under @-@ 20 national sides , further development of the team and the sport in Togo faces challenges common to African countries , as well as country @-@ specific problems such as the sport 's lack of domestic popularity . 
 = = Team = = 
 In 1985 , few countries had women 's national football teams . While the sport 's popularity grew worldwide in the ensuing years , Togo did not compete in their first FIFA @-@ sanctioned match until 2006 , when they played five games . In their first game , on 19 February , Togo beat São Tomé and Príncipe 3 – 0 . The team beat São Tomé and Príncipe again by a score of 6 – 0 on 26 February 2006 in Togo . In its next three games , Togo lost 0 – 9 to Congo , 1 – 3 to Congo and 2 – 5 to Mali . Togo tied the following game 3 – 3 against Côte d 'Ivoire in Dakar . Togo then beat Guinea 4 – 1 on 21 May 2006 . Togo has since played just one match . In 2007 , the team competed at the Tournoi de Cinq Nations held in Ouagadougou . There , Togo lost 0 – 5 to Côte d 'Ivoire before being disqualified for bringing a club team , MBA Lomé , to the competition in violation of tournament rules . 
 Togo has not participated in most regional and international competitions , including the Women 's World Cup , the 2010 African Women 's Championship , and the 2011 All @-@ Africa Games . The team was expected to participate in the 2010 African Women 's Championships and were scheduled to play against Mali but withdrew before the competition started . As of March 2012 , the team was not ranked by FIFA . 
 The country has a national under @-@ 17 side and an under @-@ 20 side . The Togo women 's national under @-@ 17 football team was active by 2010 , when they competed in the African Women 's U @-@ 17 Qualifying Tournament . Togo moved past the preliminary round after their opponents , Sierra Leone , withdrew from the tournament . In the first round , Togo was set to play Nigeria but withdrew from the competition . The Togo women 's national under @-@ 20 football team was also active by 2010 , when they competed in the African Women 's U @-@ 20 World Cup qualifying . In the first round , they had a walkover win against the Sierra Leone , but did not participate in rounds two or three . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 The development of women 's football in Africa faces several challenges , including limited access to education , poverty amongst women , inequalities and human rights abuses targeting women . Funding also in an impediment . Most support for women 's football in Africa comes from FIFA rather than national football associations . Many quality female footballers leave the continent seeking greater opportunity in northern Europe or the United States . 
 The national football association , the Fédération <unk> de Football , was founded in 1960 and became affiliated with FIFA in 1964 . The organisation has fifteen staff members focusing on women 's football . Football is the fourth @-@ most @-@ popular women 's sport in Togo , trailing basketball , handball and volleyball . Football 's popularity is growing , however . The country had 380 registered players in 2006 , up from 180 in 2000 . Women 's football was first organised in the country in 2000 . By 2006 , there were 105 football clubs in Togo , 11 of which were for women only . A national women 's competition was created by 2006 and was still operating in 2009 . While there are no school , university or regional competitions for women 's football , there was an active under @-@ 17 women 's league in 2009 . In 2010 , a women 's football competition involving 50 women 's teams was organised by the German embassy , which provided teams with football kits and footballs . 
 = T206 Honus Wagner = 
 The T206 Honus Wagner baseball card depicts the Pittsburgh Pirates ' Honus Wagner , a dead @-@ ball era baseball player who is widely considered to be one of the best players of all time . The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company ( ATC ) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series . Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue , either because he did not want children to buy cigarette packs to get his card , or because he wanted more compensation from the ATC . The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public ( exact number unknown ) , as compared to the " tens or hundreds of thousands " of T206 cards , over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes , for any other player . In 1933 , the card was first listed at a price value of US $ 50 in Jefferson Burdick 's The American Card Catalog , making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time . 
 The most famous T206 Honus Wagner is the " Gretzky T206 Honus Wagner " card . The card 's odd texture and shape led to speculation that it was altered . The Gretzky T206 Wagner was first sold by Alan Ray to a baseball memorabilia collector named Bill Mastro , who sold the card two years later to Jim Copeland for nearly four times the price he had originally paid . Copeland 's sizable transaction revitalized interest in the sports memorabilia collection market . In 1991 , Copeland sold the card to ice hockey figures Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall for $ 451 @,@ 000 . Gretzky resold the card four years later to Wal @-@ Mart and Treat Entertainment for $ 500 @,@ 000 for use as the top prize in a promotional contest . 
 The next year , a Florida postal worker won the card and auctioned it at Christie 's for $ 640 @,@ 000 to collector Michael Gidwitz . In 2000 , the card was sold via Robert Edward Auctions to card collector Brian Seigel for $ 1 @.@ 27 million . In February 2007 , Seigel sold the card privately to an anonymous collector for $ 2 @.@ 35 million . Less than six months later , the card was sold to another anonymous collector for $ 2 @.@ 8 million . In April 2011 , that anonymous purchaser was revealed to be Ken Kendrick , owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks . These transactions have made the Wagner card the most valuable baseball card in history . 
 In October 2013 , Bill Mastro pleaded guilty to mail fraud in U.S District Court — and admitted in the process that he had trimmed the Wagner card to sharply increase its value . 
 Other T206 Wagners , both legitimate and fake , have surfaced in recent years . Some of the real cards have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars in auctions . One particular T206 Honus Wagner owned by John Cobb and Ray Edwards has attracted media controversy over its authenticity , with many leading hobby experts regarding it as a fake . 
 = = Background = = 
 The American Tobacco Company was formed as a result of an 1889 merger of five major cigarette manufacturers : W. Duke & Sons & Company , Allen & Ginter , Goodwin & Company , F. S. Kinney Company and William S. Kimball & Company . Because the company came to monopolize the tobacco industry , ATC did not have to conduct advertising or promotions for its products . Since baseball cards were primarily used as a sales promotion , ATC removed them from its tobacco packs , almost driving the cards into obsolescence . During the presidency of " trust @-@ buster " Theodore Roosevelt , the ATC was subjected to legal action from the government , in hopes of shutting down the monopoly in the industry . 
 Thereafter , the ATC was back in competition with other tobacco companies , so it reinserted baseball cards into cigarette packs . In 1909 , the company introduced the T206 series – also known as the " white border set " – of baseball cards of 524 players into its cigarette packs . The cards were printed at seven factories in New York , North Carolina , Ohio and Virginia . Two years later , the ATC was broken up into several major companies as part of the United States Supreme Court ruling in United States v. American Tobacco Company , 221 U.S. 106 ( 1911 ) . 
 = = Physical attributes and production = = 
 The typical card in the T206 series had a width of 1 7 ⁄ 16 inches ( 3 @.@ 65 cm ) and a height of 2 5 ⁄ 8 inches ( 6 @.@ 67 cm ) . Some cards were awkwardly shaped or irregularly sized , which prompted a belief that many of the cards in the series had been altered at one point or another . In his work Inside T206 : A Collector Guide to the Classic Baseball Card Set , Scot A. Reader wrote that " [ i ] t is not at all uncommon to find T206 examples that have been altered at some point during their near @-@ century of existence . " These discrepancies were taken advantage of by " card doctors " who trimmed corners and dirty edges to improve the appearance of the card . The front of all T206 series cards , including the Wagner card , displayed a lithograph of the player created by a multi @-@ stage printing process in which a number of colors were printed on top of each other to create a lithograph with the appropriate design . The backs of the cards featured the monochromatic colors of the 16 tobacco brands for which the cards were printed . The Wagner cards in particular advertised the Piedmont and Sweet <unk> brands of cigarettes and were produced at Factory 25 in Virginia , as indicated by the factory stamp imprinted on the back of the cards . 
 = = Wagner 's involvement = = 
 Starting from January 1909 , the ATC sought authorization from baseball players for inclusion in the T206 series , which would feature 524 major league players , 76 of whom would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame . Wagner had been at the top of his game throughout the decade , and was even considered to be the game 's greatest player at the time . He had appeared on advertisements for a number of other products such as chewing gum , gunpowder and soft drinks . Unsurprisingly , the ATC asked for Wagner 's permission to have his picture on a baseball card . According to an October 12 , 1912 , issue of The Sporting News , Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card . In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber , a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner 's permission , Wagner wrote that he " did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes . " He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card . 
 The reasons for Wagner 's strong negative reaction to the ATC 's request have been the subject of much speculation . The most commonly told account is that Wagner rejected the deal because he did not want young baseball fans to purchase the tobacco packs for his baseball card . Wagner held high respect for many of his fans , most particularly his young fans . His granddaughter , Blair , remarked that " [ h ] e loved children . He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship . When it came time for that card to come out , it wasn 't that he wasn 't paid . He didn 't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card . " However , Wagner chewed tobacco , and he had previously appeared in advertisements for many tobacco products , including a cigar baseball trading card in 1899 and a newspaper ad for Murad cigarettes during the 1909 World Series . 
 Another explanation surmised is that Wagner did not consent because he felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card . Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator ; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907 , but returned shortly before the start of the 1908 baseball season after receiving a $ 10 @,@ 000 contract , double his salary from the 1907 season . This theory has its flaws , however , since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $ 10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create his baseball card . Michael O 'Keeffe and Teri Thompson , authors of The Card : Collectors , Con Men , and the True Story of History 's Most Desired Baseball Card , asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $ 10 , a substantial amount of money at the time ( approximately equal to $ 275 in 2016 ) , if he refused authorization for monetary reasons . The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards ; the exact number is unknown , but is speculated to be between 50 and 200 . They stopped production of the card , however , after Wagner denied authorization . 
 = = Gretzky T206 Honus Wagner = = 
 In 1991 , National Hockey League player Wayne Gretzky purchased a mint condition 1909 T206 Honus Wagner baseball card , with a Piedmont cigarette brand back , at a Sotheby 's auction . The card became known as the " Gretzky T206 Wagner " to the public . The Professional Sports Authenticator ( PSA ) company graded this card a PSA 8 Near Mint @-@ Mint ( NM @-@ MT ) on their 10 @-@ point scale , the highest grade given to a T206 Honus Wagner card . Bill Hughes was the official grader of the card , working for PSA at the time . Hughes admitted to knowing that the card had been altered when he graded it . 
 The Gretzky T206 Wagner first came to attention in 1985 , when small @-@ time <unk> , New York card collector Alan Ray contacted Bob <unk> , the owner of a Long Island sports memorabilia store , to arrange a potential $ 25 @,@ 000 deal for his T206 Honus Wagner card . Bill Mastro , a sports memorabilia dealer who later founded Mastro Auctions and became one of the most powerful figures in the industry , heard the news , and immediately jumped on the offer . Mastro , with the financial backing of friend Rob Lifson , sought to improve the offer and had Ray add 50 to 75 of his other T206 series cards , including the rare T206 Eddie Plank , into the deal . Ray , who later stated he " had a money situation " , agreed to Mastro 's terms of the deal . 
 The circumstances regarding how Ray came in possession of Gretzky T206 Wagner have been shrouded in mystery . He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but , in a 2001 interview , claimed to have received it from a relative , whose name he did not disclose . Inside the memorabilia community , there was speculation that the card had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro . Mastro has told colleagues in the memorabilia circuit that he purchased the card from a printer , which was not Ray 's profession . Ray personally stated that Mastro might have been doing this to prevent others from trying to trace the card . Some also claim that Mastro bought the card from <unk> , not Ray . 
 After the transaction was completed , Mastro went back to his car and showed the Gretzky T206 Wagner to Lifson . Mastro offered one of the other T206 Wagner cards in his personal collection to Lifson as payment for the $ 25 @,@ 000 that Lifson fronted him for the Gretzky T206 Wagner — claiming that Lifson could sell the lower quality one for $ 30 @,@ 000 and make a quick $ 5 @,@ 000 profit . Lifson was skeptical , but he took Mastro 's word and accepted the deal , successfully selling this other Wagner card to New Jersey businessman Barry Halper for $ 30 @,@ 000 . ( Halper sold that card and 200 other baseball memorabilia items in 1998 to Major League Baseball for over $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . ) 
 In 1987 , Mastro sold the Gretzky T206 Wagner to Jim Copeland , a San Luis Obispo , California sporting @-@ goods chain owner , for $ 110 @,@ 000 . With that transaction , there was a sudden renewed interest in baseball card collecting . As Lifson commented , the Copeland deal revitalized the industry and " created an incentive to sell these great cards . " 
 = = = 1991 Copeland memorabilia auction = = = 
 Within five years , Copeland decided it was time to sell his card collection ; he chose to sell his entire 873 @-@ piece collection in a single sale , through Mastro . Mastro contacted Sotheby 's , the renowned New York auction house , and asked them to accept the Copeland memorabilia collection on consignment . Sotheby 's advertised Copeland 's items as the " Copeland Collection of Important Baseball Cards and Sports Memorabilia " to attract hobbyists and other potential clients . The March 1991 auction attracted nearly 800 collectors who were interested in purchasing some of Copeland 's rare memorabilia . The bidding prices far exceeded the pre @-@ auction estimates , as a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card sold for $ 49 @,@ 500 , more than three times the initial pre @-@ auction price estimate . Pre @-@ auction estimates placed Copeland 's T206 Honus Wagner at a price of $ 114 @,@ 000 . Within minutes of the opening bid for the T206 Wagner card , the highest bidder had put down $ 228 @,@ 000 , twice the pre @-@ auction estimate . A bidding competition between Mike Gidwitz , Mark Friedland and an unknown phone bidder ensued . Gidwitz dropped out of the competition when the bidding reached the $ 300 @,@ 000 mark . As Friedland made each bid , the phone bidder would counter with a bid $ 5 @,@ 000 or $ 10 @,@ 000 higher . Friedland dropped out of the competition after the phone bidder countered with a $ 410 @,@ 000 bid for the card . With Sotheby 's 10 % buyer 's premium , the final price of the card came out to $ 451 @,@ 000 , nearly four times the pre @-@ auction estimate for the card . The phone bidder was Wayne Gretzky , who purchased the card with advice and financial backing from his ' boss ' Bruce McNall , the owner of the NHL 's Los Angeles Kings . Copeland received around $ 5 million for the entire collection . The publicity coverage of the Sotheby 's auction renewed interest in the hobby of sports memorabilia collecting . Mastro worked with Sotheby 's for the next four years to facilitate sports memorabilia auctions and established himself as a leading card dealer in the industry . Illusionist David Copperfield used the popularity of the card as part of a magic trick on a TV Specials . Copperfield had Gretzky sign the card , then Copperfield proceeded to tear the card into four pieces , then restoring the card , and magically removing the signature . 
 Gretzky , who was not a big card collector , said he purchased the card because he thought " the market would remain strong " , thus making for a valuable investment . McNall orchestrated the plan to buy the card . In a 2005 interview , McNall stated his " philosophy was , if you buy something that is absolutely the best in the world , you 'd be okay because there is always another buyer for something at the top end . " 
 = = = Card back on the market = = = 
 In 1995 , Gretzky sold the card to Wal @-@ Mart and Treat Entertainment for $ 500 @,@ 000 . The two companies intended to use the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest . The card was sent all across the United States , as part of Wal @-@ Mart 's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market . On February 24 of the following year , the 122nd anniversary of Wagner 's birthday , the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN 's Larry King Weekend . At around 9 : 00 P.M. , Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson , one of King 's guests on the show , pulled out the name of one Patricia Gibbs , a postal worker living in Hollywood , Florida . After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs , King 's staff finally got through to her phone , and informed Gibbs of her prize . Treat Entertainment and Wal @-@ Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal @-@ Mart store in Miramar , Florida . Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card , so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on . She consigned the card to Christie 's , a New York @-@ based auction house better known for selling famous artworks . 
 Michael Gidwitz , the same individual who battled with Gretzky and Mark Friedland for the card at the Copeland auction in 1991 , won the Christie 's auction with a bid of $ 641 @,@ 500 . Four years later , on July 5 , 2000 , Gidwitz partnered up with eBay and Robert Edwards Auctions to start a 10 @-@ day online auction for the card . Robert Edwards Auctions , a division of <unk> , set up a registration system in which they approved prospective individuals before they actually made bids . These individuals had to wire a $ 100 @,@ 000 deposit to <unk> in order to be pre @-@ approved to make bids for the card . On July 15 , the card was sold to Brian Seigel , a collector from California , for $ 1 @.@ 265 million . In February 2007 , the Associated Press announced that Seigel had sold the card privately & directly to an anonymous collector from Southern California for $ 2 @.@ 35 million . Less than six months later , on September 6 , 2007 , SCP Auctions announced that the card had been sold once again to another anonymous collector for $ 2 @.@ 8 million . The anonymous collector was later revealed to be Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick . 
 = = = Alteration = = = 
 Shortly after Gretzky 's 1991 purchase , previously ignored allegations that the card had once been subject to alteration flared up again . This is when Gretzky approached the Professional Sports Authenticator ( PSA ) company to grade the card , resulting in the aforementioned PSA 8 NM @-@ MT grading . Despite PSA company president David Hall 's personal statement that the card was " superb " and a " fantastic card in every way , " a number of people in the memorabilia industry were not convinced that the card had not been altered at some point . 
 Soon afterward , Alan Ray came back into the picture , claiming that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $ 25 @,@ 000 trade in 1985 . He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky 's card . He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby 's , but never received a response back . Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray 's claims , saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card . 
 As part of a 2013 plea bargain in US District Court , Mastro admitted to trimming the edges of the card in the mid @-@ 1980s to increase its value , removing some discolouration and fraying / curling on the original edges and increasing the quality of centering of the image . As of March 2014 , Mastro is still awaiting sentencing , cooperating with prosecutors on other cases regarding faked or altered sports collectibles . A similar but unaltered card , the ' Jumbo Wagner ' , also has a NM @-@ MT grade quality for the majority of the card , but the lower quality edges have not been trimmed , lowering it from NM @-@ MT to an overall grade of PSA 5 – one of only three ( along with Mastro 's trimmed card ) rated PSA 5 or better – sold at a 2013 auction for $ 2 @,@ 105 @,@ 770 @.@ 50 .

 In 1976 , three collectors discovered a T206 Wagner that featured Wagner in a different pose , never seen in any of the other cards . Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910 , the three men decided to submit the card for a water test , using chemicals to determine the card 's authenticity . The card broke apart , and as a result , the card was dismissed as a fake . The three men were respected collectors and were cleared of any wrongdoing by the card collecting community . 
 = = = Cobb – Edwards T206 Wagner controversy = = = 
 Another T206 Wagner card owned by two Cincinnati men was dismissed as a fake by Bill Mastro and PSA president Joe Orlando . The two men , John Cobb and Ray Edwards , have tried to prove that their Piedmont @-@ backed card is not a fake and , due to its excellent condition , should fetch over $ 1 million in an auction . Cobb and Edwards also have alleged that they have been dismissed because they are inner city black men in a hobby that has been dominated by successful white men . Cobb , like Mastro back in the late 1980s , does not divulge the exact details of how he came to own the card . He has stated he purchased the card at an estate sale for $ 1 @,@ 800 in 1983 or 1984 , a bargain for the card at that time . When Cobb and Edwards tried to sell the card on eBay in 2002 , a Newport , Kentucky attorney filed a police report against the two men because he believed the card was a reprint that was stolen from his office months earlier . The police launched an investigation , but found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the two men . An outraged Edwards dismissed the accusations as " bullshit , " adding that they would not have been made " if we were white . " 
 Card Collector Services graded the card and officially ruled that it was indeed a reprint . Cobb and Edwards dismissed the findings and went to Integrated Paper Services ( IPS ) , an independent paper testing and analysis lab , in February 2003 to have their card 's paper tested . An IPS expert determined that the card dated back to 1910 , which would be consistent to the time period when the card was distributed . The expert ruled that the " paper stock was consistent with the time that card would have been made . " Cobbs and Edwards later went to an Ohio paper industry consultant who confirmed that the card was from 1909 . The consultant stated that a decent counterfeit of the card could only be produced from a " master pressman with 5 – 10 years experience , and would require a machine which would cost between $ 500 @,@ 000 and $ 2 million . " Afterwards , an appraiser named Bob Connelly valued the card at $ 850 @,@ 000 , based on the two previous paper analysis reports . In November 2005 , Cobb and Edwards put the card up for sale on eBay . They had to shut down the sale , however , because Connelly only agreed to appraise the card if his report was printed in its entirety at the eBay card listing . 
 A few months after the sale , Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction . Connelly consented and took the card across the country to prospective buyers . Meanwhile , HBO 's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards ' struggles with the card . Connelly met a card dealer in New York City , Mike Mangasarian , who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out . Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder for a closer examination of the card . A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton , NY . After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not . He explained that all T @-@ 206 's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was black . Additionally , he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front . Meanwhile , a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card 's listing on the website be <unk> eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin . As a result , a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day . As Connelly pointed out , the collectors chose not to make bids because " [ w ] hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity . "

 = = = Writing and filming = = = 
 The season was primarily filmed in Los Angeles , California . Fisher Plaza , which is the headquarters building for the media company Fisher Communications and Fisher 's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle , is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter 's helipad . This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle , which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza , the Seattle Monorail , and other local landmarks . However , the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle , are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills , California . Most scenes are primarily taped in Los Feliz , Los Angeles , at the Prospect Studios , and the set occupies two stages , including the hospital pieces , but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle . Several props used are genuine medical supplies , including the MRI machine . Prior to being cast , Sara Ramirez was seen by ABC executives , in her Broadway performance of Spamalot , which garnered their attention . Due to their admiration , the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series , of her choice , which ultimately led in her choosing Grey 's Anatomy . Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition , the producers liked her , and had intentions to add her to the show , but did not know who to cast her as . She also said she was in awe of how the executives said , " Pick a show , any show " , a statement she deemed rare . Ramirez 's character was given recurring status in the second season , having been conceived as a love interest for George O 'Malley . At Torres ' initial appearance on the show , she was disliked by fans , due to her getting in the way of O 'Malley and Grey 's relationship . When asked of this , Torres said : " You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line . Obviously , I 've heard some negative stuff . " Discussing Izzie Stevens ' relationship with Alex Karev , Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him , assessing that : " Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her , she forgave him and gave him another chance . And he really screwed her over . " Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie 's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as " karma " , as Alex previously treated Izzie badly , yet as he begins to realize his true feelings , he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny , regarded by her as " undeniably handsome and totally charming " . Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny : " I love the way Izzie lights up when she ’ s around him . I love their relationship because it 's so pure and honest and completely game free . " Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie " seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny . " When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny 's condition to move him up the transplant list , series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions , asking : " Is Izzie bad for doing it ? Is she tremendously irresponsible ? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable ? " Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny 's deathbed , explaining : " Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed , not for a prom , but for a funeral . Everyone in dark colors , everyone dressed <unk> . As if they were in mourning . Only Izzie is in happy pink . Only Izzie looks like she didn 't know this was coming . " 
 Peter Horton , expressed that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson 's character , Miranda Bailey , was to focus on the similarities between her and the actress , noting that " there 's not a mean bone in her body , but she 's solid and steady , like a rock . " Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character 's personality , noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past , to a maternal outlook on her interns . She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character , describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers , rather than someone living inside her . Wilson also assessed that being a real @-@ life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character : " She gets to be flawed , she gets to be tired , she can be cranky , she can be grumpy . " Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months . Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson 's portrayal of her character " sweet and wonderful " , naming her a professional : " She makes you be a better actor , just by being there . " She also described her performance during her character 's labor as " heart @-@ breaking , tender , powerful and wonderful " , noting how she managed to transform the strong character into " a weak woman , struggling to fight the unusual situation " . Fellow cast member James Pickens , Jr. described Wilson 's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as " a breath of fresh air , literally and figuratively " , also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater . Horton also described the production process of the two @-@ part story arc , which he stated to have been planning since the beginning of the series . He stated that the plot of the episodes had to " fill the demands of the Super Bowl " , which was scheduled to air in the same night : " We really wanted something different and Shonda [ Rhimes ] came up with the idea of this bomb , that we found simply outstanding ! " Visual effects supervisor Scott <unk> noted how " breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together " . He also assessed that the necessity to use <unk> , an element they had been trying to avoid , for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous , and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material . He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor : " When we filmed it , there was a moment , a fraction of a second , when we changed the body with the actor . "

 The season opened up to critical acclaim with many critics calling it " one of the best shows on TV " and was included in the top ten for numerous 2006 " best of television " lists . Also the fame of the show skyrocketed during the season The A.V. Club called the show a " <unk> " and " one of the best TV shows around , burning through plot points at a furious clip , swooning romanticism , at embracing the kind of deeply earnest , intensely felt romance that made the show ’ s relationships so great . Meredith ’ s famous " Pick me , choose me , love me " speech is corny , to be sure , but it ’ s got tremendous rhythm and absolute conviction ... season two of Grey ’ s was a comet . " Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series , noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series ' focal point . He noted that the ensemble , composed of " countless comely females and enough strong , competitive males " remains outstanding in prime time , being iconic , due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast . Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women , he stated that he can attest to its universal , equal @-@ opportunity appeal , <unk> that the show " explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone @-@ fueled intensity and estrogen @-@ laced sensitivity " and deserved to have viewers from both genders , championing its merits . In response to the bomb story arc , he called the two episodes " juicy " , while assessing that they " followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point , but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from " . Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character , describing Grey as a " prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon , waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd " , while stating that Yang , " an aggressively ambitious intern " lacks knowledge on any topic , except medicine , comparing her to boyfriend Burke , described as her opposite . In response to George O 'Malley 's story line , he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon . He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season 's cliffhanger , seeing the arrival of Montgomery ( Walsh ) as " certainly speaking to the show 's focus on relationships over the nuts and bolts of being a surgeon " , while praising Rhimes for continuing to " merge those disparate elements in the way that does , or at <unk> should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women , creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal , often at the same time " . 
 Noting the realism in the writing for the series , Gilchrist stated : " It 's as if Rhimes and Co. harnessed the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences , that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts , and it transported it on a world that is legitimately fraught with life and death decisions . " However , he expressed disappointment in the end of the second season , which he deemed surprisingly less strong , compared to the " powerful " first half and the " immaculate " first season , describing Stevens ' " awkward and self @-@ destructive " relationship with a patient as a way to " slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama " , while expressing the predictability of Duquette 's death . Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens ' development in the last part of the second season : " Izzie 's descent into abject hysteria , which followed her season @-@ long sanctimoniousness about everything , actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too . " He described how some episodes were not among the show 's strongest , noting that the some plot lines created poignancy , and connected in an unfamiliar way . 
 The reviews have stood the test of time and the season still remains a huge critical favorite . Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that , " the second season is still the show ’ s best season to date . " The site added , " I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show ’ s best season to date : season 2 . " calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season , " the elevator " , " the walkway " , " Joe ’ s bar , " Meredith ’ s " Pick me " speech " . and the " memorable patients " adding , " I want two people stuck on a pole ( Into You Like a Train ) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye , and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate . More than anything , I want them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways . " 
 Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie 's ethics in cutting Denny 's LVAD wire , writing that she " should not be practising medicine " and stating : " That 's the reason I don 't watch Grey 's Anatomy , anymore , because the super hot blond chick can make an earth @-@ shattering , fatal decision and she doesn 't get canned . " Regarding the second season , Kevin Carr from 7M Pictures said " Rhimes really just put Scrubs , E.R. , Sex and the City and even a dash of The Love Boat in a blender and poured out Grey 's Anatomy . " Also in regard to the second season , Christopher Monfette of IGN TV said " [ ... ] The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships , whimsical banter and challenging life @-@ lessons - all to a montage @-@ fetish , indie @-@ rock soundtrack " .

He finished the war with the rank of squadron leader and remained with the RAF afterwards , operating Gloster Meteors at the head of No. 266 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron .

Awarded the Distinguished Service Order and other medals , he was also one of Rhodesia 's most decorated veterans . The Southern Rhodesian capital , Salisbury , honoured his wartime contributions by naming a street in its northern Alexandra Park neighbourhood after him . On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of wing commander in 1948 , he set up home at 1 John Plagis Avenue , opened a bottle store bearing his name , and was a director of several companies , including Central African Airways in the 1960s . He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 general election , running for the Rhodesian Front , but failed to win . He died in 1974 , reportedly by suicide . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Plagis was born on 10 March 1919 in Gadzema , a mining village near Hartley , about 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) south @-@ west of the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury . His parents , Agorastos and Helen Plagis , were Greek immigrants from the island of Lemnos ; he had five siblings . Christened with the Greek name Ioannis Agorastos , Plagis used the English form of Ioannis , John , from childhood , and attended Prince Edward School in Salisbury . 
 Having been interested in aviation since he was a boy , Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force ( SRAF ) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939 . He was turned down because he was the son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen , despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life . After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940 , bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side , Plagis applied again — this time to join the Royal Air Force , which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940 — and was accepted . Training first in Southern Rhodesia , then England , Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above @-@ average ratings in all of his flying assessments . 
 Though he was officially in the RAF as a Greek ( he became a Rhodesian citizen only after the war ) , Plagis considered himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on his uniform denoting him as such . He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay , and painted that name on the side of each cockpit . After briefly flying Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF , Plagis joined No. 266 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , an almost all @-@ Rhodesian Spitfire unit , on 19 July 1941 . He served in the UK for about half a year , during which he was commissioned as a pilot officer , before being posted to the Mediterranean theatre in January 1942 .

 = = = First tour of operations = = = 
 Plagis 's first major operation was Operation Spotter , the first of many British endeavours to reinforce the besieged island of Malta in the face of German and Italian assaults during the Battle of the Mediterranean . Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance , and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942 . Spotter was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs , which would be carried part of the way from Gibraltar on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle , then flown to Malta ; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted No. 249 ( Gold Coast ) Squadron . The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen , four Australians , two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians — Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo . 
 The operation , carried out on 7 March 1942 , was largely successful and 15 of the 16 Spitfires reached Malta . Plagis and Leggo arrived to find a third Rhodesian , Flight Officer George " Buck " Buchanan , already attached to the squadron . A further delivery of 16 Spitfires , Operation Picket I , was attempted on 21 March , but this was less successful ; only nine of the planes arrived . Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942 , playing a key role in the siege . The Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica meanwhile attempted to bomb Malta into submission , turning the airfields into " a wilderness of craters , the docks ... a shambles , Valletta a mass of broken limestone ... " 
 The Luftwaffe launched a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March . Leggo , who had not slept for over 24 hours , returned to the airfield in the early hours having spent the night with a girlfriend . As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly . Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going , but Leggo insisted on flying , and took off at 08 : 05 as part of a group of four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s . He was soon seen to be flying poorly . A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range , seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out . Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream , causing him to fall to his death . When Plagis learned what had happened , he was inconsolable , holding himself responsible . In his journal , he vowed to " shoot down ten for Doug — I will too , if it takes me a lifetime " . 
 Plagis shot down his first enemy aircraft on 25 March 1942 , and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories in a single afternoon , thereby becoming the Siege of Malta 's first Spitfire ace . His downing of four enemies in a few hours won him much praise from superiors and reporters , and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) on 1 May 1942 , the citation noting that he had " destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft " . " With complete indifference to odds against him , he presses home his attacks with skill and courage , " it continued — " He has set an outstanding example . " 
 On 11 May , Plagis attempted to down an Italian Reggiane Re.2001 by flying straight at it to ram it ; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres , the Italian aircraft stalled and almost crashed into the sea . Thinking he had downed the enemy , Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot , but the Italian flight reported no losses . Plagis 's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement , and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely ; he landed with only three gallons ( 14 litres ) of fuel left . On 16 May , Plagis and an English ace , Pilot Officer Peter Nash , destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron 's 100th victory over Malta . Amid the continuing siege , the need for a major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent ; the Governor Lord Gort warned Britain in early June that if no supplies came by August , he would have to surrender to prevent a famine . 
 Plagis was promoted in the field to flight lieutenant on 4 June 1942 and transferred to No. 185 Squadron to command " B " Flight . He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten ( thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo 's death ) , and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June . A month later , he received a Bar to his DFC , having been adjudged to have shown " exceptional skill and gallantry in combat ... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft , he presses home his attacks with great determination . " Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942 , flying first to Gibraltar , then the UK . The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal ( known in Malta as the " Santa Marija Convoy " ) . 
 On arriving in England , Plagis was found to be suffering from malnutrition , scabies and physical and mental fatigue . He briefly convalesced in a nursing home , then spent a year as an instructor in England . He was promoted to probationary flying officer on 1 October 1942 . 
 = = = Second tour of operations = = = 
 Plagis returned to action in September 1943 , when he was appointed commanding officer of No. 64 Squadron , then flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France from RAF Coltishall in Norfolk . Plagis downed a Bf 109 over France on 24 September 1943 , then a Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 on 23 November , and formally received the rank of flight lieutenant on 8 December 1943 . 
 At the start of June 1944 , Plagis assumed command of No. 126 ( Persian Gulf ) Squadron , flying Spitfire Mk IXs that had recently been moved from Malta to assist in the invasion of Normandy . Six of the squadron 's planes had been purchased by the Persian Gulf Spitfire Fund , and duly named after the donating sheikdoms ; Plagis 's aircraft , which he chose because of the large letter " K " on its tail ( echoing his sister 's name ) , had " Muscat " painted in English and Arabic script on its side . He added to this a full rendering of " Kay " and other personal decorations . 
 After leading No. 126 Squadron on raids into Normandy during the Allied invasion , Plagis took part in many of the attacks on German positions in northern France and the Low Countries that followed over the next few months . He was shot down over Arnhem in the Netherlands during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 , but suffered only minor injuries and quickly returned to action . He received the Distinguished Service Order on 3 November for his " <unk> [ ion ] in very many sorties during which much damage has been inflicted on ... [ German ] shipping , radio stations , oil storage tanks , power plants and other installations " . The citation particularly stressed an engagement in which a small group of Allied fighters led by Plagis had taken on a far superior force of enemy aircraft and shot down five of them , Plagis himself downing two . Plagis was described as " a brave and resourceful leader whose example has proved a rare source of inspiration " . 
 Plagis converted to Mustang IIIs along with the rest of his squadron at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk during December 1944 and January 1945 , and spent the rest of the war flying bomber escort missions at the head of Bentwaters Wing , which included No. 126 Squadron . He was promoted to squadron leader on 28 March 1945 . Germany surrendered on 7 May , ending the war in Europe . 
 Plagis finished the war with a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed ( including two shared victories counted as half a kill each ) , two shared probably destroyed , six damaged and one shared damaged . This made him Southern Rhodesia 's highest @-@ scoring ace of the war , as well as the top @-@ scoring ace of Greek origin . He was one of the most @-@ decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war . 
 = = Post @-@ war service and later life = = 
 Plagis stayed with the RAF following the end of hostilities , and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron in England and Germany , flying Gloster Meteor <unk> He was awarded the Airman 's Cross by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946 . After retiring from the military with the rank of wing commander , Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948 . A street in the north Salisbury suburb of Alexandra Park had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits ; he moved into the house at the end of the road , 1 John Plagis Avenue . He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter . 
 Plagis set up and ran a bottle store bearing his name in Salisbury , and was involved in several businesses during the next three decades , serving as a director on company boards , including Central African Airways from 1963 to 1968 . He joined the Rhodesian Front on its formation in 1962 , and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year 's general election , losing to the United Federal Party 's John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501 . According to a report published by the Zimbabwe African National Union in 1969 , Plagis was by then working in the office of the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith ( himself a Second World War Spitfire pilot ) , with responsibility for the premier 's written correspondence . 
 In later life , Plagis became a friend of British ace Douglas Bader , a prominent supporter of Rhodesia 's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 . Bader , Smith and Plagis often socialised . Plagis also knew L Ron Hubbard , the American founder of Scientology , who briefly relocated to Salisbury in 1966 . Hubbard initiated numerous business schemes in Rhodesia , including the purchase of the Bumi Hills Hotel at Kariba . Plagis was one of two local businessmen who partnered with Hubbard in the Bumi Hills deal . He also sold Hubbard an interest in his holdings before the American was deported . 
 Plagis died in 1974 , aged 54 or 55 ; according to Lauren St John , an author from Gadzema , he had committed suicide , having never truly readjusted to civilian life .

 Cloutier began his professional career in 1996 – 97 with the Binghamton Rangers of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) , New York 's minor league affiliate . He assumed the starting position in Binghamton as a rookie , posting a 3 @.@ 55 GAA and .892 save percentage to be named to the AHL All @-@ Rookie Team . The following season , New York changed their AHL affiliate to the Hartford Wolf Pack ; Cloutier was consequently moved to Hartford for the club 's inaugural season in 1998 – 99 . By late @-@ December 1998 , he earned a call @-@ up to the Rangers as backup goaltender Jason Muzzatti was demoted to the Wolf Pack . At the time of his call @-@ up , Rangers management established that although he would play backup to Mike Richter , they intended on giving him opportunities to play . In anticipation of Cloutier 's NHL debut , the team 's goaltending consultant , Sam St. Laurent , described his playing style as a combination of both butterfly and stand @-@ up goaltending . 
 He appeared in his first NHL game on January 3 , 1998 , replacing Richter seven minutes into a contest against the Washington Capitals . Cloutier stopped all 16 shots he faced to record his first NHL victory by a 3 – 2 score . He made his first NHL start the following game against the Carolina Hurricanes on January 6 , 1998 .

He notched his first shutout as a Canuck on October 13 , 2001 , in a 4 – 0 win against the Avalanche . The following month , Cloutier was named NHL Player of the Week on November 6 , 2001 . He earned a second such distinction near the end of the season on March 18 , 2002 . Eight days later , he recorded his seventh and final shutout of the campaign in a 4 – 0 win against the Los Angeles Kings , setting a new team record . His seven shutouts surpassed Gary Smith and Garth Snow 's previous team record of six , accomplished in 1974 – 75 and 1998 – 99 , respectively . Cloutier 's mark was later surpassed by Roberto Luongo , who recorded nine shutouts in 2008 – 09 . Cloutier finished his first full season with Vancouver posting 31 wins , 22 losses and 5 ties with a 2 @.@ 43 GAA and .901 save percentage . He played in a career @-@ high 62 games despite missing nine games in January and February 2002 with an ankle injury .

With <unk> and 34 @-@ save performances from Cloutier , Vancouver won the first two games of the series . In game three , the Canucks and Red Wings were tied with a minute remaining in the second period when Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström scored on Cloutier with a slapshot from centre ice . The goal was observed by the media as a turning point in the series for both Cloutier and the Canucks as a team . The Red Wings won game three , as well as the next three contests to eliminate the Canucks in six games ; Cloutier was taken out of the game in the first period of the next two contests in favour of backup Peter <unk> . 
 Cloutier began the 2002 – 03 season by recording a shutout against the Calgary Flames on October 10 , 2002 . It marked the first time in Canucks history that the team began the season with a shutout win . In November 2002 , Cloutier won 11 of 12 games , including a team record 10 straight games , while recording a 2 @.@ 15 GAA and <unk> save percentage . He was named NHL Player of the Month , becoming the fourth Canucks player in team history to receive the distinction . He suffered a setback in December 2002 , when he missed three games with a knee injury . On February 17 , 2003 , he was named NHL Player of the Week for the third time in his career . Six days later , he recorded his 30th win of the season , becoming the first Canucks goaltender in team history to reach the plateau in back @-@ to @-@ back years . That same week , he suffered his second knee injury of the season and missed 10 games . He returned to the lineup by mid @-@ March to finish the season with Vancouver . After the Canucks ranked in the eighth and final playoff spot in Cloutier 's first two seasons with the team , Cloutier helped lead them to within one point of the Northwest Division title in 2002 – 03 . In 57 games , he posted 33 wins , 16 losses and 7 ties with a 2 @.@ 42 GAA and <unk> save percentage . Cloutier won the first and only playoff series of his career in 2003 as the Canucks eliminated the St. Louis Blues in seven games . He made 33 saves in the deciding contest , a 4 – 1 win for Vancouver . Advancing to the second round against the Minnesota Wild , the Canucks took a three @-@ games @-@ to @-@ one lead . With Vancouver needing one more win to eliminate the Wild , Cloutier was taken out of Game 5 in favour of rookie Alex Auld after allowing six goals on 21 shots through two periods . As both teams were leaving the ice at the start of the second intermission , opposing goaltender Dwayne Roloson bumped Canucks forward Trevor Linden , prompting Cloutier to challenge Roloson ; Cloutier threw two punches towards Roloson and received minor penalties for roughing and for leaving his crease . With Cloutier on the bench for the third period , the Canucks lost 7 – 2 . In the following two games , Cloutier allowed nine goals on 40 shots as the Wild completed a three @-@ game comeback to eliminate the Canucks . 
 In the off @-@ season , Cloutier was re @-@ signed to a one @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 5 million contract on July 15 , 2003 . Nearly two months into the subsequent season , Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win , making 31 saves in a 3 – 1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27 , 2003 . As the season progressed , Cloutier suffered several more injuries , the first of which was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games . He missed three more games before the season ended with cases of the flu and a lower @-@ body injury . On February 14 , 2004 , he was fined $ 1 @,@ 000 by the league for hitting opposing forward Ronald <unk> in the face with his blocker during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers . 
 Cloutier 's regular season success with the Canucks continued in 2003 – 04 , as he became the first goaltender in team history to record three consecutive 30 @-@ win seasons . Over 60 games , he recorded 33 wins , 21 losses and 6 ties . His 2 @.@ 27 GAA , which established a Canucks team record ( later surpassed by Roberto Luongo ) , and .914 save percentage were both career highs . In the opening round of the 2004 playoffs against the Calgary Flames , Cloutier suffered another injury , spraining his right ankle in the first period of game three . After Johan Hedberg initially replaced Cloutier , Alex Auld filled in for the final three games of the series ; Vancouver was defeated in seven games . 
 As initial contract negotiations failed in the off @-@ season , Cloutier filed for arbitration on July 16 , 2004 . Arbitration was avoided by both sides when Cloutier agreed to a one @-@ year , $ 3 million contract 11 days later . Due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , however , Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20 , 2005 . Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner , he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt @-@ based team , going undefeated with a 1 @.@ 94 GAA . EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second @-@ best record in the league . Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games , recording a 2 @.@ 75 GAA . EC KAC advanced to the finals , where they were defeated four @-@ games @-@ to @-@ three by the Vienna Capitals . 
 With NHL play set to resume in 2005 – 06 , Cloutier re @-@ signed with the Canucks to a two @-@ year , $ 5 million contract on August 18 , 2005 . Returning to the Canucks , he was injured early in the season during a game against the Avalanche on October 29 , 2005 . Attempting to check Avalanche forward Andrew Brunette , Canucks defenceman Nolan Baumgartner collided with Cloutier , causing a goal and forcing Cloutier out of the game with both a concussion and whiplash . The injury caused him to miss five games . Soon after returning , Cloutier was re @-@ injured in a game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on November 20 , when forward Rob Niedermayer skated into the crease and collided with Cloutier . He stayed in net to complete the game , a 3 – 2 win , and was on the bench the following game to backup Auld . However , after aggravating the knee in a practice on November 23 , an MRI revealed a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) . <unk> for reconstructive knee surgery , occurring on December 15 , Cloutier missed the remainder of the season . 
 As the Canucks missed the playoffs in 2006 , several changes were made to team personnel in the off @-@ season . One such change included the acquisition of All @-@ Star goaltender Roberto Luongo from the Florida Panthers . Shortly after Luongo was acquired , Cloutier was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on July 5 , 2006 , for a second @-@ round draft pick in 2007 and a conditional pick in 2009 . Cloutier finished his five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year tenure with the Canucks third on the team 's all @-@ time wins list with 109 , behind Kirk McLean and Richard Brodeur , and second in shutouts with 14 , behind McLean . In a 2012 interview following his retirement , Cloutier stated that he " loved playing in Vancouver the most " during his NHL career . He recalled the city 's regeneration into a hockey market and described how the team went from playing home games that " seemed half full " to creating a " playoff game atmosphere every night . "

 Leading up to the 2006 – 07 season , Cloutier signed a two @-@ year , $ 6 @.@ 2 million contract extension with the Kings on September 27 , 2006 . He had one year , valued at $ 2 @.@ 55 million , remaining on his existing contract , which was transferred over from the Canucks . Cloutier moved to the Kings alongside Head Coach Marc Crawford , who was hired by the team shortly after being let go by the Canucks in the 2006 off @-@ season . 
 Cloutier made his Kings debut in the first game of the regular season , a 4 – 3 loss to the Anaheim Ducks on October 6 , 2006 . He made 28 saves on 32 shots . During his first week of the regular season , he suffered a hip injury , but continued playing on the insistence of team management . In retrospect , he later recalled that his " biggest mistake was playing hurt for them . " The Kings organization also had Cloutier change his goaltender mask from the uncommon mask / cage style to the more traditional full @-@ fibreglass style for safety and insurance purposes . After recording 6 wins in 24 games and a 3 @.@ 98 GAA , Cloutier 's hip forced him to end his season , aggravating it on December 23 , 2006 , in a 7 – 0 loss to the Nashville Predators . 
 At the time , the injury was still believed to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger . When the pain in his hip quickly got worse , Cloutier appealed to team management . He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy . He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12 , 2007 . Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic . The Kings ' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier . 
 Having recovered from his injury , he returned for training camp in September 2007 . He was assigned to the Kings ' AHL affiliate , the Manchester Monarchs , after losing a roster spot to goaltenders Jason LaBarbera and Jonathan Bernier . During his stint with Manchester , Cloutier struggled to earn playing time , as younger goaltenders Jonathan Quick , Danny Taylor and Erik Ersberg were given more opportunity to play . At one point , he reported to the team 's arena in preparation for a road trip , but was left in Manchester in favour of the team 's other goaltenders . To Cloutier 's surprise , he was recalled by Los Angeles on February 7 , 2008 , while Kings backup Jean @-@ Sébastien Aubin was sent down in his place . After clearing re @-@ entry waivers , he joined the Kings ' roster to backup LaBarbera . Three days later , Cloutier started in goal against the Columbus Blue Jackets ; he recorded his first NHL win in over a year , backstopping the Kings to a 3 – 2 shootout victory . After LaBarbera became sidelined with a groin injury , Cloutier began earning additional playing time with the Kings . On March 10 , he played against the Canucks for the first time since being traded . He stopped 38 shots in a 2 – 1 overtime loss against his former teammates . Later that month , he suffered a groin injury and missed three games . Remaining with the Kings for the remainder of the 2007 – 08 season as backup to Ersberg , he recorded two wins in nine games with a 3 @.@ 44 GAA and <unk> save percentage . 
 In the subsequent off @-@ season , Cloutier 's remaining year on his contract was bought out by the Kings on June 21 , 2008 . As teams cannot buyout the contract of an injured player , Cloutier claimed he was not healthy and contested the move . However , the NHL ruled in favour of the Kings ; the buyout stood and Cloutier became an unrestricted free agent . Consequently , he received $ 2 million over the next two years from the Kings . 
 Without an NHL job , Cloutier took up an assistant coaching position in the Central Hockey League ( CHL ) with his older brother Sylvain Cloutier , who had just been hired as head coach of the Corpus Christi IceRays .

 After remaining inactive for a season , Cloutier was offered a tryout with the Canucks for the team 's 2009 training camp . Soon thereafter , he accepted another tryout offer from the Detroit Red Wings on September 4 , 2009 , sensing he had a better chance to secure a contract with the latter team . He was expected to compete with Jimmy Howard for the Wings ' backup position . On September 21 , Cloutier made his first and only pre @-@ season appearance with the Red Wings , splitting a game with Wings prospect Daniel Larsson ; he stopped all eight shots he faced in a 4 – 2 loss against the New York Rangers . While Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland said Cloutier " looked sharp " in his first NHL action since April 5 , 2008 , he also alluded to the media that the amount of goaltenders competing for spots within the Red Wings organization was a factor against the likelihood of him signing Cloutier . Three days later , he was officially released from the Red Wings . 
 Cloutier subsequently received several offers to play in Europe until signing a tryout contract with the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL in December 2009 . He reportedly had received offers from two other North American teams , but chose Rockford as the best choice for his family . Cloutier made his IceHogs debut on December 6 against the Manitoba Moose , marking his return to professional hockey after 18 months . He played 26 minutes before receiving a match penalty for punching Moose player Guillaume Desbiens after the opposing forward collided with him in his crease . The following day , Cloutier was additionally suspended by the AHL for one game . After serving his ban , he recorded his first win the IceHogs against the Texas Stars on December 12 . Cloutier began receiving interest from NHL teams , but his hip began acting up once again . By the end of the month , Cloutier and the IceHogs mutually agreed to terminate his tryout contract . He recorded one win and one loss in three games with the IceHogs , along with a 2 @.@ 47 GAA and <unk> save percentage . In a later interview , published on the Canucks ' website in August 2010 , Cloutier declared he was most likely retiring due to chronic injury troubles . 
 = = International play = = 
 During Cloutier 's OHL career , he competed in the 1995 World Junior Championships . He went undefeated in three games with a 2 @.@ 67 GAA to help Canada win a gold medal as the host country in Red Deer , Alberta . Cloutier missed a second opportunity to play for the Canadian national junior team the following year due to a shoulder injury suffered during OHL play . 
 On May 4 , 2001 , he was added to Team Canada 's roster for the 2001 World Championships . One of four goaltenders on the roster , alongside Roberto Luongo , Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère and Fred Brathwaite , he did not appear in any games . Canada finished the tournament in fifth place .

 Following his release from the Los Angeles Kings in 2008 , Cloutier joined his brother Sylvain Cloutier 's coaching staff on the Central Hockey League ( CHL ) ' s Corpus Christi IceRays as a de facto assistant coach . He served in that capacity for the 2008 – 09 season until his failed attempt at an NHL return in 2009 .

 " Some Kind of Bliss " is a song recorded by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue , for her sixth studio album Impossible Princess ( 1997 ) . The song was released as the lead single from the album on 8 September 1997 through BMG , Deconstruction and Mushroom . Minogue co @-@ wrote the track with James Dean Bradfield and Sean More while Bradfield and Dave <unk> produced it . Backed by guitar and drum instruments , " Some Kind of Bliss " is a pop rock track in which Minogue sings about feeling happy while away from family and friends . 
 Critical response to " Some Kind of Bliss " was mostly mixed ; earlier reviews were critical towards her image and sound transition to rock music , while retrospective reviews are positive towards her songwriting and sonic experimentation . " Some Kind of Bliss " performed relatively poorly on international charts peaking at number twenty @-@ seven on the Australian Singles Chart , at 22 on the UK Singles Chart ( her first solo release to miss the UK Top 20 ) and reaching number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 
 To promote " Some Kind of Bliss " , she performed the track on Top of the Pops , MTV Australia live and the Australian TV series Hey Hey It 's Saturday . It was later included on her 1998 concert tour Intimate and Live Tour . David Mould directed the music video to the single , featuring Minogue and actor Dexter Fletcher robbing a gas station . The song was later included in the track list of Minogue 's compilation albums including Confide in Me ( 2002 ) , Kylie Minogue : Artist Collection ( 2004 ) , and Confide in Me : The Irresistible Kylie ( 2007 ) .

 After releasing the single " Where the Wild Roses Grow " with Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on 2 October 1995 , Minogue received acclaim from critics for her experimentation with rock music , who praised her transition from being the once @-@ dubbed " singing budgie " to a mature woman . Because of this , Minogue , with the support of her then boyfriend Stephane Sednaoui , decided to experiment with her music for the upcoming album . Welsh musician James Dean Bradfield contacted Minogue 's A & R Pete Hadfield , asking him what their current project was where Hadfield replied " Kylie Minogue 's new album " . He asked Hadfield if he could work with Minogue and was approved . 
 After Bradfield sent her a demo of the album track " I Don 't Need Anyone " , Minogue was dissatisfied with the lyrical content and re @-@ wrote the track herself . Despite this , Minogue found it " difficult " to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of " I Don 't Need Anyone " . She found this method of writing " intriguing " and wanted to do it again , so she decided to do this with " Some Kind of Bliss " , writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore . Minogue commented about this method , saying " He took one half of one set [ of lyrics ] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together , which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn 't have done because , in my mind they 're two separate things . " She later commented that she felt it worked together . Lyrically , the song is about her being happy and said " To me the song is about being able , not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [ ... ] the ability to feel like they 're with you even if they are a million miles away . "

 Produced by Bradfield and Dave <unk> , " Some Kind of Bliss " was recorded at Mayfair Studios , London , England in 1997 , and was mixed by Alan <unk> at Roundhouse Studios . Instrumentally , the song features bass , electric and acoustic guitars , drums , string sections , flute , and a saxophone . " Some Kind of Bliss " is a pop song with alternative rock and " rock @-@ tinged " elements that lasts a duration of four minutes and thirteen seconds on the album . A reviewer from Sputnikmusic said " Some Kind of Bliss is one of the more pop @-@ rock songs that could have been part of her earlier work . This gem breaks up the dominance of the sleepy trance vibe to a more upbeat feel . " Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault felt that " Some Kind of Bliss " was " surprisingly a strong and straightforward rock " song . Nick Levine from Digital Spy labelled the music as " <unk> Indie " , while Sarah <unk> from FasterLouder called it " pure pop " . Priya from NME said " Some Kind of Bliss " is " a brassy 60 ’ s influenced number which has a totally ‘ Everything Must Go ’ vibe to it . " Martin Power , who wrote the biography Nailed to History : The Story of the Manic Street Preachers ( 2012 ) for the Manic Street Preachers , commented that " Some Kind of Bliss " was " far away from Minogue 's glory days of " I Should Be So Lucky " and " Better The Devil You Know " as it was possible to get . " A reviewer from The Australian noticed the transition from Minogue 's earlier work by saying " The new single is not as heavily produced as her past songs , leaving her voice sounding edgier , and guitars take the place of the drum machine beats of earlier efforts .

 " Some Kind of Bliss " received mixed reviews from most music critics , but received positive reviews in retrospect . Writing for NME in November 1997 , Ben Willmott called it " supremely irritating " and stated " Kylie belt 's out the lyrics like she 's reading from an <unk> . Any soul is lost in a slurry of bought @-@ in brass and a ropey guitar solo that 's be more at home on a Shakin ' Stevens record . " John Magnan from The Age said while the song was a stand out to the album , it " is actually one of the album 's <unk> tracks " . Jaime Gill from Yahoo ! Music reviewed her Ultimate Kylie compilation album , and criticized the musical composition by calling it a " awkward faux @-@ rock " . Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation The Best of Kylie Minogue and was disappointed with " Some Kind of Bliss " ' absence , labelling it a " lost classic " . Larry Flick from Billboard was positive , saying " Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna @-@ pop vixen to be reckoned with . " 
 Conversely , Allmusic 's Chris True had selected the song as an album stand out and a career stand out track . While reviewing her 2002 compilation Confide in Me , True stated “ Impossible Princess , both of which found her stretching and growing beyond the pop princess image she had previously . Dark , noisy tracks like " Limbo , " the trip @-@ hoppy " Jump , " and the more rock @-@ oriented " I Don 't Need Anyone " and " Some Kind of Bliss " — both of which were co @-@ written by the Manic Street Preachers ' James Dean Bradfield — found her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past . ” A reviewer from Who Magazine called the song " Funky , <unk> , Rocky , Big . " Gareth Gorman said that while the song showcased Minogue 's " thin vocals " , he followed saying " it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning , simple and effective . " Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine stated " Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time that Stock , Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully @-@ cultivated bow . " A reviewer from Music Week awarded the song four stars out of five , stating " Kylie changes musical tack again with this dense , big sounding single , co @-@ written with two of the Manics , which loudly announces she 's back in style .

 " Some Kind of Bliss " has been recognized by critics as Minogue 's most " indie " -influenced song to date and one of her least successful singles to date . Author Lee Barron , who wrote the book Social Theory in Popular Culture , discussed the Impossible Princess period and further stated that " Some Kind of Bliss " was one of the main aspects for her " Indie Kylie " label in the media . Craig Mathieson , who wrote the book <unk> : Everything You Need to Know about Australian Music Right Now ( 2009 ) , stated about the song " It was a statement of intent , but not as planned . A sense of freedom , a belief in in the lure of happiness , did not suit Kylie . She 's best defined by constriction ad reduction , an her music has subsequently become a soundtrack to lack of choice . " 
 The poor reception prompt Hadfield to release an apology to Minogue , blaming himself for not being in control of the promotion ; " I loved her voice , got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her . " Tom Parker , who wrote the liner notes for the 2003 @-@ release of Impossible Princess , had observed that critics slated " Some Kind of Bliss " due to Minogue 's approach to " obtain lyrical and production credibility , which was overshadowed in whole " . Minogue publicly commented about the single 's aftermath " I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week , so mine didn 't get off at a good start . " She went on to say " I 've told not to be frustrated , but I was frustrated because the album should be out [ ... ] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it , they may love it or they might hate it , but it was in my hands . " She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms ; she later commented that she departed on " good terms " .

 State Road 404 ( SR 404 ) , the Pineda Causeway , is an east – west divided highway currently running from Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) to SR A1A at Patrick Air Force Base , Florida , US . It was opened as a toll road in 1971 and classified as a state road two years later . The tolls were removed in 1990 . It was named after Pineda , a former village east of <unk> on U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) . With interchanges at US 1 ( SR 5 ) , South Tropical Trail ( County Road 3 , CR 3 ) , and South Patrick Drive ( SR 513 ) , the Pineda Causeway is ( along with SR A1A ) the primary access for Patrick Air Force Base and the southern end of Merritt Island . From US 1 to the eastern terminus , it is part of the Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway system . 
 = = Route description = = 
 From I @-@ 95 , the Pineda Causeway Extension passes between developments to its north and south . After an intersection with a local road , the route curves to the northeast and later resumes its eastward course , reaching Wickham Road . The route turns to the east and moves across the Florida East Coast Railway . 
 East of the railway , the route crosses below US 1 . The eastbound lane has an exit ramp that connects to both directions of US 1 ; in contrast , the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US 1 northbound and a loop to US 1 southbound . The road continues to the east , crossing a small inlet and a small island before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges . At the eastern end of the bridges , the route again crosses a small island and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island . There , the causeway intersects with CR 3 . The route crosses a series of islands , forming another twin set of bridges over the Banana River . After reaching land for the final time , the route enters South Patrick Shores . It has a partial interchange with SR 513 , with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance . After passing north of a housing development , the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A . 
 Along the causeway east of the extension , the Florida Department of Transportation ( FDOT ) estimated that 37 @,@ 500 cars drove on the route each day . 
 As part of a pilot project , FDOT has painted the shoulders as bike lanes , thus allowing cyclists on a controlled @-@ access highway that had been closed to them . 
 = = History = = 
 Due to high traffic involving the Kennedy Space Center and Patrick Air Force Base in eastern Brevard County , local politicians in the early 1960s petitioned the United States Bureau of Public Roads for federal funding in creating a new causeway across the Banana River , between the Eau Gallie Causeway and SR 520 . Although the federal agency declined twice due to low traffic projections , local officials maintained the need for the proposed causeway . In November 1969 , after FDOT opened bids for various state construction projects , the Gregg , Gibson & Gregg Inc. put out a $ 7 @.@ 7 million estimate to build the causeway from US 1 to the eastern shore of the Banana River . Ultimately , the original Pineda Causeway was opened in 1972 , costing about $ 7 million to construct . In the previous year , the route 's interchanges with US 1 and CR 3 , as well as the bridges , were completed . In 1972 , the interchange with SR 513 was finished . On May 31 , 1973 , FDOT classified the bridge and causeway as State Route 404 . 
 Initially it was a toll road , which funded the road 's maintenance . However , FDOT agreed in 1989 to remove the fee and pay for maintenance . In June 1990 , workers removed the toll along the Pineda Causeway , along with the Bennett Causeway to the north , at a cost of $ 745 @,@ 000 . The interchange with U.S. 1 , which was first built in 1971 , was reconstructed in 1997 . In 1999 , the route became part of the newly created Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway , which was a series of roads around the Indian River Lagoon . 
 In conjunction with a project to add additional lanes to I @-@ 95 , FDOT authorized funding in March 2008 to create an interchange with an extension of the Pineda Causeway . The two projects were estimated to cost $ 202 million upon completion . On May 2 , 2011 , the interchange with I @-@ 95 opened . FDOT also authorized $ 10 million to complete the extension from the interchange to its original routing . The overall cost of the extension was estimated at $ 27 million , of which the remainder not financed by FDOT was paid by impact fee and gas tax . Groundbreaking for the extension occurred on December 14 , 2007 , and the project was finished in May 2011 . This created a 1 @.@ 9 mi ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) extension of the highway after decades of planning ; once finished , it became a hurricane evacuation route . The project was expected to aid the local economy due to ease of travel from I @-@ 95 to the beach . 
 The extension currently dead @-@ ends just west of the I @-@ 95 interchange ; this end will eventually connect to the St Johns Heritage Parkway / Palm Bay Parkway . 
 In October 2011 , five Brevard County commissioners voted to consider the option of purchasing right @-@ of @-@ way and creating an overpass for the causeway over the Florida East Coast Railway line , located just west of US 1 . Although there were no immediate plans for such a construction project , the vote allowed for the maintenance of funding , instead of FDOT transferring the money to other projects .

 Mississippi Highway 465 ( MS 465 ) is a highway in the southern region of the Mississippi Delta . The highway starts at U.S. Route 61 ( US 61 ) near Redwood . It travels westward towards the Mississippi River , and then northwards to the village of Eagle Bend . The highway then traverses on the Mississippi River levee on a one @-@ lane road . Later , MS 465 leaves the levee , continues northward , and soon ends at MS 1 . 
 The highway was built around 1956 , as a gravel road from US 61 in Vicksburg , to MS 1 in Fitler . The southern terminus was moved in 1960 to near Redwood , and the highway was completely paved by 1984 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MS 465 is located in Warren and Issaquena counties . The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 , and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation . The section from US 61 to the Warren – Issaquena county line was designated " William W. " Bill " Ramsey Memorial Highway " in 2009 . 
 The highway starts at a T @-@ intersection with US 61 , a part of the Great River Road , north of Redwood . It then travels southwestward , adjacent to the Yazoo River . MS 465 then intersects Old Twin Lake Road in the village of Twin Lake , which is surrounded by a mix of forests and farmland . The road continues traveling southwestward , slightly elevated above the farmland . It then travels over a bridge , and soon turns westward , east of the Warren – Issaquena county line . 
 MS 465 continues to journey westward in Issaquena County , following the Yazoo River while surrounded by multiple smaller ponds .

 = = History = = 
 MS 465 first appeared as a gravel road on the state map in 1956 , connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler . A year later , a section of the highway became paved in northwest Warren County , and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958 . The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years , ending near Redwood . The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964 , and the northern by 1984 . The route has not changed significantly since . The route was proposed to be part of the Great River Road , but it was not included in the most recent reiteration of the route . 
 The highway has been prone to flooding , due to it being in the Mississippi River 's vicinity . The floods have impacted the Eagle Bend area , one of the communities on MS 465 . In May 2011 , the highway was closed in preparation for floods , which were already impacting the region . It re @-@ opened in June , after repairs and cleanups were done to the road . MS 465 was closed again in early January 2016 , as waters approached flood levels again . People were told to evacuate Eagle Lake via the northern section of MS 465 .

 Kenneth " Ken " Barlow is a long @-@ standing fictional character from the ITV soap opera Coronation Street , played by William Roache . Ken was created by Tony Warren as one of Coronation Street 's original characters . He debuted in the soap 's first episode on 9 December 1960 . Having appeared continuously since the programme 's inception , December 2010 marked Ken 's 50th anniversary on @-@ screen . At this time , Roache officially became the longest @-@ serving actor in a televised soap opera . Roache was honoured at the 2010 Guinness World Records ceremony for the achievement , when he surpassed actor Don Hastings from the American soap opera As the World Turns , who previously held this title . Roache stated in 2010 that he has no plans to leave the role and will remain in Coronation Street for as long as they will have him . 
 Ken was introduced as the educated son of a working @-@ class family . Portrayed as moralistic and a political activist , Ken differed from the other , predominantly working @-@ class characters in the soap opera . The character developed a reputation as a ladies ' man ; plots saw Ken dating numerous women , marrying five times to four women ( Valerie Tatlock in 1962 , Janet Reid in 1972 and Deirdre Hunt in 1981 and again in 2005 ) , fathering four children ( Lawrence Cunningham , Susan Barlow , Peter Barlow and Daniel Osbourne ) , and adopting one daughter ( Tracy Barlow ) . Of the many women Ken has been paired with , his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring . Ken and Deirdre 's fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983 due to Deirdre 's adultery with Mike Baldwin . The storyline captured both media and viewer interest . 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken 's discovery of the affair . The storyline lead to a feud between Ken and Mike , prominent in both characters ' narratives until Mike 's screen death in 2006 . 
 Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show 's early years , Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal " boring man " . This is an allegation denied by Roache , who has cited Ken 's evolution over the years , his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary . Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken . Away from the canonical serial , Ken has been portrayed by James Roache ( William Roache 's son ) in the dramatisation The Road to Coronation Street , and by Simon Chadwick in the play Corrie ! .

 Ken Barlow is one of the twenty @-@ two original Coronation Street characters devised by series creator Tony Warren . He made his debut in the soap 's first episode , broadcast on 9 December 1960 . While auditionees for the other twenty @-@ one original roles were drawn from casting director Margaret Morris ' contacts in the north of England , Warren spotted William Roache performing in the Granada Television play Marking Time , and knew that he was the right actor to play Ken . Roache almost declined the invitation to audition : " I wasn 't interested . I had my flat in London , I was getting acting parts and it all looked very rosy . " He changed his mind at the insistence of his agent , and attended the audition , at which he was asked to read The Daily Telegraph newspaper in a Lancashire accent . Roache believes that his indifference towards being cast had a positive impact on his audition , as it enabled him to relax . Two pilot episodes were filmed , with Ken played by Roache in one , and by actor Philip Lowrie in the other . Lowrie was later cast in the role of another original character , Dennis Tanner . 
 Roache was initially offered the role of Ken on a thirteen @-@ episode , six @-@ week contract . His agent convinced him to take it , as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of Marking Time . Coronation Street was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended . Roache was given a six @-@ month contract in early 1961 , followed by a one @-@ year contract in June of that year , which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been " leading a hand @-@ to @-@ mouth existence " . The series became a long @-@ running soap opera , airing multiple times weekly , and Roache continued in the role , though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent . Roache originally earned ₤ 10 per episode , compared to the ₤ 3 @,@ 000 per episode that he earned in 2010 . He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in Coronation Street for a short time , once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with " such colossal impact " , he realised it was something special . At the time , Roache needed to be sure it wasn 't a mistake to sign up ; later he said , " If I had known it would turn out to be my life 's work , I would have run a mile . " 
 According to writer Daran Little , Roache was partly responsible for the name of the street where the soap is set , Coronation Street , which also serves as the programme 's title . The soap was originally titled Florizel Street when it was commissioned . Roache reportedly could not pronounce Florizel , so the name of the street was changed to Coronation Street . 
 = = = Longevity = = = 
 By 1984 , Ken was the only character from the original cast who remained in the serial . He became the only original character to remain with the show continuously into 2010 , its 50th year . Roache has revealed that Ken 's role in the serial was threatened in 1964 , when producer Tim Aspinall , who was dubbed the " mad axe @-@ man " , took the helm of Coronation Street . Aspinall culled a variety of characters from the serial , including fan favourite Martha Longhurst ( Lynne Carol ) , and Ken was one of the characters he wished to axe : " He had a kind of hit list of characters . He decided who he wanted out , while others including myself were put on warning that we were likely to be given the chop at a later date . It was appalling , " recalls Roache . A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then wife Valerie would move to Australia . However , Ken was given a reprieve , as before he could be axed , Aspinall was removed from his position . 
 Spiritual enlightenment and a desire for self @-@ improvement led Roache to consider quitting the series in the early 1970s , as he struggled with being in " the most ego @-@ driven profession there is " . He ultimately decided to stay — a decision he is happy with in retrospect , as his qualms were never with the series itself , but the way he felt personally . In 2010 Roache pledged to stay with Coronation Street : " I 'm not even thinking about retiring . It isn 't an option and I don 't want to even consider it [ ... ] I love the Street and while they want me and while I can do it I want to carry on . I don 't care if I 'm 120 , I 'll still be there . " Roache said in 2010 , " When people ask me why I 've played the same role for 50 years I try to explain that I haven 't because like all human beings , and thanks to clever script @-@ writers , Ken 's evolved . He ’ s been married three times , had 24 girlfriends and is head of a totally dysfunctional family . He has a son [ Peter ] who 's an alcoholic bigamist and a daughter [ Tracy ] who 's a convicted murderer . How many actors get the chance to perform scenes with meaty content like that ? " 
 = = = Characterisation = = = 
 Tony Warren created Ken as a " zeitgeist " of modern times in 1960 , and it has been suggested that Ken is a " prism through which to read the political and cultural history of the last half century " . In the soap 's early years , Ken was frequently presented as resenting what he saw as the anti @-@ intellectual , repressed climate around him , and author Dorothy Hobson has suggested that Ken was ashamed of his working @-@ class roots . Roache concurs that Ken obviously had higher aspirations than " being stuck in Coronation Street " , but notes that " he was also portrayed as a nice young guy who was happy to help out if he could . " Roache considers himself " the guardian of Ken " , responsible for ensuring that his actions and dialogue remain true to the character . This responsibility lead to a two @-@ year quarrel with his co @-@ star Pat Phoenix , when she insisted that her character , Elsie Tanner , undermine Ken in an argument . Annoyed at Ken being belittled and the scene stripped of its " dramatic impact " , Roache rowed with Phoenix , who did not speak to him again — outside of their scenes together — for two years . 
 An article in the Daily Mail in 2010 stated , " in the beginning Ken was an angry young man who , as a student , was representative of the millions who had benefited from post @-@ war reforms , such as free education for the gifted . " The Guardian 's Joe Moran likened Ken to Richard Hoggart 's scholarship boy " the ' uprooted and anxious ' figure whose education had alienated him from his working @-@ class origins . " Moran suggested that Ken has led " what Hoggart once called a ' carousel life ' , a life not of the upward trajectory of the professional career but of living from year to year and taking whatever job turns up . " Moran added that Ken " refused to go along with the last half century 's stress on consumer aspiration and meritocratic elitism " , but added that by modern standards , " Ken has wasted his education and his life . He has played little part in ' wealth creation ' [ ... ] and is still stuck in the same house he lived in when he was a student , leading his carousel life , stoically and decently . " 
 Ken 's political stance is left @-@ liberal . He has been described as the most famous fictional reader of The Guardian , a newspaper that attracts readers of the mainstream left of British political opinion . Ken has had several forays into journalism for left @-@ wing publications over the years , and was occasionally shown to be frustrated that his political views were not shared by others . A scathing article he wrote for a newspaper in which he labelled his neighbours as " lazy @-@ minded , politically ignorant , starved of a real culture and prejudiced against any advance in human insight and scientific progress " led to clashes with his father and a fistfight at the Rovers with Len Fairclough ( Peter Adamson ) . Although Ken has occasionally espoused socialist ideology , Roache suggests that he is really more of a " liberal , fair @-@ minded guy [ ... ] always looking to right the wrongs of society " , and " a man of integrity who fights for what he thinks is right " . 
 Author Graeme Kay discussed Ken 's evolution within the show : " He began as a bit of a prig , in the eyes of working @-@ class father Frank , but matured into a sound family man , only to go astray . He changed from teacher to newspaper owner , through various jobs , but threw that away too . He has always liked to see himself as a big fish in a small pond , with his steely , domineering manner and feeling of superior intellect . " Little suggested that Ken has transformed from an angry young man who never fitted in and was always challenging the system , into a bore next door , eventually discovering that he couldn 't change the world after all . Little dubbed Ken Coronation Street 's elder statesman and lynch @-@ pin , a one @-@ man Greek tragedy , and the greatest survivor in Weatherfield . 
 The character has a reputation amongst critics as boring and a man of morals ; Moran dubbed him the archetypal boring man . <unk> the history of Coronation Street in 2007 , Virgin Media stated , " Perhaps unfairly dubbed boring , Ken is ultimately an intelligent man , frustrated by the cards life has dealt him – although the hair , clothes and strong morals haven 't helped . " Popular perception of Ken as being boring originated , in Roache 's view , around the time of the Ken – Deirdre – Mike love triangle storyline . He refutes the label , particularly as Ken has had numerous romantic dalliances during his tenure . Karen Price of the Western Mail called him the Street 's resident intellectual , who has never quite managed to break free from his roots . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Ken is renowned for having had multiple relationships with women during his time in Coronation Street . Discussing this , author Hobson has suggested that Ken 's numerous relationships could give the impression that the character is a lothario or a great romantic ; however , Hobson noted that this would be inaccurate as Ken is " neither a great romantic nor someone with whom you would be wise to trust your romantic or emotional future . In fact , he is one of the characters about whom audiences would tend to want to warn any female characters to ' stay away , it 'll end in tears ' . Roache feels that Ken 's approach to romance early in his tenure belied his educated , intellectual affectations , and revealed him to be a typical " northern working @-@ class man at heart . " He explained : " [ Ken ] was the sort who wanted to have a wife who would stay at home , look after the kids and make sure the house was run smoothly , while he went off to work to pursue a career . It was very old @-@ fashioned in many ways , but he could never see it that way and it was often left to the women he had relationships with to remind him of that trait in his character . " 
 Ken 's many relationships have been marred by infidelities . Despite being generally " well @-@ meaning " , Roache assessed that for the first two decades of Coronation Street , Ken had a ruthless streak where women were involved . While he has since mellowed somewhat , he was initially a " sensitive , thinking chauvinist who liked the idea of having a wife who was always there for him , but at the same time [ ... ] found nothing wrong with flirting or going off with another woman . " ITV publicity noted how many relationships and flings he has had , stating " This could take a while ... Ken has had more girlfriends than most of the Street ’ s male residents put together . " Between the periods of 1960 and 2007 , Ken married four times and dated 27 women , including a character played by the then unknown actress Joanna Lumley , who played headmaster 's daughter Elaine Perkins in 1973 . 
 = = = = Valerie Tatlock = = = = 
 Ken 's first notable relationship in the serial was with the character Valerie Tatlock ( Anne Reid ) in 1961 . Roache and Reid had been to neighbouring schools , which gave them common ground and a relaxed attitude to working together . Ken 's relationship with Valerie became popular with viewers . Roache once attributed their success to his own rapport with Reid , citing it as a helpful element in their on @-@ screen chemistry . Ken and Valerie married on 4 August 1962 . Executive producer H. V. Kershaw was aware of their popularity , and requested that Granada Television 's evening duty officer be made available on the night of broadcast , in order to take phone calls of congratulations from viewers . Although no calls were made , 20 million viewers watched the wedding episode . Reid was " thrilled " with the reaction to the wedding . Roache was initially skeptical about the impact marriage would have on Ken 's development . Roache said : " I was a sort of young semi @-@ heartthrob in those days and thought getting married was going to finish all that . " He felt that , given Ken 's aspirations of upward social mobility and desire to leave Weatherfield , marriage conflicted with his characterisation , but realised it was necessary for the writers to anchor him in the area . 
 Valerie gave birth to twins , Peter and Susan , and became a housewife to look after them . All scenes involving the child actors were filmed separately from episodic shoots , to avoid unwanted noise ruining Roache and Reid 's scenes . In one storyline , Ken had to start looking after the children more frequently , but he grew bored and would often leave them unattended . Valerie accused him of attempted murder on one occasion when a small house fire occurred – with the twins trapped inside . His boredom with his marriage caused him to have an affair with Jackie Marsh ( Pamela Craig ) . There were only " kissing scenes " written into scripts , but the production team made it clear they were having a sexual relationship . The storyline " horrified " viewers , and Craig received abusive letters from angry fans . Craig knew nothing more than a short affair could occur between the pair . On @-@ screen Elsie Tanner convinced him to end the affair ; Valerie found out , but forgave him . Roache enjoyed the aftermath , as it added a new dimension to Ken , whereby " He was a married man with kids , and had all of those good intentions , but he was also liable to stray and clearly had trouble resisting the temptation of another woman . " 
 Ken and Valerie 's marriage came to an untimely end in 1971 . Following Reid 's decision to leave the role – having grown bored of playing the character – the producers opted to kill Valerie off . Reid and Roache were briefly concerned that her departure would result in Ken being written out , and Roache recalls that Ken emigrating with the twins was a scenario under consideration . To his relief , he was kept on . Valerie died after being electrocuted while trying to mend a faulty hair dryer . After the fatal shock , she knocked over an electric heater , setting the Barlow 's house on fire ; it has been dubbed one of the most sensational soap departures . A then @-@ record audience tuned in for Valerie 's death , scripted by Leslie Duxbury . The following episode ended with Ken walking through the burned remains of their home , in a scene that Roache has deemed one of his " most enjoyable and satisfying moments in Coronation Street . " 
 = = = = Janet Reid = = = = 
 Ken 's second marriage in the serial was to a character named Janet Reid ( Judith Barker ) in 1973 ; their relationship was short @-@ lived . There was no buildup to their marriage ; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife . The storyline 's fast pace angered Roache ; he once stressed : " I was very cross about the whole thing . There was no wedding , she just arrived , no build @-@ up to it . It was just like an idea that was shoved in . I wasn 't happy . " The storyline was unpopular with viewers , who did not approve of the wedding . Janet was already an unpopular character by then , because of her previous affairs with two other Coronation Street males . Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly . She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school . The situation saw Ken realise he was in a " loveless marriage " – a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness . The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed " a series of spectacular rows " , which saw Ken become violent towards Janet . One such row , which followed Ken 's discovery of Janet 's plans to send the twins to boarding school , was later used as an exercise in drama schools , which Roache deemed " a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment . " 
 Janet and Ken split up in 1974 . Barker was included in the series on and off for a few years , as Janet would occasionally return to be with Ken . In late 1976 Barker was asked to reprise the role for a final time . Janet returned on @-@ screen in 1977 and asked Ken for another chance , claiming she had changed . When he rejects her , she commits suicide by taking an overdose . Barker recalled the " exhausting " scenes she and Roache filmed , and said there was substantial " dramatic tracking " scenes as Ken discovered her dead in bed . Ken was described as " shattered " and " remorseful " by the death of Janet , and felt guilty over the fact he did not try to help her more . To worsen his situation , he was initially suspected of murdering her . 
 = = = = Deirdre Hunt = = = = 
 In 1972 , Deirdre Hunt , played by Anne Kirkbride , was introduced into Coronation Street ; the character would become synonymous with Ken 's narrative when , in the early 1980s , Deirdre became Ken 's third wife . A combined audience of 24 million viewers tuned in to see the nuptials . Their wedding coincided with professional unease for actor Roache , who feared that Ken was becoming boring , to the detriment of his own self @-@ confidence . In 2010 Roache said , " [ Ken ] was beginning to look very ordinary and quite nerdy , and that in turn had a knock @-@ on effect for me , because I started to lose confidence as an actor . I went through a time where I was really scared of ' drying ' , which is not being able to remember your lines . You start to wonder about your own ability to remember lines and act in the way you had , which can be very damaging . " 
 Roache inferred that the writers no longer knew how to utilise Ken . Although he had rarely done so in the past , he voiced his concerns to the series ' producer , dismayed that the character " seemed to be floating in a nebulous state " . He believes that Ken was thereafter included in " much stronger stuff " as a result , including a storyline in which Deirdre had an affair with his rival , Mike Baldwin ( Briggs ) . The storyline was devised in 1982 . Then producer Mervyn Watson recalls : " It was normal story conference and we looked at the Ken / Deirdre marriage and had the idea of her having an affair with somebody in the Street . It was extremely passionately debated because there were categorical and opposite view points expressed . " Watson believes that actors often feel " disturbed and uncomfortable " at the prospect of what their character will experience . In turn , he thought the scenario generated some of the best performances in the actors ' careers . He concluded that Roache proved his theory correct , and praised his performance . 
 A now infamous scene , in which Ken comes face @-@ to @-@ face with Mike following the discovery of the affair and a showdown ensues , was originally scripted differently . Ken was intended to stand and meekly watch Mike and Deirdre chatting on his doorstep . Roache disliked this version , as he believed Ken 's response lacked realism . Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken 's " lame " characterisation , Roache approached the episode 's director , Brian Mills , and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike . Though the filming set @-@ up planned for the scene did not allow for this , it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike , and that Deirdre would intervene . In the transmitted scene , Deirdre did intervene , resulting in Ken attempting to manhandle her . Roache recalls , " Every time I looked at the words and at what was supposed to happen I knew it just didn 't ring true . Poor Annie wasn 't prepared for what happened to her next and actually burst into tears because of the ferocity of my performance . She was shaken up by it , and when it came to the moment for Mike Baldwin to knock at the door she got an even bigger shock . After Baldwin asked why Deirdre had put the phone down when he 'd called earlier , I slammed the door shut with my left hand and then slammed poor Annie against the door itself , leaving her shaken and shocked . She then made her way into the Barlows ' living room , sobbing her heart out , and Brian left the cameras rolling , capturing [ Anne 's ] genuine distress . " 
 The storyline was described as the most volatile and explosive in the programme 's history . Roache recalls viewers taking it very seriously , to the point that he received letters reading : " Dear Ken , I though you should know that Mike Baldwin is seeing your wife ! " He related that , " When Deirdre decided to stop seeing Mike and stay with Ken , the scoreboard at Old Trafford on the night flashed the message that the couple were not splitting up to 56 @,@ 000 football fans , amid thunderous cheers from the crowd ! " 20 million viewers tuned in for the episode ; it attained the soap 's second @-@ highest recorded overnight ratings , surpassed only by the farewell episode of Hilda Ogden ( Jean Alexander ) in 1987 . 
 Ken and Deidre have been described as soap opera 's version of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor . Their relationship has featured various affairs , break @-@ ups and reunions over the years . The couple 's first marriage eventually disintegrated in the early 1990s , this time when Ken had an affair with colleague Wendy Crozier , a dalliance which ended in divorce for the Barlows . Ken was kicked out of home on New Year 's Day 1990 . Their on / off relationship continued , with each having various other liaisons , until producers decided to reunite Ken and Deidre in 1999 . Roache said , " I was pleased . It seemed to fit perfectly with the lives that had been created for them throughout their time in Coronation Street . They had both gone off and done very silly things and had had affairs with people , and yet their overriding need as they got older was for each other . " Ken and Deirdre 's second marriage in 2005 was watched by an estimated 13 million viewers , compared to the nine million who watched the wedding of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles the following day . Coincidentally , Ken and Deirdre 's first wedding in 1981 was screened within 48 hours of Prince Charles and Princess Diana 's wedding , and just as in 2005 , the Barlow wedding attracted more viewers than the royal wedding . 
 Roache has been complimentary about Ken and Deirdre , as well as Kirkbride — who , he states , he loves as much as Ken loves Deirdre — with this love explaining why Ken always ends up returning to her . Roache said , " We have been together on screen for pretty much 30 years now and so much of what we do on camera is instinctive . We really are like an old married couple who have had their ups and downs , lived through them and come out the other side . " 
 = = = = Denise Osbourne = = = = 
 Ken was paired romantically with hairdresser Denise Osbourne ( Denise Black ) in 1994 , the romance <unk> the chances of a reconciliation between recent divorcees Ken and Deirdre . Scriptwriters had actually been planning to reunite Ken and Deirdre , but when Deirdre 's actress fell ill and had to be written out , the scripts were changed and Ken was paired with Denise instead . Black has suggested that the romance came out of nowhere . 
 The Official Coronation Street Annual 1997 has described Ken and Denise as a " mis @-@ matched pair " who were never destined to spend their lives together . In the storyline , Ken fathered Denise 's son Daniel . They had an on / off relationship and a wedding was planned in 1996 ; however , in a plot twist , it was revealed to Ken that Denise , unable to " hold her primitive lusts in check " , was having an affair with her brother @-@ in @-@ law , Brian . Upon the discovery , Ken 's happiness was snatched away in what has been described by Sunday Mail as " harrowing circumstances " , and one of the character 's worst moments . Denise Black has discussed her character 's ambivalence towards her relationship with Ken , revealing why she believed Denise engaged in infidelity : " The thing is that she 's in love with both men . When she 's with Brian she loves him . And she 's completely in love with Ken when he 's with her . So she has two loves and all the guilt that goes along with that scenario . Denise doesn 't mean to cause so much pain . Her problem is that she just doesn 't know whether she 's coming or going . " When Ken discovered the truth the wedding was called off , with Ken telling Denise to " get out before I kill you " . 
 Following the revelation and amidst the fallout , Denise absconded , leaving her son in Ken 's custody . This facilitated Black 's desire to have a six @-@ month break from the serial . The character returned in the winter of 1996 , for the last part of her storyline , Black having decided to quit the role . Denise 's return storyline was scripted to coincide with Coronation Street 's increase to four weekly episodes . It focused upon a custody battle for Daniel between Ken and Denise after Denise snatched Daniel . A source at the time discussed the storyline and Ken 's reaction to losing his son : " Ken is devastated when he returns home the week before Christmas and finds his son gone . He simply can 't believe he 's been snatched by the woman who dumped them . He immediately starts a custody battle . Denise plays heavily on the fact that she is the mother , while Ken [ claims ] that he is back in a relationship with his ex @-@ wife Deirdre . Deirdre actually goes to court with him for support , but she gets angry when she finds out he tries to use their friendship as a lever to get Daniel back . " When Denise was awarded custody , she left Coronation Street , and Ken lost contact with his son . 
 Denise was reintroduced for several months in 2007 , over a decade after she had last appeared . Ken tracked down his son following marital unease with Dierdre , which led to interactions with Denise when he turned up unannounced for a visit . Black was pleased to be invited back , saying " I don ’ t think that you can have Ken Barlow ’ s baby and forget about it , can you ? " Denise 's return was used as a catalyst to cause further problems in Ken and Deirdre 's marriage , Ken having grown discontented . It was only a brief return ; once Denise 's advances towards Ken were rejected , Denise was written out again . 
 = = = = Martha Fraser = = = = 
 In January 2009 , Martha Fraser ( played by Stephanie Beacham ) , a new love interest for Ken , was introduced to the show . Ken meets Martha by the canal while he is walking his dog , Eccles . Martha reveals that she is a theatre actress who travels to performances on her barge . Ken seeks Martha out again , and he helps her go through her lines . Roache told What 's on TV that Ken is happy to find a " like @-@ minded person " who is easy to talk to . He enjoys telling Martha about his problems , his son and his grandchildren , as she is not judgmental . When asked if Ken mentions Deirdre , Roache said " Er ... no . Martha asks him about Peter 's mum and Ken tells her that she 's dead , which is the truth , so Martha automatically assumes he 's a widower and he doesn 't put her right . " Ken also chooses not to mention Martha to Deirdre ; Roache believed that she would be angry if she found out . Roache revealed that Ken is not thinking about having an affair with Martha , but he is " captivated " by her , and does have feelings for her . During the storyline , Roache 's wife , Sara , died . Roache was given compassionate leave from the soap , and writers were forced to rework Ken 's storyline . Ken and Martha eventually consummate their relationship , and Ken considers leaving Deirdre and Weatherfield . He changes his mind at the last minute and Martha leaves , alone . 
 Alison Graham of the Radio Times said Martha was Ken 's soulmate , because " she 's the most perfectly bourgeois bit @-@ on @-@ the @-@ side . " Graham said that Martha allowed Ken 's " middle @-@ class heart " to sing after the pair bonded over a love of BBC Radio 4 , books and plays . Comparing Ken 's relationships with Martha and Deirdre to a prison sentence , Graham said Martha offered Ken a deserving parole from the " years of breaking rocks in the prison yard of his marriage to Deirdre . " She hoped that Ken and Martha were " soon in the throes of ecstasy " , because Ken deserved it . Following the conclusion to Ken 's relationship with Martha , Roache expressed an interest in having more girlfriends for Ken introduced in the future . The actor said , " I thought it was great last year having a girlfriend , especially at my age . A few more would be great . I 've lost count of romances I 've had in the show , not to mention the four weddings . " Ken and Martha 's romance was later depicted in the Coronation Street musical , Corrie ! . Ben East of The Stage said the romance was " genuinely funny . " 
 = = = = Other relationships = = = = 
 Ken 's first on @-@ screen relationship was with Susan Cunningham ( <unk> ) , who he dated throughout the first ten episodes . Ashamed of his family and background , Ken was constantly apologising to her . This frustrated Susan , who actually liked Coronation Street . Fifty years later , it transpired that their relationship had left Susan pregnant , resulting in the birth of a son , Lawrence . After Susan , Ken 's early love interests included Marian Lund ( Patricia Heneghan ) , a librarian eleven years his senior ; Yvonne Chappell ( Alex Marshall ) , a hotel receptionist he met en route to first wife Valerie 's funeral ; Norma Ford ( Diana Davies ) , an impressionable young shop @-@ assistant ; Wendy Nightingale ( Susan Tebbs ) , a married woman who moved in with Ken , making them Coronation Street 's first unmarried cohabiting couple ; and Elaine . Roache believes that Ken was in love with Elaine , though her feelings for him were less intense . He recalls some discussion of re @-@ introducing her to the series in 2009 ; however , this did not come to fruition . Upon separating from Elaine , Ken confided in his friend Rita ( Knox ) that , " There were other fellers more glamorous , more successful , more wealthy and more interesting than me . " According to Roache , the line offers insight into Ken 's psyche , evidencing that he truly belongs on Coronation Street , despite his desires to the contrary . 
 Although the number of romances Ken was involved in declined from the 1980s onwards , Roache states that those relationships he did have " tended to be bigger and more involved " . His later love interests included Wendy Crozier ( Kerr ) , Alma Sedgewick ( Barrie ) and Maggie Redman ( Kerman ) . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Ken was disdainful of his parents , Frank ( Pemberton ) and Ida ( Dyson ) . Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene , in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce . Roache called it " good character @-@ defining stuff " , which established the antagonism between Ken and his father , borne from Ken 's snobbery and desire to abandon his roots . The death of his mother further illuminated the father @-@ son relationship . Roache recalls that , " although their relationship could often be stormy , with Ken 's views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues , the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided . " While Dyson left the series under her own volition , Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall 's tenure as producer . By 1984 , both of Ken 's parents had left the Street . Ken was originally intended to have a sister named Enid . Warren decided against her inclusion , and instead created a younger brother , professional footballer David ( Rothwell ) , to enable the show to represent teenage males . Rothwell feels that an " underlying antagonism " existed between Ken and David , which stemmed from the fact Ken had the advantage of a university education , while his brother did not . 
 Ken was bored with looking after the children , Peter and Susan , before Valerie 's death . Afterwards , further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope . The writers were initially uncertain whether to continue with Ken as a single father , or dispatch the children and pursue a less @-@ encumbered lifestyle . Roache said , " Ken tried to bring up the kids on his own , but he wasn 't doing so good . So he sent them up to Glasgow to live with his mother @-@ in @-@ law . " Ken still remained in contact ; Roache recalled Ken often saying : " Right , I 'm off to Scotland . ' " Roache has suggested that the subsequent problems in his children 's adulthood were Ken 's fault : " I blame Ken for how they 've all turned out . He shoved his kids up in Scotland , didn 't really look after them . But you don 't want a happy family in the Street . You want a wonderful dysfunctional one like the one I 've got , they 're great and Deirdre is wonderful . " The animosity between Ken and his children has been explored throughout the programme 's duration . Chris Gascoyne , who took on the role of Peter in the 2000s , has suggested that there is a lot of tension between Ken and Peter due to the dysfunctional nature of the Barlow family . Guilt over the twins ' upbringing led Ken to dote on his youngest son , Daniel , as he was keen to avoid repeating his past mistakes . Their close relationship resulted in Roache challenging the series producers when a script required Ken to allow Daniel to be taken away by his mother . The actor felt that Ken would not accept this ; he would fight . The scriptwriters apologised , but it was too late to re @-@ write the plot . 
 After Valerie 's death , Ken became responsible for looking after her uncle , Albert , and he later became known as Ken 's " Uncle Albert " . Albert would often make attempts to interfere in Ken 's life , as he had no one else . At one stage , Ken was making plans to leave Weatherfield . When Albert revealed he could not pay his bills on his pension , Ken opted to stay . The storyline has been called a turning point for Ken — when he realised he belonged in Coronation Street and had to help the community and Albert alike . Ken moved in with him and Albert gradually saw Ken as " the son he never had " . Roache enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with Howarth , whom he first met as a schoolboy . He characterised Ken and Albert 's relationship as " often a little bumpy and uncomfortable , but underlying all of that was an affection the two had for each other . " 
 Ken had a slight antagonistic relationship with his " acid @-@ tongued " mother @-@ in @-@ law Blanche , Deirdre 's mother , who has been described as a " thorn in Ken 's side " . A favourite subject matter for Blanche 's wit , Ken has been described as " long @-@ suffering " as he bore the brunt of her " catty remarks " . She would criticise his looks , and on one occasion she accused him of being homosexual . When Ken 's affair with Martha was exposed , Blanche took her comments too far : she tormented Deirdre for staying with him , which resulted in her being thrown out of the Barlow household and forced to live with Peter . However , she was seen as " the glue " of the Barlow family in the modern era , holding them together . Blanche was willing to put her wit aside and fight to ensure Ken and Deirdre stayed together , although most of the time , she interfered in his life . Even upon death , Blanche managed to make a final remark aimed at Ken , through her will . The storyline was described as giving her the chance to have " the last laugh " . 
 In 2010 it was announced that Roache 's own children , Linus and James , would be joining the cast . They played his long @-@ lost son and grandson , respectively . In the storyline , Ken finds a letter which discloses he had a secret son with a short @-@ term girlfriend . Roache said he looked forward " immensely " to working with his children during the fiftieth @-@ anniversary year . The reunion was short @-@ lived due to a rift between Lawrence and James . Lawrence was a bigot who could not accept that the fact James was homosexual . The producers decided to run the storyline to highlight the fact homophobia still exists . Gay rights activists approved of the storyline because the producers showed both sides of the issue . On @-@ screen , Ken was opposed to Lawrence 's views and decided to embrace James ' sexuality . He urged him to be true to himself and ignore his father 's bigoted views . Lawrence does not agree with Ken 's liberal stance . In 2011 James returns to stay with Ken . Ken was grateful for the chance to get to know him better . Ken sees James as his " intellectual match " , and has a lot of respect for him because he is a " well @-@ educated , erudite young man " . He became carried away and moved him in because Ken has always " longed for intelligent conversation " . 
 = = = Feud with Mike Baldwin = = = 
 Television researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas and suggested that " many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme 's history " . She used the " undying hatred " between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin ( Johnny Briggs ) as an example of this , suggesting that viewers " welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers . " It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike 's hatred was a clash of cultures : " Barlow the lefty do @-@ gooder versus Baldwin , the cut @-@ and @-@ thrust money grabber . " Briggs has claimed that Ken was jealous of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not , and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self @-@ centred and self @-@ made individual . 
 Ken 's feud with Mike — spanning over 20 years — began in 1983 , when Ken discovered that his wife , Deirdre , was having an affair with Baldwin . His dislike for Mike pre @-@ dated the affair , however , and Roache has stated : 
 " The truth was that Ken never liked him , but having his wife go off and have an affair with Mike turned dislike into hatred , which was wonderful for the programme . Just the mention of Baldwin 's name was enough to get Ken twitching with barely contained anger , and for Johnny Briggs and me it was absolutely wonderful . At best the two characters sometimes tolerated each other in an uneasy truce , but at worst the two of them not only threw insults at each other , but punches too . It was a relationship that ran for many years , and although towards the end of Mike Baldwin 's time on the show you might say there was a little mellowing going on , it was never a relationship that was going to be anything other than uneasy . " 
 Of the love triangle storyline , Briggs has said , " the way it captured the nation was amazing . Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty . Men were shouting out : ' Go on Mike , give her one . ' People were disappointed when she went back to Ken " . The storyline had significant cultural impact , with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken , and those who thought she should leave with Mike . In her 2003 book , Hobson suggested that Ken " spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal " caused by Mike and Deirdre 's affair . 
 Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when , in 1986 , Mike married Ken 's daughter Susan , a union that Ken strongly opposed . Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured , and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls . The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986 , when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike 's maltreatment of his daughter . Of the confrontation , Briggs has said , " It was a classic – Baldwin getting it in his own territory , the factory . It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter , he was furious . He marched into the office and let him have it . This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off @-@ guard . " Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken , though it took a further four years before he could do so on @-@ screen . In a scene which aired in 1990 , Mike punched Ken , knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house . Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on @-@ screen fistfights , and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts . According to Briggs , no choreographers were ever used . In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards . 
 Ken and Mike were forced to work together in 2000 , when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the " <unk> siege " . Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap 's local supermarket , where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher . The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence . Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers , which facilitated an end to their feud ; Ken helped Mike to combat a panic attack . The pair resolved to put the past behind them ; it was a temporary reprieve . Mike had unknowingly fathered a son , Adam , during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow ; she kept the baby a secret from him . Mike discovered Adam 's existence in 2001 ; Susan attempted to flee , but was killed in a motor accident . Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam , with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson . The storyline lead to the fifth fistfight between Ken and Mike in the soap 's history , with the pair brawling at the funeral of Susan . 
 The feud came to an end on @-@ screen in 2006 , when Briggs quit the role of Mike . Mike was killed off , dying of Alzheimer 's disease ; he died in Ken 's arms . In the final scenes , a disorientated and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken , and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms , the rivals talked about old times before Mike died , signifying the end of their 20 @-@ year feud . To promote Mike 's final scenes , Radio Times released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re @-@ enacting Arthur Devis 's ( 1807 ) painting of the death of Horatio Nelson — Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments , with Ken prominently positioned next to him , taking on the role of Captain Hardy , Nelson 's trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered " Kiss me " before he died . Producer Maire Tracey said , " The fact that Mike dies in Ken 's arms says it all . For most of Mike 's life , it was his battles with Ken that kept him going . Like two cowboys , they spent their lives sizing each other up . Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of Brokeback Mountain for the two elderly cowboys . Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust @-@ ups . " 
 Reflecting on the feud in 2006 , Roache gave reasons why he thinks Ken and Mike clashed so often : " Ken felt threatened when Mike arrived on the street , but it made the part more exciting for Bill . Ken is a nice guy , a loyal guy , a reliable guy . But he isn 't terribly exciting . So the exciting guy [ Mike ] comes along and he 's a bit flash , isn 't he ? But I 've always liked the physical side of acting , so my punch @-@ ups with Johnny were probably the best bits . I shall miss those terribly . "

 In September 2010 , coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Coronation Street , BBC Four aired a drama film entitled The Road to Coronation Street , which depicted Tony Warren 's struggle to get his soap opera commissioned , and the filming of its pilot . Ken Barlow appeared in the film and was played by Roache 's son , James . 
 In 2011 , ITV filmed a spin @-@ off , web @-@ based series featuring Ken and Deirdre , entitled Ken and Deirdre 's Bedtime Stories . Created by Coronation Street writer Jonathan Harvey , the webisodes featured Ken and Deirdre mulling over the events of their day while in bed . Roache said , " Each episode has been carefully crafted and injected with humour , warmth and drama . The content takes Coronation Street into new and exciting territory which , for me personally , is thoroughly exciting to be a part of . " 
 In 2010 a comedy play about Coronation Street was released entitled Corrie ! , penned by scriptwriter Jonathan Harvey . Ken Barlow was played by Simon Chadwick in the production . Harvey has suggested that when he researched the play , in the top five storylines for each of the 50 years of Coronation Street , three characters regularly featured — Ken , Deirdre and Gail Platt . Harvey therefore tried to shape the play around their journeys over the years . 
 In February 2011 Ken was among various Coronation Street characters to have his portrait auctioned for charity in the exhibition ' Behind the Street ' at Manchester 's Generation Pop Gallery . The black @-@ and @-@ white shots were taken by photographer Rob Evans , and raised £ 8 @,@ 600 for charity . The highest bid on a photograph was for a shot of Ken , standing amongst rubble after the Weatherfield tram crash in 2010 , a storyline marking the show 's 50th anniversary . In 2010 ITV began selling Coronation Street merchandise featuring Ken , including gift wrap and novelty congratulations cards . 
 A parody song written about the character , entitled " Ken ! " , was included on Harry Hill 's debut album , Funny Times . The track features vocals from Hill and Roache . Ken has been spoofed by Jon Culshaw in The Impressions Show , where he is having a secret affair with Pat Evans from EastEnders , spoofed by Debra Stephenson . Culshaw wanted to include his impression of Ken in the show , saying " We were just looking for an excuse to get him in " , so he decided that Ken and Pat would have a " secret romantic tryst at a motorway service station " somewhere between Weatherfield and the EastEnders ' setting of Walford . 
 In May 2012 , Trisha Ward 's stage musical , Street of Dreams , debuted . The production , which is based on Coronation Street , featured Roache playing his on @-@ screen alias , Ken , in a pre @-@ recorded segment . Roache was one of several actors from the television series to feature in the musical . Others included Julie Goodyear , Kevin Kennedy and Brian Capron ( who played Bet Gilroy , Curly Watts and Richard Hillman respectively ) .

 For his portrayal of Ken , Roache won the Lifetime Achievement award at the British Soap Awards in 1999 . In November 2010 , Ken surpassed Bob Hughes ( Don Hastings ) from US soap opera As the World Turns to become the longest @-@ serving soap opera actor . Roache was honoured at a Guinness World Records ceremony in New York . In 1983 , Roache , Kirkbride and Briggs were named TV Personalities of the Year at the Pye Colour Television Awards , for their performances in the Ken – Deirdre – Mike love triangle storyline . Journalist Brian Viner of The Independent has suggested that Roache has not been given the accolades he has deserved as a performer because of his longevity in the role of Ken . He felt that it may be a common assumption that Roache is merely playing himself on @-@ screen ; this notion diminishes a " rather remarkable acting performance " . He added , " although the bouquets tend to go to actors who repeatedly display their versatility , it is in many ways even harder to inhabit one role for five decades . That said , for sheer staying power Ken and Bill are clearly indivisible : one has lived in the same street practically all his life , the other in the same role [ ... ] . That we have been able to watch the evolution of that young man into the Ken Barlow we know today , no less self @-@ righteous but with 50 years of experiences behind him , is frankly one of the wonders of British television . " 
 Ken has a reputation for being boring . The British band Half Man Half Biscuit highlighted this point in their 2001 song " Lark Descending " , comparing Ken Barlow <unk> with a member of the US underground music scene , with the lyric : " I could have been like Lou Barlow , but I 'm more like Ken Barlow " . Despite Ken being fictional , critic Jim Shelley writing for the Daily Mirror in 2009 labelled Ken " the most boring man you could ever meet " . Roache sued for libel in 1990 when The Sun newspaper ran an article branding Ken boring and making allegations that Roache was disliked among the cast of Coronation Street . Roache said to the jury at the court case , " I felt extremely distressed . I could not believe those words had been written , that they had raked into my past . I broke out in a sweat . [ ... ] They were saying that I was not doing my job , that I was a joke to the storyline writers , which is not true " . Roache added in regard to Ken , " If people find someone who has had 23 girlfriends and three wives boring , that 's fine by me . " Roache won the case and was awarded £ 50 @,@ 000 ; however , he was forced to pay legal costs , which bankrupted him . Brian Viner has suggested that it is remarkable that Ken has been labelled boring in spite of the many plots he has been involved with over the years . Brian Viner said , " It is easy enough to see , despite the extraordinary number of broken relationships and personal crises in his wake , why Ken tends not to make the pulse race when he opens his mouth . After all , he usually opens it only to drink halves of bitter , or to say something sensible or worthy . For 50 years he has been the nearest thing Weatherfield , the fictional area of Greater Manchester where Coronation Street is located , has had to a social conscience . " 
 In a Channel 4 televised poll that was broadcast in 2001 , Ken Barlow was voted the third most @-@ hated TV character of all time , coming behind Phil Mitchell from EastEnders and Mr Blobby . In a Radio Times poll of over 5 @,@ 000 people in 2004 , 15 % chose Ken as the soap character they would most like to see retired . He came second in the poll , behind EastEnders ' Den Watts ( 17 % ) . 
 Television personality Paul O 'Grady wrote the foreword to Roache 's 2010 autobiography , 50 Years on the Street . In it , he hailed Ken as " one of the iconic British soap characters " , an all @-@ time great who has been integral to Coronation Street . In 2005 , Grace Dent of The Guardian suggested that Coronation Street archetypes have influenced latter soap opera characters . On Ken , she stated : " another heavily plagiarised Corrie stalwart is Ken Barlow , who as ' resident intellectual ' has been looking down his nose at the proletariat since 1960 . Just like poor hangdog @-@ faced Ken , brainy people in soapland ( Dr Truman [ from EastEnders ] , Roy Cropper , Todd Grimshaw [ both from Coronation Street ] , Emmerdale 's Ethan the curate ) are always miserable and brooding , due to the terrible burden of their mighty intellect in the face of so many <unk> . It rarely pays to be too clever or too rich in soapland as the majority of plotlines rely upon tragic Shakespearian falls from grace which everyone laughs their socks off at . " 
 In 2009 , viewers complained to ITV as well as the media regulator Ofcom after Coronation Street broadcast scenes in which Ken made derogatory comments about Christianity . A spokesperson for the show defended the opinions expressed by Ken in the scripts , saying , " Coronation Street is a soap opera set in modern society and therefore represents views from all side of the religious spectrum " . The Guardian columnist Nancy Banks @-@ Smith spoke highly of Ken 's affair with Martha Fraser in 2009 , calling it " a muted ingenious storyline " . Gareth McLean of the Radio Times was critical of the storyline : " When it comes to self @-@ delusion , Ken takes the biscuit , claims the cake and <unk> down the <unk> . Nursing the notion that he 's been thwarted by life , he decides to leave Deirdre to sail off into the sunset – or possibly Runcorn – with Martha . All these years and Ken still doesn 't realise it 's not Deirdre who 's the dead weight in his life , it 's he himself . " The BBC have said : " During his record @-@ breaking time on the hit soap , Roache 's character has led a life full of incident " . Holy Soap suggested that Ken being labelled a gigolo in the local newspaper after his client , Babs , died halfway through eating her meal , was his most memorable moment . Jaci Stephen , writing for the Daily Mail , said that soap operas are mostly a " cultural wasteland " , but suggested that Ken was the exception as he read broadsheet newspapers and books . In her book Soap Opera , Hobson said Ken and his brother David initially represented the younger males of society . She noted that although Ken had many relationships , " he could hardly be described as an early ' Dirty Den ' " , a character notable for his womanising in the soap opera , EastEnders . 
 = Hurricane Gladys ( 1968 ) = 
 Hurricane Gladys was the first Atlantic hurricane to be observed each by the Hurricane Hunters , radar imagery , and photographs from space . The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane ( including one unnamed hurricane ) of the 1968 season , Gladys formed on October 13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave . The storm moved north @-@ northwestward , becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October 16 . Gladys later reached peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October 19 . The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward , passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20 . The next day , Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia . 
 In Cuba , the threat of the hurricane prompted widespread evacuations . Gladys caused flash flooding and heavily damaged the tobacco crop . Damage in the country was estimated at $ 12 million ( 1968 USD ) , and there were six deaths . While passing west of the Florida Keys , the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the Dry Tortugas , but damage was minor . Near where Gladys made landfall , winds gusted to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and tides reached 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) above normal . There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast , while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages . Across the state , damage was estimated at $ 6 @.@ 7 million ( 1968 USD ) , and three people were indirectly killed . Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding . When paralleling just off the coast of North Carolina , Gladys was responsible for breaking the state 's worst drought since 1932 , and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there . Later , Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in Prince Edward Island . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Gladys were from a tropical wave – a trough embedded in the trade winds – that moved across the Lesser Antilles on October 6 . For the next few days , the wave moved across the Caribbean Sea without any development . As the wave interacted with the intertropical convergence zone , a large area of convection persisted across the region , spawning a series of low pressure areas . One became a tropical depression near Swan Island offshore Honduras on October 11 , and two days later another tropical depression formed near San Andrés island in the extreme southwestern Caribbean . The latter system , which would eventually become Gladys , moved slowly north @-@ northwestward . An anticyclone in the region caused wind shear to decrease , allowing for gradual development . On October 15 , a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) ; on that basis , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gladys . 
 After becoming a tropical storm , Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the Isle of Youth on October 16 . Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba . By the time the hurricane reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico , a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast . Gladys turned more to the north , passing just west of the Dry Tortugas , before resuming its north @-@ northwest trajectory , possibly due to a mid @-@ level low near Alabama . Around that time , the eye was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida , and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation being over the state . Early on October 19 , Gladys made landfall near Homosassa after turning to the northeast , with peak winds estimated at 85 mph ( 130 km / h ) . It accelerated across the state due to the approaching trough , emerging into the Atlantic near St. Augustine . Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States , Gladys passed just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20 , although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery . The approaching trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics , and on October 21 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia . A few hours later , the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front . 
 Hurricane Gladys was active during the Apollo 7 spaceflight mission , and astronauts aboard took several pictures of the hurricane . Later , researchers were able to compare the photographs to airforce reconnaissance data , radar , and local weather networks , the first such hurricane to be observed with such varied data . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In advance of the storm , Cuban officials forced about 36 @,@ 000 residents to evacuate from low @-@ lying areas , along with 35 @,@ 000 livestock . All flights were canceled in and out of Havana during the storm 's passage . Many classes were canceled in the region , and workers took steps to minimize damage to the tobacco crop . 
 Shortly after Gladys became a tropical storm , the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys and later a hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater . After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico , the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key , with a watch to St. Marks . Later , hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston , South Carolina to Hatteras , North Carolina . Before Gladys made landfall in Florida , all schools in Pinellas County were closed , and officials evacuated 60 jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi . The HMS Sirius , which was visiting St. Petersburg , rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico . The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm , and about 40 @,@ 000 people evacuated their homes during the storm 's passage . Then @-@ governor Claude R. Kirk , Jr. ordered 100 Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work . Shelters were set up in North Carolina , although few people evacuated . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Before its first landfall in Cuba , Gladys produced wind gusts of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at Nueva Gerona on the Isle of Youth . Rainfall on the island was estimated at 8 @.@ 49 in ( 216 mm ) . On the Cuban mainland , a station in Havana reported gale force winds for several hours . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall , causing flash flooding that damaged factories and crops ; the tobacco crop sustained heavy losses to the extent that the Monthly Weather Review described it as " virtually wiped out " . In Havana , floodwaters from the storm wrecked houses and other buildings , while in San Antonio de los Baños , residents required rescue from their flooded houses . After the storm , Cuban officials advised residents in Havana to boil their water to prevent the spread of disease , after water lines were damaged . At least 36 @,@ 000 people were left homeless as a result of the storm . Throughout Cuba , Gladys caused $ 12 million in damage and six deaths . 
 While Gladys was still moving northward offshore Florida , it produced winds of 64 mph ( 103 km / h ) on the Dry Tortugas , with gusts to 86 mph ( 138 km / h ) . Rainfall on the Dry Tortugas reached over 4 in ( 100 mm ) . Communications were briefly cut to the island during the storm . Along the Florida Keys , the only other report of a hurricane force wind gust was 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) on Plantation Key . Tides in the Florida Keys were about 0 @.@ 6 ft ( 0 @.@ 18 m ) above normal , and damage was minor in the region . 
 Farther north in Florida , hurricane @-@ force winds were limited to a small area from Clearwater to Bayport , with peak gusts of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Winds in eastern Florida were not as strong . Gladys produced moderate rainfall across the state , peaking at 12 @.@ 46 in ( 316 mm ) at Cape Canaveral . Rainfall was generally less than 6 in ( 150 mm ) , which limited flooding . The hurricane produced high tides near where it made landfall , reaching 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) above normal ; this caused heavy beach erosion and coastal flooding . The town of Sunset Beach was almost entirely under water during the high storm tides . Elsewhere , the high waves wrecked boat houses , and portions of the seawall were washed out in Tierra Verde . Gladys also spawned two tornadoes in the state , one each in Boca Raton and Palatka . The one in Boca Raton damaged a warehouse , while a waterspout in Whitfield Estates damaged three homes . According to locals , several other tornadoes touched down in Volusia and Putnam counties , based on the falling of trees and visible twisting trail of damage Across Florida , Gladys downed many trees and power lines , and the NHC office briefly lost power for two hours . Gladys affected about 85 % of the citrus crop to some degree , although crop damage was fairly minimal , with about 10 % lost in Pinellas and west Pasco counties . There was widespread property damage due to the strong winds , particularly to mobile homes . Strong winds in Pinellas County knocked over trailers and damaged billboards . In Ocala , most roads were blocked by fallen trees and power lines . Wind damage was minor in northeastern Florida , despite a wind gust of 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) in Jacksonville . Two people died in the state due to storm @-@ induced heart attacks , and another person died after driving into a flooded ditch . Damage in the state totaled $ 6 @.@ 7 million , mostly to private property , and due to the damage , portions of the state were later declared a federal disaster area . The Small Business Administration authorized low @-@ interest loans to homes and businesses damaged during the storm . 
 Outside of Florida , Gladys produced rainfall through Delaware , with a maximum of 13 @.@ 80 in ( 351 mm ) in Marion , South Carolina . In the state , the rains caused minor river flooding and left minor damage to the cotton crop , while high tides eroded beaches . In North Carolina , wind gusts peaked at 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) at Cape Lookout , while sustained winds reached 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) at Nags Head before the anemometer blew away . The strongest winds were only along the immediate coastline due to the hurricane passing offshore . Gladys produced above @-@ normal tides of 2 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) . The storm knocked two houses off their foundations and severely damaged a business and a mobile home . Rainfall in the state helped end break the worst drought since 1932 , and the minimal storm damage was offset by the beneficial precipitation . In southeastern Virginia , the fringes of the storm produced wind gusts of 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) and light rainfall in Norfolk . Farther inland , rains from Gladys caused the Roanoke River to rise 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) near Roanoke , just below flood stage . Tides were about 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) above normal in the state , low enough to prevent major coastal flooding . 
 Later , the extratropical remnants of Gladys produced beneficial rainfall of 2 to 4 in ( 51 to 102 mm ) over Atlantic Canada , peaking at 5 @.@ 03 in ( 128 mm ) in New Brunswick . In the province , the former hurricane also produced 1 @.@ 38 in ( 35 mm ) of snow in <unk> . Precipitation from the storm spread as far west as Quebec and as far northeast as Newfoundland , causing flooding in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia . Wind gusts in the latter province peaked at 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) in Sydney . Along Cape Breton Island , the remnants of Gladys killed one person and injured four . In Prince Edward Island , wind gusts reached 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) in Charlottetown , strong enough to knock over a tree and kill a man driving in Alberton . The storm washed out a portion of a bridge near Alberton and part of a wharf in <unk> , and damaged 35 boats . Ferry service was disrupted between the Canadian Maritime provinces . 
 = Solomon P. Sharp = 
 Solomon Porcius Sharp ( August 22 , 1787 – November 7 , 1825 ) was an American attorney and politician , serving as attorney general of Kentucky and a member of the United States Congress and the Kentucky General Assembly . His murder by Jereboam O. Beauchamp in 1825 is referred to as the Beauchamp – Sharp Tragedy or " The Kentucky Tragedy . " 
 Sharp began his political career representing Warren County , in the Kentucky House of Representatives . He briefly served in the War of 1812 , then returned to Kentucky and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1813 . He was re @-@ elected to a second term , though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816 . Allied with Kentucky 's Debt Relief Party , he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817 ; in 1821 , he accepted Governor John Adair 's appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky . Adair 's successor , Joseph Desha , re @-@ appointed him to this position . In 1825 , Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House . 
 In 1820 , rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a stillborn illegitimate child with Anna Cooke , a planter 's daughter . Sharp denied the charge , and the immediate political effects were minimal . When the charges were repeated during Sharp 's 1825 General Assembly campaign , opponents publicized the allegation that the child was a mulatto . Whether Sharp made such a claim , or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies , remains in doubt . Jereboam Beauchamp , who had married Cooke in 1824 , avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7 , 1825 . Sharp 's murder inspired fictional works , most notably Edgar Allan Poe 's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren 's novel World Enough and Time ( 1950 ) . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Solomon Sharp was born on August 22 , 1787 , at Abingdon , Washington County , Virginia . He was the fifth child and third son of Captain Thomas and Jean ( Maxwell ) Sharp , a Scottish woman . Through the male line he was a great @-@ great @-@ grandson of John Sharp , Archbishop of York . His father Thomas Sharp was a veteran of the Revolutionary War , participating in the Battle of King 's Mountain . The family briefly moved to the area near Nashville , Tennessee , and to North Carolina , before settling permanently about 1795 at Russellville , Logan County , where they lived in a log cabin near the Muddy River . 
 Sharp " [ intermittently attended ] one of Logan County 's academies " during his childhood years ; the schools of Logan County were primitive then . He read the law and was admitted to the bar in 1806 . He opened a practice in Russellville , but soon relocated to the busier Warren County seat of Bowling Green , which had 154 residents in 1810 . He engaged in land speculation , sometimes in partnership with his brother , Dr. Leander Sharp , and by 1824 , had acquired 11 @,@ 000 acres , mostly north of the Barren River in Warren County . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 After getting established , on December 17 , 1818 , Sharp at the age of 31 married Eliza T. Scott , the daughter of a physician who had served as an officer in the War of 1812 . She was from Frankfort and above him in social standing . They had three children together . He moved the family to the state capital of Frankfort in 1820 for his political career . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1809 , Sharp was elected to represent Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives . During his tenure , he supported the legislature 's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate , the creation of a state lottery , and the creation of an academy in Barren County . He served on a number of committees , and for a time , served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly 's second session . He was re @-@ elected in 1810 and 1811 . By 1810 , the county had nearly 12 @,@ 000 residents . During the 1811 session , Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers and attorneys at law would not be involved in dueling . He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves . 
 Sharp 's political service was interrupted by the War of 1812 . On September 18 , 1812 , he enlisted as a private in the Kentucky militia , serving under Lieutenant Colonel Young Ewing . Twelve days later , in a rapid rise even for the militia , he was promoted to major and made a part of Ewing 's staff . Ewing 's unit was put under the command of general Samuel Hopkins during his ineffective expedition against the Shawnee . In total , the expedition lasted forty @-@ two days and never engaged the enemy . Sharp recognized the value of a record of military service in Kentucky politics , however ; he was eventually was promoted to the rank of colonel . 
 = = = U.S. Representative = = = 
 In 1812 , Sharp was elected to the Thirteenth Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives and took his seat at the age of 25 , the minimum for election . Aligning with the War Hawks , he defended President James Madison 's decision to lead the country into the war , and supported a proposal to offer 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 156 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 405 km2 ) of land to any British deserters . Sharp also " [ passionately denounced ] Federalist obstruction of the war effort " . In a speech on April 8 , 1813 , he opposed indemnity for those defrauded in the Yazoo land scandal in Mississippi . He allied with South Carolina 's John C. Calhoun in supporting the Second Bank of the United States . 
 Sharp was re @-@ elected to the Fourteenth Congress , during which he served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims . He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson . The measure , which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session , was unpopular with the voters of his district . When the next congressional session opened in December 1816 , Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law , but the damage was already done ; he lost his seat in the House in the next election . 
 In 1817 , Sharp was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives . During his term , he supported measures for internal improvements , but opposed the creation of a state health board and a proposal to open the state 's vacant lands to the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the War of 1812 . Most notably , he supported the creation of 46 new banks in the state , and proposed a tax on the branches of the Bank of the United States in Lexington and Louisville . 
 = = = Accusations of illegitimate child = = = 
 In May or June 1820 , Anna Cooke , an unmarried planter 's daughter in her early 30s , claimed that Sharp was the father of her illegitimate child ; Sharp denied her claim . The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin , and some speculated that it was a mulatto , with a black father . After her father 's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County , Virginia , Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810 , when she may have met Sharp . In addition to losing the child , Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821 . 
 The scandal soon abated for Sharp , as Anna had a reputation as " a freethinker , reader of romantic fiction , and a libertine . " Although Sharp 's political opponents would continue to call attention to his putative child in future campaigns , his reputation remained largely untarnished . 
 = = = Attorney general of Kentucky = = = 
 In 1821 , Sharp began a campaign for a seat in the Kentucky Senate . His opponent , attorney John U. Waring , was a notably violent and contentious man , frequently in court because of altercations . ( In 1835 , he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson . ) 
 Waring sent two threatening letters to Sharp , and on June 18 , 1821 , published a handbill attacking Sharp 's character . Five days later , Sharp ceased campaigning for the senatorial seat . He accepted an appointment by Governor John Adair to the position of attorney general of Kentucky . Sharp 's nomination was unanimously confirmed by the legislature on October 30 , 1821 . 
 Sharp took office at a critical time Kentucky 's history . Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819 , state politicians had split into two camps : those who supported legislation favorable to debtors ( the Debt Relief Party ) and those who favored the protection of creditors ( typically called Anti @-@ <unk> . ) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party , as had Governor Adair . 
 In the 1824 presidential election , Sharp alienated some of his constituency by supporting his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky 's favorite son , Henry Clay . When it was clear that Calhoun 's bid would fail , Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson . He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2 , 1824 . 
 After Governor Adair 's term expired in 1825 , he was succeeded by another Relief Party member , General Joseph Desha . Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress , and Desha re @-@ appointed Sharp as attorney general . The Relief faction in the legislature passed several measures favorable to debtors , but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional . Unable to muster the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals , Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one , which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges . For a time , two courts claimed authority as Kentucky 's court of last resort ; this period was referred to as the Old Court @-@ New Court controversy . 
 Sharp 's role in the Relief Party 's plan to abolish the old court and replace it with a new , more favorable court is not known . As he was the administration 's chief legal counsel , historians believe he was closely involved . He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair . By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court , Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy . 
 On May 11 , 1825 , Sharp was chosen to represent the Desha administration in welcoming the Marquis de Lafayette , a hero of the American Revolution , to Kentucky . At a banquet in Lafayette 's honor three days later , Sharp toasted the guest of honor : " The People : Liberty will always be safe in their holy keeping . " Shortly following this event , Sharp resigned as attorney general , likely because Relief Party advocates thought he would be more useful as a member of the General Assembly . 
 The Anti @-@ Relief partisans nominated former Senator John J. Crittenden for one of the two seats apportioned to Franklin County in the state House . The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders , a prominent area lawyer . During the sharply contested campaign , both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby , a land speculator , said that Sharp 's life was at risk if he won . Opponents revived the charges of Sharp 's illegitimate child . It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke 's midwife to that effect ; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain . Despite the controversy , Sharp netted the most votes in the election , winning by 69 out of a total of 1600 votes cast in the county .

 " It was a land of the fiddle and whisky , sweat and prayer , pride and depravity . - Robert Penn Warren , World Enough and Time : A Romantic Novel ( 1950 ) 
 In the early hours of November 7 , 1825 , the day the General Assembly was to open its session , a man knocked on the door of Sharp 's residence . When Sharp answered the door , the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger . Sharp died at approximately two o 'clock in the morning . After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall , he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery . 
 Because of the bitterness of the campaign and the timing of the murder , speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti @-@ Relief partisan . For some time , rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death . Sharp 's political rival , John J. Crittenden , tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $ 3000 reward for the capture of the assassin . The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $ 1000 , and an additional $ 2000 reward was raised from private sources . In the 1825 session of the General Assembly , a measure to form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session . 
 In the investigation that followed , the evidence quickly pointed to Jereboam O. Beauchamp , 23 , who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824 . ( She was a contemporary of Sharp . ) On November 11 , 1825 , a four @-@ man posse arrested Beauchamp at his home in Franklin . 
 He was tried and convicted of Sharp 's murder on May 19 , 1826 . His sentence – execution by hanging – was to be carried out on June 16 , 1826 . Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a justification of his actions ; he continued to assert his avenging his wife 's honor . The request was granted , allowing Beauchamp to complete his book , The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp : who was hanged at Frankfort , Ky . , on the 7th day of July , 1826 , for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp . After two failed suicide attempts with his wife , who died as a result of the second incident , Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7 , 1826 . Beauchamp 's Confession was published in 1826 . Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix . Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author . 
 The following year , Sharp 's brother , Dr. Leander Sharp , wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp to defend him from the charges contained in Beauchamp 's confession . In Vindication , Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination : he named Patrick Darby , a partisan of the Anti @-@ Relief faction , as co @-@ conspirator with Beauchamp , an Anti @-@ Relief stalwart . Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication ; and Waring threatened to kill him . Heeding these threats , Sharp did not publish his work ; all extant manuscripts remained in his house , where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling .
