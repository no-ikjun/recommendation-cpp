 The leopard shark is aplacental viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained by a yolk sac until birth . In northern areas , females use bays and sloughs as nursery areas , while to the south they give birth in more open areas . Known breeding grounds along the coast of California include Humboldt Bay , Tomales Bay , Bodega Bay , San Francisco Bay , Elkhorn Slough , Morro Bay , Santa Monica Bay ( Los Angeles ) , Catalina Harbor ( Santa Catalina Island ) , and San Diego Bay . 
 Females give birth to 1 – 37 young annually from March and July ( most in April or May ) , with the number of pups increasing with female size . In Humboldt and San Francisco Bays , females drop their pups in beds of eelgrass that provide both shelter and food . In Catalina Harbor , females give birth on flats in 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) of water , their backs and dorsal fins exposed ; the pups stay in even shallower water less than 30 cm ( 12 in ) deep . Mating occurs in early summer following birth ; the only known observation of this in the wild was in 2004 off La Jolla , amongst nine sharks gathered 19 m ( 62 ft ) from shore in water 0 @.@ 3 – 3 m ( 0 @.@ 98 – 9 @.@ 84 ft ) deep . 
 Newborn leopard sharks measure around 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) long . Relatively slow @-@ growing after the first 3 – 4 years of life , male leopard sharks grow an average of 2 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) per year , reaching maturity at an age of 7 – 13 years and a length of 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 2 m ( 2 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 9 ft ) , while females grow an average of 2 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) per year , reaching maturity at an age of 10 – 15 years and a length of 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 3 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 3 ft ) . Individuals of the same age can vary significantly in size and large sharks are especially slow @-@ growing : one specimen was documented to have gained only 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) in length over 12 years . The maximum lifespan of this species is estimated to be 30 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Wary and quick to flee , leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans . There is a single record from 1955 of a leopard shark harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed , though no injuries resulted . This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines , and by recreational anglers and <unk> ; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls . The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold fresh or frozen . However , leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury , pesticides , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) within their bodies , and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife warns against eating them regularly . The leopard shark is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness ; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook @-@ and @-@ line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s . It may live for over 20 years in captivity . 
 Most of the fishing for leopard sharks occurs in the waters off California , where commercial landings peaked at 45 @,@ 953 kg ( 101 @,@ 309 lb ) in 1983 and has averaged 14 @,@ 060 kg ( 31 @,@ 000 lb ) annually since 1991 . These figures are believed to be underestimates , as an unknown portion of the leopard shark catch is recorded simply as " shark " . In recent decades the number of sharks taken recreationally has exceeded those taken commercially , with sport fishers catching an average of 52 @,@ 000 sharks per year from 1980 – 1988 , and 45 @,@ 000 sharks per year since 1993 . This species contributes negligibly to fishery landings off Oregon . The status of leopard sharks off Mexico is uncertain , although Mexican shark fisheries tend to focus more on larger species . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the leopard shark as of Least Concern . It is highly susceptible to local depletion due to its slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks . It was considered for , but is not managed under , the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council 's ( PMC ) 1982 <unk> Management Plan . In 1992 , the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of 91 cm ( 36 in ) and a possession limit of three fish , a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community . In 1993 , the State also instituted a minimum size limit of 46 cm ( 18 in ) for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays , including for the aquarium trade . In addition , Californian restrictions on the use of certain types of fishing gear in near @-@ shore waters confer good protection to this shark 's core population . These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s ; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure , with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3 – 6 % with sustainable fishing . 
 = 2016 Paris – Roubaix = 
 The 2016 Paris – Roubaix was a one @-@ day classic cycling race that took place on 10 April 2016 in northern France . It was the 114th edition of the Paris – Roubaix and was the tenth race of the 2016 UCI World Tour and the third monument of the season . 
 The race took place over 257 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 160 @.@ 0 mi ) . The principal difficulty was provided by the 27 sectors of cobbled roads , which cover a total distance of 52 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 32 @.@ 8 mi ) . The difficult conditions caused by the cobbles have earned the race the name " the Hell of the North " . It came at the end of the cobbled classics season , a week after the 2016 Tour of Flanders ; the favourites included the winner of that race , Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) , as well as Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) and Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . 
 The race was hard from the very beginning , with major attacks being made over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) from the finish . Cancellara and Sagan were held up by crashes and a five @-@ rider group formed in the final 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) and , despite many more attacks in the closing part of the race , came to the velodrome in Roubaix together . The sprint was won by Mathew Hayman ( Orica – BikeExchange ) ahead of Boonen , with Ian Stannard ( Team Sky ) in third . 
 = = Route = = 
 The route of the 2016 Paris – Roubaix was not significantly changed from the 2015 edition . It was slightly longer at 257 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 160 @.@ 0 mi ) . There were 27 sectors of cobbled roads : these included one addition to the route , the uphill <unk> du <unk> sector . Several sections of cobbles , including the difficult one at Mons @-@ en @-@ Pévèle , had been renovated since 2015 . 
 Despite its name , the race did not start in Paris : it started in Compiègne ( 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) to the north ) and travelled generally north towards Roubaix . The main difficulty came from the 27 cobbled sectors , with a total distance of 52 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 32 @.@ 8 mi ) ; the race organisers gave these sectors a difficulty rating with the three five @-@ star sectors the most difficult and the one one @-@ star sector the easiest . The first 98 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 61 @.@ 2 mi ) were generally flat on normal roads , with the first sector coming between Troisvilles and <unk> . Over the following 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) , there were another eight cobbled sectors , before the first five @-@ star sector . This was the Trouée d 'Arenberg ( English : Arenberg Trench ) and was 2 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) in length . The riders turned back on themselves several times around Wallers to take in several more sectors . With the route again heading north , the riders crossed several more cobbled sectors – all rated as either three @-@ star or four @-@ star in difficulty – on the way to the next five @-@ star sector , a 3 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) road through Mons @-@ en @-@ Pévèle . At the end of this sector , there were 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) to the finish line . 
 After Mons @-@ en @-@ Pévèle , there were seven more cobbled sectors before the final five @-@ star sector . This was the 2 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) Carrefour de l 'Arbre ; by the end there were 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) to the finish line . This included three more cobbled sectors – two two @-@ star sectors and the final one @-@ star sector as the route entered Roubaix itself . The route ended on the Vélodrome André @-@ <unk> in Roubaix : the riders enter the velodrome half @-@ way round ; they ride one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half laps of the 500 @-@ metre ( 550 yd ) circuit to complete the race .

 As Paris @-@ Roubaix is a UCI World Tour event , all 18 UCI World Teams were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad . In February 2016 , the race organisers announced the seven UCI Professional Continental teams that had received wildcard invitations , completing the 25 @-@ team peloton . With each team allowed to enter up to eight riders , the maximum size of the peloton was 200 . Astana was the only team to submit just seven riders . Team Katusha 's Jacopo Guarnieri failed to start the race , so the race began with 198 riders . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The recent editions of Paris – Roubaix had been won in various ways . Seven of the previous ten editions had been won by riders who had made solo breakaways ; the most recent of these was Niki Terpstra in 2014 . Other editions had been won in small group sprints : there were three riders together at the finish in 2008 Paris – Roubaix , two riders in 2013 and six in 2015 . 
 John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) won the sprint in 2015 , but was unable to defend his title in the 2016 edition due to injuries sustained in a collision with a car during winter training . Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) , who finished third in 2015 , was also unable to start the race after breaking his collarbone in a crash at the Tour of Flanders the previous week . 
 The two principal favourites to win the race were Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) and Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) . Sagan , the reigning world champion , had won the Tour of Flanders ( the other monument raced on cobbled roads ) in a solo breakaway . He was able to win both from a breakaway and in a group sprint . Sagan 's best previous result in Paris – Roubaix was his sixth @-@ place finish in 2014 . Cancellara had won the race on three previous occasions ( in 2006 , 2010 and 2013 ) and had finished in the top ten on five other occasions . Cancellara was racing in his final Paris – Roubaix , after announcing that he would retire at the end of the 2016 season . 
 One of Cancellara 's main rivals in classics races over his career was Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who had won Paris – Roubaix on four occasions in the past . He had not been in strong form , however , in the 2016 season and had struggled with a wrist injury in the Tour of Flanders . His team , however , was very strong , with Terpstra , Stijn Vandenbergh and Zdeněk Štybar all possible winners of the race . 
 Other possible winners included Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , who was third in the Tour of Flanders , Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , Lars Boom ( Astana ) , Ian Stannard ( Team Sky ) and Edvald Boasson Hagen ( Team Dimension Data ) . 
 = = Race summary = = 
 There was a high @-@ speed start to the race , with several groups attempting to form breakaways ; each was chased by the main peloton . An initial group of six riders was caught within 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) of the start ; a group of 25 then briefly held a 30 @-@ second lead before they were recaptured by the peloton . After several more attacks and a total of 67 kilometres ( 42 mi ) , the riders were still all together in one group . A group of sixteen riders then attacked and built a lead , despite the efforts of the Etixx – Quick @-@ Step and Bora – Argon 18 teams to chase it . As the riders arrived on the first cobbled sectors , Sky took over at the front of the peloton to protect their riders and the breakaway 's advantage increased to two minutes , although it was reduced to fourteen riders . The riders in the breakaway were Sylvain Chavanel ( Direct Énergie ) , Mathew Hayman and Magnus Cort ( Orica – BikeExchange ) , Jelle Wallays ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Yaroslav Popovych ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Johan Le Bon ( FDJ ) , Marko Kump ( Lampre – Merida ) , Tim Declercq ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , Salvatore Puccio ( Sky ) , <unk> Janse van Rensburg ( Dimension Data ) , Frederik <unk> ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) , Maxime Daniel ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Borut Božič ( Cofidis ) and Imanol Erviti ( Movistar Team ) . The breakaway was notable for the presence of Popovych , who had announced that the race would be the last of his career , and Erviti , who had finished in the top ten at the Tour of Flanders a week earlier having again been in the early breakaway . 
 With 140 kilometres ( 87 mi ) completed and more than 115 kilometres ( 71 mi ) remaining , there was a crash in the peloton before the eighth cobbled sector . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step immediately sent Tony Martin and Guillaume Van <unk> to the front of the group and accelerated hard ; this caused the group to split up . The front group included Boonen , Boasson Hagen , Stannard , Rowe and Vanmarcke along with several others , with Sagan , Cancellara , Štybar and Terpstra all in a chasing group . LottoNL – Jumbo had six riders in the front group . The gap between the first and second chasing groups quickly grew to a minute , thanks in particular to Martin 's work ; he spent around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) at the front of Boonen 's group . Martin 's effort reduced the group to five riders , with Vanmarcke and Rowe among the riders dropped . As they reached the Trouée d 'Arenberg , the break had just over a minute 's lead over the first chasing group ; the Vanmarcke group was around 20 seconds behind them , with Cancellara and Sagan in another group that was around a minute further back . Sagan himself was making efforts at the front of the group to try to bring the first chase group back . 
 With 87 kilometres ( 54 mi ) remaining , Vanmarcke 's group merged with Boonen 's , forming a 16 @-@ man group that was 55 seconds behind the breakaway group . Alexander Kristoff had punctured and been dropped from the group containing Cancellara and Sagan . Over the following kilometres , Hayman attacked solo from the breakaway ; meanwhile , Jasper Stuyven ( Trek – Segafredo ) rode hard to bring his teammate Cancellara back to within 40 seconds of the first chasing group . Hayman was brought back by the rest of the group , while Popovych dropped back from the breakaway to help Cancellara 's group with 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) remaining . After the next cobbled sector , Boonen 's group caught the remainder of the breakaway and formed a group of around 20 riders , led by Team Sky , that was around 50 seconds ahead of the Cancellara group . 
 Cancellara and Sagan worked hard together at the front of what was now the second group on the road . Shortly afterwards , the front group was disrupted when three of the four Team Sky riders in the front group – Rowe , Puccio and Gianni <unk> – crashed in just a few corners , leaving Stannard as the team 's only rider in the leading group . With 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) remaining and the chasers 37 seconds behind the lead group , the riders crossed the five @-@ star Mons @-@ en @-@ Pévèle cobbles . Cancellara crashed on a muddy section , slipping off the crown of the road . Sagan , riding immediately behind him , managed to bunny hop over him – with only one foot clipped into his bike – and continued in pursuit of the lead group ; Cancellara , although able to continue the race , never rejoined the group . Terpstra was also among those to crash in the incident . Cycling Weekly described Sagan 's manoeuvre as " unbelievable bike handling " . 
 Rowe rejoined the leading group with Heinrich Haussler and <unk> Saramotins ( both IAM Cycling ) to form a ten @-@ man leading group which led Sagan 's group by over a minute with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) remaining . Rowe was tired after coming back from his crash ; he agreed to work fully for Stannard . He put in a strong effort with 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) remaining that dropped Erviti , Haussler , Saramotins and Marcel Sieberg ( Lotto – Soudal ) , who formed a chase group behind . A five @-@ man group then formed on the Camphin @-@ en @-@ Pévèle sector , with Stannard , Boonen , Boasson Hagen , Hayman and Vanmarcke the only riders remaining . Vanmarcke put in a big attack on the Carrefour de l 'Arbre ; although he briefly had a significant gap , the other four riders brought him back before the next section of cobbles . 
 Stannard attacked with 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) remaining . He had a 20 metres ( 20 yd ) advantage , but the group was able to come back to him . In the final 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , Boonen attacked several times . On the last of these attacks , Hayman accelerated past him and the two riders came together into the velodrome , with Vanmarcke joining soon afterwards . With one 500 @-@ metre ( 550 yd ) lap remaining , Stannard and Boasson Hagen rejoined the group . Hayman led out the sprint : Boonen was on his wheel and Stannard came around the outside . Neither was able to come around him and Hayman crossed the line first to take the victory . Boonen was second with Stannard third . Vanmarcke finished with them in fourth place ; Boasson Hagen was three seconds behind in fifth place . 
 The chase group of Haussler , Sieberg and Saramotins finished a minute back , with Erviti a further seven seconds back to finish in ninth . Sagan 's group arrived more than two minutes after Hayman , with Adrien Petit ( Direct Energie ) outsprinting Sagan for tenth place .

 The race was given widespread praise . Bernard Hinault , who won the race in 1981 , described it as " magnificent " . He particularly praised Etixx – Quick @-@ Step 's aggression a long way from the finish , describing it as the kind of move that used to exist but had not been seen in a long time . Similarly , Marc Madiot ( the manager of the FDJ team and the winner of the race in 1985 and 1991 ) described it as " a beautiful race , of great quality " and praised Hayman as " a fine winner " . VeloNews described it as an " epic battle " and as " one @-@ day racing at its absolute best " . The cycling journalist and former cyclist Daniel Lloyd tweeted that it had been " one of the best races I 've ever seen " ; David Millar , another former cyclist , wrote " That was exhausting " after watching the race . 
 Mathew Hayman described his reaction as " disbelief " . He had broken his arm in a crash at the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad at the beginning of the classics season and had barely raced before the race began . He said that he had realised that the other riders were not superior to him after they failed to get away from him in the closing kilometres . He stated that he could " gamble " and that it had paid off . Hayman 's team manager , Shayne <unk> , described him as " so professional " and suggested that he had been helped by good preparation and motivation combined with a lack of expectation ; he called it " an incredible ride " . 
 Boonen praised Hayman 's victory . He said that Hayman was " the rider nobody was really looking at " and that he had ridden a " good sprint " , although no one had much energy left by the velodrome ; Vanmarcke had faded in the final metres and boxed Boonen in at the bottom of the track . He stated that he had received a text message on the morning of the race from a doctor who had treated him after he fractured his skull in the 2015 Abu Dhabi Tour ; the doctor had said that the day of the race would be the first day that Boonen would be able to get back on his bike . He noted that he " couldn 't be unsatisfied " even though he had not won the race . Stannard described the race as " so close yet so far " and thought that he could have managed a better result than his third place had he not attacked in the final kilometres . He said that he was " super happy " to see Hayman win ; he also said that there were " two more steps to work my way up now " . 
 Fabian Cancellara finished his final Paris – Roubaix in 40th place , seven minutes behind Hayman . He said " I ’ m not sad , I ’ m happy not to be in hospital . I ’ m happy to have finished , " and that he was hurting all over – as well as crashing during the race , he had crashed in the velodrome – but said that he was " happy it is done " . Sagan described the race as " a crazy day " ; he said that he was lucky not to have crashed with Cancellara , but that his race was over at that point . He described Paris – Roubaix as " very hard to win " .

 Money No Enough ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a 1998 Singaporean comedy film about three friends with financial problems who start a car polishing business together . Written by Jack Neo , directed by Tay Teck Lock and produced by JSP Films , the movie stars Neo , Mark Lee and Henry Thia . Released in cinemas on 7 May 1998 , Money No Enough received mixed reviews from critics , but earned over S $ 5 @.@ 8 million and was the all @-@ time highest @-@ grossing Singaporean film until 2012 . Its success helped revive the Singaporean film industry and pave the way for the emergence of other Singaporean cultural phenomena .

 The plot revolves around the lives of three close friends : Keong ( Jack Neo ) , a spendthrift white @-@ collar worker , Ong ( Mark Lee ) , a general contractor , and Hui ( Henry Thia ) , a <unk> <unk> waiter . After an argument with his boss ( Chen Zhao Jin ) , Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English , lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy . With bills ( especially instalments ) to pay and a family to support , he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him , taking their daughter with her . Ong borrows S $ 40 @,@ 000 from loan sharks , and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away . The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two @-@ week deadline , so he flees to Johor Bahru . Hui , who is single and lives with his elderly mother , wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an insurance agent who he has a crush on . 
 In an attempt to resolve their financial problems , the three friends decide to start a car polishing business together with the limited capital they have . However , at the opening ceremony of their business , Hui 's mother collapses and is taken to hospital , where she is diagnosed with leukaemia . Hui has three wealthy older sisters , but they refuse to help pay the medical bills , and his application for financial assistance is rejected because of his sisters ' high incomes . To compound matters , the loan sharks show up at the company to harass Ong . Ong and Hui ask to cash out their shares so they can pay the loan sharks and medical bills respectively , but all their money has already been spent on equipment and other business running costs . Hui 's mother then dies and at her wake , which raises ten thousand dollars of ' bai jin ' ( contributions toward funeral expenses ) . The loan sharks turn up , pursue Ong and are arrested after a lengthy police chase . Keong convinces his wife and daughter to enter an obstacle race where they win the first prize of S $ 100 @,@ 000 , which he uses to pay his creditors , and his family is reunited . The car polishing business is successful , and the three friends go on to become the directors of <unk> Singapore . 
 = = Production = = 
 In the 1990s , Neo , Lee and Thia became well known in Singapore for their performances in the Channel 8 television show Comedy Night ( Wade @-@ Giles : Kao <unk> <unk> tung ) . Neo then acted in the 1997 Eric Khoo film 12 <unk> , and saw potential in the then virtually nonexistent local film industry . He wrote a screenplay about expatriates in the advertising industry , but decided the concept would not appeal to most Singaporeans , so he thought of writing a story about Ah <unk> ( uneducated Chinese men ) , drawing on the humble backgrounds of Lee , Thia and himself . Inspired , he contacted Tay Teck Lock , a former producer for Channel 8 , and suggested they collaborate . They decided on a plot about three Singaporean men facing financial difficulties . Neo spent eight months writing the script , while Tay helped develop the characters and jokes . Despite the Speak Mandarin Campaign , Neo chose to use Hokkien dialogue to " reflect real life " and " reach a different audience " . 
 Money No Enough was produced by JSP Films on a budget of S $ 850 @,@ 000 . The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director , J.P. Tan as producer , <unk> as cinematographer , A. <unk> as film editor , Anthony Ng as art director and Abdul <unk> Mohd as sound designer . Filming was plagued by financial problems , such as poor quality shooting equipment , confiscation of props that were not paid for , and a High Court petition against the producer which almost caused the project to be declared bankrupt . After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough , distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 . The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and JSP Films over their shares of the profits . To mark its tenth anniversary , Money No Enough was released in cinemas again and was followed by a sequel , Money No Enough 2 .

 Money No Enough earned S $ 50 @,@ 000 from sneak previews and S $ 42 @,@ 000 on its opening day , then topped the local box office for a month . In total , the film made S $ 5 @.@ 8 million , which remained the best box @-@ office showing by a local movie until the record was broken by Ah Boys to Men in 2012 . After its box office run , 70 @,@ 000 VCDs of Money No Enough were sold , which remains a record for a Singaporean film . Its success sparked the film career of Jack Neo , who won the Best Director Award at the 1998 Silver Screen Awards , and the development of the Singaporean film industry . Four more Singaporean movies were produced in 1998 , two of which were described by critics as copycats of Money No Enough . With its use of Hokkien and crude portrayal of Singaporean life , the film is also credited with paving the way for other Singaporean cultural phenomena such as <unk> and <unk> . 
 The movie received a mixed critical reception with LoveHKFilm.com commending the film as " an effective satire of ... Singaporean culture " and noted that the actors " do a credible job representing characters from Singapore 's varying social strata " , while a Variety review described the movie as " initially fresh and amusing but ultimately too one @-@ note and local in its humor to travel far " . Francis Dass of the New Straits Times wrote that Money No Enough was " spot @-@ on " and " funny " , but criticised the " clichéd script and the director 's penchant for melodrama " . 
 = Hoysala Empire = 
 The Hoysala empire was a prominent Southern Indian Kannadiga empire that ruled most of the modern @-@ day state of Karnataka between the 10th and the 14th centuries . The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at Belur but was later moved to Halebidu . 
 The Hoysala rulers were originally from Malnad Karnataka , an elevated region in the Western Ghats range . In the 12th century , taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the then ruling Western Chalukyas and Kalachuri kingdoms , they annexed areas of present @-@ day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the Kaveri River delta in present @-@ day Tamil Nadu . By the 13th century , they governed most of present @-@ day Karnataka , minor parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in Deccan India . 
 The Hoysala era was an important period in the development of art , architecture , and religion in South India . The empire is remembered today primarily for its temple architecture . Over a hundred surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka . 
 Well known temples " which exhibit an amazing display of sculptural exuberance " include the Chennakesava Temple at Belur , the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu , and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura . The Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts , encouraging literature to flourish in Kannada and Sanskrit . 
 = = History = = 
 Kannada folklore tells a tale of a young man Sala , who saved his Jain guru <unk> by striking dead a Lion he encountered near the temple of the Goddess <unk> at Angadi , now called <unk> . The word " strike " literally translates to " hoy " in Hale Kannada ( Old Kannada ) , hence the name " Hoy @-@ sala " . This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription of Vishnuvardhana ( 1117 ) , but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story it remains in the realm of folklore . The legend may have come into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana 's victory over the Cholas at Talakad as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical warrior Sala and a tiger , the tiger being the emblem of the Cholas . 
 Early inscriptions , dated 1078 and 1090 , have implied that the Hoysalas were descendants of the Yadava by referring to the Yadava <unk> ( clan ) as Hoysala <unk> . But there are no early records directly linking the Hoysalas to the Yadavas of North India . 
 Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of Malnad Karnataka , based on numerous inscriptions calling them Maleparolganda or " Lord of the Male ( hills ) chiefs " ( Malepas ) . This title in the Kannada language was proudly used by the Hoysala kings as their royal signature in their inscriptions . Literary sources from that time in Kannada ( Jatakatilaka ) and Sanskrit ( <unk> ) have also helped confirm they were natives of the region known today as Karnataka . 
 The first Hoysala family record is dated 950 and names <unk> as the chieftain , followed by <unk> and Nripa Kama I ( 976 ) . The next ruler , Munda ( 1006 – 1026 ) , was succeeded by Nripa Kama II who held such titles as <unk> that show an early alliance with the Western Ganga dynasty . From these modest beginnings , the Hoysala dynasty began its transformation into a strong subordinate of the Western Chalukyas . Through Vishnuvardhana 's expansive military conquests , the Hoysalas achieved the status of a real kingdom for the first time . He wrested Gangavadi from the Cholas in 1116 and moved the capital from Belur to Halebidu . 
 Vishnuvardhana 's ambition of creating an independent empire was fulfilled by his grandson Veera Ballala II , who freed the Hoysalas from subordination in 1187 – 1193 . Thus the Hoysalas began as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gradually established their own empire in Karnataka with such strong Hoysala kings as Vishnuvardhana , Veera Ballala II and later Veera Ballala III . During this time , peninsular India saw a four way struggle for hegemony – Pandya , Kakatiya and Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri being the other kingdoms . Veera Ballala II defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom . He assumed the title " <unk> of the Chola Kingdom " ( <unk> ) , " Emperor of the south " ( Dakshina Chakravarthi ) and " Hoysala emperor " ( Hoysala Chakravarthi ) . He founded the city of Bangalore according to Kannada folklore . 
 The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225 , making the city of <unk> <unk> near Srirangam a provincial capital and giving them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan . Vira Narasimha II 's son Vira Someshwara earned the honorific " uncle " ( <unk> ) from the Pandyas and Cholas . The Hoysala influence spread over Pandya kingdom also . Toward the end of the 13th century , Veera Ballala III recaptured territory in the Tamil country which had been lost to the Pandya uprising , thus uniting the northern and southern portions of the kingdom . 
 Major political changes were taking place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when significant areas of northern India were under Muslim rule . Alla @-@ ud @-@ din Khilji , the Sultan of Delhi , was determined to bring South India under his domain and sent his commander , Malik Kafur , on a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital Devagiri in 1311 . The Seuna empire was subjugated by 1318 and the Hoysala capital Halebidu ( also called <unk> or <unk> ) was sacked twice , in 1311 and 1327 . 
 By 1336 , the Sultan had conquered the Pandyas of Madurai , the Kakatiyas of Warangal and the tiny kingdom of Kampili . The Hoysalas were the only remaining Hindu empire who resisted the invading armies . Veera Ballala III stationed himself at Tiruvannamalai and offered stiff resistance to invasions from the north and the Sultanate of Madurai to the south . Then , after nearly three decades of resistance , Veera Ballala III was killed at the battle of Madurai in 1343 , and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by Harihara I in the Tungabhadra region . This new Hindu kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and come to be known as the Vijayanagara Empire . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Hoysala administration supported itself through revenues from an agrarian economy . The kings gave grants of land as rewards for service to beneficiaries who then became landlords to tenants producing agricultural goods and forest products . There were two types of landlords ( gavunda ) ; gavunda of people ( <unk> gavunda ) was lower in status than the wealthy lord of gavundas ( prabhu gavunda ) . The highlands ( malnad regions ) with its temperate climate was suitable for raising cattle and the planting of orchards and spices . Paddy and corn were staple crops in the tropical plains ( <unk> ) . The Hoysalas collected taxes on irrigation systems including tanks , reservoirs with sluices , canals and wells which were built and maintained at the expense of local villagers . Irrigation tanks such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> were created at the expense of the state . 
 Importing horses for use as general transportation and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard . The forests were harvested for rich woods such as teak which was exported through ports located in the area of present @-@ day Kerala . Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China , indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms . South India exported textiles , spices , medicinal plants , precious stones , pottery , salt made from salt pans , jewels , gold , ivory , rhino horn , ebony , aloe wood , perfumes , sandalwood , camphor and condiments to China , Dhofar , Aden , and Siraf ( the <unk> to Egypt , Arabia and Persia ) . Architects ( <unk> ) , sculptors , quarry workers , goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities . 
 The village assembly was responsible for collecting government land taxes . Land revenue was called <unk> and included the original assessment ( Kula ) plus various <unk> . Taxes were levied on professions , marriages , goods in transit on chariots or carriages , and domesticated animals . Taxes on commodities ( gold , precious stones , perfumes , sandalwood , ropes , yarn , housing , hearths , shops , cattle pans , sugarcane presses ) as well as produce ( black pepper , betel leaves , ghee , paddy , spices , palm leaves , coconuts , sugar ) are noted in village records . The village assembly could levy a tax for a specific purpose such as construction of a water tank . 
 = = Administration = = 
 In its administrative practices , the Hoysala Empire followed some of the well @-@ established and proven methods of its predecessors covering administrative functions such as cabinet organisation and command , the structure of local governing bodies and the division of territory . Records show the names of many high @-@ ranking positions reporting directly to the king . Senior ministers were called Pancha <unk> , ministers responsible for foreign affairs were designated <unk> and the chief treasurer was <unk> or <unk> . <unk> were in charge of armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the <unk> . 
 The kingdom was divided into provinces named Nadu , Vishaya , Kampana and Desha , listed in descending order of geographical size . Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister ( Mahapradhana ) and a treasurer ( Bhandari ) that reported to the ruler of that province ( Dandanayaka ) . Under this local ruler were officials called <unk> and Gavundas who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land . Subordinate ruling clans such as Alupas continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire . 
 An elite and well trained force of bodyguards known as <unk> protected the members of the royal family at all times . These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master , their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death . Hero stones ( virgal ) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars . The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of <unk> <unk> , a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II . 
 King Vishnuvardhana 's coins had the legends " victor at <unk> " ( <unk> ) , " victor at Talakad " ( <unk> ) , " chief of the Malepas " ( Maleparolganda ) , " Brave of <unk> " ( <unk> ) in Hoysala style Kannada script . Their gold coin was called <unk> or <unk> and weighed 62 grains of gold . Pana or Hana was a tenth of the <unk> , Haga was a fourth of the Pana and Visa was fourth of Haga . There were other coins called <unk> and Kani . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnavism and Lingayatism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism . Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara 's Advaita philosophy . The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at Dambal and Balligavi . <unk> Devi , queen of Vishnuvardhana , was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe <unk> temple in Belur , evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions . 
 During the rule of the Hoysalas , three important religious developments took place in present @-@ day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers , Basava , Madhvacharya and Ramanuja . 
 While the origin of Lingayatism is debated , the movement grew through its association with Basava in the 12th century . Madhvacharya was critical of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion . His philosophy gained popularity enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi . Ramanuja , head of the Vaishnava monastery in Srirangam , preached the way of devotion ( bhakti marga ) and wrote <unk> , a critique on the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankara . 
 The impact of these religious developments on culture , literature , poetry and architecture in South India was profound . Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written during the coming centuries . The Saluva , Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the <unk> area of Vijayanagara . Scholars in the later Kingdom of Mysore wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the teachings of Ramanuja . King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism . The later saints of Madhvacharya 's order , Jayatirtha , Vyasatirtha , <unk> , Vadirajatirtha and devotees ( dasa ) such as Vijaya Dasa , <unk> and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide . His teachings inspired later day philosophers like Vallabha Acharya in Gujarat and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal . Another wave of devotion ( bhakti ) in the 17th century – 18th century found inspiration in his teachings . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 Hoysala society in many ways reflected the emerging religious , political and cultural developments of those times . During this period , the society became increasingly sophisticated . The status of women was varied . Some royal women were involved in administrative matters as shown in contemporary records describing Queen <unk> 's administration of Halebidu in the absence of Veera Ballala II during his long military campaigns in northern territories . She also fought and defeated some antagonistic feudal rebels . Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts , such as Queen <unk> Devi 's skill in dance and music , and the 12th century Vachana poet and Lingayatism mystic Akka Mahadevi 's devotion to the bhakti movement is well known . Temple dancers ( Devadasi ) were common and some were well educated and accomplished in the arts . These qualifications gave them more freedom than other urban and rural women who were restricted to daily mundane tasks . The practice of sati in a voluntary form was prevalent and prostitution was socially acceptable . As in most of India , the Indian caste system was conspicuously present . 
 Trade on the west coast brought many foreigners to India including Arabs , Jews , Persians , Chinese and people from the Malay Peninsula . Migration of people within Southern India as a result of the expansion of the empire produced an influx of new cultures and skills . In South India , towns were called Pattana or <unk> and the marketplace , Nagara or Nagaram , the marketplace serving as the nuclei of a city . Some towns such as Shravanabelagola developed from a religious settlement in the 7th century to an important trading center by the 12th century with the arrival of rich traders , while towns like Belur attained the atmosphere of a regal city when King Vishnuvardhana built the Chennakesava Temple there . Large temples supported by royal patronage served religious , social , and judiciary purposes , elevating the king to the level of " God on earth " . 
 Temple building served a commercial as well as a religious function and was not limited to any particular sect of Hinduism . Shaiva merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur , elevating Halebidu to an important city as well . Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects , the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions . Temples built by rich landlords in rural areas fulfilled fiscal , political , cultural and religious needs of the agrarian communities . Irrespective of patronage , large temples served as establishments that provided employment to hundreds of people of various guilds and professions sustaining local communities as Hindu temples began to take on the shape of wealthy Buddhist monasteries . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Although Sanskrit literature remained popular during the Hoysala rule , royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased . In the 12th century some works were written in the Champu style , but distinctive Kannada metres became more widely accepted . The Sangatya metre used in compositions , Shatpadi ( six line ) , Tripadi ( three line ) metres in verses and Ragale ( lyrical poems ) became fashionable . Jain works continued to extol the virtues of Tirthankaras ( Jain ascetics ) . 
 The Hoysala court supported scholars such as Janna , Rudrabhatta , Harihara and his nephew Raghavanka , whose works are enduring masterpieces in Kannada . In 1209 , the Jain scholar Janna wrote <unk> , the story of a king who intends to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to a local deity , <unk> . Taking pity on the boys , the king releases them and gives up the practice of human sacrifice . In honour of this work , Janna received the title " Emperor among poets " ( <unk> ) from King Veera Ballala II . 
 Rudrabhatta , a <unk> Brahmin , was the earliest well @-@ known Brahminical writer whose patron was Chandramouli , a minister of King Veera Ballala II . Based on the earlier work of Vishnu Purana , he wrote Jagannatha Vijaya in the Champu style relating the life of Lord Krishna leading up to his fight with the demon Banasura . 
 Harihara , ( also known as Harisvara ) a <unk> writer and the patron of King Narasimha I , wrote the Girijakalyana in the old Jain Champu style which describes the marriage of Lord Shiva and Parvati in ten sections . He was one of the earliest Virashaiva writers who was not part of the Vachana literary tradition . He came from a family of accountants ( <unk> ) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred <unk> ( poems in blank verse ) in praise of Lord Virupaksha ( a form of Lord Shiva ) . Raghavanka was the first to introduce the Shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his Harishchandra <unk> which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar . 
 In Sanskrit , the philosopher Madhvacharya wrote <unk> on <unk> ( a logical explanation of Hindu scriptures , the Vedas ) as well as many polemical works rebutting the doctrines of other schools of Vedas . He relied more on the Puranic literature than the Vedas for logical proof of his philosophy . Another famous writing was <unk> by <unk> . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests . The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north . Their architectural style , an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style , shows distinct Dravidian influences . The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida , and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features . 
 A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship . The tower over the temple shrine ( vimana ) is delicately finished with intricate carvings , showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height . The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers . Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty , grace and physique . The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone ( Chloritic schist ) , a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material . 
 The Chennakesava Temple at Belur ( 1117 ) , the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu ( 1121 ) , the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura ( 1279 ) , the temples at Arasikere ( 1220 ) , Amruthapura ( 1196 ) , <unk> ( 1200 ) , <unk> ( 1246 ) , <unk> ( 1250 ) , <unk> ( 1250 ) , <unk> ( 1173 ) , <unk> ( 1235 ) , Mosale and <unk> ( 1234 ) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art . While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures , the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples . The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes ( decorative mouldings ) that depict the Hindu epics . These depictions are generally clockwise in the traditional direction of circumambulation ( pradakshina ) . The temple of Halebidu has been described as an outstanding example of Hindu architecture and an important milestone in Indian architecture . The temples of Belur and Halebidu are a proposed UNESCO world heritage sites . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong , and this is seen even in their epigraphs , often written in polished and poetic language , rather than prose , with illustrations of floral designs in the margins . According to historian Sheldon Pollock , the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit , with Kannada dominating as the courtly language . Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit , while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks . Schools of higher learning were called <unk> . The local Kannada language was widely used in the rising number of devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity ( <unk> and <unk> ) . Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together . While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature , Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign . Writings in Sanskrit included poetry , grammar , lexicon , manuals , rhetoric , commentaries on older works , prose fiction and drama . Inscriptions on stone ( Shilashasana ) and copper plates ( Tamarashasana ) were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual . The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title , genealogy , origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit . Kannada was used to state terms of the grants , including information on the land , its boundaries , the participation of local authorities , rights and obligations of the grantee , taxes and dues , and witnesses . This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without ambiguity . 
 = French ironclad Richelieu = 
 The French ironclad Richelieu was a wooden @-@ hulled central battery ironclad built for the French Navy in the early 1870s . She was named after the 17th century statesman Cardinal de Richelieu . The ship was the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron for most of her career . Richelieu caught on fire in Toulon in 1880 and was scuttled to prevent her magazines from exploding . She was salvaged and , after being repaired , resumed her role as flagship . In 1886 , however , the ship was placed in reserve and was eventually condemned in 1901 . While being towed to the ship breakers in Amsterdam in 1911 , Richelieu was caught in a storm in the Bay of Biscay and had to be cast loose from her tugboat . Nevertheless , the ship survived the storm and was recovered near the Scilly Isles from where she was towed to her final destination . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Richelieu was designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the Océan @-@ class ironclads . As a central battery ironclad she had her armament concentrated amidships . Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a plough @-@ shaped ram that projected 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) from her hull . Her crew numbered around 750 officers and men . The metacentric height of the ship was very low , a little above 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) . 
 The ship measured 101 @.@ 7 meters ( 333 ft 8 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 4 meters ( 57 ft 1 in ) . Richelieu had a maximum draft of 8 @.@ 5 meters ( 27 ft 11 in ) and displaced 8 @,@ 984 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 842 long tons ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Richelieu was given two propellers by Henri Dupuy de Lôme to make her more maneuverable for ramming . She had two Indret 3 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engines , each driving a single propeller . Her engines were powered by eight oval boilers . On sea trials the engines produced 4 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 400 kW ) and Richelieu reached 13 @.@ 2 knots ( 24 @.@ 4 km / h ; 15 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 640 metric tons ( 630 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately 3 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 100 km ; 3 @,@ 800 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Richelieu was initially square rigged with three masts , then cut down to a schooner rig . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Richelieu 's intermediate armament of four 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns was mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery , with her six 274 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) guns on the battery deck below the barbettes . One 240 @-@ millimeter gun was mounted in the forecastle as a chase gun . The ship 's secondary armament consisted of ten 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns . These were later replaced by six 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns . 
 The 18 @-@ caliber 274 @-@ millimeter Modéle 1870 gun fired an armor @-@ piercing , 476 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 216 @.@ 0 kg ) shell while the gun itself weighed 22 @.@ 84 long tons ( 23 @.@ 21 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 424 ft / s ( 434 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 3 inches ( 360 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armor at the muzzle . The 138 @-@ millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed 2 @.@ 63 long tons ( 2 @.@ 67 t ) . It fired a 61 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 0 kg ) explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 529 ft / s ( 466 m / s ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 At some point the ship received eight , and then later ten more , 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft . However , the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft . Late in the ship 's career four above @-@ water 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added .

 Richelieu had a complete 220 @-@ millimeter ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) wrought iron waterline belt . The sides and the transverse bulkheads of the battery itself were armored with 160 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of wrought iron . The barbettes were unarmored , but the deck was protected by 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) of armor . 
 = = Service = = 
 Richelieu was laid down at Toulon in 1869 and launched on 3 December 1873 . While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known , it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy 's budget which was cut after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time , which were not suitable for the Industrial Age . The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875 , but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron , of which she became flagship , until 10 February 1876 . She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879 . 
 While in Toulon harbor on 29 December 1880 , Richelieu caught fire and had to be scuttled to prevent her magazines from exploding . The ship capsized to port in 10 @.@ 75 meters ( 35 @.@ 3 ft ) of water ; she lay on her barbettes almost at a 90 ° angle . In order to salvage her , all accessible guns , ammunition , masts , armor and movable decks were removed and the equivalent weight was placed in the ship 's holds to lower her center of gravity . A sheer hulk was moved to her port side and cables were connected to Sibylle on the other side of Richelieu . 360 empty casks and 34 cubic meters ( 1 @,@ 200 cu ft ) of cork were attached to the starboard side to prevent the ship from rolling too far the other way . After an hour and a half of lifting , Richelieu had been righted to a 45 ° angle ; a subsequent effort completed the job . 
 Richelieu was repaired and returned to service as the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron on 8 October 1881 where she remained until 1886 . The squadron made port visits in Tangiers and Lisbon in 1884 before sailing to Brest and Cherbourg for exercises . In 1885 Richelieu tested Bullivant torpedo nets , but they reduced her speed to a maximum of 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) and as a result were not considered successful . The ship was placed back in reserve in 1886 and became flagship of the Reserve Squadron on 8 September 1892 , which , despite its name , consisted of ships in commission . The squadron conducted exercises from June to August 1892 in French waters . Richelieu was condemned on 5 March 1900 , but was not immediately sold . After having been sold to Dutch ship breakers , Richelieu departed Toulon on 28 January 1911 . She was under tow in the Bay of Biscay , having left the Mediterranean for the first time in her existence , when a storm caused the tugboat to cast her loose . The ship remained afloat , however , and was subsequently recovered near the Scilly Isles and towed to Amsterdam where she was broken up . 
 = Alister Murdoch = 
 Air Marshal Sir Alister Murray Murdoch , KBE , CB ( 9 December 1912 – 29 November 1984 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He served as Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) from 1965 to 1969 . Joining the Air Force in 1930 , Murdoch trained as a seaplane pilot , and participated in an Antarctic rescue mission for lost explorers in 1935 . During World War II , he commanded No. 221 Squadron RAF in Europe and the Middle East , and later occupied senior positions on the staff of RAAF formations in the South West Pacific . His post @-@ war appointments included Commandant of RAAF College from 1952 to 1953 , Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Training Command from 1953 to 1955 , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1958 to 1959 , and AOC Operational Command from 1962 to 1965 . 
 As AOC Training Command in 1954 , Murdoch headed a program to determine aircraft purchases for the RAAF ; his recommendations included the C @-@ 130 Hercules transport , considered one of the most important acquisitions in the Air Force 's history . His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the Vietnam War , and he came into conflict with Australian Army commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle . He was also involved in assessing the readiness of the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C for RAAF service . Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1960 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966 , Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the Royal Military College , Duntroon . He retired from the Air Force in December 1969 , and died in 1984 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Alister Murdoch was born on 9 December 1912 in Elsternwick , Victoria , the son of engineer Thomas Murdoch and his wife Kathleen . A lieutenant in the Commonwealth Military Forces at the time of Alister 's birth , Thomas was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in World War I , and rose to the rank of <unk> as Director General of Engineer Services in World War II . Educated at Caulfield Grammar School , Alister entered the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in 1929 , following his elder brother Ian ( later a major general ) . Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , which did not at that stage have its own officer training college . Budgetary constraints imposed during the Great Depression necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four @-@ year course . Although offered positions in the Australian Public Service or nominations for short @-@ term commissions with the Royal Air Force , all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering their chosen service early . 
 Murdoch enlisted in the Air Force on 10 December 1930 , and completed his pilot training the following year . He was commissioned in 1932 and later qualified as a flying instructor and seaplane pilot , undertaking navy cooperation and maritime patrol operations . In December 1935 , Flying Officer Murdoch was selected to join an RAAF rescue mission for explorer Lincoln Ellsworth and his pilot , Herbert Hollick @-@ Kenyon , who were presumed lost while journeying across the Antarctic . Flying a de Havilland Gipsy Moth , Murdoch located Hollick @-@ Kenyon near the Bay of Whales . Hollick @-@ Kenyon led the search party to Ellsworth , who protested that he was not lost and did not need rescuing . Murdoch was posted to England in 1936 – 37 to undertake a course in long navigation at RAF Manston and serve on attachment with No. 114 Squadron . Returning to Australia , he married Florence Miller on 27 December 1937 ; the couple had a daughter . Murdoch spent the next two years on the staff of the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters , Melbourne . In June 1938 , he helped inaugurate RAAF instruction in long navigation , with a nine @-@ month course in the discipline .

 Ranked squadron leader at the outbreak of World War II , Murdoch took charge of No. 1 Air Observer School at Cootamundra , New South Wales , from April 1940 until mid @-@ 1941 . Following this posting he was promoted to wing commander and sent to the European Theatre . In August 1941 , he became Commanding Officer of No. 221 Squadron RAF , a Coastal Command unit flying Vickers Wellingtons on reconnaissance and anti @-@ submarine patrols out of Iceland during the Battle of the Atlantic . The next year , Murdoch accompanied the squadron to the Middle East , where it carried out anti @-@ submarine and maritime strike operations . He also served as Staff Officer Operations with No. 235 Wing RAF . Back in London in July 1942 , Murdoch was assigned to Combined Operations Headquarters , where he assisted in planning the Dieppe Raid before returning to Australia in 1943 . 
 Promoted to group captain , Murdoch was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command , Sydney , in July 1943 . In January 1944 , he became SASO at North @-@ Western Area Command , which controlled thirteen Australian , British , Dutch , and American squadrons from its headquarters in Darwin , Northern Territory . Murdoch planned many of the command 's bombing and mining operations in the South West Pacific Theatre , and was mentioned in despatches for his " distinguished service " in the role . He was posted as SASO to the Australian First Tactical Air Force ( No. 1 TAF ) in April 1945 , replacing Group Captain William Gibson after the latter 's dismissal in the wake of the " Morotai Mutiny " , when the threatened resignations of eight of the RAAF 's leading fighter aces caused a crisis in the formation 's leadership . Delegated operational responsibility by No. 1 TAF 's new Air Officer Commanding , Air Commodore Frederick Scherger , Murdoch received much of the credit for the " excellent " planning of the RAAF 's role in Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan . He accompanied Scherger ashore on the afternoon of the landings on 10 June 1945 . Murdoch was also praised for his staff work during Operation Oboe Two , the Battle of Balikpapan , in July .

In February 1951 , he led a team to the Middle East , where the possibility of Australia contributing a garrison force to the region was first raised . Two years later , No. 78 Wing was deployed to Malta to fulfil this role , operating leased RAF de Havilland Vampire jet fighters . Murdoch became Commandant of RAAF College in June 1952 , gaining promotion to air commodore . In December 1953 , he was raised to acting air vice marshal and appointed Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Training Command . 
 In 1954 , Murdoch led a mission to examine potential new fighter , bomber , transport and training aircraft for the RAAF , following a shift in defence funding towards the Air Force . He advocated the F @-@ 104 Starfighter as a replacement for the CAC Sabre , two years before the Sabre entered squadron service with the RAAF , as well as nuclear @-@ capable British V bomber strike aircraft to augment Australia 's Canberra jet bombers , and C @-@ 130 Hercules transports to replace the C @-@ 47 Dakota . Although his proposals for V bombers and the F @-@ 104 were not taken up , the Australian government acquired the C @-@ 130 in 1958 . Described as second only to the General Dynamics F @-@ 111 as the " most significant " purchase by the RAAF , the Hercules gave the Air Force its first strategic airlift capability , which in years to come would provide a " lifeline " for Australian forces deployed to Malaya , Vietnam , and other parts of South East Asia . Murdoch also recommended the locally built Vampire as a jet trainer for No. 1 Applied Flying Training School ; sixty @-@ nine were later delivered as <unk> by the de Havilland factory in Bankstown , New South Wales . 
 Murdoch was seconded to the Department of Defence in January 1956 as Deputy Secretary ( Military ) . By February 1958 , he had been made a substantive air vice marshal and appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . In October 1959 , Murdoch was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff , and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in the 1960 New Year Honours . He returned to Australia in June 1962 , when he became AOC Operational Command . His tenure in the position coincided with the deployment of the first RAAF aircraft to South Vietnam , seven DHC @-@ 4 Caribous , commencing in August 1964 . Murdoch was promoted air marshal and appointed Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) on 1 June 1965 , succeeding Air Marshal Sir Valston Hancock . He was the last of a quartet of army @-@ trained CASs ; from 1954 to 1969 inclusive , every RAAF chief — John McCauley , Scherger , Hancock , and Murdoch — had been a cadet at the Royal Military College , Duntroon , prior to serving with the Air Force . With this pedigree , Murdoch was described by Air Chief Marshal Scherger as " the last of the professionals " . The new CAS was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) in the 1966 Queen 's Birthday Honours . 
 = = = Chief of the Air Staff and Vietnam = = = 
 Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF through the build @-@ up of Australia 's commitment to the Vietnam War beginning in the mid @-@ 1960s . He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , over the latter 's recommendation in mid @-@ 1965 to deploy two UH @-@ 1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam . Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air / ground operations in the region before large @-@ scale commitment of Australian forces . Murdoch dismissed the idea on <unk> grounds , despite the fact that two @-@ thirds of the RAAF 's UH @-@ 1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation . He further contended that helicopter operations in Malaysia had afforded the RAAF sufficient experience in the type of conditions they might face in Vietnam , though Australia 's senior UH @-@ 1 pilot at the time considered that the former theatre offered " little if any hostile opposition , and there was none of the insertion and extraction of SAS patrols which was to become such an important part of the RAAF 's Vietnam operations " . Air Commodore Brian Eaton , as Director @-@ General of Operational Requirements , advised Murdoch that if the Air Force did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army , then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations , undermining the RAAF 's position as the main provider of Australia 's air power . Murdoch 's reluctance to deploy the helicopters was eventually overridden by the Australian government , and No. 9 Squadron 's UH @-@ 1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later . When Murdoch visited the combat zone himself in August 1966 , he was informed by Brigadier David Jackson that the squadron was not performing the role the Army expected of it . 
 Wilton 's successor as CGS , Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Daly , urged Murdoch to procure specialised helicopter gunships such as the AH @-@ 1 <unk> for Vietnam , to support the more vulnerable troop @-@ carrying " slicks " . Murdoch largely ignored the suggestion , telling his staff to treat the Army 's recommendation with a lesser priority than " anything we now have on our ' shopping list ' " . His preference was for V / STOL fixed @-@ wing aircraft like the Harrier Jump Jet , which he thought would open a " new era in close support aircraft " . In the event , the Federal government earmarked eleven AH @-@ 1G <unk> for purchase in 1971 , though the deal never went ahead due to Australia 's withdrawal from South East Asia . Murdoch 's failure to appreciate the need for cooperation with land forces has been blamed for fostering long @-@ running enmity between the services , which twenty years later would contribute to the government 's decision to transfer the RAAF 's battlefield helicopters to the Army . Air Force historian Alan Stephens contended that despite Murdoch 's " competence " and " good mind " , his " comprehension of air power in its fullest sense and handling of inter @-@ service politics were respectively inadequate and disastrous ... A generation of lieutenant @-@ colonels and majors had come to believe that the RAAF did not care about army support , and they were to carry that belief into the 1970s and beyond " . Murdoch also opposed sending Canberra jet bombers to Vietnam on what were later described in the official post @-@ war history of the RAAF as " misleading " grounds that the type was unsuitable for low @-@ level strike and close support ; their deployment went ahead in April 1967 . 
 In 1963 , Australia had selected the F @-@ 111 swing @-@ wing bomber as a replacement for the Canberra . Murdoch attended the much @-@ anticipated official hand @-@ over ceremony for the aircraft on 4 September 1968 at Fort Worth , Texas , with Defence Minister Sir Allen Fairhall , various US dignitaries , and RAAF F @-@ 111 crews . Within eight days a US Navy F @-@ 111B crashed , followed by a USAF F @-@ 111A twelve days later , creating a " public relations disaster " , and contributing to the type 's entry into RAAF service being delayed until 1973 . In late 1969 , Murdoch accompanied Secretary of Defence Sir Henry Bland to the United States to gain assurance of an adequate " safe life " for the F @-@ 111 's swing @-@ wing mechanism , amid the Australian government giving serious consideration to abandoning the program . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Murdoch retired from the military on 31 December 1969 after completing his term as CAS , which the government had extended for a further twelve months beyond its original three years . He was succeeded by Air Marshal Colin Hannah , whom Murdoch had earlier recommended for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam ( the role went to an Army officer , as had been previous practice ) . In 1971 , Murdoch joined the board of directors of Meggitt Limited , an oilseed @-@ crushing firm that was chaired by World War II fighter ace Nicky Barr . Murdoch continued to exercise his interest in Australia 's defence after he left the Air Force , joining in 1975 a group of pundits , including retired Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan , who promoted augmenting the country 's arsenal with nuclear weaponry . He also followed sport , including horse racing . A resident of Church Point , New South Wales , Sir Alister Murdoch died on 29 November 1984 . 
 = Friedrich Accum = 
 Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum ( March 29 , 1769 – June 28 , 1838 ) was a German chemist , whose most important achievements included advances in the field of gas lighting , efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives , and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace . From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London . Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary , he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise . His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment . Accum , himself , gave fee @-@ based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science . 
 Intrigued by the work of Frederick Winsor , who had been championing the introduction of gas lighting in London , Accum too , became fascinated by this innovation . At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company , he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry . After a time of close working association with this company , he became a member of its board of directors in 1812 . The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas . Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks . 
 The majority of Accum 's publications were written in English . They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man . Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings , which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era . In 1820 , Accum published Treatise on <unk> of Food , in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food . This ground @-@ breaking work marked the beginning of an awareness of need for food safety oversight . Accum was the first person to tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities . His book , controversial at the time , found a wide audience and sold well . However , it threatened established practices within the food processing industry , earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers . Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him . He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin .

 Accum was born in Bückeburg , Schaumburg @-@ Lippe , about 50 km ( 31 mi ) west of Hanover . His father was from Vlotho , and had been in an infantry regiment in the service of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg @-@ Lippe . In 1755 , Accum 's father converted from Judaism to Protestant Christianity . Soon after , his father married Judith Berth dit La Motte in Bückeburg . Judith was the daughter of a hat maker , who resided in the French community in Berlin , and the granddaughter of a refugee who suffered under the Huguenot persecutions in France . 
 At the time of his conversion baptism , the senior Accum changed his name from Markus Herz to Christian Accum . In addition to choosing the name " Christian , " which means " follower of Christ " , Accum 's father chose to emphasize his newly embraced religion by adopting the surname Accum , which derives from the Hebrew word " <unk> , " meaning " not @-@ Jewish . " It is not known whether he did this on his own initiative or because of pressure from his fiancee 's family . After his marriage , Christian Accum opened his own soap @-@ making shop in Bückeburg at his in @-@ law 's personal residence . Nine years after his marriage to Judith , he received legal citizenship from the city . On May 9 , 1772 , his father Christian died at the age of 45 ; a mere three years after the birth of his first son . 
 Friedrich Accum attended the Bückeburg Gymnasium <unk> and additionally received private tutelage in the subjects of French and English . Following the conclusion of his studies , he finished an apprenticeship as an apothecary with the Brande family in Hanover , who were family friends . The Brandes also conducted business in London and were the apothecaries to the Hanoverian King of England , George III . As one of the leading centers for scientific research and industry at the close of the 18th century , London attracted the best and brightest minds of Europe . Friedrich Accum felt the pull and relocated there in 1793 . He found work as an assistant in another Brande apothecary located on Arlington Street . 
 = = = The first year in London = = = 
 After gaining experience as an assistant in the apothecary , Accum pursued scientific and medical studies at the School of Anatomy in Great Windmill Street in London . He became acquainted with the surgeon Anthony Carlisle ( 1768 – 1842 ) and the London chemist William Nicholson ( 1753 – 1815 ) . In Mr. Nicholson 's circulating journal , ( Nicholson 's Journal ) Accum published his first article in 1798 . On May 10 , 1798 Accum married Mary Ann Simpson ( March 6 , 1777 – March 1 , 1816 in London ) . He had , in the intervening period , anglicized his name to " Frederick Accum " . Frederick and Mary had a total of eight children , but only two survived past childhood . 
 In the fall of the year 1799 , a translation of Franz Carl Achard 's ground @-@ breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson 's Journal . Until that time , sugar cane , which was grown overseas , was the only plant from which sugar could be derived . This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry , and was greeted with great interest . A short time after the article 's publication , Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin , and presented them to William Nicholson . This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England . Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar , Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal , stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two .

 In 1800 , Accum and his family changed residence in London from 17 Haymarket to 11 Old Compton Street . There he would live for the next twenty years . His family home also served as a school , an experimental laboratory and a mercantile for chemicals and scientific instruments . Accum 's business cards of the time described his activities thus : 
 Mr Accum <unk> the Patrons and Amateurs of Chemistry that he continues to give private Courses of Lectures on Operative and Philosophical Chemistry , Practical Pharmacy and the Art of Analysis , as well as to take Resident Pupils in his House , and that he keeps constantly on sale in as pure a state as possible , all the Re @-@ Agents and Articles of Research made use of in Experimental Chemistry , together with a complete Collection of Chemical Apparatus and Instruments calculated to Suit the conveniences of Different Purchasers . 
 For his customers in London , Accum compiled and distributed a catalog of his merchandise for sale . This catalog was also sent to other locales upon request . 
 For many years , Accum 's establishment was the only significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice . Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge . Accum 's teachings attracted various prominent students . These included the well @-@ known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston , the Duke of Bedford , and the Duke of Northumberland . Additionally , his laboratory was the first in Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States , among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck . When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College ( precursor to Yale University ) in New Haven , he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London . Accum 's biographer , Charles Albert Browne , stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum 's London business . 
 With the development of new laboratory apparatus , Accum positioned himself in the middle market range with respect to cost and usability . Accum developed portable laboratory kits , intended for farmers , for the analysis of soils and stones . With affordable prices ranging from three to eighty pounds sterling , these chests were the first truly portable laboratories . 
 = = = Teacher and researcher = = = 
 In March 1801 , Frederick Accum was offered a position at the Royal Institution in <unk> Street , a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford . Accepting the position , he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy , who had been hired at the same time as director of the laboratory , and would later become the president of the Royal Society . Accum ’ s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803 . His biographer , R. J. Cole , speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris . Rumford had been the driving force behind securing a position for Accum . 
 By 1803 , Accum had published a series of articles in Nicholson 's Journal , which discussed a number of subjects : investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines , determining the existence of benzoic acids in vanilla extract , observing the explosivity of sulphur @-@ phosphorus mixtures . In 1803 one of Accum 's most significant publications was completed . Cole , Accum 's biographer states that this book , System of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry , " was the first text @-@ book of general chemistry written in the English language to be based on Lavoisier 's new principles ; it is outstanding , also , in that it is written in a popular style , the subject matter being graduated as with a modern text @-@ book . " 
 Accum held his first lecture on chemistry and mineralogy in a small room in his house on Old Compton Street . His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street . After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution , he continued with his popular lectures . An advertisement in The Times on January 6 , 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening . 
 His increasing interest in mineralogy at this time is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809 . The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals , which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy . In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy . Beginning in 1808 , while at the Surrey Institution , Accum also published , a series of articles on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander <unk> 's Philosophical Journal . 
 In 1811 , when the Parisian saltpetre manufacturer Bernard Courtois made iodine for the first time from the kelp ash , his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts . Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine . In two articles published in <unk> 's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814 , Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production . 
 = = = Accum 's role in the history of gaslight = = = 
 Artificial lighting of any sort was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly , and economically unsound . With the advent of industrial means of production , not only were new textile halls physically larger , but they also had to be lit more brightly for longer periods of time . Driven by great demand , and made possible through Lavoisier 's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion , the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology . 
 The production of gases from coal had been noted by Henry Clayton . He shared this observation with Robert Boyle in a letter written in the 17th century . The letter was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1739 . Clayton wrote : 
 I then got some Coal from one of the Pits nearest thereunto , which I distilled in a <unk> in an open Fire . At first there came over only <unk> , afterwards a black Oil , and then likewise a Spirit arose , which I could <unk> condense , but it forced my Lute , or broke my Glasses . Once , when it had forced the Lute , coming close thereto , in order to try to repair it , I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle , and continued burning with Violence as it issued out , in a Stream , which 1 blew out , and lighted again , alternately , for several times . 
 Clayton 's findings did not have any practical application until the end of the 18th century . The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant . Other such experiments , though limited in depth , had been done by : George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield , Jean @-@ Pierre <unk> in 1785 in Louvain , and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey . The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee 's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester . However innovative the new technology , it was met with great skepticism by many critics . As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons : " Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick ? " Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting . Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution . 
 Accum became involved with the production of gas for lighting purposes through the efforts of Friedrich Albert Winsor ( 1763 – 1830 ) , another German émigré , who had been waging a longstanding publicity campaign . In 1809 , Accum was asked to appear before a Parliamentary committee that was considering granting a charter for a gaslight company Winsor had been promoting . While unsuccessful in its first attempt , the bill passed in 1810 and the company was incorporated under the name " Gas Light and Coke Company " . The newly incorporated company met the conditions laid out in the bill and began operating in 1812 with Accum as a member of its board of directors . Accum oversaw the construction of a gas plant on Curtain Road , which was the first such plant in the history of gaslight . After that time , gaslight was no longer limited to industrial mills and was introduced into urban life . Westminster Bridge was lighted with gas lamps in 1813 , and a year later , the streets in Westminster followed . In 1815 , Accum published " Description of the Process of Manufacturing Coal @-@ Gas " . In the introduction , Accum compared the newly formed gas utility with the water companies that had been operating in London since the early 18th century : " Through gas , it will be possible to have light in all rooms , as is presently the case with water . " When this book was translated into German in Berlin in 1815 , an explanatory note had to be added , as no such water utilities existed there : " There are many private homes in England that are provided with pipes in the walls so that in almost all rooms , all one needs to do to get water is open a faucet . " 
 In London , in 1814 , there was a single gasometer of 400 m3 ( 14 @,@ 000 cu ft ) , by 1822 , there were four gas companies , whose gasometers had a total combined volume of almost a million ft3 To keep delivery routes for the gas pipelines as short as possible , gas plants were set up within the city districts where the gas was consumed . The arrival of these types of chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology . This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations . These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants . Accum , who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist , strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings . Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole , accidents were caused by carelessness of plant <unk> rather than problems with the technology , and were therefore avoidable . 
 From early on in its conception , Accum had been concerned with the byproducts of coal gas production , which included tar and sulphur compounds . These were typically buried or dumped into nearby waterways . The ammonium and sulphur compounds were especially damaging to the environment . In 1820 , Accum began demanding legal measures to prevent the discharge of these byproducts into the sewage systems and rivers . His criticisms were met with few positive reactions . Various catastrophes due to gas explosions drew far more attention than the environmental impact of long term release of poisonous byproducts . 
 = = = " There is death in the pot " = = = 
 In 1820 Accum began the public struggle against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons . Some additives derived from plants , and used as preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance , had already been in use for some time . The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods . The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern . The production and distribution of food , instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople , increasingly became a centralized process in large factories . The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals and the absence of laws moderating their use , made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health . Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns . 
 Accum alludes to his moral <unk> on food adulterations as he claims that : 
 The man who robs a fellow <unk> a few shillings on the high @-@ way , is sentenced to death ; while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole community , escapes punishment . 
 A thousand copies of A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons were sold within a month of its publication . A second run was printed in the same year , and a German translation was printed in Leipzig two years later . The book 's cover shows that Accum was capable of using dramatic imagery to try to draw attention to his scientific knowledge . It featured a rectangular frame supporting a spider 's web and surrounded by intertwined snakes . A spider lurks in the middle of the web over its prey , and a skull crowns the entire collection with a caption beneath it , taken from 2 Kings 4 : 40 : " There is death in the pot . " 
 The various chapters of the book alternate between harmless forgeries such as mixing dried pea grounds in coffee , and much more dangerous contamination by truly poisonous substances . Accum explained to his readers that there was a high lead content in Spanish olive oil , caused by the lead containers used to clear the oil , and recommended using oil from other countries such as France and Italy , where this was not practiced . He warned against bright green sweets sold by itinerant merchants in the streets of London as the colour was produced with " <unk> " , a colorant with high copper content . " Vinegar " , he explained to his readers , " was frequently mixed with sulphuric acid in order to increase its acidity . " 
 Accum paid particular attention to beer , introducing the subject with the comment : " Malt beverages , and especially port , the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities , is among the items which is most frequently adulterated in the course of supply . " He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses , honey , vitriol , pepper and even opium . Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding <unk> , part of the <unk> family , to port . It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was getting out of hand , and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter . Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims . As evidence for his claims about <unk> indicus he used , among others , import statistics , which he complemented with observations about when the price of <unk> indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased . He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities . 
 The Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons has two further notable characteristics . First , like Accum 's earlier writings , it was written with descriptions of the simple techniques of analytical chemistry he employed , thereby making them more accessible to his readers . He wanted to make every test repeatable in the simplest possible way by a non @-@ expert . Accum wrote in the foreword to his first edition : 
 In stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of the frauds which it has been my object to expose , I have confined myself to the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by persons unacquainted with chemical science ; and it has been my purpose to express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest language , divested of those recondite terms of science , which would be out of place in a work intended for general perusal . 
 The second characteristic was that Accum did not limit his campaign to simply exposing problems . At the end of every chapter , he included names of merchants of who had in years prior to 1820 been caught adulterating foodstuffs . In this way , Accum tried to deprive them of business and thereby had an effect on the London economy . 
 = = = Reaction to Treatise on Adulterations of Food = = = 
 Accum was well aware before the publication of his book that mentioning specific names from London 's business world would provoke a resistance and a possibly a severe reaction . In the foreword to the first edition he called the publication of the names of those adulterating foodstuffs an " invidious office " and a " painful duty , " which he undertook as a verification for his statements . Although he further stated that he carefully avoided citing any except those authenticated in Parliamentary documents and other records , this did not save him from the ire of his opponents . By the time the second edition appeared , he mentioned in the foreword that he had received threats . At the same time , this did not stop him from putting " the unwary on their guard " against the <unk> of unscrupulous men . He further added that he wished to notify his hidden enemies that he would report for posterity the crimes these swindlers and their base associates had been found guilty of in public justice — that is , of having made basic foodstuffs poisonous . 
 = = = Scandal and lawsuit = = = 
 The process that ultimately led to Accum 's departure from England and return to Germany began a few months after the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs . For a long time , many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile . Finally in 1951 , Cole , in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution , proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography , and also later in the <unk> Deutschen <unk> ( according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany ) , did not correspond to the facts . 
 Cole completely reprinted the minutes of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23 , 1820 , which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt . Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5 , 1820 , a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution , books Accum had read . On the instructions of his superiors , Sturt cut a small hole in the wall of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room . On the evening of December 20 , as recorded in the minutes , Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate . The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson ’ s Journal . Accum 's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London , and torn pages were indeed discovered there . These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution . 
 The Magistrate after hearing the whole of the Case observed that however valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr Accum ’ s house had been taken , yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper . If they had weighed a pound he would have committed him for the value of a pound of waste paper , but this not being the case he discharged him . 
 The Royal Institution committee that met on December 23 , 1820 was not , however , satisfied with this judgment , and decided to take further legal action against Accum . On January 10 , 1821 , an open letter directed to Earl Spencer , the president of the Institution , appeared in The Times defending Accum . The letter was signed " <unk> " , and Cole supposed that the author was the surgeon Anthony Carlisle , who had been friends with Accum since the first years of the latter 's stay in London . This unsought support availed Accum little , as the minutes of the Royal Institution from April 16 , 1821 show . These report the commencement of a lawsuit against Accum for theft of paper valued at 14 pence . Two of his friends were included in the indictment : the publisher Rudolph Ackermann and the architect John Papworth . These three appeared in court and paid altogether 400 pounds sterling as surety . Accum did not make an appearance at the court session . He had fled England and returned to Germany . 
 = = = Return to Germany = = = 
 In the two years before his return to Germany , Accum had published a number of books dealing with nutrition chemistry . In 1820 , he published two works , one on beer production ( A Treatise on the Art of Brewing ) and another on wine ( A Treatise on the Art of Making Wine ) . The following year appeared Culinary Chemistry , in which Accum provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking . He also published a book on bread ( A Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread ) . Even when he had returned to Germany , his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French , Italian and German , reaching a wide readership in Europe , as well as in the US after it was reprinted there . 
 Immediately upon his arrival in Germany , Accum went to the town of <unk> . There , the industrialist Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement . Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets , and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816 . It was probably Nathusius ’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum . He remained only a short time in <unk> , however , as he soon got a professorship at the <unk> and the <unk> in Berlin . His teaching in the areas of physics , chemistry , and mineralogy , were collected in the two volume work , <unk> und <unk> <unk> der <unk> , deren Wahl , <unk> und <unk> Anwendung , published in Berlin in 1826 . It was the only work Accum published originally in German . 
 A few years after settling down in Berlin , Accum had a house built at 16 <unk> ( later 21 <unk> ) , where he dwelt until his death . During his last years , he suffered from a bad case of gout , which ultimately led to his death . His illness took a serious turn for the worse in June 1838 , and he rapidly deteriorated . On June 28 , approximately 16 years after he return to Germany , Accum died at the age of 69 in Berlin . He was buried there at the <unk> Friedhof .

 = Scream / Childhood = 
 " Scream " / " Childhood " is the lead single from Michael Jackson 's ninth studio album , HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I. The A @-@ side of the single , " Scream " , is a duet with his younger sister Janet Jackson , while the corresponding B @-@ side , " Childhood " , is a solo piece . The single was released on May 31 , 1995 . 
 " Scream " is cited primarily as an aggressive , retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993 . " Scream " was written , composed and produced by Jimmy Jam , Terry Lewis , Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson ; Michael played many of the instruments . It incorporates elements of pop , R & B , <unk> , new jack swing , dance @-@ pop , and funk . Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina , Minnesota in December 1994 . The song was leaked to radio stations early , despite Epic Records ' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date . 
 Generally well received amongst critics , it has been compared favorably to other accomplished pieces by Michael Jackson . It went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award and an American Music Award . The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed pieces ; it won numerous MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy . At a cost of $ 7 million , it was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made ; however , director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim , saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost " millions more " than the video for " Scream " . The imagery in " Scream " has been replicated in several contemporary pieces , including " No Scrubs " ( 1999 ) by TLC , " Shawty Get Loose " ( 2008 ) by Lil Mama , " Stay the Night " ( 1999 ) by IMx , " Walkin ' on the Moon " ( 2009 ) by The @-@ Dream , and " I 'm Out " by Ciara featuring Nicki Minaj ( 2013 ) . 
 " Childhood " is an auto @-@ biographical song written and composed by Michael Jackson . The theme of the track centers around his difficult childhood experiences . It would become the main theme song for Free Willy 2 : The Adventure Home , continuing his association with the Free Willy series . The track appeared on several compilation albums , but was met with a mixed reception amongst critics . The song 's music video , which had little in common with the supporting film , has been critically praised . " Scream " / " Childhood " would become the first single in the 37 @-@ year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 , where it peaked . It was a worldwide hit , reaching the top five in the vast majority of major music markets . Michael performed " Scream " on his 1996 – 97 HIStory World Tour . Following his death in 2009 , Janet performed the song on her 2011 Number Ones : Up Close and Personal World Tour as a tribute to him as well as on her 2015 @-@ 2016 Unbreakable World Tour .

 " Scream " is a song primarily directed at the tabloid press . As far back as the late 1980s , Jackson and the press had a difficult relationship . In 1986 , the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process ; he was pictured lying down in a glass box . When Jackson bought a pet chimpanzee called Bubbles , it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality . It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick ( the " elephant man " ) . However , Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah and an interview with Martin Bashir in Take Two - The Footage You Were Never Meant To See . Still , these stories inspired the pejorative nickname " Wacko Jacko " , which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise . He stopped leaking untruths to the press , so the media began making up their own stories . 
 In 1989 , Jackson released the song and music video " Leave Me Alone " , a song about his perceived victimization at the hands of the press . The video shows Jackson poking fun not only at the press but also the situation he was in . In the video , there are images of shrines to his friend Elizabeth Taylor , newspapers with bizarre headlines , Jackson dancing with the bones of The Elephant Man , and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen . 
 In 1993 , the relationship between Jackson and the press came to a head when he was accused of child sexual abuse . Although never charged with a crime , Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place . Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline , accepting stories of Jackson 's alleged criminal activity in return for money , accepting confidential , leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid , deliberately using pictures of Jackson 's appearance at its worst , a lack of objectivity and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson 's guilt . At the time , Jackson said of the media reaction , " I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible , terrible mass media . At every opportunity , the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions . " 
 The singer began taking painkillers , Valium , Xanax and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him . Jackson 's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation . Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers . A few months after the allegations became news , Jackson had lost approximately 10 lb ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) in weight and had stopped eating . The singer 's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was " barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level " . While in the clinic , Jackson took part in group and one @-@ on @-@ one therapy sessions . 
 When Jackson left the U.S. to go into rehabilitation , the media showed him little sympathy . The Daily Mirror held a " Spot the Jacko " contest , offering readers a trip to Disney World if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next . A Daily Express headline read , " Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run " , while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive . These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognizable on his return . Geraldo Rivera set up a mock trial , with a jury made up of audience members , even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime . 
 " Scream " / " Childhood " and HIStory were Jackson 's first releases since the allegations , and the press was waiting to see if the album would sell well . One analyst for SoundScan expressed the opinion that the press were out of touch with the public when it came to Jackson ; the public liked him , while the press did not . He believed that " naysayers " in the media would be left surprised with the commercial reception to the HIStory campaign . 
 In the UK , on 24 June 1995 , " Scream ( David Morales Remix ) " was released as a single peaking at number 43 , dropping to number 57 a week later . It remained on the charts for only 2 weeks .

 In the HIStory album booklet there is an image of Gottfried Helnwein 's 1981 watercolor " Das Lied / The Song " which is an image of a distressed child huddled in the corner of a room , screaming up at the ceiling . Jackson 's handwritten lyrics to " Scream " were scrawled on the wall beside the child . Towards the end of the booklet is a copy of a child 's letter to the President of the United States , Bill Clinton , asking him to end war , pollution , and to stop the negative press reports about Jackson . 
 = = = Production and music of " Scream " = = = 
 Janet Jackson wanted to be involved with the project as a show of sibling support . It was the first time they had worked together since 1982 , when Janet provided backing vocals on " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " . Janet said that it was " very fun " working with her brother again and that seeing her brother 's work was " interesting " . " Scream " was written , composed and produced by the Jackson siblings , with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis . It was the first time Michael Jackson had worked with Jam and Lewis , although Janet had worked with them successfully on numerous occasions . The album was created with the intention of following half R & B and half pop / rock themes , the same themes that brought Jackson success on his prior album , Dangerous . Jackson was credited for playing instruments such as keyboard , synthesizer , guitar , drums and percussion on the single and album . 
 In the song , Jackson tells the media to stop pressuring him and to stop misrepresenting the truth . Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed , " fear has turned to aggression . The music has polarized ; it 's either clipped , choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous , only occasionally trying to combine the two . Most of the time , Jackson sounds as if he 's singing through clenched teeth , spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors " . He believed that " Scream " had a similar sound to the music of Janet 's acclaimed Rhythm Nation . It was Michael Jackson 's first song that contained the word " fucking " in the lyrics " Stop pressuring me / Stop pressuring me / Stop fucking with me " — which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson , considering his appeal with the younger audience . Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike , shit and nigga . " Scream " incorporates elements of pop , R & B , hip @-@ hop , funk and rock . As of December 26 , 2013 , it 's been discovered that a sample of Janet Jackson 's song from her 1989 Rhythm Nation 1814 album " The Knowledge " was used in the production of the song . 
 = = = Leaking of " Scream " = = = 
 Two weeks before the official release of " Scream " , Jackson happened to hear it on a Los Angeles radio station . The station was playing " Scream " once an hour until served with a cease and desist order from Epic Records . Two other stations in Philadelphia also received similar orders . All involved denied that Epic leaked them the song early . The song had been a closely guarded secret by the label and most staff members were not allowed access to a copy . 
 Though they potentially faced legal action , the Los Angeles radio station programmer noted that , " some things are more important ... The record company was furious , lawyers were involved and the situation got hairy ... But on a release as big as Michael Jackson 's , there 's no way we 're going to wait if we receive a leak . It 's a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity because his security is really insane . " 
 = = = Critical reaction to " Scream " = = = 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic expressed the opinion that " Scream " , " improved on the slamming beats of his earlier single ' Jam , ' " a song that received critical acclaim in its own right , as the recipient of two Grammy nominations : Best R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . James Hunter of Rolling Stone noted that , " the excellent current single ' Scream ' or the first @-@ rate R & B ballad ' You Are Not Alone ' – manage to link the incidents of Jackson 's infamous recent past to universal concepts like injustice or isolation . When he bases his music in the bluntness of hip @-@ hop , Jackson sketches funky scenarios denouncing greed , blanket unreliability and false accusation . " He went on to say of " Scream " and " Tabloid Junkie " , " [ these ] two adventurous Jam and Lewis thumpers work completely : Jackson 's slippery voice is caught in mammoth funk @-@ rock constructions . They 're reminiscent of Janet Jackson 's hits , in which Jam and Lewis allow space for lush vocal harmonies taken from the Triumph @-@ era Jacksons ; the choruses of ' Tabloid Junkie ' in particular sing out with quick @-@ voiced warnings about the failings of media truth . " 
 Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times called " Scream " the best song on the album . He continued , " The refrain of " Stop <unk> ' me ! " is compelling , and he spits out the lyrics with drama and purpose . The song has bite and infectious energy . " MacDonald did , however , consider the use of profanity unnecessary . Deepika Reddy of The Daily Collegian wrote , " The lyrics to the album 's debut single and video ' Scream ' are for the first time in Jackson 's convoluted career , painfully direct . He sings ' Stop pressuring me / Stop pressuring me / It makes me want to scream ' with a force and resentment that 's new and surpassing . " " ' Scream ' and ' Tabloid Junkie ' have a raw aspect that Jackson hasn 't approached since a near @-@ miss with ' Billie Jean . ' " Richard Harrington of The Washington Post , however , called it " dull and musically uninvolved . " He was also of the opinion that it sounded like " Jam " from 1991 , thus dated . " Scream " was nominated for " Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals " at the 1996 American Music Awards , and shortly afterward it gained a Grammy nomination for " Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals . "

 The 4 : 46 minute music video for " Scream " was choreographed by Travis Payne , <unk> Smith Jnr , Tina Landon and Sacha <unk> in May 1995 , and Sean Cheesman , directed by Mark Romanek , with the production being designed by Tom Foden . Jackson did not create the " concept " for the video , which he had often done in the past , but left it to Romanek . Jackson later described the making of " Scream " as a collaborative effort . The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media in 1993 . 
 Foden commented , " Mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that Michael and Janet were on this large spacecraft . And they were alone ... They were getting away from Earth , and the different sets were the different environments on the spacecraft where they could have a little bit of fun and where they could relax . " Production of the music video 's 13 @-@ piece set were restricted to a one @-@ month period and is produced by Foden art directors Richard Berg , Jeff Hall , and Martin <unk> . Foden describes the assignment as a " military operation " explaining , " The idea was to give each of the art directors three sets : a complicated one , a not @-@ so @-@ complicated one , and one of the smaller , easier vignettes . " Typography in the video was designed by P. Scott <unk> . Jackson was happy to work with his sister again , explaining that as they still had a passion for dancing it reminded him of " old times . " 
 In the video , Janet Jackson takes on a darker persona , previously unseen in her own music videos . Jim Farber of the New York Daily News described her as " Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair , and eyes darkened by coal @-@ black makeup ... sullen and arty ... Janet , however , never looked tougher , or more in control . " In the video , a sign appears with the logo of the song 's title . The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside . Then , the lights came on and reveal Michael and Janet inside a small hole . Suddenly , the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy , sending them screaming . In the first verse , Michael is seen in the room where he is floating on gravity . Then , Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse . Then , it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag . Then , it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of Gregory Peck , art painting , statues , etc . Next , it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins . Then , Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while at the core of the craft , grabs at her breasts , gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation . ( In the out @-@ takes , there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger . ) Meanwhile , Michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is playing a Chinese person before screaming which breaks the glass above him . Then , Michael and Janet perform a dance breakdown . Then , it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael . Then , Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars . The video has influences of Japanese sci @-@ fi Anime - several clips of the Zillion anime series and the movie Akira can be seen in the background screens . The version of the video included on Michael Jackson 's Vision is uncut and contains the " Stop fucking with me " lyric , which was censored in HIStory on Film , Volume II . 
 = = = = Reception and influence = = = = 
 The video premiered in the summer of 1995 , on MTV and BET and the next evening on ABC @-@ TV 's " Primetime Live " during Diane Sawyer 's interview with Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley . The interview was broadcast to approximately 64 million viewers . The video is one of Jackson 's most critically acclaimed pieces , Heather Phares of Allmusic described the video as a " stylish , interstellar clip . " James Hunter of Rolling Stone called it a contemporary video , " in which Michael and his sister Janet jump around like ' 90s fashion kids trapped in a spaceship stolen from a Barbarella film set . " Jim Farber called it a " supercool black @-@ and @-@ white clip ... The clip 's great allure is that neither of the siblings looks quite real . While the visuals hold barely any connection to the lyric , and seem to have no clear point , the weird look captivates . " He was of the opinion that while Michael Jackson outshines his sister in the vocals , it is Janet Jackson who gives the better performance in the music video . 
 In 1995 , Scream gained 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations — more than any other music video — and won " Best Dance Video " , " Best Choreography " , and " Best Art Direction . " Reacting to this , Jackson stated that he was " very honored " , explaining that he had worked " very hard " and he was " very happy " with the reception up to that point . It was also given a Billboard Music Award for best Pop / Rock video . A year later , it won a Grammy for Best Music Video , Short Form ; shortly afterward Guinness World Records listed it as the most expensive music video ever made at a cost of $ 7 million , although this was later refuted by the director . In 2001 , VH1 placed " Scream " at number nine on their list of the 100 greatest music videos . 
 In 1997 , " Scream " was remixed as " Scream Louder ( Flyte Tyme Remix ) " for Michael Jackson 's remix album Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix . The remix used elements from the Sly & The Family Stone song Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again ) . Another official remix was produced by Naughty By Nature and was called , " Scream ( Naughty Remix ) " and has a new urban R & B instrumental beat & a rap verse by <unk> of Naughty By Nature . 
 " Scream " was a creative influence on other music videos such as the 1999 release of the award winning " No Scrubs " by TLC . This influence was also present on the 2008 release of " Shawty Get Loose " by Lil Mama and Chris Brown . Reacting to the comparisons made between the videos , Mama explained , " I feel honored , because that was one of the initial goals , and I feel that it was executed well . " She adding that the emulation was intentional and that Brown was the only logical choice to step into Michael Jackson 's role . Ciara 's music video for her single " I 'm Out " was heavily influenced by the video by referencing the all @-@ white scenery and attire .

 In September 2009 , Janet Jackson performed " Scream " on the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards as part of a medley tribute to Michael Jackson , who died three months earlier . MTV General Manager Stephen Friedman stated " [ t ] his is not something that just came together — we 've been in talks with [ Janet ] for a while ...

" She worked with several world @-@ renowned choreographers , including Dave Scott , Cris Judd , Brian Friedman , Wade Robson , <unk> Diorio , Travis Payne , Jeri Slaughter , Laurie Ann Gibson , Mia Michaels and Tina Landon , with her personal creative director , Gil Duldulao , coordinating the performance . Gil Kaufman of MTV commented " [ w ] <unk> a black @-@ and @-@ white , skintight leather dress with matching pants , Janet busted some of her and Michael 's signature moves , flawlessly re @-@ creating her late brother 's steps as they were projected on the screen behind her .

 = = " Childhood " = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 " Childhood " is a biographical reference to Jackson 's difficult years as a youngster , such as the relationship with his father Joseph and the pressures of being world famous from such a young age as the lead singer of The Jackson 5 . From a young age Jackson and his siblings were allegedly physically and emotionally abused by their father through incessant rehearsals , whippings and derogatory name calling . Jackson 's abuse as a child had affected him throughout his later life . In one altercation — later recalled by Marlon Jackson — Joseph held Michael Jackson upside down by one leg and " pummelled him over and over again with his hand , hitting him on his back and buttocks " . Joseph would allegedly often trip up or push his sons into walls . One night , while Jackson was asleep , Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window . Wearing a fright mask , he entered the room screaming and shouting . Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep . For a number of years afterward , Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom . 
 Although it had been reported for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood , he first spoke openly about it in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey . He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father ; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood , admitting that he often cried from loneliness . In the same interview , speaking of his father , Jackson said , " There were times when he 'd come to see me , I 'd get sick ... I 'd start to regurgitate . I 'm sorry ... Please don 't be mad at me ... But I do love him " . In Jackson 's other high profile interview Living with Michael Jackson ( 2003 ) , he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse . Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed , saying , " He had this belt in his hand . If you didn 't do it the right way , he would tear you up , really get you . It was bad . Real bad " . When Jackson received his Living Legend award — presented to him by Janet Jackson — at the 1993 Grammys , he said , " I don 't read all the things written about me , I wasn 't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre . But when you grow up like I did in front of 100 million people since the age of five , you 're automatically different ... My childhood was completely taken away from me . There was no Christmas , no birthdays . It was not a normal childhood , no normal pleasures of childhood . Those were exchanged for hard work , struggle and pain , and eventual material and professional success " . 
 Both of Jackson 's parents have denied the longstanding abuse allegations and Katherine acknowledges that although the whippings are viewed as child abuse by current generations , such disciplinary methods were normal back then . In an interview , Jackie , Tito , Jermaine and Marlon have also denied that their father is abusive and according to Jermaine , he is , second to Michael , one of the most misunderstood people .

 " Childhood " is a biographical song , written , produced and sung solely by Michael Jackson . The New York City 's children 's choir is credited for providing backing vocals on the track . It became the main theme song for the Free Willy 2 : The Adventure Home soundtrack , which was released by Jackson on his record label MJJ . Jackson had previously provided the main theme song for the first Free Willy film , his hit single " Will You Be There " , originally from Dangerous . Aside from HIStory and the Free Willy 2 : The Adventure Home soundtrack , " Childhood " appeared on compilations such as Movie Music : The Definitive Performances and Sony Music 100 Years : Soundtrack for a Century . 
 Jon Pareles described it as a " defense show ... Over tinkling keyboards and strings that could be sweeping across a <unk> panorama , he croons [ the lyrics ] " . He described it as " creepy " yet " lushest " . In the song , Jackson states , " No one understands me ... They view it as such strange eccentricities , ' cause I keep kidding around " . He invokes " the painful youth I 've had " and asks the public to , " Try hard to love me " and , with a breaking voice , asks , " Have you seen my childhood ? " . James Hunter believed , " uncut Hollywood fluff like " Childhood " ... has zero point of view on itself ; its blend of rampaging ego and static orchestral pop is a Streisand @-@ size mistake " . Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times described it as " dynamically enunciated reading and maudlin string arrangement directly invoke Streisand " . Tim Molloy , of the Associated Press , called it a sweet sounding pleading song . Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times described " Childhood " as " a sad , self @-@ pitying song , but quite moving and beautiful " . Taraborrelli observed that the song was not purely about his bad childhood years , but was also a plea for compassion and understanding . The song was covered by Italian singer Cristina D <unk> for her 2009 Magia Di Natale album as a tribute to Michael Jackson .

 The video is set in a forest ; Jackson , in scruffy clothes , sings " Childhood " while sitting on a tree stump . The camera moves up the trees into the night sky and flying airships travel overhead . On board the ships , children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson , towards the moon . Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships , but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump .

 Georg Eduard Albert Krugers ( also written as G. Kruger ) was a cameraman and film director active in the Dutch East Indies ( modern Indonesia ) during the early 20th century . He is recorded as having worked in film since the mid @-@ 1920s , and in 1927 he made his directorial debut , Eulis Atjih . He joined hajj pilgrims in 1928 and screened the resulting documentary in the Netherlands . His 1930 film Karnadi Anemer Bangkong is thought to be the first talkie in the cinema of the Indies , but was a commercial failure as the majority Sundanese audience considered it insulting . After making two works for Tan 's Film in the early 1930s , Krugers moved to Hong Kong , where he died in 1937 . 
 = = Silent film = = 
 Sources disagree regarding much of Krugers ' life . J. B. Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia lists him as having been born in Hong Kong , but does not give a year . However , a 1933 newspaper report gave Krugers ' age as 43 and his place of birth as Banda <unk> , and a Georg Eduard Albert Krugers is known to be born there in 1890 . 
 Krugers is recorded as having been active in film in the mid @-@ 1920s , leading the laboratory at N.V. Java Film . He may have been one of its founders , together with the Dutchman L. Heuveldorp . The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926 , when Heuveldorp directed the colony 's first feature film , Loetoeng Kasaroeng . Krugers served as a cameraman for the film , which was based on a Sundanese folktale , also processing the film in his laboratory in Bandung . 
 The following year , Krugers directed his own film , titled Eulis Atjih , which followed the beautiful Eulis Atjih as she falls into poverty after being left by her husband . International release emphasised the ethnographic aspects of the film . The film was a commercial failure , but Krugers told his backers that the film had recouped its expenses . Later that year Krugers left Java Film to form his own company , Krugers <unk> ( Krugers Film Company ) , 
 By 1928 he was reportedly working on film adaptations of the folktales Roro Mendut and <unk> <unk> , although it is not known if he finished them . He did , however , complete a documentary entitled Het Groote <unk> @-@ <unk> ( The Great Mecca Feast ) which followed hajj pilgrims from the Indies during their trip to Mecca . The film premiered in Leiden , the Netherlands , on November 8 , 1928 . This premiere was attended by numerous Dutch socialites , including Princess Juliana , and given an introduction by Dutch Orientalist Christiaan <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Talkies = = 
 The first talkies shown in the Indies , Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man ( both 1929 ) , came from the United States and were screened in late 1929 . This encouraged Krugers to make Karnadi Anemer Bangkong ( Karnadi the Frog Contractor ) , an adaptation of the book by <unk> , in 1930 . The comedy , made with a single system camera that Krugers had obtained with the help of his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership , is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country , but had poor technical quality . It was a critical failure , as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted ; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that this poor reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog , something which is forbidden for Muslims . 
 Following this failure , Krugers made the documentary Atma De <unk> ( 1931 ) , which followed Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik on a trip through the Hague , before being signed to Tan 's Film . With Tan 's , Krugers made two films . First he was asked to handle cinematography on Bachtiar Effendi 's 1932 talkie Njai Dasima , an adaptation of G. Francis ' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima ( Story of Njai Dasima ) . He then directed and produced <unk> op Bevel ( Forced to Marry ; 1931 ) , which was advertised as featuring songs and comedy . The film was a commercial failure , leading to all rights being acquired by Tan 's . He is recorded as planning a further two films , De Nona ( Of Ladies ) and <unk> , but neither was made . 
 During 1934 and early 1935 , all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun . This situation was created by the Great Depression , which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes , advertisers asking for more money , and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices ; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films . During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions .

 " Rather Die Young " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her fourth studio album , 4 ( 2011 ) . Composed by Beyoncé , Jeff Bhasker , Luke Steele , the song 's development was motivated by the fact that Beyoncé wanted a song that would help people through both their painful and happy moments . " Rather Die Young " is an R & B @-@ soul power ballad that is instrumentally complete with synthesizers , a piano , a strummy guitar , and heavy drums , which were inspired by the work of the American band Earth , Wind & Fire . Lyrically , the song talks about the inability to fight what the heart wants . The female protagonist sings to an indifferent love interest , whom she likens to American actor James Dean and tells him that she prefers to die rather than live without him . 
 " Rather Die Young " was generally well received by contemporary music critics who described it as a dark , yet enchanting ballad . They highlighted Beyoncé 's vocal power and the song 's melody . Critics also noted that the ballad was heavily influenced by the 1980s R & B and soul music , adding that it has a Philadelphia soul vibe . However , some of them commented that it was barely distinguishable among the other songs on 4 , criticizing its chorus which , according to them , forms the major part of the song . Following the release of 4 , " Rather Die Young " charted at number 37 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart , based on downloads alone . The song was part of Beyoncé 's set list for her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé shows , held at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City .

 " Rather Die Young " is an R & B @-@ soul power ballad , which is heavily influenced by the 1990s R & B music and the 1970s soul music . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian commented that it refracts " a dramatic Philadelphia soul ballad through gauzy modern production " . " Rather Die Young " also contains elements of retro pop music . The song is built on a heavy laid @-@ back programmed drumbeat , which according to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , was inspired by the material of American band Earth , Wind & Fire . Additional instrumentation includes a horn section , a weave of synthesizers , a piano , a keyboard , and a strummy guitar . Priya Elan of NME noted that " Rather Die Young " gets close to the " smoky soul styling " of Anita Baker , before adding that its chorus bears similarities to Andrew Lloyd Webber 's previous work and jazz hands . Jim Farber of The Daily News wrote that " ' Rather Die Young ' has a choir of Beyoncés " that recalls the harmonies of all @-@ female singing group The Emotions . Simon Goddard of Q magazine compared the song with Massive Attack 's " Protection " ( 1995 ) and also noted similarities with The Shangri @-@ Las ' songs . 
 Lyrically , " Rather Die Young " talks about the inability to fight what the heart wants , even if it is wrong . Beyoncé <unk> herself at the mercy of an indifferent love interest , telling him that she would rather die young than to live her life without him . Beyoncé also sings about leaving a legacy as she shows her " epic " neediness to her love interest , as stated by Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club . The music stays soft in the first verse , where Beyoncé likens her romantic interest to American actor James Dean , " You 're my James Dean / you make me feel like I 'm seventeen " . She also relates about how good girls often fall for bad boys ; she affirms that " bad boy " she loves , " drive [ s ] too fast " and " smoke [ s ] too much " . During the chorus , Beyoncé projects the image of a woman , who wants to love and be loved regardless of what others may say , " I 'd rather die young / Than live my life without you / Rather not live at all " . As the song progresses , Beyoncé references " some deeper emotional fires burning " as she sings , " Nobody understands what we 've been through " .

 The song received generally positive reviews . Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that " Rather Die Young " is a " dark , yet enchanting ... mesmerising " ballad , noting that as Beyoncé sings , she give listeners a sense of mystery .

Likewise , Chad Grischow of the website IGN wrote that the song gives Beyoncé 's vocals room to shine with " some beautifully soft verses and [ a ] belted hook " . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called " Rather Die Young " a fantastic and dramatic song . Similarly , Rolling Stone 's Matthew Perpetua wrote , " There 's a great melodramatic kick to this song , which comes across like a quiet storm slow jam spiced up with modern drum programming . ' I 'd rather not live at all than live my life without you ' is an unusually self @-@ pitying lyric for Beyoncé , but she sells it well regardless . " Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism for the song , writing : 
 [ Knowles ' ] utterance of ' you 're my James Dean / you make me feel like I 'm seventeen ' on ' Rather Die Young ' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides . Certainly , the ' bad boy ' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who ' drive too fast ' and ' smoke too much ' than an actual person , but at least it feels tangible . For once , the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn 't feel like a total fraud . Forget Lady Gaga 's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears ' lullaby to her babies – here , I 'm convinced , if only for a moment , that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover , that she cares , even if you don 't . This doesn 't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is , but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – and it turns out that those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé 's voice itself . 
 Prefix magazine 's Craig Jenkins found " retro @-@ leaning flourishes and propulsive boom bap in equal measure " in " Rather Die Young " .

 A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly , who compared Beyoncé 's work on " Rather Die Young " to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross , but felt the tone overshadowed her style , stating that " she gets lost in her idols ' polyester @-@ swathed shadows " . Matthew Horton of BBC Online wrote that the ballad is less successful than the other songs on 4 because of its " overdone glitz " . Similarly , NME 's Hamish MacBain classified " Rather Die Young " as one of the " barely distinguishable slowies " , and Priya Elan of the same publication wrote that the song is spoilt by " some rather drippy lyrics and [ its ] chorus " , adding that there are several lyrical references that " instead of being explained further , are overturned in favour of some romantic mulch " . Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune noted that the song was a little more than a chorus on repeat . Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that " Rather Die Young " ruins its Philly soul vibe with " a theatrical Broadway glaze " .

 = = Plot = = 
 Scientist David Banner introduces the idea of creating super soldiers by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response , making them effectively impervious to any weaponized agent , but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects . Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself . After the birth of his son Bruce , he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure , but is stopped in the process . Bruce remembers nothing of the incident after a traumatic event , and has been raised by the <unk> . Years later , Bruce is a geneticist working with his ex @-@ girlfriend Betty Ross , within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on <unk> research . The pair hope to achieve <unk> cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the <unk> once they are introduced into a living organism . During routine maintenance of their appropriated <unk> , a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment 's program sequence . Unable to prevent the machine from firing , Bruce throws himself in front of his colleague to shield him and is exposed to incredibly toxic levels of Gamma Radiation . 
 Betty visits Bruce in the hospital and remarks that he should be dead , but Bruce feels great . A new janitor at the lab claims that he is Bruce 's biological father , of whom Bruce has no recollection . When under extreme stress , Bruce transforms into the Hulk who destroys the laboratory , though he has no memory of the incident . General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with his father but then deduces Bruce has repressed memories . He orders Bruce to be put under house arrest . Through a phone call with his father , Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in his DNA , and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his dogs , which now have similar powers to the Hulk ( thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation ) , and he is attacked by Major Glenn Talbot , leading to a transformation into the Hulk . The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty from the dogs . The Hulk kills David 's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning . 
 Kept at a secret desert base , Bruce is kept under observation while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk 's powers . David Banner tries to recreate Bruce 's failed experiment , but instead of turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any materials and energy he touches , and hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he murdered his wife in front of the child Bruce . Bruce has a nightmare about the event which leads to a more powerful transformation of the Hulk . Talbot is killed in an explosion of his own making . The Hulk escapes the base and rampages his way across the desert to San Francisco , battling army forces sent after him . When Betty calms him into his human form , General Ross realizes that the Hulk cannot be controlled and that Bruce should be executed . 
 At their mutual execution , David Banner tries to taunt his son into transforming into Hulk , but fails . He then decides to " go first " and bites an electrical cable absorbing all the electricity in San Francisco . The electricity hits Bruce , triggering his own transformation . A brutal fight ensues between David and the Hulk , with David absorbing Hulk 's energy during the fight . David finds that the Hulk 's energy is too much for him to handle and he is killed by an army missile at the height of his weakness . One year later , though Bruce is presumed dead , General Ross mentions apparent Hulk sightings and Betty admits her love for Bruce . In a South American jungle , Bruce has become a doctor and is approached by rebel militants who want to take medical supplies from the poor . Bruce 's eyes turn green and a scream of the Hulk is heard .

 Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd started the development for Hulk in 1990 , the same year the final TV movie based on the 1970s TV series aired . They set the property up at Universal Pictures in 1992 . Michael France and Stan Lee were invited into Universal 's offices in 1994 , with France writing the script . Universal 's concept was to have the Hulk battle terrorists , an idea France disliked . John Turman , a Hulk comic book fan , was brought to write the script in 1995 , getting approval from Lee . Turman wrote ten drafts and was heavily influenced by the Tales to Astonish issues , which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military , the Leader , Rick Jones , the atomic explosion origin from the comics , and Brian Banner as the explanation for Bruce 's inner anger . Universal had mixed feelings over Turman 's script , but nonetheless future screenwriters would use many elements . 
 Hurd brought her husband Jonathan Hensleigh as co @-@ producer the following year and Industrial Light & Magic was hired to use computer @-@ generated imagery to create the Hulk . Universal was courting France once more to write the script , but changed their minds when Joe Johnston became the director in April 1997 . The studio wanted Hensleigh to rewrite the script due to his successful results on Johnston 's Jumanji . France was fired before he wrote a single page , but received a buy @-@ off from Universal . Johnston dropped out of directing in July 1997 in favor of October Sky , and Hensleigh convinced Universal to make the Hulk his directing debut . Turman was brought back a second time to write two more drafts . Zak Penn then rewrote it . His script featured a fight between the Hulk and a school of sharks , as well as two scenes he eventually used for the 2008 film ; Banner realizing he is unable to have sex , and triggering a transformation by falling out of a helicopter . Hensleigh rewrote from scratch , coming up with a brand new storyline featuring Bruce Banner , who prior to the accident which will turn him into The Hulk , experimenting with gamma @-@ irradiated insect DNA on three convicts . This transforms the convicts into " insect men " that cause havoc . 
 Filming was set to start in December 1997 in Arizona for a summer 1999 release date , but filming was pushed back for four months . Hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with J. J. Abrams . Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were also brought on board to rewrite with Hensleigh still attached as director . In October 1997 , Hulk had entered pre @-@ production with the creation of prosthetic makeup and computer animation already under way . Gregory <unk> was cast as " Novak " , Banner 's archenemy while Lynn " Red " Williams was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human , ant and beetle . In March 1998 Universal put Hulk on hiatus due to its escalating $ 100 million budget and worries of Hensleigh directing his first film . $ 20 million was already spent on script development , computer animation , and prosthetics work . Hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script in order to lower the budget . 
 = = = Michael France = = = 
 Hensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out , and felt he " wasted nine months in pre @-@ production " . It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time . France claimed " Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn 't sure if this was a science fiction adventure , or a comedy , and I kept getting directions to write both . I think that at some point when I wasn 't in the room , there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie . " France was writing the script on fast track from July — September 1999 . Filming for Hulk was to start in April 2000 . 
 France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts , which based Bruce Banner on his " amiable , nerdy genius " incarnation in the 1960s . France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner , Bruce 's abusive father who killed his mother . His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father . However , he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created , which makes everything worse . The " Don 't make me angry ... " line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner 's father would say before beating his son . Elements such as the " <unk> " , Banner 's tragic romance with Ross , and the black ops made it to the final film . France turned in his final drafts in late 1999 @-@ January 2000 . 
 = = = Ang Lee = = = 
 Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote the script afterwards , despite positive response from the producers over France 's script . Tolkin was brought in January 2000 , while Hayter was brought in September of that year . Hayter 's draft featured The Leader , <unk> , and the Absorbing Man as the villains , who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and get caught in the same accident that creates the Hulk . Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20 , 2001 . Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter 's script , and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite , merging Banner 's father with the Absorbing Man . Lee cited influences from King Kong , Frankenstein , Jekyll and Hyde , Beauty and the Beast , Faust , and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story . Schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced Brian Banner , thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father @-@ son themes . 
 Schamus was still rewriting the script in October 2001 . In early 2002 , as filming was underway , Michael France read all the scripts for the Writers Guild of America , to determine who would get final credit . France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character , and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman 's work in interviews . Schamus elected to get solo credit . France felt , " James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay . For example , he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner 's father as a real character in the present . But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman 's scripts and quite a lot from mine , and that 's why we were credited . " France , Turman and Schamus received final credit . A theatrical release date for June 20 , 2003 was announced in December 2002 , with the film 's title as The Hulk .

 Filming began on March 18 , 2002 in Arizona , and moved on April 19 to the San Francisco Bay Area . This included Advanced Light Source , Lawrence Berkeley labs , Oakland , Treasure Island military base , and the sequoia forests of Porterville , before several weeks in the Utah and Californian deserts . Filming then moved to the Universal backlot in Los Angeles , using Stage 12 for the water tank scene , before finishing in the first week of August . Filming of Hulk constituted hiring 3 @,@ 000 local workers , generating over $ 10 million into the local economy . Mychael Danna , who previously collaborated with Lee on Ride with the Devil and The Ice Storm , was set to compose the film score before dropping out . Danny Elfman was then hired . 
 Eric Bana commented that the shoot was , " <unk> serious ... a silent set , morbid in a lot of ways . " Lee told him that he was shooting a Greek tragedy : he would be making a " whole other movie " about the Hulk at Industrial Light & Magic . An example of Lee 's art house approach to the film was taking Bana to watch a bare @-@ knuckle boxing match . Visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren was on the set every day . One of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for Bana was a split screen technique employed by Lee to cinematically mimic the panels of a comic book page . This required many more takes of individual scenes than normal . Sound design was completed at Skywalker Sound . Muren and other ILM animators used previous technology from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ( for the Dobby character ) to create the Hulk with computer @-@ generated imagery . Other software used included PowerAnimator , Softimage XSI , and RenderMan Interface Specification . ILM started computer animation work in 2001 , and completed in May 2003 , just one month before the film 's release . Lee provided some motion capture work in post @-@ production .

 The musical score for Hulk was composed by Danny Elfman , who scored Spider @-@ Man the previous year . Frequent Ang Lee collaborator , Mychael Danna , was the original composer for the film . However , Danna 's score was rejected by studio executives for its non @-@ traditional approach , which featured Japanese taiko , African drumming , and Arabic singing . Elfman was then approached by Universal 's president of film music , Kathy Nelson . With 37 days to compose over two hours of music , Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee . While instructing to retain much of the character of Danna 's score , Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores . " They did leave some of my music in the movie , " said Danna , " so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine . What happened is that they panicked , they brought in Danny and he heard what I 've been doing and I guess he liked it . " 
 A soundtrack album was released on June 17 , 2003 by Decca Records . It features the song " Set Me Free " by Velvet Revolver , which is played during the film 's end credits .

 Hulk received mixed reviews from critics . Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 61 % approval rating out of 227 reviews . The website 's critical consensus reads , " While Ang Lee 's ambitious film earns marks for style and an attempt at dramatic depth , there 's ultimately too much talking and not enough smashing . " By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 54 based on 40 reviews . Roger Ebert gave a positive review , explaining , " Ang Lee is trying to actually deal with the issues in the story of the Hulk , instead of simply cutting to brainless visual effects . " Ebert also liked how the Hulk 's movements resembled King Kong . Although Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt Hulk should have been shorter , he heavily praised the action sequences , especially the climax and cliffhanger . Paul Clinton of CNN believed the cast gave strong performances , but in an otherwise positive review , heavily criticized the computer @-@ generated imagery , calling the Hulk " a ticked @-@ off version of Shrek " . 
 Conversely , Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle considered " the film is more thoughtful and pleasing to the eye than any blockbuster in recent memory , but its epic length comes without an epic reward .

 = Adrastea ( moon ) = 
 Adrastea ( / <unk> / ad @-@ <unk> @-@ STEE @-@ ə ; Greek : <unk> ) , also known as Jupiter XV , is the second by distance , and the smallest of the four inner moons of Jupiter . It was discovered in photographs taken by Voyager 2 in 1979 , making it the first natural satellite to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft , rather than through a telescope . It was officially named after the mythological <unk> , foster mother of the Greek god Zeus — the equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter . 
 Adrastea is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet 's day . It orbits at the edge of Jupiter 's Main Ring and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the Rings of Jupiter . Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft , very little is known about the moon 's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter . 
 = = Discovery and observations = = 
 Adrastea was discovered by David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson in Voyager 2 probe photographs taken on July 8 , 1979 , and received the designation S / 1979 J 1 . Although it appeared only as a dot , it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft . Soon after its discovery , two other of the inner moons of Jupiter ( Thebe and Metis ) were observed in the images taken a few months earlier by Voyager 1 . The Galileo spacecraft was able to determine the moon 's shape in 1998 , but the images remain poor . In 1983 , Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph Adrastea , the daughter of Zeus and his lover <unk> . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Adrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20 × 16 × 14 km across . A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1 @,@ 600 ( ~ 1 @,@ 200 ) km2 . This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons . The bulk , composition and mass of Adrastea are not known , but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea , around 0 @.@ 86 g / cm3 , its mass can be estimated at about 2 × 1015 kg . Amalthea 's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10 – 15 % , and Adrastea may be similar . 
 No surface details of Adrastea are known , due to the low resolution of available images . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the inner Jovian satellite family . It orbits Jupiter at a radius of about 129 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @.@ 806 Jupiter radii ) at the exterior edge of the planet 's Main Ring . Adrastea is one of only three moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet 's day — the other two being Jupiter 's innermost moon Metis , and Mars ' moon Phobos . The orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination — around 0 @.@ 0015 and 0 @.@ 03 ° , respectively . Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter . 
 Due to tidal locking , Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period , keeping one face always looking toward the planet . Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter , this being the lowest energy configuration . 
 The orbit of Adrastea lies inside Jupiter 's synchronous orbit radius ( as does Metis 's ) , and as a result , tidal forces are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter . If its density is similar to Amalthea 's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid Roche limit . However , since it is not breaking up , it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit . 
 Adrastea is the second @-@ fastest moving of Jupiter 's moons , with an orbital speed of 31 @.@ 378 km / s . 
 = = Relationship with Jupiter 's rings = = 
 Adrastea is the largest contributor to material in Jupiter 's rings . This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter 's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts . It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space . This is due to the satellites ' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres . 
 It seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material , as evidenced by the densest ring ( the Main Ring ) being located at and within Adrastea 's orbit . More precisely , the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter 's Main Ring . The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images : in forward @-@ scattered light Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring , but in back @-@ scattered light ( which reveals much bigger particles ) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea 's orbit . 
 = Little egret = 
 The little egret ( Egretta garzetta ) is a species of small heron in the family Ardeidae . The genus name comes from the Provençal French <unk> , " egret " , a diminutive of <unk> , " heron " . The species epithet garzetta is from the Italian name for this bird , garzetta or <unk> . 
 It is a white bird with a slender black beak , long black legs and , in the western race , yellow feet . As an aquatic bird , it feeds in shallow water and on land , consuming a variety of small creatures . It breeds colonially , often with other species of water birds , making a platform nest of sticks in a tree , bush or reed bed . A clutch of bluish @-@ green eggs is laid and incubated by both parents . The young fledge at about six weeks of age . 
 Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Europe , Africa , Asia , and Australia . In warmer locations , most birds are permanent residents ; northern populations , including many European birds , migrate to Africa and southern Asia to over @-@ winter there . The birds may also wander north in late summer after the breeding season , and their tendency to disperse may have assisted in the recent expansion of the bird 's range . At one time common in Western Europe , it was hunted extensively in the 19th century to provide plumes for the decoration of hats and became locally extinct in northwestern Europe and scarce in the south . Around 1950 , conservation laws were introduced in southern Europe to protect the species and their numbers began to increase . By the beginning of the 21st century the bird was breeding again in France , the Netherlands , Ireland and Britain . It has also begun to colonise the New World ; it was first seen in Barbados in 1954 and first bred there in 1994 . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird 's global conservation status as being of " least concern " . 
 = = Subspecies = = 
 Depending on authority , two or three subspecies of little egret are currently accepted : 
 E. g. garzetta – ( Linnaeus , 1766 ) : nominate , found in Europe , Africa , and most of Asia except the south @-@ east 
 E. g. nigripes – ( Temminck , 1840 ) : found in Indonesia east to New Guinea 
 E. g. <unk> – Australia and ( non @-@ breeding ) New Zealand , often considered synonymous with E. g. nigripes 
 Three other egret taxa have at times been classified as subspecies of the little egret in the past but are now regarded as two separate species . These are the western reef heron Egretta gularis which occurs on the coastline of West Africa ( Egretta gularis gularis ) and from the Red Sea to India ( Egretta gularis <unk> ) , and the dimorphic egret Egretta dimorpha , found in East Africa , Madagascar , the Comoros and the Aldabra Islands . 
 = = Description = = 
 The adult little egret is 55 – 65 cm ( 22 – 26 in ) long with an 88 – 106 cm ( 35 – 42 in ) wingspan , and weighs 350 – 550 g ( 12 – 19 oz ) . Its plumage is normally entirely white , although there are dark forms with largely bluish @-@ grey plumage . In the breeding season , the adult has two long plumes on the nape that form a crest . These plumes are about 150 mm ( 6 in ) and are pointed and very narrow . There are similar feathers on the breast , but the barbs are more widely spread . There are also several elongated scapular feathers that have long loose barbs and may be 200 mm ( 8 in ) long . During the winter the plumage is similar but the scapulars are shorter and more normal in appearance . The bill is long and slender and it and the lores are black . There is an area of greenish @-@ grey bare skin at the base of the lower mandible and around the eye which has a yellow iris . The legs are black and the feet yellow . Juveniles are similar to non @-@ breeding adults but have greenish @-@ black legs and duller yellow feet , and may have a certain proportion of greyish or brownish feathers . The subspecies nigripes differs in having yellow skin between the bill and eye , and blackish feet . During the height of courtship , the lores turn red and the feet of the yellow @-@ footed races turn red . 
 Little egrets are mostly silent but make various croaking and bubbling calls at their breeding colonies and produce a harsh alarm call when disturbed . To the human ear , the sounds are indistinguishable from the black @-@ crowned night heron ( Nycticorax nycticorax ) and the cattle egret ( Bubulcus ibis ) with which it sometimes associates . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The breeding range of the western race ( E. g. garzetta ) includes southern Europe , the Middle East , much of Africa and southern Asia . Northern European populations are migratory , mostly travelling to Africa although some remain in southern Europe , while some Asian populations migrate to the Philippines . The eastern race , ( E. g. nigripes ) , is resident in Indonesia and New Guinea , while E. g. <unk> inhabits Australia and New Zealand , but does not breed in the latter . During the late twentieth century , the range of the little egret expanded northwards in Europe and into the New World , where a breeding population was established on Barbados in 1994 . The birds have since spread elsewhere in the Caribbean region and on the Atlantic coast of the United States . 
 The little egret 's habitat varies widely , and includes the shores of lakes , rivers , canals , ponds , lagoons , marshes and flooded land , the bird preferring open locations to dense cover . On the coast it inhabits mangrove areas , swamps , mudflats , sandy beaches and reefs . Rice fields are an important habitat in Italy , and coastal and mangrove areas are important in Africa . The bird often moves about among cattle or other hoofed mammals . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Little egrets are sociable birds and are often seen in small flocks . Nevertheless , individual birds do not tolerate others coming too close to their chosen feeding site , though this depends on the abundance of prey . They use a variety of methods to procure their food ; they stalk their prey in shallow water , often running with raised wings or shuffling their feet to disturb small fish , or may stand still and wait to ambush prey . They make use of opportunities provided by cormorants disturbing fish or humans attracting fish by throwing bread into water . On land they walk or run while chasing their prey , feed on creatures disturbed by grazing livestock and ticks on the livestock , and even scavenge . Their diet is mainly fish , but amphibians , small reptiles , mammals and birds are also eaten , as well as crustaceans , molluscs , insects , spiders and worms . 
 Little egrets nest in colonies , often with other wading birds . On the coasts of western India these colonies may be in urban areas , and associated birds include cattle egrets ( Bubulcus ibis ) , black @-@ crowned night herons ( Nycticorax nycticorax ) and black @-@ headed ibises ( Threskiornis melanocephalus ) . In Europe , associated species may be <unk> herons ( <unk> <unk> ) , cattle egrets , black @-@ crowned night herons and glossy ibises ( Plegadis falcinellus ) . The nests are usually platforms of sticks built in trees or shrubs , or in reed beds or bamboo groves . In some locations such as the Cape Verde Islands , the birds nest on cliffs . Pairs defend a small breeding territory , usually extending around 3 to 4 m ( 10 to 13 ft ) from the nest . The three to five eggs are incubated by both adults for 21 to 25 days before hatching . They are oval in shape and have a pale , non @-@ glossy , blue @-@ green shell colour . The young birds are covered in white down feathers , are cared for by both parents and fledge after 40 to 45 days . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Globally , the little egret is not listed as a threatened species and has in fact expanded its range over the last few decades . The International Union for Conservation of Nature states that their wide distribution and large total population means that they are a species that cause them " least concern " . 
 = = = Status in northwestern Europe = = = 
 Historical research has shown that the little egret was once present , and probably common , in Ireland and Great Britain , but became extinct there through a combination of over @-@ hunting in the late mediaeval period and climate change at the start of the Little Ice Age . The inclusion of 1 @,@ 000 egrets ( among numerous other birds ) in the banquet to celebrate the enthronement of George Neville as Archbishop of York at Cawood Castle in 1465 indicates the presence of a sizable population in northern England at the time , and they are also listed in the coronation feast of King Henry VI in 1429 . They had become scarce by the mid @-@ 16th century , when William <unk> , " yeoman purveyor to the <unk> <unk> " , " had to send further south " for egrets . In 1804 Thomas Bewick commented that if it were the same bird as listed in Neville 's bill of fare " No wonder this species has become nearly extinct in this country ! " 
 Further declines occurred throughout Europe as the plumes of the little egret and other egrets were in demand for decorating hats . They had been used for this purpose since at least the 17th century but in the 19th century it became a major craze and the number of egret skins passing through dealers reached into the millions . Complete statistics do not exist , but in the first three months of 1885 , 750 @,@ 000 egret skins were sold in London , while in 1887 one London dealer sold 2 million egret skins . Egret farms were set up where the birds could be plucked without being killed but most of the supply of so @-@ called " Osprey plumes " was obtained by hunting , which reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels and stimulated the establishment of Britain 's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1889 . 
 By the 1950s , the little egret had become restricted to southern Europe , and conservation laws protecting the species were introduced . This allowed the population to rebound strongly ; over the next few decades it became increasingly common in western France and later on the north coast . It bred in the Netherlands in 1979 with further breeding from the 1990s onward . About 22 @,@ 700 pairs are thought to breed in Europe , with populations stable or increasing in Spain , France and Italy but decreasing in Greece . 
 In Britain it was a rare vagrant from its 16th @-@ century disappearance until the late 20th century , and did not breed . It has however recently become a regular breeding species and is commonly present , often in large numbers , at favoured coastal sites . The first recent breeding record in England was on Brownsea Island in Dorset in 1996 , and the species bred in Wales for the first time in 2002 . The population increase has been rapid subsequently , with over 750 pairs breeding in nearly 70 colonies in 2008 , and a post @-@ breeding total of 4 @,@ 540 birds in September 2008 . Little egrets are especially common around the River Thames , and in summer can be noticed in large numbers at Port Meadow , Oxford . In Ireland , the species bred for the first time in 1997 at a site in County Cork and the population has also expanded rapidly since , breeding in most Irish counties by 2010 . Severe winter weather in 2010 – 2012 proved to be only a temporary setback , and the species continues to spread . 
 = = = Status in Australia = = = 
 In Australia , its status varies from state to state . It is listed as " Threatened " on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 . Under this act , an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared . On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria , the little egret is listed as endangered . 
 = = = Colonisation of the New World = = = 
 The little egret has now started to colonise the New World . The first record there was on Barbados in April 1954 . The bird began breeding on the island in 1994 and now also breeds in the Bahamas . Ringed birds from Spain provide a clue to the birds ' origin . The birds are very similar in appearance to the snowy egret and share colonial nesting sites with these birds in Barbados , where they are both recent arrivals . The little egrets are larger , have more varied foraging strategies and exert dominance over feeding sites . 
 Little egrets are seen with increasing regularity over a wider area and have been observed from Suriname and Brazil in the south to Newfoundland , Quebec and Ontario in the north . Birds on the east coast of North America are thought to have moved north with snowy egrets from the Caribbean . In June 2011 , a little egret was spotted in Maine , in the Scarborough Marsh , near the Audubon Center . 
 = École Polytechnique massacre = 
 The École Polytechnique Massacre , also known as the Montreal Massacre , occurred on December 6 , 1989 , at the École Polytechnique in Montreal , Quebec , Canada . Twenty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old Marc Lépine , armed with a Mini @-@ 14 rifle and a hunting knife , shot 28 people , killing 14 women , before committing suicide . He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university , where he separated the male and female students . After claiming that he was " fighting feminism " and calling the women " a bunch of feminists , " he shot all nine women in the room , killing six . He then moved through corridors , the cafeteria , and another classroom , specifically targeting women to shoot . Overall , he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under 20 minutes before turning the gun on himself . His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life . The note included a list of 19 Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill . 
 Since the attack , Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events , their significance , and Lépine 's motives . Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the massacre as an anti @-@ feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women . Consequently , the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women . Other interpretations emphasize Lépine 's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman , unrelated to larger social issues . Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty , isolation , and alienation in society , particularly in immigrant communities . 
 The incident led to more stringent gun control laws in Canada . It also introduced changes in the tactical response of police to shootings , changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the Dawson College shootings . 
 = = Massacre = = 
 Sometime after 4 p.m. on December 6 , 1989 , Marc Lépine arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique , an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal , armed with a semi @-@ automatic rifle and a hunting knife . He had purchased the Sturm , Ruger brand rifle , Mini @-@ 14 model , on November 21 , 1989 , in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal , telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game . Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event . 
 Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor . He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone , even when a staff member asked if she could help him . He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5 : 10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation , he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom . No one moved at first , believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling . 
 Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave . Speaking in French , he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there , and when one student replied " no , " he answered : " I am fighting feminism " . One of the students , Nathalie Provost , said , " Look , we are just women studying engineering , not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men , just students intent on leading a normal life . " Lépine responded that " You 're women , you 're going to be engineers . You 're all a bunch of feminists . I hate feminists . " He then opened fire on the students from left to right , killing six , and wounding three others , including Provost . Before leaving the room , he wrote the word shit twice on a student project . 
 Lépine continued into the second @-@ floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student . His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun . He returned to the room he had just left , but the students had locked the door ; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door . Moving along the corridor he shot at others , wounding one , before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked . 
 He next went down to the first @-@ floor cafeteria , in which about a hundred people were gathered . The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student . Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria , Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there . He told a male and female student to come out from under a table ; they complied and were not shot . 
 Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor . He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to " get out , " shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair , who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom . He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room , while other students dove under their desks . Lépine moved towards some of the female students , wounding three of them and killing another . He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class , shooting in all directions . At this point , the wounded Leclair asked for help and , after <unk> his hunting knife , Lépine stabbed her three times , killing her . He took off his cap , wrapped his coat around his rifle , exclaimed , " Ah shit , " and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head , twenty minutes after having begun his attack . About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him . He had killed fourteen women in total ( twelve engineering students , one nursing student and one employee of the university ) and injured fourteen other people , including four men . 
 After briefing reporters outside , Montreal Police director of public relations Pierre Leclair entered the building and found his daughter Maryse 's stabbed body . 
 The Quebec and Montreal governments declared three days of mourning . A joint funeral for nine of the women was held at Notre @-@ Dame Basilica on December 11 , 1989 , and was attended by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , Quebec premier Robert Bourassa , and Montreal mayor Jean Doré , along with thousands of other mourners . 
 = = = Suicide letter = = = 
 Marc Lépine 's inside jacket pocket contained a suicide letter and two letters to friends , all dated the day of the massacre . Some details from the suicide letter were revealed by the police two days after the event , but the full text was not disclosed . The media brought an unsuccessful access to information case to compel the police to release the suicide letter . A year after the attacks , Lépine 's three @-@ page statement was leaked to journalist and feminist Francine Pelletier . It contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because he considered them feminists . The list included Pelletier herself , as well as a union leader , a politician , a TV personality , and six police officers who had come to Lépine 's attention as they were on a volleyball team together . The letter ( without the list of women ) was subsequently published in the newspaper La Presse , where Pelletier was a columnist at the time . Lépine wrote that he considered himself rational and that he blamed feminists for ruining his life . He outlined his reasons for the attack including his anger towards feminists for seeking social changes that " retain the advantages of being women [ ... ] while trying to grab those of the men . " He also mentioned Denis Lortie , a Canadian Forces corporal who killed three government employees and wounded thirteen others in an armed attack on the National Assembly of Quebec on May 7 , 1984 . The text of the original letter in French is available , as well as an English translation .

 The shooter , Marc Lépine , was born to a French @-@ Canadian mother and an Algerian father , and at birth , Lepine 's name was Gamil Gharbi . His father , a mutual funds salesman , was contemptuous of women . He was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son , discouraging tenderness between mother and child . When Gamil was seven , his parents separated ; his father ceased contact with his children soon after . His mother returned to nursing to support the family , and because of her schedule , the children lived with other families during the week . At 14 , Gamil changed his name to " Marc Lépine " , citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother 's surname . Lépine attempted to join the Canadian Army during the winter of 1980 – 1981 , but according to his suicide letter was rejected because he was " anti @-@ social . " The brief biography of Marc Lépine that police released the day after the killings described him as intelligent but troubled . He disliked feminists , career women and women in traditionally male occupations , such as the police force . He began a pre @-@ university CEGEP ( college ) program in pure sciences in 1982 but switched to a three @-@ year vocational program in electronics technology after his first year . He abandoned this program in his final semester without explanation . Lépine applied to the École Polytechnique in 1986 and in 1989 but lacked two CEGEP courses required for admission . He completed one of them in the winter of 1989 .

 The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians . Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to antifeminist violence . As a result , a public inquiry was not held , and Marc Lépine 's suicide letter was not officially released . In addition , though an extensive police investigation into Marc Lépine and the killings took place , the resulting report was not made public , though a copy was used by the coroner as a source in her investigation . The media , academics , women 's organizations , and family members of the victims protested the lack of a public inquiry and paucity of information released . 
 The sex of Marc Lépine 's victims as well as his oral statements during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as an antifeminist attack and as an example of the wider issue of violence against women . Feminist scholars consider Lépine 's actions to spring from a widespread societal misogyny , including toleration of violence against women . Scholars have categorized it as a " pseudo @-@ community " type of " pseudo @-@ commando " murder @-@ suicide , in which the perpetrator targets a specific group , often in a public place , and intends to die in " a blaze of glory " . Criminologists regard the massacre as an example of a hate or bias crime against women , as the victims were selected solely because of their membership of the category of women , and those targeted were interchangeable with others from the same group . Lépine 's mother later wondered if the attack was not directed at her , as some would have considered her a feminist since she was a single , working mother . Others , including television journalist Barbara <unk> , pleaded that the massacre not be seen as an antifeminist attack or violence against women , and questioned why people insisted on " diminishing " the tragedy by " suggesting that it was an act against just one group ? " 
 As predicted by Marc Lépine in his suicide letter , some saw the event as the isolated act of a madman . A psychiatrist interviewed Lépine 's family and friends and examined his writings as part of the police investigation . He noted that Marc Lépine defined suicide as his primary motivation , and that he chose a specific suicide method , namely killing oneself after killing others ( multiple homicide / suicide strategy ) , which is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder . Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood , suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage , or that Lépine was psychotic , having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal ( yet largely absent ) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women . A different theory was that Lépine 's childhood experiences of abuse led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life . His mother wondered if Lépine might have suffered from attachment disorder , due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood . 
 Others expressed a broader analysis , framing Lépine 's actions as the result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty , powerlessness , individual isolation , and polarization between men and women . Noting Lépine 's interest in violent action films , some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions . Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13 , 2006 , Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant . 
 = = Effects = = 
 The injured and witnesses among university staff and students suffered a variety of physical , social , existential , financial , and psychological consequences , including post @-@ traumatic stress disorder . A number of students committed suicide . In the suicide letters of at least two of them , the anguish they suffered following the massacre was cited as the reason for killing themselves . Nine years after the event , survivors reported still being affected by their experiences , though with time some of the effects had lessened . 
 = = = Police response = = = 
 Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre . The first police officers to arrive at the scene established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building . During this period , several women were killed . Subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders ' handling of the Dawson College shooting in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a shooter . In that incident , coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention were credited with minimizing the loss of life . 
 = = = Gun control = = = 
 The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement . Heidi <unk> , a student who was in one of the classrooms Lépine did not enter during the shooting , organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy <unk> . Suzanne <unk> @-@ Edward and Jim Edward , the parents of one of the victims , were also deeply involved . Their activities , along with others , led to the passage of Bill C @-@ 68 , or the Firearms Act , in 1995 , ushering in stricter gun control regulations . These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners , screening of firearm applicants , rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the registration of all firearms . Between 2009 and 2012 , survivors of the massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by Stephen Harper 's Conservative government aimed at ending the long @-@ gun registry ; A bill was narrowly defeated in September 2010 , but following their 2011 majority election win , the long @-@ gun registry was abolished by the Harper government in April 2012 . The Quebec government subsequently won a temporary injunction , preventing the destruction of the province 's gun registry data , and ordering the continued registration of long guns in Quebec . In March 2015 , The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec , clearing the way for the destruction of all registry data . 
 = = = Violence against women = = = 
 The Canadian women 's movement sees the massacre as a symbol of violence against women . " The death of those young women would not be in vain , we promised " , Canadian feminist Judy <unk> recalled . " We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women . " 
 In response to the killings , a House of Commons Sub @-@ Committee on the Status of Women was created . It released a report " The War against Women " in June 1991 , which was not endorsed by the full standing committee . However , following its recommendations , the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991 . The panel issued a final report , " Changing the Landscape : Ending Violence – Achieving Equality " , in June 1993 . The panel proposed a two @-@ pronged " National Action Plan " consisting of an " Equality Action Plan " and a " Zero Tolerance Policy " designed to increase women 's equality and reduce violence against women through government policy . Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations , the final report failed to make an impact . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Male survivors of the massacre have been subjected to criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine . In an interview immediately after the event , a reporter asked one of the men why they " abandoned " the women when it was clear that Lépine 's targets were women . René <unk> , the sergeant @-@ at @-@ arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack , said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine , but acknowledged that " ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror . " Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a " culture of passivity " prevalent among men in Canada , which enabled Lépine 's shooting spree : " Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine / Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom , who , ordered to leave by the lone gunman , meekly did so , and abandoned their female classmates to their fate — an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history . " 
 Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings , but Nathalie Provost , one of the survivors , said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy , and that her fellow students should not feel guilty . 
 The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women . For example , Charles <unk> , a University of Toronto computer science professor , compared the Ku Klux Klan with those organizing vigils marking the event , writing that " [ t ] he point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist / extreme left @-@ wing agenda , " and adding that it is " no more justified " than the KKK using the " murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda . " Other critics say that Lépine was a " lone gunman " who does not represent men , and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture . In this perspective , feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men , irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women . Some masculinist and anti @-@ feminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women , and without condoning the shootings , view the massacre as an extreme expression of men 's frustrations . A few say that Lépine was a hero of <unk> , glorifying his actions . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 Since 1991 , the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women , intended as a call to action against discrimination against women . A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London , Ontario , in the wake of the massacre , for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women , with the ribbon symbolizing " the idea of men giving up their arms . " Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built . In memoriam of the event , December 6 is a day off every year at Polytechnique . 
 The Place du 6 @-@ Décembre @-@ 1989 in the Côte @-@ des @-@ Neiges / Notre @-@ Dame @-@ de @-@ Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre . Located at the corner of <unk> Avenue and Queen Mary Road , a short distance from the university , it includes the art installation Nef pour <unk> reines ( Nave for Fourteen Queens ) by Rose @-@ Marie Goulet . It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6 . 
 A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to " all women murdered by men " , which critics say implies all men are potential murderers . As a result , women involved in the project received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might " antagonize " other groups . 
 The event has also been commemorated through references in television , theatre , and popular music . A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The <unk> was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette . A movie entitled Polytechnique , directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009 , and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film . 
 Additionally , several songs have been written about the events in different musical genres , including " Give Us Back The Night " by folk @-@ rock duo Open Mind , " Montreal Massacre " by the death metal band Macabre , " This Memory " by the folk duo the Wyrd Sisters , and " 14 ( for December 6 ) " by spoken @-@ word artist Evalyn Parry . 
 In 2008 , Marc Lépine 's mother Monique published Aftermath , a memoir of her own journey through the grief and pain of the incident . She had stayed silent until 2006 , when she decided to speak out for the first time in the wake of that year 's Dawson College shooting . 
 For the commemorative ceremony on the 25th anniversary of the massacre in 2014 , the city of Montreal entrusted the technical aspect of the ceremony to the multimedia production company Moment Factory , who installed fourteen searchlights representing the 14 victims of the massacre on the esplanade of Mount Royal . The light beams turned skyward first appeared shortly after four o 'clock , the hour when the attack had started 25 years earlier .

 " Silly Love Songs " was met with critical acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode , and wrote , " This was our favorite type of Glee episode . Though we enjoy over @-@ the @-@ top spectacles [ ... ] , the show 's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline . Sue Sylvester didn 't make an appearance and — dare we say it — we didn 't even miss her . " Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode , going on to write , " I thought it was a strong showing , if a little disjointed . Well , at least it was honest . If this show is one thing , it 's disjointed . It 's part of its spazzy appeal . " Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review : " On Tuesday night , Glee wasn ’ t only back at its usual time , it was back to doing what it does best : giving us entertaining [ ... ] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story . It was like a perfect heart @-@ shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show ’ s fans about all the things we ’ ve missed about the show these last couple of months . " 
 Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review , and opined , " With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold , Glee the series was able to have a little fun with Tuesday night 's episode . And fun it was , with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine 's Day , with flirting , kissing and , of course , singing . Without the bullying , this was a much lighter episode of Glee , and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development . " He went on to praise Ashley Fink 's performance as Lauren Zizes , and said of Puck 's falling in love with Lauren , " I can 't decide if I want to root for this couple , but I certainly know I 'm going to be rooting for Lauren . " Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school , as well as the backing vocals for Salling 's performance of " Fat Bottomed Girls " by Queen . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of " A − " : " ' Silly Love Songs ' is a fine example of the show at what 's very nearly its absolute best . There ’ s nothing too heady here , but if the show has one tone that it 's nailed almost completely consistently , it ’ s the feeling of teenage romance , the sense that the person you 're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [ ... ] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak , of losing that person too soon . Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions . And like most musicals , Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters ' lives . As such , ' Silly Love Songs ' , which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show 's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters , is a lot of fun without trying all that hard . " In conclusion of his review , he wrote , " The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other . The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold . But when Glee just tells small , sweet stories about these kids and the ways they 're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they 're meant for bigger things , it can be terrific . Tonight was one of those episodes , and tonight 's episode was terrific . Here 's to a good February sweeps . " 
 Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4 @.@ 6 out of 5 stars , and went on to describe the episode as " A funny , touching , entertaining Glee episode that didn 't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester ?

" Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review , and wrote , " ' Silly Love Songs ' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night 's post @-@ Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue 's cartoon evilness . It was also the funniest episode of the season , in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time : Santana and Lauren . " James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode . However , Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review : " This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a <unk> , prime idiot TV writer .

I know this song fits in with Puck 's storyline for the episode , but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him . At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes . Because of this , I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out . It seems depending on the song selection for him , Salling 's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season . " 
 Tina 's cover of " My Funny Valentine " stirred mixed emotions in Gonzalez . She criticized the ending : " When she started sobbing , it got weird . Then weirder . Then downright uncomfortable . " However , she liked the earlier part of the performance , and wrote , " It was <unk> when Tina started getting choked up during her song , because let 's face it , it happens . You can love someone so much it hurts . If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat , I think I might have gotten choked up with her . " 
 Rachel 's cover of " Firework " by Katy Perry was reviewed negatively by Coachman . She wrote , " I 'm not loving Michele ’ s vocals on this track . It was like they wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry . As much as I really like Katy Perry , Michele has more of a tremendous voice . There are parts where I thought she sounded really great , but for the most part this song just wasn 't my cup of tea . Michele has such a beautiful voice ; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage . " Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers ' performance of " Silly Love Songs " , writing , " Not only do they sound great [ ... ] , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super @-@ saccharine episode .

Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling 's performance of " Fat Bottomed Girls " , as well as the casts ' performances of " P.Y.T.

Only in Puck 's world would Queen 's raucous song qualify as a serenade — and our horror @-@ turned @-@ amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions ' faces .

 " The Joy of Sect " is the thirteenth episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 8 , 1998 . In the episode , a cult takes over Springfield , and the Simpson family become members . 
 David Mirkin conceived the initial idea for the episode , Steve O 'Donnell was the lead writer , and Steven Dean Moore directed . The writers drew on many groups to develop the Movementarians , but were principally influenced by Scientology , Heaven 's Gate , the Unification Church , the Rajneesh movement , and Peoples Temple . The show contains many references to popular culture , including the title reference to The Joy of Sex and a gag involving Rover from the television program The Prisoner . 
 " The Joy of Sect " was later analyzed from religious , philosophical , and psychological perspectives ; books on The Simpsons compared the Movementarians to many of the same groups from which the writers had drawn influence . Both USA Today and The A.V. Club featured " The Joy of Sect " in lists of important episodes of The Simpsons .

 The episode was the second and last episode written by Steve O 'Donnell and was based on an idea from David Mirkin . Mirkin had been the show runner during seasons five and six , but had been brought back to run two episodes during the ninth season . He said he was attracted to the notion of parodying cults because they are " comical , interesting and twisted " . He conceived the episode after hearing a radio show about the history of cults whilst driving home one night . The main group of writers that worked on the episode were Mirkin , O 'Donnell , Jace Richdale , and Kevin Curran . The episode 's title " The Joy of Sect " was pitched by Richdale . Steven Dean Moore directed the episode . 
 Aspects of the Movementarians were inspired by different cults and religions , including Scientology , Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple , the Heaven 's Gate group , the Unification Church , the Oneida Society , and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh . In particular , the leader driving through the fields in a Rolls Royce was partly inspired by the <unk> , and the notion of holding people inside the camp against their will was a reference to Jim Jones . The name " Movementarians " itself was simply chosen for its awkward sound . The scene during the six @-@ hour orientation video where those who get up to leave are induced to stay through peer pressure and <unk> was a reference to the Unification Church and EST Training . The show 's producers acknowledged that the ending scene of the episode was a poke at Fox as " being the evil mind controlling network " . The episode 's script was written in 1997 , at roughly the same time that the members of the Heaven 's Gate cult committed mass suicide . The writers noticed strange parallels between Mirkin 's first draft and Heaven 's Gate , including the belief in the arrival of a spaceship and the group 's members wearing matching clothes and odd sneakers . Because of these coincidences , several elements of the episode were changed so that it would be more sensitive in the wake of the suicides .

 Chris Turner 's book Planet Simpson : How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation describes the Movementarians as a cross between the Church of Scientology and Raëlism , with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh . Planet Simpson also notes the Simpsons ' chant at the conclusion of the episode as evidence of a " true high @-@ growth quasi @-@ religious cult of our time " , referring to television . The book refers to a " Cult of Pop " , which it describes as " a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West 's social fabric where organized religion used to be " . Martin Hunt of <unk> notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology . " The Leader " physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard ; the Movementarians ' " trillion year labor contract " alludes to the ( Scientology ) Sea Org 's billion year contract ; and both groups make extensive use of litigation . The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called " Springfield joins a cult " , comparing the Movementarians ' plans to travel to " Blisstonia " to Heaven 's Gate 's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Hale – Bopp . However , it also notes that " The Joy of Sect " is a commentary on organized religion in general , quoting Bart as saying , " Church , cult , cult , church . So we get bored someplace else every Sunday . " Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons ' approach to deprogramming in the episode , noting groundskeeper Willie 's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to <unk> Homer . Author Chris Turner suggests that Marge should have instead gone with the " <unk> Brain Deprogrammers " used in the episode " Burns ' Heir " to convince Bart to leave Mr. Burns and come back home . 
 In The Simpsons and Philosophy : The D 'oh ! of Homer , the authors cite " escaping from a cult commune in ' The Joy of Sect ' " as evidence of " Aristotle 's virtuous personality traits in Marge . " As the title suggests , the book The Psychology of the Simpsons : D 'oh ! examines " The Joy of Sect " from a psychological point of view . It discusses the psychology of decision @-@ making in the episode , noting , " Homer is becoming a full @-@ blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice , ... but through the process of escalating behavioral commitments . " The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians , including the charismatic leader , established authority based on a religious entity or alien being ( in this case " Blisstonia " ) , and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader 's greatness . The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six @-@ hour Movementarian recruitment film . In that scene , those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish . They are , however , questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave , and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film . The book describes this technique as " subtle pressure " , in contrast to the " razor wire , landmines , angry dogs , crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape , while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave " . The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that " the Leader " is seen as an authority figure , because " he has knowledge or abilities that others do not , but want " . Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks , the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader 's Way and Science for Leader Lovers . 
 In Pinsky 's The Gospel According to the Simpsons , one of the show 's writers recounted to the author that the producers of The Simpsons had vetoed a planned episode on Scientology in fear of the Church 's " reputation for suing and harassing opponents " . Pinsky found it ironic that Matt Groening spoofed Scientology in spite of the fact that the voice of Bart Simpson , Nancy Cartwright , is a Scientologist , having joined in 1996 . Pinsky notes that Groening later " took a shot at Scientology " in Futurama with the fictional religion " Church of Robotology " . Groening said he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode contains several references to popular culture . The title of the episode is a spoof of the book The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort . When Marge attempts to leave the compound , she is chased by the Rover guard " balloon " from the 1967 television program The Prisoner . Neal Hefti and Nelson Riddle 's theme music to the 1960s Batman series is used in the episode to indoctrinate Homer , while " I Love You , You Love Me " sung by Barney the Dinosaur on the Barney and Friends / Barney and the Backyard Gang series is used to brainwash babies . When Mr. Burns introduces his new religion , most of the sequence is a parody of the promotional video of Michael Jackson 's 1995 album HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I. Willie scratching his nails along the church window to get Marge and Reverend Lovejoy 's attention is a reference to the 1975 film Jaws , in which the character Quint performs a similar action . The Springfield Airport contains the " Just Crichton and King Bookstore " , referencing Michael Crichton and Stephen King , authors famous for their airport novels , carrying only their works .

 In its original broadcast , " The Joy of Sect " finished 27th in ratings for the week of February 2 – 8 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 6 , equivalent to approximately 9 @.@ 4 million viewing households . It was the fourth highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files , King of the Hill , and Ally McBeal . 
 In a 2006 article in USA Today , " The Joy of Sect " was highlighted among six other episodes of The Simpsons season 9 , along with " Trash of the Titans " , " The Last Temptation of Krust " , " The Cartridge Family " , " Dumbbell Indemnity " , and " Das Bus " . The A.V. Club featured the episode in its analysis of " 15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras " . The Daily Mirror gave the episode positive mention in its review of the Season 9 DVD release , calling it " hilarious " . Isaac Mitchell @-@ Frey of the Herald Sun cited the episode as the highlight of the season . The Sunday Mail highlighted the episode for their " Family Choice " segment , commenting : " Normally , a show about religious cults would spell doom and gloom . Only Bart , of The Simpsons , could make a comedy out of it but then , he and his cartoon family are a cult in their own right anyway ! " 
 Jeff <unk> of The Simpsons Archive used the episode as an example of one of the " good qualities present in The Simpsons " , while analyzing why some other aspects of The Simpsons make Christians upset . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented that the episode was " an odd one " with " a lot of good moments " , and went on to state that it was " a nice twist to see Burns determined to be loved " . However , the book also noted that " The Joy of Sect " is " another one where the central joke isn 't strong enough to last the whole episode " . In a lesson plan for St Mary 's College , Durham titled An Introduction to Philosophy : The Wit and Wisdom of Lisa Simpson , the episode is described in a section on " False Prophets " as applicable for " ... studying the more outrageous manifestations of ' religion ' or those simply alert to the teachings of Christ on the subject " . 
 = Christening ( The Office ) = 
 " Christening " is the seventh episode of the seventh season of the American version of the comedy television series The Office and the show 's 133rd episode overall . Written by Peter <unk> and directed by Alex Hardcastle , the episode aired on November 4 , 2010 on NBC in the United States . The episode guest stars Linda Purl as Helene Beesly , Rick Overton as William Beesly , Robert Pine as Mr. Halpert , Perry Smith as Betsy Halpert , Bobby Ray Shafer as Bob Vance , and Peggy Stewart as Sylvia . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) and Jim Halpert 's ( John Krasinski ) baby , Cece , is christened and Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) invites the entire office to celebrate . Michael joins a church group of high school graduates on a mission to Mexico , with Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) following along to impress Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) . 
 Since the seventh season of The Office focused on Michael 's departure , the producers wanted to showcase the ensemble cast in various episodes ; " Christening " dealt with Pam and Jim . The episode was watched by 7 @.@ 65 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 8 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49 , marking a slight drop in the ratings when compared to the previous week . The episode received mixed reviews from critics ; while a few enjoyed the episode , several felt that the main story was unfunny and forced . Cindy White of IGN even called it one of the worst episodes of The Office to air . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) and Jim Halpert 's ( John Krasinski ) daughter Cece is being christened , and Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) has invited all the members of the office to the service , much to their disappointment . During the service , Cece 's dress is ruined when Jim changes her diaper . Jim scrambles to replace the gown , and Cece is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire T @-@ shirt he found in the back of his car . At the end of the mass , the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam , who panic because the reception was for family only and they are not prepared for so many guests . 
 At the reception , food quickly runs out , and Cece goes missing after Jim asks Pam 's grandmother Sylvia ( Peggy Stewart ) to watch over her . Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) had been showing a disturbingly intense interest in Cece , so after finding out from guests that Cece was last seen with a " short blond woman " , Jim thinks Angela has kidnapped Cece , and calls her out as she is leaving . Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) attacks Angela 's purse , only for Jim to realize that Pam 's mother Helene ( Linda Purl ) had Cece . 
 Michael is inspired by the fellow churchgoers and , following inappropriate comments from the rest of the office staff , angrily lashes out at them for being disrespectful . As the church 's youth ministry — which is going to Mexico to help build a school — leave , Michael decides to go with them . The other employees try to talk him out of it , but Michael refuses . Just before they leave , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) boards the bus with him in an attempt to impress his ex @-@ girlfriend Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) . Both get cold feet 45 minutes into the trip , and force the bus to stop . They then have Erin drive them home . 
 Meanwhile , Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) hesitates to enter the church throughout the service . He explains that he has a history between himself and " The Big Man " . Finally , Toby enters the church after the ceremony . He looks at the crucifix and asks , " Why do you have to be so mean to me ? "

 The episode was written by Peter <unk> , his first writing credit for The Office since joining the staff in its seventh season as a co @-@ executive producer . It was directed by Alex Hardcastle , the first episode of The Office he directed . Due to the fact that the seventh season of The Office was Carell 's last , the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves ; the first half would " celebrate Carell 's finale year and highlight different actors on the show " , whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager . As such , " Christening " was written to specifically highlight " potential heirs to the throne " , in this case Fischer and Krasinski 's characters , Pam and Jim . The episode guest stars Linda Purl as Helene Beesly , Rick Overton as William Beesly , Robert Pine as Mr. Halpert , Perry Smith as Betsy Halpert , Bobby Ray Shafer as Bob Vance , and Peggy Stewart as Sylvia . 
 Within a week of its airdate the official website of The Office released two deleted scenes . In the first 46 @-@ second clip , Angela , Kelly Kapoor ( Mindy Kaling ) , Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) , and Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) discuss their feelings about having children . In the second 75 @-@ second clip , Jim asks Michael to take a picture of his family , Jim and Pam complain to the camera about the uninvited guests , and Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) and Ryan talk about their volunteer past . The season seven DVD contains several more deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Jim and Pam discussing the situation surrounding the reception , Dwight placing his business card in the books in the church 's pew , Jim and Pam discussing naming Cece and thanking their friends and family for coming .

 During the cold open , Kelly plays a " your mom " joke on Pam . Michael initially thinks that he is Cece 's godfather , and impersonates Marlon Brando 's character Don Corleone in the Godfather movies . During this scene , Michael also references Robert De Niro 's famous line " You talkin ' to me ? " from the 1976 film Taxi Driver . Jim wraps Cece in an Arcade Fire shirt , a reference to the Canadian indie rock band . Pam references the miracle of Jesus feeding the multitude , claiming that she and Jim are " gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed " all their guests . Michael defends the churchgoers , and claims that the office members are being catty like the titular antagonists from the 2004 comedy film Mean Girls .

 The episode received mixed reviews , with one calling it one of the worst episodes of The Office to air . Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club wrote that his favorite element of the episode concerned Toby and his relationship with God , but he was slightly critical of the " A @-@ story " , calling it " inert . " Despite this , McNutt felt that the episode portrayed Michael as " a flawed , yet normal , man " . He felt that the episode , like the sixth season episode " Scott 's Tots " , illustrated that Michael was still " searching for his identity despite being over 40 . " He ultimately gave the episode a " B + " . Joel Keller of AOL 's TV Squad praised Michael 's maturity in the episode , saying " even when we get an episode that didn 't quite hit the mark , like last night 's , the maturing of Michael still makes the episode interesting to watch . " 
 Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly was more critical , referring to it as " forced , off pitch , and strenuously unfunny " . She was also critical of Michael 's interaction with the youth group , writing that it " didn 't add any development to his character or to the show 's broader arcs ; it just seemed weird , and not that humorous . " Despite this , she praised the cold opening , featuring Pam lecturing the office on proper hygiene . HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode " spectacularly unfunny " and criticized the writers for using Michael 's loneliness as a joke instead of taking it seriously like they had in the fourth season episode " Money " . Despite this , he complimented Lieberstein 's performance as Toby while he was questioning God . 
 While reviewing the seventh season , Cindy White of IGN said that the episode proved to fans that Jim and Pam dragged the series at times . She wrote that the episode was one of the worst of the series — noting that only the sixth season clip show " The Banker " was worse — and blamed it on the writers , who she said " have no idea what to do with [ Pam and Jim ] anymore " . 
 = Cyclone Kamba = 
 Intense Tropical Cyclone Kamba ( JTWC designation : 23S ) was a powerful tropical cyclone which remained out over the open waters of the south @-@ central Indian Ocean for its entire existence . The fourth and final intense tropical cyclone of the 2007 @-@ 08 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season , Kamba developed out of an area of disturbed weather just outside Météo France 's area of responsibility on March 5 . Over the next several days , the system intensified , becoming a moderate tropical storm , at which time it was named Kamba , late on March 8 @.@ rapid intensification followed shortly after with Kamba becoming an intense tropical cyclone around 1200 UTC on March 10 . Shortly thereafter , the cyclone moved over cooler waters and into a less favorable environment . By March 12 , Kamba rapidly degenerated into a remnant @-@ low pressure area and dissipated two days later . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On March 5 , the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the southwest Indian Ocean , Météo @-@ France , began monitoring an area of disturbed weather located just outside their area of responsibility . At 0000 UTC , the system was classified as a tropical disturbance . Operationally , Météo France did not begin issuing advisories on the disturbance until it had crossed 90 ° E. Early on March 7 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the disturbance as they anticipated it to develop into a tropical cyclone with 24 hours . Although the center of circulation was partially exposed , deep convection was developing on the western half of the storm as the vertical wind shear , which previously caused to low to become exposed , began to weaken . Later that day , Météo France upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression . About three hours after being classified as a depression , the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 23S as they estimated winds to have reached 75 km / h ( 45 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . 
 Late on March 8 , the depression was upgraded to a moderate tropical storm as 10 @-@ minute sustained winds reached 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Wind shear continued to impact the organization of the system as the eastern portion of the storm remained partially exposed . Shortly after , the storm was given the name Kamba by the Meteorological service in Mauritius , a name contributed by the Comoros . Tracking towards the southwest , Kamba quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm at 1200 UTC on March 9 as winds increased to 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) . Not long after being upgraded to a severe tropical storm , the JTWC estimated that Kamba had strengthened into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Early on March 10 , Kamba began to undergo rapid intensification and Météo @-@ France upgraded the storm to a tropical cyclone as an eye developed . At this time , Kamba also started to turn towards the south as it tracked around the northwestern edge of a strong subtropical ridge . 
 With low wind shear , Kamba continued to intensify throughout the first half of March 10 , reaching its peak intensity with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) with a minimum pressure of 930 hPa ( mbar ) at 1200 UTC according to Météo @-@ France . Kamba developed a 46 km ( 28 mi ) wide eye as it reached peak intensity . Shortly after , the JTWC upgraded Kamba to a Category 4 equivalent cyclone with winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . By March 11 , Kamba began to move over cooler waters and into an area of higher wind shear , causing the storm to deteriorate . About 24 hours after reaching peak intensity , the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition and weakened to a tropical cyclone . Early on March 12 , the JTWC issued their final advisory on Kamba as it rapidly weakened over open waters . At the same time , Météo @-@ France further downgraded the cyclone to a severe tropical storm as winds dropped below 120 km / h ( 75 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) . Kamba further weakened to a moderate tropical storm as convection associated with the storm significantly diminished . The final advisory by Météo @-@ France was issued shortly after as the storm degenerated into a remnant @-@ low pressure area . The remnants of Kamba persisted for a few more days before ultimately dissipating at 0600 UTC on March 14 .

 = Planet Stories = 
 Planet Stories was an American pulp science fiction magazine , published by Fiction House between 1939 and 1955 . It featured interplanetary adventures , both in space and on other planets , and was initially focused on a young readership . Malcolm Reiss was editor or editor @-@ in @-@ chief for all of its 71 issues . Planet Stories was launched at the same time as Planet Comics , the success of which probably helped to fund the early issues of Planet Stories . Planet did not pay well enough to regularly attract the leading science fiction writers of the day , but did manage to obtain work from well @-@ known names on occasion , including Isaac Asimov and Clifford Simak . In 1952 Planet published Philip K. Dick 's first sale , and went on to print four more of his stories over the next three years . 
 The two writers most identified with Planet Stories are Leigh Brackett and Ray Bradbury , both of whom set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the depiction of Barsoom in the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs . Bradbury 's work for Planet included an early story in his Martian Chronicles sequence . Brackett 's best @-@ known work for the magazine was a series of adventures featuring Eric John Stark , which began in the summer of 1949 . Brackett and Bradbury collaborated on one story , " Lorelei of the Red Mist " , which appeared in 1946 ; it was generally well @-@ received , although one letter to the magazine complained that the story 's treatment of sex , though mild by modern standards , was too explicit . The artwork also emphasized attractive women , with scantily clad damsels in distress or alien princesses on almost every cover . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Although science fiction ( sf ) had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback . By the end of the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom . Fiction House , a major pulp publisher , had run into difficulties during the Depression , but after a relaunch in 1934 found success with detective and romance pulp titles . Fiction House 's first title with sf interest was Jungle Stories , which was launched in early 1939 ; it was not primarily a science fiction magazine , but often featured storylines with marginally science fictional themes , such as survivors from Atlantis . At the end of 1939 Fiction House decided to add an sf magazine to its line up ; it was titled Planet Stories , and was published by Love Romances , a subsidiary company that had been created to publish Fiction House 's romance titles . The first issue was dated Winter 1939 . Two comics were launched at the same time : Jungle Comics and Planet Comics ; both were published monthly , whereas Planet Stories was quarterly , and it is quite likely that the success of the comics funded the early issues of the pulps . 
 Malcolm Reiss edited Planet Stories from the beginning , and retained editorial oversight and control throughout its run , though he was not always the named editor on the masthead ; when other editors were involved , his title was " managing editor " . The first of these sub @-@ editors was Wilbur S. Peacock , who took over with the Fall 1942 issue and remained until Fall 1945 , after which he was replaced by Chester Whitehorn for three issues , and then by Paul L. Payne , from Fall 1946 to Spring 1950 . 
 With the Summer 1950 issue the editorship passed to Jerome Bixby , who was already editing Jungle Stories . Soon thereafter Planet Stories switched from a quarterly to bimonthly schedule . Bixby lasted a little over a year ; Malcolm Reiss took over again in September 1951 , and three issues later , in March 1952 , Jack O 'Sullivan became editor . A contemporary market survey records that in 1953 , payment rates were only one to two cents per word ; this was substantially behind the leading magazines of the day . Planet returned to a quarterly schedule beginning with the Summer 1954 issue , but the pulp market was collapsing , and the Summer 1955 issue was the final one . 
 = = Contents and reception = = 
 Fiction House apparently made the decision to launch Planet Stories so quickly that there was little time for Reiss to obtain new stories , so he worked with Julius Schwartz and other authors ' agents to fill the first issue . The results were unremarkable , but Reiss was energetic , and was able to improve the quality of fiction in succeeding issues , though he occasionally apologized to the readers for printing weak material . The magazine was exclusively focused on interplanetary adventures , often taking place in primitive societies that would now be regarded as " sword and sorcery " settings , and was aimed at a young readership ; the result was a mixture of what became known as space opera and planetary romances — melodramatic tales of action and adventure on alien planets and in interplanetary space . Planet relied on a few authors to provide the bulk of its fiction in the early years , with Nelson Bond providing eight lead stories , some of them novels . Fourteen more were written by Ray Cummings and Ross Rocklynne ; and Leigh Brackett was also a regular contributor , with seventeen stories in total published over the lifetime of the magazine . 
 The letter column in Planet was titled " The <unk> " ; it was very active , with long letters from an engaged readership . It often printed letters from established writers , and from fans who would go on to become well known professionally : Damon Knight 's letters are described by sf historian Mike Ashley as " legendary " ; and Robert Silverberg commented in a letter in the Summer 1950 issue that Ray Bradbury " certainly gets some original ideas , if not good ones " . The editors put a good deal of effort into keeping the letter column friendly and lively ; contemporary writer and editor Robert Lowndes recalls that " Reiss was sincere and urbane ; Wilbur [ Peacock ] enjoyed taking his coat off and being one of the crowd " . 
 Despite the focus on melodramatic space adventure , the fiction in Planet Stories improved over the next few years , largely due to the work of Brackett and Bradbury . Both writers set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs . Brackett 's writing improved during the 1940s from formulaic pulp adventure to a more mature style , and she became the most accomplished writer of planetary romances of her day . She wrote a well @-@ received series of stories featuring adventurer Eric John Stark , which began in the Summer 1949 Planet with " Queen of the Martian Catacombs " . Her work had a strong influence on other writers , in particular Gardner F. Fox , Lin Carter and Marion Zimmer Bradley , Brackett later argued that " the so @-@ called space opera is the folk @-@ tale , the hero @-@ tale of our particular niche in history " . Also arguing in support of Planet Stories , science fiction critic John Clute has commented that " the content was far more sophisticated than the covers " . 
 Bradbury 's work for Planet included two of the stories that he later incorporated into The Martian Chronicles , including " The Million Year Picnic " ; only one other story in the series had appeared before this . He also collaborated on a story with Leigh Brackett , " Lorelei of the Red Mist " , based on an idea of hers , which appeared in the Summer of 1946 . His stories for Planet demonstrate his reservations about the advance of technology , in particular " The Golden Apples of the Sun " ( November 1953 ) , and " A Sound of Thunder " ( January 1954 , reprinted from the June 28 , 1952 issue of Collier 's Weekly ) . Bradbury 's work in Planet Stories is regarded by one pulp historian , Tim de Forest , as " the magazine 's most important contribution to the genre " . 
 Several other well @-@ known writers appeared in Planet Stories , including Isaac Asimov , Clifford Simak , James Blish , Fredric Brown and Damon Knight . Asimov 's story , originally titled " Pilgrimage " , appeared in 1942 ; Asimov had been unable to sell the piece elsewhere , and rewrote it numerous times for different editors , adding a religious element at John Campbell 's request , and removing it again when Malcolm Reiss asked for further changes . Reiss bought it but changed the name to " Black Friar of the Flame " . 
 Jerome Bixby , who took over as editor in 1950 , was a published writer and was knowledgeable about sf , though he had primarily written western fiction . In his short tenure he did much to improve the magazine , persuading the established writers to produce better material and finding unusual variations on the interplanetary adventure theme such as Poul Anderson 's " Duel on Syrtis " in March 1951 , about an Earthman tracking an alien on Mars , and Theodore Sturgeon 's " The <unk> on Planet X " , about aliens who kidnap Earth women . After Bixby 's departure in 1952 , Planet 's major contribution to the genre was the discovery of Philip K. Dick , whose first sale , " Beyond Lies the Wub " , appeared in the July 1952 issue . Dick went on to sell another four stories to Planet over the next two years , including " James P. Crow " , in which a human suffers discrimination in a world of robots . 
 Planet Stories clearly targeted a young readership , and the simultaneous launch in 1939 of Planet Comics may have been instrumental in attracting young readers to science fiction , but Ashley suggests that it is more likely that Planet Stories attracted experienced readers of the genre who " still yearned for the early days of sf " . Critic and sf historian Thomas Clareson has commented that " Planet seemed to look backward towards the 1930s and earlier " , an impression that was strengthened by the extensive use of interior artwork by Frank Paul , who had been the cover artist for the early Gernsback magazines in the 1920s . Paul 's distinctive style was strongly associated with the early years of the field . The cover art was also melodramatic , with beautiful women — sometimes human , sometimes princesses from other planets — and threatening aliens . The <unk> on the cover read " Strange Adventures on Other Worlds – The Universe of Future Centuries " until the end of 1946 . 
 Although almost every story that appeared in Planet could be described as space opera , there was some variety of approach to the basic themes . Earth was sometimes threatened , but more often the action took place on other worlds , bringing <unk> into local conflicts . This often involved beautiful native princesses , though the romantic storylines were stereotyped : in one story , Carl Selwyn 's " Venus Has Green Eyes " , which appeared in Fall 1940 , the Venusian princess is dissuaded from her hatred of humans when the hero seizes her and kisses her ; she slaps him , but succumbs to his charm . Some respite from these depictions of women was provided by Leigh Brackett , who described her own heroines as " usually on the bitchy side — warm @-@ blooded , hot @-@ tempered , but <unk> and intelligent " ( with " bitchy " intended as a compliment ) . During World War II , it was in Planet Stories that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight , instead of merely being fought over . Sex itself had long been taboo in the pulp magazines , but some stories in Planet depicted sexuality more directly than the competing magazines would . The readers were not always accepting ; one reader in a letter in 1949 supported " jettisoning the taboos " , but a letter writer in 1946 objected to " Lorelei of the Red Mist " , saying that he needed " a pint of <unk> to wash the dirty taste out of my mouth " . The cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well , with what sf author and critic Harry Harrison sardonically referred to as " sexual dimorphism in space " : heavy , functional spacesuits for the men , and transparent suits through which bikinis or swimsuits could be seen for the women . 
 Hannes Bok contributed much of the interior artwork , and the covers were often by Allen Anderson during the early years . Later , Kelly Freas became a frequent cover artist . One of the best artists to work on Planet was Alexander Leydenfrost , whose work , according to Clareson , " epitomized much of what Planet Stories represented in the 1940s " , though his cover artwork was less impressive than his black @-@ and @-@ white interior illustrations . Artist and sf historian David Hardy has described Leydenfrost 's black and white illustrations as " almost <unk> in his use of light and shade " .

 Planet Stories was a pulp @-@ sized magazine for all of its 71 issues . It was 128 pages for most of its existence , and was priced at 20 cents . With the November 1950 issue the page count was cut to 112 , and the price went up to 25 cents . The page count was reduced to 96 for one issue in March 1952 , but then returned to 112 until Summer 1954 , when it was again reduced to 96 pages for the last five issues . 
 Planet began as a quarterly . A brief attempt was made to switch to a bimonthly schedule in 1943 ; a March and May issue appeared , but the next issue was titled Fall 1943 , inaugurating another quarterly period . The Fall 1950 issue was followed by November 1950 , and this began a bimonthly period that lasted until May 1954 , which was followed by a Summer 1954 issue . A quarterly schedule resumed until the end ; unusually , the winter issue that year was dated Winter 1954 / 55 , rather than with a single year . The volume numbering was consistent throughout the magazine 's publication , with five volumes of 12 issues and a final volume of 11 , but there were three errors in the volume numbering printed on the spine ( though not on the masthead ) : issue 5 / 10 was given as 5 / 8 on the spine ; issue 5 / 11 was given as 6 / 3 on the spine ; and issue 6 / 11 was given as 6 / 12 on the spine . 
 A British reprint edition appeared between March 1950 and September 1954 ; the issues were numbered but not dated , and were heavily cut , with only 64 to 68 pages . There are twelve issues known ; a thirteenth has been rumored but not seen by any sf bibliographers . The publisher was <unk> , though some sources indicate that Streamline Publications was the publisher of the first issue . Issues 7 and 8 of the British edition also contained nonfiction material reprinted from Startling Stories and Thrilling Wonder . A Canadian edition was published by American News Co . , from Fall 1948 to March 1951 ( a total of twelve issues ) ; these were identical to the corresponding U.S. editions .

 In the summer of 1950 Fiction House launched a companion magazine to Planet . It was titled Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books ; the policy was to print two novels in a single magazine . It appeared three times a year and lasted until the spring of 1954 . In 1953 Fiction House launched a reprint magazine , Tops in Science Fiction , selecting the contents from the backfile of stories that had appeared in Planet . It only lasted for two issues , the second of which received almost no distribution . 
 A derivative anthology , The Best of Planet Stories # 1 , appeared in 1975 from Ballantine Books , edited by Leigh Brackett , containing seven stories reprinted from between 1942 and 1952 . It was intended to be the first of a series , but no further volumes appeared . 
 = Government of Japan = 
 The government of Japan is a constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited and is relegated primarily to ceremonial duties . As in many other states , the Government is divided into three branches : the Executive branch , the Legislative branch and the Judicial branch . 
 The Government runs under the framework established by the Constitution of Japan adopted in 1947 . It is a unitary state , containing forty @-@ seven administrative divisions , with the Emperor as its head of state . His role is ceremonial and he has no powers related to Government . Instead , it is the Cabinet , composing of the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister , that directs and controls the Government . The Cabinet is the source of power of the Executive branch , and is formed by the Prime Minister , who is the head of government . He or she is designated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor . 
 The National Diet is the legislature , the organ of the Legislative branch . It is bicameral , consisting of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house , and the House of Representatives being the lower house . Its members are directly elected from the people , who are the source of sovereignty . The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch , and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the Meiji Restoration , Japan was ruled by successive military shoguns . During this period , effective power of the government resided in the Shogun , who officially ruled the country in the name of the Emperor . The <unk> were the hereditary military governors , with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo . Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the Shogun , his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the country . This is often compared to the present role of the Emperor , whose official role is to appoint the Prime Minister . 
 The Meiji Restoration in 1868 led to the resignation of Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu , agreeing to " be the instrument for carrying out " the Emperor 's orders . This event restored the country to Imperial rule and the proclamation of the Empire of Japan . In 1889 , the Meiji Constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen Japan to the level of western nations , resulting in the first parliamentary system in Asia . It provided a form of mixed constitutional @-@ absolute monarchy , with an independent judiciary , based on the Prussian model of the time . 
 A new aristocracy known as the <unk> was established . It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period , the <unk> , and the former Daimyo , feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun . It also established the Imperial Diet , consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers . Members of the House of Peers were made up of the Imperial Family , the <unk> , and those nominated by the Emperor , while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage . Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution , ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually lead to a political crisis . It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military , which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics . 
 Following the end of World War II , the Constitution of Japan was adopted as an intention to replace the previous Imperial rule with a form of Western @-@ style liberal democracy . 
 = = The Emperor = = 
 The Emperor of Japan ( <unk> ) is the head of the Imperial Family and the ceremonial head of state . He is defined by the Constitution to be " the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people " . However , he is not the nominal Chief Executive and he possesses only certain ceremonially important powers . He has no real powers related to the Government as stated clearly in article 4 of the Constitution . 
 Article 6 of the Constitution of Japan delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles : 
 Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet . 
 Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet . 
 While the Cabinet is the source of executive power and most of its power is exercised directly by the Prime Minister , several of its powers are exercised by the Emperor . The powers exercised via the Emperor , as stipulated by Article 7 of the Constitution , are : 
 Promulgation of amendments of the constitution , laws , cabinet orders and treaties . 
 Convocation of the Diet . 
 Dissolution of the House of Representatives . 
 Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet . 
 Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law , and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers . 
 Attestation of general and special amnesty , commutation of punishment , reprieve , and restoration of rights . 
 Awarding of honors . 
 Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law . 
 Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers . 
 Performance of ceremonial functions . 
 The Emperor is known to hold the nominal ceremonial authority . For example , the Emperor is the only person that has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister , even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position . One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives . The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister , but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election , as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada . 
 In this manner , the Emperor 's modern role is often compared to those of the Shogunate period and much of Japan 's history , whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power ; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself . Today , a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power , to be called a Shadow Shogun ( <unk> ) . 
 Unlike his European counterparts , the Emperor is not the source of sovereign power and the government does not act under his name . Instead , the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State , in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty . Article 5 of the Constitution , in accordance with the Imperial Household Law , allows a regency to be established in the Emperor 's name , should the Emperor be unable to perform his duties . 
 Historically , the Imperial House of Japan is said to be the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world . According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki , Japan was founded by the Imperial House in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu ( <unk> ) . Emperor Jimmu was the first Emperor of Japan and the ancestor of all of the Emperors that followed . He is , according to Japanese mythology , the direct descendant of Amaterasu ( <unk> ) , the sun goddess of the native Shinto religion , through <unk> , his great @-@ grandfather . 
 The Current Emperor of Japan ( <unk> ) is Akihito . He was officially enthroned on November 12 , 1990 . He is styled as His Imperial Majesty ( <unk> ) , and his reign bears the era name of Heisei ( <unk> ) . Naruhito , the Crown Prince of Japan , is the heir apparent to the Chrysanthemum Throne . 
 = = Executive = = 
 The Executive branch of Japan is headed by the Prime Minister . The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet , and is designated by the legislative organ , the National Diet . The Cabinet consists of the Ministers of State and may be appointed or dismissed by the Prime Minister at any time . Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power , it is in practice , however , mainly exercised by the Prime Minister . The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet , and as a whole , should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet , the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet en masse with a motion of no confidence . 
 = = = Prime Minister = = = 
 The Prime Minister of Japan ( <unk> ) is designated by the National Diet and serves a term of four years or less ; with no limits imposed on the number of terms the Prime Minister may hold . The Prime Minister heads the Cabinet and exercises " control and supervision " of the executive branch , and is the head of government and commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Japan Self @-@ Defense Forces . The Prime Minister is vested with the power to present bills to the Diet , to sign laws , to declare a state of emergency , and may also dissolve the Diet 's House of Representatives at will . He or she presides over the Cabinet and appoints , or dismisses , the other Cabinet ministers . 
 Both houses of the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run @-@ off system . Under the Constitution , should both houses not agree on a common candidate , then a joint committee is allowed to be established to agree on the matter ; specifically within a period of ten days , exclusive of the period of recess . However , if both houses still do not agree to each other , the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet . Upon designation , the Prime Minister is presented with their commission , and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor . 
 As a candidate designated by the Diet , he or she is required to report to the Diet whenever demanded . The Prime Minister must also be both a civilian and a member of either house of the Diet . 
 ※ As of October 7 , 2015 
 = = = The Cabinet = = = 
 The Cabinet of Japan ( <unk> ) consists of the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister . The members of the Cabinet are appointed by the Prime Minister , and under the Cabinet Law , the number of members of the Cabinet appointed , excluding the Prime Minister , must be fourteen or less , but may only be increased to nineteen should a special need arises . Article 68 of the Constitution states that all members of the Cabinet must be civilians and the majority of them must be chosen from among the members of either house of the National Diet . The precise wording leaves an opportunity for the Prime Minister to appoint some non @-@ elected Diet officials . The Cabinet is required to resign en masse while still continuing its functions , till the appointment of a new Prime Minister , when the following situation arises : 
 The Diet 's House of Representatives passes a non @-@ confidence resolution , or rejects a confidence resolution , unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within the next ten ( 10 ) days . 
 When there is a vacancy in the post of the Prime Minister , or upon the first convocation of the Diet after a general election of the members of the House of Representatives . 
 Conceptually deriving legitimacy from the Diet , whom it is responsible to , the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways . In practice , much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister , while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor . 
 Article 73 of the Constitution of Japan expects the Cabinet to perform the following functions , in addition to general administration : 
 <unk> the law faithfully ; conduct affairs of state . 
 Manage foreign affairs . 
 Conclude treaties . However , it shall obtain prior or , depending on circumstances , subsequent approval of the Diet . 
 <unk> the civil service , in accordance with standards established by law . 
 Prepare the budget , and present it to the Diet . 
 <unk> cabinet orders in order to execute the provisions of this Constitution and of the law . However , it cannot include penal provisions in such cabinet orders unless authorized by such law . 
 Decide on general amnesty , special amnesty , commutation of punishment , reprieve , and restoration of rights . 
 Under the Constitution , all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent Minister and countersigned by the Prime Minister , before being formally promulgated by the Emperor . Also , all members of the Cabinet cannot be subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister ; however , without impairing the right to take legal action .

 = = = Ministries = = = 
 The Ministries of Japan ( <unk> ) consist of eleven ministries and the Cabinet Office . Each ministry is headed by a Minister of State , which are mainly senior legislators , and are appointed from among the members of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister . The Cabinet Office , formally headed by the Prime Minister , is an agency that handles the day @-@ to @-@ day affairs of the Cabinet . The ministries are the most influential part of the daily @-@ exercised executive power , and since few ministers serve for more than a year or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation , most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats .
