 The newfound success in roguelike @-@ likes is considered part of a larger trend in those that play both board and computer games , looking for " rich play experiences " , as described by 100 Rogues developer Keith Burgun , that more popular titles may not always offer . David <unk> of Gaslight Games stated that there is a thrill of the risk inherent in roguelike @-@ likes with random generation and permadeath , helping the player become more invested in the fate of their player character : " The deadly precariousness inherent to the unknown environments of roguelikes gives that investment a great deal of meaning . " Additionally , many of these newer roguelike @-@ likes strive to address the apparent high difficulty and ruthlessness that traditional roguelikes were known for , and newer players will be able to find more help through user @-@ generated game guides and walkthroughs made possible through wide Internet accessibility . Fabien Fischer offers that players have taken to independently @-@ developed roguelike @-@ likes as they have tired from " superficial gameplay , whitewashing spectacle , the content craze , and Skinner Box design " in titles produced by AAA developers and publishers . 
 Particularly for smaller indie developers , the nature of the procedural @-@ generated world allows teams to deliver many hours worth of game content without having to spend resources and development time on fleshing out detailed worlds . This also allows developers to devote more time in building out complex gameplay features and their interacting systems that are part of the enjoyment of roguelike and roguelike @-@ like games . McMillen of The Binding of Isaac stated that incorporating roguelike elements into other game genres can be difficult due to overcoming the complex interfaces roguelikes tend to have , but once a means to do so is found , " it becomes an increasingly beautiful , deep , and everlasting design that allows you to generate a seemingly dynamic experience for players , so that each time they play your game they 're getting a totally new adventure " . 
 With the expansion of both classical roguelikes and modern roguelike @-@ like titles , there has been more interest in developing roguelikes . The 7 Day Roguelike challenge ( <unk> ) was born out of a USENET newsgroup in 2005 for roguelike developers , informally challenging them to create the core of a novel roguelike within 7 days to be submitted for judging and play by the public . The competition has continued annually each year , since growing from 5 – 6 entries in 2005 to over 130 in 2014 .

 The fight was a rematch of the main event at UFC 117 , also a contest for the UFC Middleweight Championship . In that match , Silva ( after losing four rounds on points ) made Sonnen submit to a triangle armbar with 1 : 50 left in the fight . Sonnen landed 320 strikes against Silva , more than any other fighter since UFC 5 ( when Royce Gracie landed 355 strikes against Ken Shamrock ) . Silva had only absorbed 166 strikes ( combined ) in his previous 11 matches . With the win Silva retained the UFC Middleweight Championship , his undefeated record in the UFC and extended his winning streak to 13 . The bout received the Fight of the Year award at the 2010 World MMA Awards . After UFC 117 Silva defended the title twice , with KO and TKO wins over Vitor Belfort and Yushin Okami respectively . Sonnen is also undefeated since UFC 117 , defeating Brian Stann and Michael Bisping and setting the stage for the most @-@ anticipated rematch of the year . 
 The UFC Middleweight Championship main @-@ event match between Silva and Sonnen was originally scheduled for UFC 147 at Havelange Stadium in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Due to a scheduling conflict with the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development , the bout was moved to headline UFC 148 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas , Nevada . At this point in their careers Sonnen was ranked as the number @-@ two middleweight in the world by Sherdog , while Silva is ranked number @-@ one middleweight and the number @-@ one pound @-@ for @-@ pound fighter in the world according to Sherdog , Yahoo ! Sports , and ESPN . In an effort to further promote the contest , UFC Primetime returned on Fuel TV . 
 After Sonnen 's win over Nate Marquardt in early 2010 , Sonnen became a polarizing figure due to his criticism of Silva and overall trash talk ( including comments directed towards Silva 's manager , teammates , coaches , wife and home country of Brazil ) . Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012 , when he stated through an interpreter : " Chael Sonnen 's going to get his ass kicked like he 's never gotten his ass kicked before . What I 'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that 's going to change the image of the sport . This is going to be violent and I am sorry . I 'm going to make sure that every one of his teeth are broken , that his arms are broken and his legs are broken . He 's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself . I can guarantee that . He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards . And I know that he ’ s listening , so the game ’ s over . No more shit talking . It ’ s on now . " This caught some by surprise , who perceived his remarks as out of character . 
 The sixth and final bout of the main card was the UFC Middleweight Championship match between Anderson <unk> and Chael Sonnen , regulated by referee Yves Lavigne . As the fight finally took place , Sonnen quickly took the champion down in the first round and maintained a dominant position throughout , eventually gaining full mount while attacking with ground @-@ and @-@ pound . One <unk> judge scored it a 10 – 8 round as Silva was credited with zero strikes . Sonnen connected with 76 strikes from the top position in the opening round , and held a 22 @-@ to @-@ 15 edge in significant strikes against Silva . However , Sonnen was unable to inflict substantial damage to the champion , and as the fight resumed Silva was repeatedly admonished by the ref for holding Chael 's shorts . Being unable to score a takedown due to Silva 's constant violations of the ref 's commands , Sonnen failed to connect with a high @-@ risk spinning <unk> strike , leaving Sonnen in a <unk> position for Silva to land a knee to the chest , then with punches to stop Sonnen with a TKO at 1 : 55 of the second round .

 = Monarchies in the Americas = 
 There are 13 monarchies in the Americas ( self @-@ governing states and territories that have a monarch as head of state ) . Each is a constitutional monarchy , wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office , usually keeping it until death or abdication , and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers . Ten of these monarchies are independent states , and equally share Queen Elizabeth II , who resides primarily in the United Kingdom , as their respective sovereign , making them part of a global grouping known as the Commonwealth realms , while the remaining three are dependencies of European monarchies . As such , none of the monarchies in the Americas have a permanently resident monarch . 
 These crowns continue a history of monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization . Both tribal and more complex pre @-@ Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government , with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure , while others did the same with a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain . None of the contemporary monarchies , however , are descended from those pre @-@ colonial royal systems , instead either having their historical roots in , or still being a part of , the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean , beginning in the mid 14th century . 
 From that date on , through the Age of Discovery , European colonization brought extensive American territory under the control of Europe 's monarchs , though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers . Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries , as in the American Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence , usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process . Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths , such as Canada 's patriation of its constitution from the United Kingdom . A certain number of former colonies became republics immediately upon achieving self @-@ governance . The remainder continued with endemic constitutional monarchies — in the cases of Mexico , Brazil , and Haiti — with their own resident monarch and , for places such as Canada and some island states in the Caribbean , sharing their monarch with their former metropole , the most recently created being that of Belize in 1981 .

The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor @-@ General of Barbados , Sir Elliott Belgrave . 
 In 1966 , Elizabeth 's cousin , Prince Edward , Duke of Kent , opened the second session of the first parliament of the newly established country , before the Queen herself , along with Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , toured Barbados . Elizabeth returned for her Silver Jubilee in 1977 , and again in 1989 , to mark the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Barbadian parliament . 
 Former Prime Minister Owen Arthur called for a referendum on Barbados becoming a republic to be held in 2005 , though the vote was then pushed back to " at least 2006 " in order to speed up Barbados ' integration in the <unk> Single Market and Economy . It was announced on 26 November 2007 that the referendum would be held in 2008 , together with the general election that year .

The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain , but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century , whereafter the islands remained under the control of the Dutch Crown as colonial territories . The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954 , from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom .

 The British Crown possesses a number of overseas territories in the Americas , for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch . In North America are Anguilla , Bermuda , the British Virgin Islands , the Cayman Islands , Montserrat , and the Turks and Caicos Islands , while the Falkland Islands , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America . The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs , mostly English , Dutch , or Spanish , throughout the first half of the 17th century . By 1681 , however , when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons , all of the above @-@ mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England , Scotland , France and Ireland . Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown 's Caribbean regions , until 19 December 1980 , the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right . The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by : the Governor of Anguilla , Andrew George ; the Governor of Bermuda , Richard <unk> ; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands , David <unk> ; the Governor of the Cayman Islands , Stuart Jack ; the Governor of Montserrat , Elizabeth Carriere ; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands , Peter Beckingham . 
 The Falkland Islands , off the south coast of Argentina , were simultaneously claimed for Louis XV of France , in 1764 , and George III of the United Kingdom , in 1765 , though the French colony was ceded to Charles III of Spain in 1767 . By 1833 , however , the islands were under full British control .

 Before 28 October 2011 , the succession order in the American Commonwealth realms , as well as those American territories under the British crown , adhered to male @-@ preference cognatic primogeniture , by which succession passed first to an individual 's sons , in order of birth , and subsequently to daughters , again in order of birth . However , with the possible exception of Canada , following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement , succession is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011 , whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender . As these states share the person of their monarch with other countries , all with legislative independence , the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm . Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture .

 Most pre @-@ Columbian cultures of the Americas developed and flourished for centuries under monarchical systems of government . By the time Europeans arrived on the continents in the late 15th and early 16th centuries , however , many of these civilizations had ceased to function , due to various natural and artificial causes . Those that remained up to that period were eventually defeated by the agents of European monarchical powers , who , while they remained on the European continent , thereafter established new American administrations overseen by delegated viceroys . Some of these colonies were , in turn , replaced by either republican states or locally founded monarchies , ultimately overtaking the entire American holdings of some European monarchs ; those crowns that once held or claim territory in the Americas include the Spanish , Portuguese , French , Swedish , and Russian , and even Baltic Courland , Holy Roman , Prussian and Norwegian . Certain of the locally established monarchies were themselves also overthrown through revolution , leaving five current pretenders to American thrones .

 Orélie @-@ Antoine felt that the indigenous peoples would be better served in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader , and was accordingly elected by a group of Mapuche <unk> ( chieftains ) to be their king . He made efforts to gain international recognition , and attempted to involve the French government in his project , but these efforts proved unsuccessful : the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane , and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country . The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie @-@ Antoine and his kingdom , at least initially , and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía , a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region . In the process , Orélie @-@ Antoine was captured in 1862 , and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile . After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom ( thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities ) , Tounens died penniless in 1878 in <unk> , France . The current pretender , Prince Antoine IV , lives in France . The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne , even though a few <unk> continue to recognise the <unk> monarchy .

 The Aztec Empire existed in the central Mexican region between c . 1325 and 1521 , and was formed by the triple alliance of the <unk> ( the Nahuatl term for " speaker " , also translated in English as " king " ) of three city @-@ states : <unk> , Texcoco , and the capital of the empire , Tenochtitlan . While the lineage of Tenochtitlan 's kings continued after the city 's fall to the Spanish on 13 August 1521 , they reigned as puppet rulers of the King of Spain until the death of the last dynastic <unk> , Luis de Santa María <unk> , on 27 December 1565 . 
 = = = = Brazil = = = = 
 Brazil was created as a kingdom on 16 December 1815 , when Prince João , Prince of Brazil , who was then acting as regent for his ailing mother , Queen Maria , elevated the colony to a constituent country of the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves . While the royal court was still based in Rio de Janeiro , João ascended as king of the united kingdom the following year , and returned to Portugal in 1821 , leaving his son , Prince Pedro , Prince of Brazil , as his regent in the Kingdom of Brazil . In September of that same year , the Portuguese parliament threatened to diminish Brazil back to the status of a colony , dismantle all the royal agencies in Rio de Janeiro , and demanded Pedro return to Lisbon . The Prince , however , feared these moves would trigger separatist movements and refused to comply ; instead , at the urging of his father , he declared Brazil an independent Nation on 7 September 1822 , leading to the formation of the Empire of Brazil , a constitutional monarchy . Prince Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822 , with the title of Pedro I ( on that date , he was formally offered the Throne of the newly created Empire , accepted it , and was acclaimed as monarch ) , and his coronation took place on 1 December 1822 . After Pedro abdicated the throne on 7 April 1831 , the Brazilian empire saw only one additional monarch : Pedro II , who reigned for 58 years before a coup d 'état overthrew the monarchy on 15 November 1889 . There are two pretenders to the defunct Brazilian throne : Prince Luiz of Orléans @-@ Braganza , head of the <unk> branch of the Brazilian Imperial Family , and , according to legitimist claims , de jure Emperor of Brazil ; and Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans @-@ Braganza , head of the Petrópolis line of the Brazilian Imperial Family , and heir to the Brazilian throne according to royalists . 
 The Brazilian constitution of 1988 called for a general vote on the restoration of the monarchy , which was held in 1993 . The royalists went to the polls divided , with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne ( Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique ) ; this created some confusion among the voters . Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy . Additional anti @-@ monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil 's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship . This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls . 
 = = = = Haiti = = = = 
 The entire island of Hispaniola was first claimed on 5 December 1492 , by Christopher Columbus , for Queen Isabella , and the first Viceroy of the Americas was established along with a number of colonies throughout the Island . With the later discovery of Mexico and Peru many of the early settlers left for the main land , but some twelve cities and a hundred thousand souls remained , mainly in the Eastern part of the Island . Through the Treaty of <unk> in 1697 , King Louis XIV received the western third of the Island from Spain as retribution and formalized the first French pirate settlement in existence since the mid @-@ 1600s , with the colony administered by a governor @-@ general representing the French crown , an arrangement that stood until the French Revolution toppled the monarchy of France on 21 September 1792 . Though the French government retained control over the region of Saint @-@ Domingue , on 22 September 1804 , Jean @-@ Jacques Dessalines , who had served as Governor @-@ General of Saint @-@ Domingue since 30 November 1803 , declared himself as head of an independent Empire of Haiti , with his coronation as Emperor Jacques I taking place on 6 October that year . After his assassination on 17 October 1806 , the country was split in half , the northern portion eventually becoming the Kingdom of Haiti on 28 March 1811 , with Henri Christophe installed as King Henri I. When King Henri committed suicide on 8 October 1820 , and his son , Jacques @-@ Victor Henry , Prince Royal of Haiti , was murdered by revolutionaries ten days later , the kingdom was merged into the southern Republic of Haiti , of which Faustin @-@ Élie <unk> was elected president on 2 March 1847 . Two years later , on 26 August 1849 , the Haitian national assembly declared the president as Emperor Faustin I , thereby re @-@ establishing the Empire of Haiti . But this monarchical reincarnation was to be short lived as well , as a revolution broke out in the kingdom in 1858 , resulting in Faustin abdicating the throne on 18 January 1859 .

The Inca Empire eventually fell to the Spanish in 1533 , when the last Sapa Inca of the empire , Atahualpa , was captured and executed on 29 August . The conquerors installed other Sapa Inca beginning with Atahualpa 's brother , Túpac <unk> .

Despite constant warfare and shifts in regional power , most Maya kingdoms remained a part of the region 's landscape , even following subordination to hegemonic rulers through conquest or dynastic union . Nonetheless , the Mayan civilization began its decline in the 8th and 9th centuries , and by the time of the arrival of the Spanish , only a few kingdoms remained , such as Tayasal , Mam , Kaqchikel , and the K 'iche ' Kingdom of Q 'umarkaj . On 13 March 1697 , the last Itza Mayan king was defeated at Tayasal by the forces of King Philip IV of Spain . 
 = = = = Mexico = = = = 
 With the victory of the Mexicans over the Spanish imperial army in 1821 , the Viceroyalty of New Spain came to a conclusion . The newly independent Mexican Congress still desired that King Ferdinand VII , or another member of the House of Bourbon , agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico , thereby forming a type of personal union with Spain . The Spanish monarchy , however , refused to recognise the new state , and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico . Thus , the Mexican Agustín de Iturbide was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822 , with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following . Only a few months later , Augustine dissolved a factious congress , thereby prompting an enraged Antonio López de Santa Anna to mount a coup , which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822 . In order to end the unrest , Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country , and the Mexican monarchy was abolished . After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication , Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824 , but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and , without trial , was executed . 
 Benito Juárez , elected as President of Mexico on 19 January 1858 , suspended all repayments on Mexico 's foreign debts ( save those owed to the United States ) , leading France , the United Kingdom , and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took Veracruz in December 1861 . Juárez then repaid the debts , after which British and Spanish troops withdrew , but Emperor Napoleon III of France used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly to the interests of France . Archduke Maximilian , brother of the Emperor of Austria , was elevated as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico , thereby re @-@ establishing the Mexican monarchy , but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon 's wishes , leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico . Regardless , Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet , and an illegitimate leader of the country . As well , at the end of the American Civil War , US troops moved to the Mexico @-@ US border as part of a planned invasion , seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their Monroe Doctrine . Backed by the Americans , ex @-@ president Juárez mobilised to retake power , and defeated Maximilian at Querétaro on 15 May 1867 . The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal , sentenced to death , and executed at the Cerro de las Campanas on 19 June 1867 .

 The Miskito people of Central America were governed by the authority of a monarch , but one who shared his royal powers with a governor and a general . The origins of the monarchy are unknown ; however , its sovereignty was lost when King Edward I of the Miskito Nation signed the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with King George II of the United Kingdom , putting the Miskito kingdom under the British protection and law . At the cessation of the American Revolutionary War , King George III of the United Kingdom , via the Treaty of Paris , relinquished control of the Miskito 's lands , though Britain continued an unofficial protectorate over the kingdom to protect Miskito interests against Spanish encroachments . After British interest in the region waned , Nicaragua dissolved and occupied the Miskito kingdom in 1894 , with the monarch thereafter becoming known as the Hereditary Chief . Norton Cuthbert Clarence is the current pretender to the Miskito Kingdom and Hereditary Chief of the Miskito Nation .

 The Taínos were an indigenous civilization spread across those islands today lying within the Bahamas , Greater Antilles , and the northern Lesser Antilles . These regions were divided into kingdoms ( the island of Hispaniola alone was segmented into five kingdoms ) , which were themselves sometimes sub @-@ divided into provinces . Each kingdom was led by a cacique , or " chieftain " , who was advised in his exercise of royal power by a council of priests / healers known as <unk> . The line of succession , however , was matrilineal , whereby if there was no male heir to become <unk> , the title would pass to the eldest child , whether son or daughter , of the deceased 's sister . After battling for centuries with the Carib , the Taíno empire finally succumbed to disease and genocide brought by the Spanish colonisers .

 After a number of failed attempts at colonising Tobago , Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland and Semigallia sent one more ship to the island , which landed there on 20 May 1654 , carrying soldiers and colonists , who named the island New Courland . At approximately the same time , Dutch colonies were established at other locations on the island , and eventually outgrew those of the Duchy of Courland in population . When the Duke was captured by Swedish forces in 1658 , Dutch settlers overtook the Courland colonies , forcing the Governor to surrender . After a return of the territory to Courland through the 1660 Treaty of Oliwa , a number of attempts were made by the next Duke of Courland ( Friedrich Casimir Kettler ) at re @-@ colonisation , but these met with failure , and he sold New Courland in 1689 .

 After King Francis I commissioned Jacques Cartier to search out an eastern route to Asia , the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia . From there , the French Crown 's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River , as well as islands in the Caribbean , and the north eastern shore of South America ; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV . Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties , and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day . Upon several restorations of the monarchy , the royal presence in the Americas ended with the collapse of the Second French Empire under Napoleon III in 1870 .

Another Russian outpost , Fort Ross , was established in 1812 in what is now California . The colonies , however , were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area , with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700 .

The Portuguese Prince Regent , the future King John VI , with his incapacitated mother , Queen Maria I of Portugal and the Royal Court , escaped to the colony of Brazil in 1808 . With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 , there were calls for the return of the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon ; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro , where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom , and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe . However , those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from a colony . On the other hand , leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the elevation of Brazil from the rank of a colony , so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother @-@ country . Brazilian nationalists also supported the move , because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal , but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy .

 Beginning in 1492 with the voyages of Christopher Columbus under the direction of Isabella I of Castile , the Spanish Crown amassed a large American empire over three centuries , spreading first from the Caribbean to Central America , most of South America , Mexico , what is today the Southwestern United States , and the Pacific coast of North America up to Alaska . These regions formed the majority of the Viceroyalty of New Spain , the Viceroyalty of Peru , the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , and the Viceroyalty of New Granada , in each of which the Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy . By the early 19th century , however , the Spanish sovereign 's possessions in the Americas began a series of independence movements , which culminated in the Crown 's loss of all its colonies on the mainland of North and South America by 1825 . The remaining colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico were occupied by the United States following the Spanish – American War , ending Spanish rule in the Americas by 1899 .

 = Alioramus = 
 Alioramus ( / <unk> / ; meaning ' different branch ' ) is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous period of Asia . The type species , A. remotus , is known from a partial skull and three foot bones recovered from Mongolian sediments which were deposited in a humid floodplain about 70 million years ago . These remains were named and described by Soviet paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976 . A second species , A. altai , known from a much more complete skeleton , was named and described by Stephen L. Brusatte and colleagues in 2009 . Its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear , with some evidence supporting a hypothesis that Alioramus is closely related to the contemporary species Tarbosaurus bataar . 
 Alioramus were bipedal like all known theropods , and their sharp teeth indicate that they were carnivores . Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex , but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both species are known only from juvenile or sub @-@ adult remains . The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur . The genus Alioramus is characterized by a row of five bony crests along the top of the snout , a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid , and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids . 
 = = Description = = 
 Alioramus remotus was estimated at 5 to 6 metres ( 16 to 20 ft ) in length when originally described by Sergei Kurzanov in 1976 . Kurzanov , however , did not correct for lengthening of the skull by deformation during fossilization , which may indicate a shorter overall body length for this individual . If this specimen is a juvenile , then adult Alioramus would have reached greater lengths , but no confirmed adult specimens are known . 
 The skull of A. remotus was approximately 45 centimetres ( 18 in ) long . In general , it is long and low , a shape typical of more basal tyrannosauroids and juveniles of larger tyrannosaurids . The premaxillary bones at the tip of the snout in Alioramus remotus have not been found , but are taller than wide in all tyrannosauroids for which they are known . The nasal bones are fused and ornamented with a row of five irregular bony crests that protrude upwards from the midline , where the nasal bones are sutured together . These crests all measure more than 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) tall . 
 At the back of the skull there is a protrusion , called the nuchal crest , arising from the fused parietal bones , a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids . In Alioramus , the nuchal crest is greatly thickened , similarly to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus . Like the rest of the skull , the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender , another possible juvenile characteristic . As in Tarbosaurus , a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with the rear of the dentary bone , locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids . Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth , D @-@ shaped in cross section , on each side . Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla , and 18 in each dentary , Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth , more than any other tyrannosaurid . The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions . 
 The rest of the skeleton of Alioramus remotus is completely unknown except for three metatarsals ( bones of the upper foot ) , but the discovery of A. altai , which is known from substantially more complete remains , has shed light on the anatomy of the genus . 
 = = Classification and systematics = = 
 Paleontologists have long classified Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea , but because its remains were for many years poorly known , a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai . A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae , alongside Tyrannosaurus , Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus . A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it was equally probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely , with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea . Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen 's fragmentary nature . The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed the placement of the genus within the Tyrannosaurinae . 
 Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features , including a locking mechanism in the lower jaw between the dentary and angular bones , and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus . The two genera may be closely related , representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae . Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus , although much lower . The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died and might even have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus , which lived in the same time and place . The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus , however , suggested it was a separate taxon , even if it is known only from juvenile remains , confirmed by the discovery of A. altai . Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults . 
 Recently a cladogram has been published finding Alioramus just outside Tyrannosauridae . Below is the cladogram by Loewen ( 2013 ) . 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 The holotype ( PIN 3141 / 1 ) of Alioramus is a partial skull associated with three metatarsals . A joint Soviet @-@ Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert in the early 1970s found these remains at a locality known as Nogon @-@ Tsav in the Mongolian province of <unk> . Alioramus was named and described by Russian paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976 . Its crests and low skull profile looked so different from other tyrannosaurids that Kurzanov believed his find was far removed from other members of the family . Accordingly , he gave it the generic name Alioramus , derived from the Latin <unk> ( ' other ' ) and ramus ( ' branch ' ) , and the specific name A. remotus , which means ' removed ' in Latin . Alioramus is known from the holotypes of A. remotus and A. altai . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 The Beds of Nogon @-@ Tsav are considered to be the same age as the Nemegt Formation . This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically , but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the Maastrichtian stage , at the end of the Late Cretaceous . 
 The Maastrichtian stage in Mongolia , as preserved in the Nemegt Formation and at Nogon @-@ Tsav , was characterized by a wetter and more humid climate compared with the semi @-@ arid environment preserved in the earlier , underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations . Nemegt sediments preserve floodplains , large river channels and soil deposits , but caliche deposits indicate periodic droughts . This environment supported a more diverse and generally larger dinosaur fauna than in earlier times . Kurzanov reported that other theropods , including Tarbosaurus , ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs were discovered at the same locality , but these remains have never been reported in detail . If the Nogon Tsav fauna was similar to that of the Nemegt Formation , troodontid theropods , as well as pachycephalosaurs , ankylosaurids and hadrosaurs would also have been present . <unk> sauropods were also potential prey for predators in the Nemegt . 
 = St Helen 's Church , Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch = 
 St Helen 's Church is the Anglican parish church of Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch , in the deanery of North West Leicestershire and the Diocese of Leicester . Although there was a church in the town in the eleventh century , the core of the present building mainly dates from work started in 1474 , when the church was rebuilt by William Hastings at the same time that he converted his neighbouring manor house into a castle . The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space , but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829 , and a major rebuild in 1878 – 80 , including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles . 
 The sandstone church has a tower at the west end , and its nave is wider than it is long due to the extra Victorian aisles . St Helen 's Church has some ancient stained glass at the east end , and the Victorian windows on the nave and towers form a coherent narrative of the life of Jesus . Other fixtures include some important funereal monuments , and a font , pulpit and carved heads by Thomas Earp . The finger pillory is a rare item , once seen as a humane form of punishment . The church has a long association with the Hastings family , its patrons for four centuries , and became a centre for Puritanism under Henry Hastings , 3rd Earl of Huntingdon . The " Puritan Earl " brought a series of radical figures to the town , including Anthony Gilby and Arthur Hildersham . St Helen 's Church is a nationally important building , with a Grade I listing for its exceptional architectural interest .

 = = = Foundation to 1547 = = = 
 There is little documented history of Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch before the Norman Conquest , although Roman coins were found in the area , and the town 's name has both Saxon and Danish elements . It has an entry in the Domesday Book , which suggests that it had about 100 inhabitants in 1086 , and subsequently grew in importance under its La Zouch and Hastings lords , notably William Hastings . 
 It is recorded in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby , and that the church dedicated to St Helen consisted only of a nave . In about 1144 , Philip <unk> , lord of the Manor of Ashby , granted the church , its lands and revenues to the Augustinian community of Lilleshall Abbey , which retained possession until 1538 . A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two @-@ story vicarage dating from this period , but the building fell into disrepair following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the site was cleared in the English Civil War of 1642 – 49 . 
 Parts of the current nave and chancel date from the fourteenth century , but the church was rebuilt and enlarged by William Hastings in 1474 , at the same time that he erected the tower of his nearby castle . The new , larger church included a nave with aisles and chapels adjoining the chancel . The tower , Hastings Chapel , and some buttresses and windows still remain from the fifteenth century . 
 = = = Reformation and after = = = 
 The English Reformation inevitably affected St Helen 's Church . Edward VI 's 1547 injunction decreed that all images in churches were to be dismantled or destroyed , including stained glass , shrines , roods , statues and bells , and altars were to be replaced by wooden tables . Damage during the Civil War was minimal , although there are pike marks on the stonework . The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle , a Royalist stronghold . 
 Around 1670 , the church was refurbished , a gallery was built at the western end of the nave , and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms , now at the west end of the nave , were acquired at the same time . An inspection report at the end of the eighteenth century commented on the dirty transept walls , and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard . Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief . The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829 , but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878 – 80 , by James Piers St Aubyn . The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period , a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel . The cost of these works has been estimated as between £ 16 @,@ 000 and more than £ 18 @,@ 000 . Later developments included the expenditure of £ 13 @,@ 000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat <unk> beetles found during rewiring , improvements to the heating system , and a rededication in 1974 , the quincentenary of the church .

The tower has a four @-@ light window and west doorway , and contains a spiral stairway to the bell and clock chambers and the roof . The chancel is adjoined by the former north chapel ( now the vestry ) on one side and the Hastings Chapel , set transept @-@ wise on the other ; it has three sedilia and a piscina on its northern wall . The nave is significantly wider than it is long , and has four bays with medieval inner north and south aisles and nineteenth @-@ century outer aisles . The Hastings Chapel , chancel and clerestory are embattled , and the former north chapel is English Perpendicular , with a window of the same style . The piers in the nave were remodelled in the fifteenth century , and have incised panels , as do some of the arches . This feature is of an unusual style , although it is seen also at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul , <unk> , Leicestershire . 
 The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at the east end of the outer north and south aisles respectively , and contain twenty of the twenty @-@ eight stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878 – 1880 , mostly depicting biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist , or historical figures like St Helen and Martin Luther . Ten are paired on opposite sides of the five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle , and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels . The corbels of the north , west and south doors bear six more heads , those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait ; and Jesus and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window . The clerestory and the wooden roofs of the nave and south inner aisle are fifteenth century , but the rest of the lead @-@ clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding . 
 St Helen 's Church was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1950 , recognising it as a building of exceptional interest . It is important not only for the medieval structures that remain , but also for its monuments and fittings . The Victorian restoration is also noted as being of high quality and in keeping with the older parts of the church .

 The church had much stained glass in 1622 that disappeared during the Reformation . The current eleven coloured glass windows on the north , west and south sides of the church were erected in 1879 by Lavers , Barraud and Westlake , each being named for its donor ; the scenes depicted tell the Life of Christ from the Annunciation to the Last Supper . The stained glass in the chancel and the Hasting Chapel was erected in 1924 , and most was once in the castle , although the earliest glass is a German , Swiss and Flemish work possibly originally from Farleigh Hungerford . The chancel 's east window contains arms of Richard I and Edward I and the south window includes " The Magi bearing gifts " and the arms of Catherine Parr . The Hastings Chapel south window has several panels from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , and one which could possibly be as old as the thirteenth century . The chapel 's east window also has some high quality work , including " The Last Supper " . The large west window in the tower is plain glass , as is the clerestory . 
 The rare finger pillory at the west end immobilised offenders without exposing them to the public degradation associated with the stocks . In the centre aisle hangs a large brass candelabrum donated by Leonard <unk> , High Bailiff of Leicester , in 1733 . It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London . Some of the branches were stolen in 1776 , but soon recovered . 
 The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679 , probably by local man Thomas Sabin , has been compared favourably with the work of Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons , and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman , John Staley , is also of high quality . There is a Royal Arms from the reign of Charles II high on the west wall of the nave . The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878 – 1880 . The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols , and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base . The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font . A second , smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave . 
 The church contains a pipe organ of uncertain date made by Kirkland of London at their Wakefield branch which opened in 1893 . Its most recent restorations were in 1935 and 1955 . It has three manuals and a pedalboard , and is described on the National Pipe Organ Register as being of an " unusual " type . 
 There is a north @-@ facing clock on the tower , and a sundial on the south side which was rediscovered and repaired in 2000 . The masonry shows that it was built at the same time as that part of the tower . The tower holds a ring originally of eight bells ; the earliest dates back to 1571 , but was recast in 1849 , and all eight bells were repaired by John Taylor & Co in 1886 . The bells were repaired and rehung again in 2006 using £ 42 @,@ 600 of National Lottery funding awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund . The tenor bell was recast , and two new trebles were made , bringing the total to ten ; prior to the last recasting , the large tenor bell weighed 902 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 989 lb ) . 
 = = = Hastings Chapel and memorials = = = 
 The Hastings Chapel contains a number of family monuments , including a large alabaster tomb for Francis Hastings , 2nd Earl of Huntingdon , who died in 1561 , and his countess , Catherine . The monument was carved by Joseph Pickford to a design by William Kent . A memorial to Theophilus Hastings , 9th Earl of Huntingdon , who died in 1746 , is on the east wall and is by Michael Rysbrack . His widow , Selina , founded a training college for evangelical ministers , and a sculpture of her in mourning , also by Rysbrack , is placed by her husband 's memorial . The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor . The larger of two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel , and the smaller and older one is under their chapel . 
 The Lady Chapel contains a wall memorial to Arthur Hildersham and a painted wooden bust of Margery Wright , who died in 1623 . The inscription below records that she had given £ 43 to provide gowns for the old and needy of the town . The Chapel of St Michael and All Angel has a recumbent alabaster effigy known as " the Pilgrim " . The subject holds a pilgrim 's staff and other symbols such as a wide hat with cockle shells . A dog lies at his feet . The fifteenth @-@ century figure was originally brightly painted , and depicts a person of noble birth . It is believed to represent Thomas , the third brother of William Hastings . A number of carved alabaster memorial slabs were removed when the church was re @-@ <unk> in 1829 . Only one survives , a memorial to Robert Mundy , who died in 1526 , and his two wives , both named Elizabeth ; it now stands upright by the west wall . 
 The arch gateway at the western end of the churchyard bears a skull and crossbones at the top of each pillar . The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750 – 1850 , and most are lined against the churchyard 's south wall or are flush with the ground . Some show fine carving , commensurate with commercial success . They include the memorials of French @-@ born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers , founders of Royal Crown Derby . From 1804 , French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby , and those who died before their release , or who stayed and married local women , are also buried in the churchyard . A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family , the <unk> . Edward <unk> , church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six , also has a monument in the church , and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons .

 The advowson of St Helen 's Church , including the right to nominate the vicar , was owned by Lilleshall Abbey until 1508 , when it passed to the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield . The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of the patronage to Francis Hastings , the 2nd Earl of Huntingdon , and it remained with the Hastings family until 1931 , passing then to John G. Shields and his descendants . The names of the vicars are known back to Roger in 1200 . 
 Henry Hastings , the third earl , was a zealous promoter of puritanism and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education in accordance with his religious views . Anthony Gilby had lived in exile in Geneva during the reign of Mary , but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre for radical Protestantism . Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed , and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering . Hastings ' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers . The last of these was Arthur Hildersham , another influential figure who sought to <unk> radical Protestantism , but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595 . Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency , Earl Henry was interred in St Helen 's after a lavish funeral befitting his status as Lord President of the Council of the North .

 The Ashe lectures , endowed by Francis Ashe in 1654 , provided for weekly lectures in the church by a " godly , orthodox and ordained minister " . This was later amended to allow for at least one lecture each year . Twentieth @-@ century lecturers include Geoffrey Fisher , Donald Coggan , Donald Soper and George Carey .

 = Cwm , Llanrothal = 
 Cwm ( also known as Come and Welsh Jesuit College of St Francis Xavier ) was a Jesuit gathering place , Ecclesiastical province and college in Llanrothal , Herefordshire , England . It became a Jesuit college in 1622 . Based in a large farmhouse , the Cwm included two houses , called " Upper Cwm " and " Lower Cwm " . They were divided by a walled forecourt and each was able to generate £ 60 ( equivalent to £ 10 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) during its prime annually in rents from its own land . 
 In 1678 , Cwm came under attack during the Popish Plot , when it was raided by such Protestants as Bishop Croft , John Arnold of Monmouthshire and ultra @-@ Protestant Charles Price . Some 150 volumes of its library were confiscated and removed to Hereford Cathedral Library . The original buildings were mostly demolished in 1830 and the existing building dates from soon afterwards , now a Grade II listed building .

 The Jesuits ' South Wales Mission was originally based about 14 miles to the south , in Raglan , Monmouthshire , but soon after the year 1600 , their Superior received from the Earl of Worcester an estate called The Cwm in the parish of Llanrothal . The estate consisted of farm buildings and land between the villages of Welsh Newton and Llanrothal , about 5 miles from <unk> . The Cwm became " one of the two focal points of disturbance in June and July 1605 " . That year , Father Robert Jones who resided at Cwm , was implicated in an attempt to save two of the Gunpowder Plot perpetrators . 
 Henry Milbourne worshipped with the Jesuits at the Cwm for some time and " refused to issue warrants under the Elizabethan legislation , saying that it was not intended for use against Papists . " In the early 17th Century , it was home to the recusant William Griffith . The province was founded in 1622 by Fr . John Salusbury ( d . 1625 ) , and it sheltered the College of St Francis Xavier , and the Cwm college became known as the Welsh Jesuit College of St Francis Xavier . After Salusbury 's death , Charles Gwynne ( also known as <unk> ) became rector . Serving as a refuge for priests ( 1625 – 1678 ) , in 1648 it was the base of the martyr St David Lewis , who became head of the Catholic seminary there . In 1678 , it came under attack during the Popish Plot , when it was raided by such Protestants as Bishop Croft , John Arnold of Monmouthshire and ultra @-@ Protestant Charles Price .

 M @-@ 1 , commonly known as Woodward Avenue , is a north – south state trunkline highway in the Metro Detroit area of the US state of Michigan . The highway , called " Detroit 's Main Street " , runs from Detroit north @-@ northwesterly to Pontiac . The street is one of the five principal avenues of Detroit , which also include Michigan , Grand River , Gratiot and Jefferson avenues . These streets were platted in 1805 by Judge Augustus B. Woodward , namesake to Woodward Avenue . The US Department of Transportation has listed the highway as the Automotive Heritage Trail , an All @-@ American Road in the National Scenic Byways Program . It has also been designated a Pure Michigan Byway by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . The roadway was also included in the <unk> National Heritage Area designated by the US Congress in 1998 . 
 The trunkline is the dividing line between Detroit 's East and West sides , and it connects to some of the city 's major freeways like Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 , Edsel Ford Freeway ) and M @-@ 8 ( Davison Freeway ) . Woodward Avenue exits Detroit at M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) and runs through the city 's northern suburbs in Oakland County on its way to Pontiac . In between , Woodward Avenue passes through several historic districts in Detroit and provides access to many businesses in the area . The name Woodward Avenue has become synonymous with Detroit , cruising culture and the automotive industry . 
 Woodward Avenue was created after the Detroit Fire in 1805 . It followed the route of the Saginaw Trail , an Indian trail that linked Detroit with Pontiac , Flint , and Saginaw . The Saginaw Trail also connected to the Mackinaw Trail , which ran north to the Straits of Mackinac at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan . In the age of the auto trails , Woodward Avenue was also part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway that connected Portland , Maine , with Portland , Oregon through Ontario in Canada . It was also a part of the Dixie Highway , which connected Michigan with Florida . Woodward Avenue was the location of the first mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of concrete roadway in the country . When Michigan created the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 , the roadway was included , numbered as part of M @-@ 10 in 1919 . Later , it was part of US Highway 10 ( US 10 ) following the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System . Since 1970 , it has borne the M @-@ 1 designation . The roadway carried streetcar lines from the 1860s until the 1950s ; a new light rail line will be added in the future .

 Woodward Avenue starts at an intersection with Jefferson Avenue next to Hart Plaza about 750 feet ( 230 m ) from the Detroit River . The plaza is regarded as the birthplace of the Ford Motor Company , and it is located near Cobo Center and the Renaissance Center , headquarters for General Motors ( GM ) . Woodward Avenue runs north @-@ northwesterly away from the river through the heart of downtown Detroit and the Financial District . Along the way , it passes several important and historic sites , including notable buildings like One Woodward Avenue , the Guardian Building and The <unk> . Woodward also passes The Spirit of Detroit , a statue used to symbolize the city . Further north , Woodward Avenue runs around Campus Martius Park and enters the Lower Woodward Avenue Historic District , a retail , commercial , and residential district listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . After that historic district , the avenue travels through the middle of Grand Circus Park ; the northern edge of the park is bounded by Adams Avenue , where state maintenance begins . 
 North of Adams Avenue , Woodward Avenue is a state trunkline designated M @-@ 1 . The highway crosses to the west of Comerica Park and Ford Field , home of Major League Baseball 's Detroit Tigers and the National Football League 's Detroit Lions , respectively . Woodward also passes the historic Fox Theatre before it crosses over I @-@ 75 ( Fisher Freeway ) without an interchange ; access between the two highways is through the service drives that connect to adjacent interchanges . A six @-@ lane street , the highway travels through mixed residential and commercial areas of Midtown including the Midtown Woodward Historic District , another district listed on the NRHP . South of I @-@ 94 , Woodward heads through the Cultural Center Historic District , which includes the campus of Wayne State University , the Detroit Public Library , and the Detroit Institute of Arts ( DIA ) . The DIA and the nearby Detroit Historical Museum both feature exhibits showcasing the city 's automotive history . 
 North of I @-@ 94 , Woodward passes through New Center ; this district is home to Cadillac Place , the former headquarters of GM . The neighborhoods on either side of the highway transition in composition north of New Center ; this area is mostly residential in nature . Between the intersections with Webb Street / Woodland Street and Tuxedo Street / Tennyson Street , Woodward Avenue leaves the city of Detroit for the first time and crosses into Highland Park , an enclave within Detroit . It is within Highland Park that M @-@ 1 intersects M @-@ 8 , the Davison Freeway . Woodward passes over the Davison , which is the first urban , depressed freeway in the US , at an interchange south of Highland Park 's downtown business district . M @-@ 1 crosses that district and runs next to the historic Highland Park Ford Plant , home of the original moving assembly line used to produce Model Ts ; opened in 1910 , the plant 's assembly line dropped the time needed to build a car from 12 hours to 93 minutes and allowed Ford to meet demand for the car . 
 M @-@ 1 crosses back into Detroit at the intersection with McNichols Road ; the latter street occupies the 6 Mile location in Detroit 's Mile Road System . North of this intersection , Woodward Avenue widens into a boulevard , a divided street with a median ; left turns along this section of roadway are made by performing a Michigan left maneuver using the U @-@ turn crossovers in the median . Between McNichols and 7 Mile Road , Woodward Avenue travels to the east of the Detroit Golf Club in the Palmer Park area . North of 7 Mile , the highway runs to the west of the Michigan State Fairgrounds and to the east of the Palmer Woods Historic District .

 Many historical sites are located along Woodward Avenue , which was included in the <unk> National Heritage Area when it was created on November 6 , 1998 . The road was designated what is now called a Pure Michigan Byway by MDOT in 1999 , and a National Scenic Byway by the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) National Scenic Byways Program on June 13 , 2002 , the only urban road at the time with that classification . It was later upgraded to All @-@ American Road status on October 16 , 2009 ; such roads have highly unique features and are significant enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves . In announcing the byway status in 2002 , Norman <unk> , then United States Secretary of Transportation , said that " Woodward Avenue put the world on wheels , and America 's automobile heritage is represented along this corridor . " Other sources have called it the " Father Road " , in contrast to U.S. Route 66 's title as the " Mother Road " . 
 The Woodward Avenue Action Association ( WA3 ) , the local agency that acts as the stewards and advocates for the All @-@ American Road and Pure Michigan Byway designations as well as adjacent historical sites , obtained a grant for $ 45 @,@ 000 from the FHWA in 2011 to install a set of 50 custom road signs along M @-@ 1 between Detroit and Pontiac . The signs took 18 months to design and fabricate in consultation with the local communities , MDOT and DTE Energy . The signs proved to be popular , enough so that two of them were stolen in the first months after installation . WA3 is offering replicas of these unique signs to discourage theft , and the proceeds raise funds for future sign maintenance . Profits are also being used along with money from clothing and other merchandise to support the Woodward Avenue Beautification Fund , a special endowment created in 2010 to aid the 11 communities along the highway with maintenance and to defray costs associated with special events on the avenue . 
 In addition to the custom signage , WA3 has received FHWA grant funding to erect a series of lighted " tributes " : solar @-@ powered , lighted pillars that contain artwork related to the roadway . The $ 150 @,@ 000 glass and concrete sculptures are being placed in the median along Woodward Avenue to serve as landmarks along the route of the roadway and to brand it for tourists .

 The area around Woodward was once nicknamed " Piety Hill " . There are 22 churches on the NRHP along the street in Detroit and Highland Park . According to The Detroit News , the sounds of church bells and horse hooves were some of the most distinctive sounds on Sundays along Woodward Avenue in the early 20th century . Later , the street was home to the jazz clubs of the 1910s and 1920s . During the 1940s , ministers lobbied for a law to prevent the issuance of additional liquor licenses in their neighborhood ; the law was overturned in 1950 . Nightclubs hosted a burgeoning music scene in the early days of rock ' n roll , and the area also had plenty of bars and even burlesque shows as late as the 1970s . One local journalist called the mix of churches , clubs , and bars along Woodward Avenue " a precarious balance between the sacred and the profane . " 
 In addition to music clubs , many of Detroit 's other important entertainment fixtures are located on or near Woodward in downtown Detroit , including the Fox Theatre , Majestic Theater and the rest of the theater district . During World War II , the area was also home to 24 @-@ hour movie theaters and bowling alleys . Curfews across the river in Windsor , Ontario , meant that many patrons during the war years were Canadian . They frequented the establishments in addition to the Americans , many of whom worked in the factories of the Detroit area . Since the 1990s , the theater district has undergone a renaissance after renovations and improvements during the 1980s . 
 Woodward Avenue 's connection to Detroit 's automobile culture dates back to the early 20th century . Around 100 automobile companies were founded along the roadway . Henry Ford developed and first produced the Model T in 1907 – 08 at his <unk> Avenue Plant to the east of Woodward Avenue . The first 12 @,@ 000 Model Ts were built there , before Ford moved production of his cars to the Highland Park plant adjacent to Woodward Avenue in 1910 . Employees at the plant used the streetcar system along Woodward to get to work ; these lines also provided transportation options to assembly plant workers affected by gas rationing during World War II . During the 1950s and 1960s , automobile engineers street tested their cars along Woodward Avenue between 8 Mile and Square Lake roads ; the roadway was the only such location where this activity was practiced . 
 = = = Woodward Dream Cruise = = = 
 Young carriage drivers raced one another along Woodward Avenue after the roadway was converted from logs to planks in 1848 . They placed bets on each other 's carriages while racing from tavern to tavern . By 1958 , the roadway was used for unofficial street racing with cars . The wide width , median and sections lacking a large commercial presence attracted a reputation for the competition . The numerous drive @-@ ins , each with its dedicated local teenaged clientele , were also popular . Woodward also had numerous car dealerships and automobile accessory shops in the age of the muscle car which completed the formula for young adults to cruise , race and hang out along the road . 
 The Woodward Dream Cruise takes place on Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Ferndale during August of each year , evoking nostalgia of the 1950s and 1960s , when it was common for young drivers to " cruise " with their cars on Woodward Avenue . The event attracts huge crowds of classic car owners and admirers from around the world to the Metro Detroit area in celebration of Detroit 's automotive history . The cruise was founded in 1995 as a fundraiser for a soccer field in Ferndale . Neighboring cities joined in , and by 1997 , auto manufacturers and other vendors had begun sponsoring the event . An estimated one million spectators attended the 2009 event .

 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . One of these , the Saginaw Trail , followed what is now Woodward Avenue from the Detroit area north to Saginaw , where it connected with the Mackinaw Trail north to the Straits of Mackinac . The Town of Detroit created 120 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 37 m ) rights @-@ of @-@ way for the principal streets of the city in 1805 . This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit , with a mandate from the territorial governor to improve on the previous plan . The wide width of the avenues was an emulation of the street plan for Washington , DC , and intended to make Detroit the " Paris of the West " . 
 Augustus Woodward was a judge in the Michigan Territory appointed by his friend , President Thomas Jefferson . He was also a colonel in the territorial militia and a president of one of Detroit 's first banks . Woodward named the street for himself , responding whimsically to the resulting criticism : " Not so . The avenue is named Woodward because it runs wood @-@ ward , toward the woods . " Other proposals for names included Court House Street or Market Street . For a time , one section was named Congress Street , <unk> Street , Saginaw Road or Saginaw Turnpike , with another section dubbed Pontiac Road . Unlike these other monikers , the avenue retained the judge 's name . 
 Detroit was incorporated in 1815 , and the initial roadway to connect Detroit north to Pontiac along the Saginaw Trail was started in 1817 ; this was a corduroy road built by laying down logs and filling in the gaps with clay or sand . The territorial legislature authorized a survey of the roadway to Pontiac on December 7 , 1818 , and the route was approved by Governor Lewis Cass on December 15 , 1819 , the first to be done in the future state . The Michigan Legislature authorized the construction of a private plank road with tolls to connect Detroit with Pontiac in 1848 . By the next year , 16 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) and 3 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) oak planks were laid along the road between the two communities . Tolls were one cent per mile ( 0 @.@ 62 ¢ / km ) for vehicles and two cents per mile ( 1 @.@ 2 ¢ / km ) for a herd of cattle . Tolls along some segments of Woodward Avenue remained in place as late as 1908 . 
 The first automobile in Detroit was driven by Charles Brady King along Woodward Avenue on March 3 , 1896 , a few weeks before Henry Ford drove his first car in the city . In 1909 , the first mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of concrete roadway in the country was paved between 6 and 7 Mile roads at a cost of $ 14 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 17 million in 2015 ) .

 On May 13 , 1913 , the Legislature created the state 's highway system ; Woodward Avenue was included as part of " Division 2 " . The full length was paved in 1916 . The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues on October 9 , 1917 ; the tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before the structure was replaced in October 1920 with the world 's first four @-@ way traffic light . The state signposted its highways in 1919 , and Woodward Avenue was assigned the M @-@ 10 designation . The same year , two auto trail designations were applied to the avenue . The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was created in February 1919 , running from Detroit northward along Woodward Avenue . Later that year , the Dixie Highway was extended through Detroit to the Straits of Mackinac , following the route of the old Saginaw Trail northward along Woodward Avenue . 
 Since 1924 , Woodward Avenue has hosted America 's Thanksgiving Parade , the second oldest Thanksgiving Day parade in the United States . In 1925 , the intersection between Woodward Avenue and State Street was busier than Times Square . On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) ; the M @-@ 10 designation along Woodward was replaced with US 10 , a moniker that ran from Detroit to Seattle , Washington . 
 Legal disputes over a plan to widen Woodward Avenue dating back to 1874 were resolved in 1932 . Permission was needed from a majority of the landowners along Woodward Avenue to finalize the deal . John W. Chandler , general manager of the Woodward Avenue Improvement Association , pledged not to shave his face until he had the necessary permissions in hand . This resolution allowed Woodward to be widened from 66 to 120 feet ( 20 to 37 m ) . Several buildings were removed to clear the wider street path , and St. John 's Episcopal Church was moved 60 feet ( 18 m ) to avoid demolition . Work started in 1933 and cost $ 7 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 919 million in 2015 ) to complete . 
 A bypass of downtown Birmingham opened between late 1939 and early 1940 , drawing through traffic away from the busy Woodward Avenue – Maple Road intersection . The bypass was originally named Hunter Boulevard . In 1996 , though , Birmingham renamed the bypass to Woodward Avenue , with the previous alignment of Woodward signed as Old Woodward Avenue . 
 In October 1969 , AASHO approved the realignment of US 10 in the Detroit area ; the next year the designation was rerouted to follow the Lodge Freeway ( what is now M @-@ 10 ) and the portion of Jefferson Avenue between the Lodge and Randolph Street ( then US 25 , now M @-@ 3 ) . The M @-@ 1 designation was applied to the section of Woodward Avenue , from Jefferson Avenue in downtown Detroit , to Square Lake Road along the southern border of Pontiac . Woodward north of Square Lake Road was designated as business routes of US 10 and I @-@ 75 . When US 10 was truncated to Bay City in 1986 , the Bus . US 10 portion of Woodward became Bus . US 24 . 
 In the early 1980s , M @-@ 1 was truncated in downtown Detroit , as the Woodward Mall was designated in the area around Cadillac Square . At the end of 2000 , MDOT proposed several highway transfers in Detroit . Some of these involved transferring city streets in the Campus Martius Park area under the department 's jurisdiction to city control ; another part of the proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Woodward Avenue from Adams Avenue south to Grand River Avenue . These transfers were completed the following year . In 2004 , however , the southern terminus was moved north three blocks to Adams Avenue . 
 = = = Streetcars and subways = = = 
 On August 27 , 1863 , the Detroit City Railway Company ( DCRC ) established streetcar service along Woodward from Jefferson to Adams avenues . The company was formed by investors from Syracuse , New York , earlier that year . Later , on September 18 , 1886 , a separate electrified line , the Highland Park Railway , was added that ran along Woodward Avenue through Highland Park . In mid @-@ December 1893 , the main streetcar line was electrified by the DCRC . In 1901 , the various lines throughout the city were consolidated as the Detroit United Railway . 
 Detroit took control of the Detroit Unified Railway on May 15 , 1922 ; afterwards , the streetcar system became the city 's Department of Street Railways . Following the change in control , the city also formed the Detroit Rapid Transit Commission to build a subway system . Early proposals included a station under Woodward Avenue next to Detroit City Hall . In 1926 , a four @-@ line system encompassing 47 miles ( 76 km ) of lines was proposed at a cost of $ 280 million ( equivalent to $ 18 @.@ 7 billion in 2015 ) . By 1929 , plans were scaled back further in the face of tough local economic conditions ; the plan submitted to voters included one line of 13 @.@ 3 miles ( 21 @.@ 4 km ) that interconnected with the city 's streetcar system with two 2 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) streetcar tunnels . The bond proposal failed by a 2 @.@ 5 : 1 margin that year , killing any proposal for a city subway system in Detroit . 
 The street car system , like those in other cities across the US , fell into decline after World War II . Unlike the Great American streetcar conspiracy alleged in other cities , the decline of Detroit 's publicly owned system was related to a multitude of different factors . Increased spending on roads benefitted competing bus lines , and zoning changes coupled with freeway construction shifted the city 's population to areas away from the older street car lines . During the early 1950s , several lines were converted to buses after labor strikes , and other lines were eliminated completely . Later on April 8 , 1956 , a parade was held when the last streetcars stopped running along Woodward Avenue and in Detroit ; the remaining cars were sent to Mexico City . 
 = = Future = = 
 Local business and government officials have proposed two projects to add modern streetcars to M @-@ 1 . The Woodward Avenue Light Rail line was a proposed light rail line that would have run for approximately nine miles ( 14 km ) along Woodward Avenue from the transit center at Michigan Avenue north to the state fairgrounds . Another proposed venture , the M @-@ 1 Rail Line , would run for 3 @.@ 4 miles ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) in the downtown area only . Suggestions to unify the two plans were made in late 2008 , and the Detroit City Council approved the sale of $ 125 million in bonds on April 11 , 2011 , for the longer system . The line was approved by the Federal Transit Administration on August 31 , 2011 , with service expected at the time to start in 2015 . However , just months later , the federal government withdrew its support for the longer proposed line , in favor of a bus rapid transit system which would serve the city and its suburbs ; Woodward Avenue would have a dedicated bus lane under this system . This decision was made after talks between Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood , Detroit Mayor Dave Bing and Governor Rick Snyder . 
 Private investors who supported the shorter three @-@ mile line to New Center stated that they would continue developing that project . In January 2013 , LaHood announced $ 15 million in federal funding for the M @-@ 1 Rail Line . The final environmental clearance was granted in April 2013 to allow the project to start right @-@ of @-@ way purchases and construction . Construction started on July 28 , 2014 . The streetcar line will stretch from downtown Detroit to Grand Boulevard in New Center . There will be 20 different stations serving 12 stops , with most of the stations being curbside on either side of Woodward Avenue going uptown or downtown , but changing to center road stations at the north and south ends of the system . The streetcar line is expected to be operational in late 2016 .

 = The Mirror Never Lies = 
 The Mirror Never Lies ( also known by the Indonesian name Laut <unk> , meaning The Ocean <unk> ) is a 2011 Indonesian film directed by Kamila Andini and co @-@ produced by Andini 's father , Garin Nugroho , and former Miss Indonesia Nadine Chandrawinata . Starring Gita Novalista , Atiqah Hasiholan , and Reza Rahadian , it follows a young Bajau girl named Pakis who has lost her father at sea and uses mirrors to unsuccessfully search for him . It has several interpretations , including as a coming @-@ of @-@ age story and as an environmentalist piece . 
 Filmed over a period of two months after nearly three years of research , The Mirror Never Lies was sponsored in part by the Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wakatobi regency government . The first feature film to star the Bajau , it used their language extensively . Although a commercial failure domestically , it has been screened at many international film festivals and won several awards both inside and outside of Indonesia . Critical reviews have generally been positive , mostly emphasising the film 's visuals . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Pakis ( Gita Novalista ) is a young girl from a fishing community of the Bajau people in Wakatobi , Sulawesi , part of the Coral Triangle . She lives with her mother , Tayung ( Atiqah Hasiholan ) . As Pakis ' father has been lost at sea , Tayung works hard to support her daughter . Pakis , however , is determined to search for her father , a quest which brings the two into conflict . Pakis regularly visits a local shaman , who conducts a ritual allowing Pakis to search for her father in a mirror 's surface . The ritual never shows Pakis his location but she remains determined to keep trying . Meanwhile , Tudo ( Reza Rahadian ) has broken up with his fiancée . Struggling to cope with the loss , he takes a new job in Wakatobi studying dolphins . There he becomes involved with the Bajau community , staying at Tayung 's home . Eventually Pakis is able to realise that her father is dead and continues with her life . 
 = = Production = = 
 The film was directed by Kamila Andini , who also wrote the script and , in collaboration with <unk> Hatta , the screenplay . For her feature film debut , Andini chose to write about the sea – a topic which had long interested her and on which she had previously recorded documentaries . She had also had a long @-@ held interest in environmental issues . It was produced by former Miss Indonesia , Nadine Chandrawinata , together with Andini 's father , the director Garin Nugroho . Andini has stated that she only consulted with her father and that he was not directly involved in the production , while Chandrawinata described herself as assistant producer , with Nugroho in charge . Artistic direction was handled by Timothy D <unk> , with costumes by <unk> <unk> Damayanti and make @-@ up by Erwin Wijaya . Cinematography was completed by <unk> Rachmat <unk> . Editing was handled by <unk> I Wibowo , while <unk> <unk> provided music and <unk> <unk> provided sound effects . 
 The Mirror Never Lies was a collaboration between the Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature , the Wakatobi regency government , and <unk> Film Workshop , with the former two providing funding . It focused on the Bajau people , also known as " sea gypsies " for their nomadic maritime lifestyle . Little Indonesian @-@ language documentation was available to the crew , and as such production took over two years , most of which was research . Andini later recalled that the crew had to " go directly to Wakatobi back and forth to get to know everything about the [ Bajau ] tribe " . Originally planned for the second quarter of 2010 , shooting was further delayed until September owing to an extended rainy season . Unlike most contemporary Indonesian films , which are often completed in a matter of days , the crew shot on site over a period of two months . They faced poor weather , including typhoons and large waves , and had difficulty manoeuvring over the wooden walkways and bridges used by the Bajau . 
 The film cast three Bajau teenagers , Gita Novalista , Eko and Zainal , in their feature film debuts ; the three were the first Bajau to play in a feature film . More experienced actors , including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian ( who had received two Citra Awards ) , were also cast . Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet , citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother . In preparing for their roles , Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish , while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins . 
 The Mirror Never Lies uses the Bajau language heavily , with its Indonesian spoken in a Bajau accent and , in domestic screenings , Indonesian @-@ language subtitles when Bajau is spoken . The use of pre @-@ recorded music is minimal . Instead , much of the film 's soundtrack consists of " folk songs and chanting " in Bajau . Hasiholan had to undergo tutoring to learn her lines , learning from the Bajau people on location . 
 = = Themes = = 
 In a 2012 interview Andini stated that she considered The Mirror Never Lies and the Bajau people symbols of unity ; she expressed that the sea should not separate the different ethnic groups in the nation , but serve to connect them . Likewise , in an interview with Antara Nugroho stated that the film was intended to remind Indonesians that theirs is a maritime nation , which has influenced the country 's culture . The regent of Wakatobi , <unk> , added in an interview with the Indonesian newspaper Kompas that Indonesian films had historically only presented land based cultures . 
 Triwik Kurniasari , writing for The Jakarta Post , considered the film a criticism of " destructive fishing practices and climate change " in Wakatobi ; she believed that this is shown through the director 's " respect for the environment " in the film . Writing for Kompas , Teguh <unk> <unk> noted that such a theme is representative of realities faced by Bajau fishermen , who must travel ever further as the fish supplies diminish . He further suggested that the film depicts the sea as capable of both friendliness and hostility , a force with which the Bajau must deal every day . The critic <unk> Rahman , writing for the Indonesian film database <unk> , contrasted The Mirror Never Lies with the plot of " tourist " ( " <unk> " ) films : unlike in such films , where a city @-@ dweller changes the traditional lifestyle in a village , Tudo is able to adjust himself to village life and follow their ways . 
 Benny Benke , writing for the Semarang @-@ based Suara Merdeka , drew a parallel between The Mirror Never Lies and Samuel Beckett 's play Waiting for Godot . He suggests that they both have the same message : that awaiting somebody who never comes is ultimately futile . Benke further suggests that the film is centred around the conflict between the " utopian " Pakis and her " realistic " mother . Meanwhile , Maggie Lee , reviewing in The Hollywood Reporter , considered the film more of a coming @-@ of @-@ age story , with Pakis " discovering her womanhood just when the most significant man in her life is gone " . Lee also noted Pakis ' burgeoning sensuality and " nascent physical stirrings " for her friend Tudo . Ultimately , Lee suggested that Andini was expressing her desire to " break away from her father ' [ sic ] artistic influence and swim alone " through the film . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The Mirror Never Lies was premiered at the XXI Cineplex at FX Life Style in Jakarta on 26 April 2011 , followed by a wide release on 5 May 2011 . According to Lisa Siregar of The Jakarta Globe , the film was one of the first to document the Bajau people , including several of their rituals . It was a commercial failure domestically , seeing little viewership . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , writing for the Indonesian entertainment website <unk> , praised The Mirror Never Lies , concluding that it was " highly <unk> " [ sic ] and that , despite some scenes which were out of focus , it " showed its quality from the first minute " . Kurniasari considered the performances by the Bajau youth well done and praised the visuals as a " sneak peak into the beauty of Wakatobi " . She found , however , that the film had several events with unclear motives . Lee likewise praised the film 's " breathtaking underwater cinematography " and Novalista 's performance , considering the youth 's performance " convincingly embodying the uncertainties of a girl on the brink of adolescence " . She found some faults in the film , including its ecological message which made " some scenes look rather Discovery Channel " and the " artificial " manner in which traditional songs were included in the film . Siregar also praised the visuals , writing that " every frame of the film is filled with the natural beauty of Wakatobi " and that The Mirror Never Lies would likely attract tourists to the islands . 
 Writing for Tempo magazine , <unk> <unk> found that Andini had " done pretty well " with the film , praising its storyline and the children 's acting . She considered the film 's main strength to be the " beauty and uniqueness of Wakatobi 's panoramas " and wildlife . Benke found that the film was full of symbolism , similar to the works of Nugroho ; Benke stated , however , that The Mirror Never Lies much easier to decipher than works by Andini 's father . Rahman gave the film six out of ten . She praised Hasiholan and Novalista 's performances , but found Rahadian 's to be lacking . Although admitting the technical difficulties in filming on @-@ site , she wrote that the cinematography could have been better . 
 The film was screened at numerous international film festivals , including the Busan International Film Festival in Korea , the Vancouver International Film Festival in Canada , the Mumbai Film Festival in India , the Tokyo International Film Festival in Japan ( where it received a special mention ) , the Seattle International Film Festival in the US , and the Melbourne International Film Festival in Australia . It was one of two Indonesian films screened at the 2012 Berlin International Film Festival , playing to full cinemas in the Generation category ; Kompas reported that it was recommended viewing for German schoolchildren at the time . 
 = = Awards = = 
 The Mirror Never Lies has won several awards in both domestic and international film festivals . Before its domestic release , it won a special mention from the Global Film Initiative for its aesthetics and cultural content . For her directorial debut , Andini won a " Bright Young Talent Award " at the 2011 Mumbai Film Festival . At that year 's Indonesian Film Festival the film was nominated for eight Citra Awards , winning two . It lost four , including Best Film , to Ifa Isfansyah 's Sang Penari ( The Dancer ; 2011 ) , while Hanung Bramantyo 's ? ( 2011 ) surpassed The Mirror Never Lies for cinematography . 
 At the 2012 Bandung Film Festival The Mirror Never Lies received four awards from a total of ten nominations . At the 2012 Asia Pacific Screen Awards , it was one of two Indonesian works to compete , winning a single award from a single nomination . That year the film competed at the Asian Film Awards , receiving nominations for Best Cinematographer and Best Newcomer . The former award was ultimately captured by Chin Ting @-@ Chang of Warriors of the Rainbow : Seediq Bale ( 2011 ) , while the latter was taken by Ko Chen @-@ tung of You Are the Apple of My Eye ( 2011 ) .

 Alan Kotok ( November 9 , 1941 – May 26 , 2006 ) was an American computer scientist known for his work at Digital Equipment Corporation ( Digital , or DEC ) and at the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) . Steven Levy , in his book Hackers : Heroes of the Computer Revolution , describes Kotok and his classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) as the first true hackers . 
 Kotok was a precocious child who skipped two grades before college . At MIT he became a member of the Tech Model Railroad Club , and after enrolling in MIT 's first freshman programming class , he helped develop some of the earliest computer software including a digital audio program and what is sometimes called the first video game ( Spacewar ! ) . Together with his teacher John McCarthy and other classmates , he was part of the team that wrote the Kotok @-@ McCarthy program which took part in the first chess match between computers . 
 After leaving MIT , Kotok joined the computer manufacturer DEC , where he worked for over 30 years . He was the chief architect of the PDP @-@ 10 family of computers , and created the company 's Internet Business Group , responsible for several forms of Web @-@ based technology . Kotok is known for his contributions to the Internet and to the World Wide Web through his work at the World Wide Web Consortium , which he and Digital had helped to found , and where he served as associate chairman . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Alan Kotok was born in 1941 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and was raised as an only child in Vineland , New Jersey . During his childhood , he played with tools in his father 's hardware store and learned model railroading . He was a precocious child , skipping two grades at high school , and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) aged 16 . Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School , his first practical experience of computing came at MIT ; there he developed a habit of working late at night when more computer time was available . 
 In 1977 , at age 36 , Kotok married Judith McCoy , a choir director and piano teacher on the faculty of the <unk> School of Music . They lived in Cambridge , Massachusetts and Cape May , New Jersey . The couple shared a love of 16th and 17th @-@ century music and pipe organs , and toured historic pipe organs in Sweden , Germany , Italy and Mexico . They had a daughter , Leah Kotok , and two stepchildren from Judith 's prior marriage , Frederica and Daryl Beck . 
 Kotok recorded an oral history at the Computer History Museum in 2004 . He died at his home in Cambridge , apparently from a heart attack , on May 26 , 2006 , six months after the death of his wife during her treatment for cancer . 
 = = MIT : 1958 – 62 = = 
 At MIT , Kotok earned bachelor 's and master 's degrees in electrical engineering . He was influenced by teachers such as Jack Dennis and John McCarthy and by his involvement in the student @-@ organized Tech Model Railroad Club ( TMRC ) , which he joined soon after starting college in 1958 . 
 While a graduate student and member of TMRC , Dennis introduced his students to the TX @-@ 0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory . In the spring of 1959 , McCarthy taught the first course in programming that MIT offered to freshmen . Outside classes , Kotok , David Gross , Peter Samson , Robert A. Saunders and Robert A. Wagner , all friends from TMRC , reserved time on the TX @-@ 0 . They were able to use the TX @-@ 0 as a personal , single @-@ user tool rather than a batch processing system , thanks to Dennis , faculty advisors and John McKenzie , the operations manager . 
 In September 1961 , Digital donated a PDP @-@ 1 to MIT . Although not an expensive machine , and with a tiny ( by today 's standards ) 9K of memory , it had a Type 30 precision CRT display . Dennis oversaw the PDP @-@ 1 lab , located next door to the TX @-@ 0 . Students from TMRC worked as support staff , programming the new computer . 
 = = = Chess = = = 
 With classmates Elwyn Berlekamp , Michael Lieberman , Charles <unk> and Wagner , Kotok began to develop McCarthy 's IBM 704 chess @-@ playing program in 1959 . Kotok described their work in MIT Artificial Intelligence Project Memo 41 and in his bachelor 's thesis . By the time " the chess group " graduated in 1962 , their program played chess " comparable to an amateur with about 100 games experience " on an IBM 7090 . 
 Although they came to learn a great deal about the game , neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players . Mikhail Botvinnik , three times world chess champion , wrote in his book Computers , Chess and Long @-@ Range Planning that the Kotok – McCarthy program 's " rule for rejecting moves was so constituted that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water . " The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt , who later wrote Mac Hack , which beat a person in tournament play , and more recently , from Hans Berliner , when he looked back on it in 2005 . During the Cold War , Kotok @-@ McCarthy played ( and lost to ) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs . 
 = = = Spacewar ! = = = 
 Martin Graetz , Stephen Russell and Wayne Wiitanen conceived the computer game Spacewar ! while working at Harvard University in 1961 . Inspired by Marvin Minsky 's Three Position Display ( which they dubbed the <unk> ) , they had the first version running , with help from their MIT classmates Dan Edwards , Kotok , Stephen D. Piner , Samson and Saunders , by early 1962 . Coded by Russell , Spacewar ! was one of the earliest interactive computer games and is sometimes called the first video game . 
 Kotok did not write any of the Spacewar ! code , but he did travel to Digital to obtain a sine @-@ cosine routine that Russell needed . Graetz credited Kotok and Saunders with building the game controllers that allowed two people to play side by side . 
 Spacewar ! has had an enduring legacy . The game 's success was celebrated in Rolling Stone for the game 's 10th anniversary in 1972 in " Spacewar : Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums " . More recently , the source code has been transcribed into a Spacewar ! Java applet , and on the 40th anniversary in 2002 , the creators of Spacewar ! were interviewed by the New York Times .

 Edward <unk> , at one time at BBN Technologies ( BBN ) ( Digital 's first customer for the PDP @-@ 1 ) , McCarthy , Russell , Samson , Kotok and Harlan Anderson met in May 2006 for a panel to celebrate the Computer History Museum 's restoration of a PDP @-@ 1 ( with Gordon Bell on tape ) . Their presentations illustrated the contributions of TX @-@ 0 and PDP @-@ 1 users to early software . 
 Piner wrote Expensive Typewriter which enabled the group to operate the TX @-@ 0 and PDP @-@ 1 directly . 
 Wagner wrote Expensive Desk Calculator . 
 On a second PDP @-@ 1 in the physics department , Daniel L. Murphy wrote the Text Editor and Corrector ( TECO ) text editor , later used to implement Emacs . 
 Samson wrote the type @-@ justifying program known as TJ @-@ 2 , an early page layout program , and implemented the War card game . 
 Collaboration on computing waveforms with Dennis on the TX @-@ 0 led to Samson writing the Harmony Compiler with which PDP @-@ 1 users coded music . 
 Kotok and Samson worked together on T @-@ Square , a drafting program that used a Spacewar ! controller to move the cursor . 
 Gross and Kotok built the digital audio program Expensive Tape Recorder . 
 Early PDP @-@ 1 users wrote programming software including an assembler translated from the TX @-@ 0 over one weekend in 1961 . Kotok later wrote an interpreter for the Lisp programming language in TECO macros . 
 Kotok and his classmates are described as the first true hackers in the book Hackers : Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy .

 After graduating from MIT , Kotok started at Digital Equipment Corporation as one of the company 's first few dozen employees ; in his 34 @-@ year career with the company , he held senior engineering positions in storage , telecommunications and software . 
 He began in 1962 by writing a Fortran compiler for the PDP @-@ 4 , before contributing to the development of the PDP @-@ 5 instruction set . Under Harlan Anderson ( Vice President of Engineering ) , principal architect Gordon Bell led a team , including Kotok as an assistant logic designer , which developed the first commercial time @-@ sharing computer , the PDP @-@ 6 , designed and delivered in 1963 – 1964 . Aiming at a scientific market , Digital machines had a 36 @-@ bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers . In 1965 , in what may have been the first around @-@ the @-@ world networking connection , a PDP @-@ 6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link . 
 Kotok became the principal architect and designer of several generations of the PDP @-@ 10 , DECsystem @-@ 10 and <unk> @-@ 20 . Bell , Thomas Hastings , Richard Hill and Kotok wrote that the <unk> @-@ 10 accelerated the transition from batch @-@ processing to time @-@ sharing and single @-@ user systems . With Kotok as system architect , the VAX 8600 ( known as Venus ) was introduced in 1984 as the highest @-@ performance computer in Digital 's history to date , operating up to 4 @.@ 2 times faster than the standard at the time . 
 Kotok expanded his areas of expertise from engineering into teaching and business : following a suggestion of Berlekamp , he taught logic design at the University of California , Berkeley during the 1975 – 1976 academic year ; he also earned a master 's degree in business administration from Clark University in 1978 , which prepared him for later work at Digital and W3C . 
 = = Web : 1994 – 97 = = 
 While at Digital , Kotok recognized the Web 's potential , and helped to found the World Wide Web Consortium . Early in 1994 , in Zürich , Switzerland , Tim Berners @-@ Lee had met with Michael <unk> to discuss starting a new organization at MIT . In April 1994 , Kotok , Steve Fink , Gail Grant and Brian Reid from Digital traveled to CERN in Geneva to speak with Berners @-@ Lee about the need for a consortium to create open standards and coordinate Web development . Berners @-@ Lee mentions the pivotal meeting with Digital in his book Weaving the Web . 
 As technical director of Digital 's Corporate Strategy Group , Kotok was instrumental in creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web @-@ based technologies . Digital created the AltaVista search engine , the Internet firewall , the Web portal , the webcast and live election returns . Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times , but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the <unk> . For example , he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent , the <unk> system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent . 
 Kotok was a corporate consulting engineer for Digital 1962 – 1997 , W3C Advisory Committee representative for Digital 1994 – 1996 , vice president of marketing for GC Tech Inc . 1996 – 1997 , member of the Science Advisory Board for <unk> Corp. , a consultant for Compaq , and a content advisor for the Computer History Museum . 
 Digital and GC Tech were early W3C members and were among the sponsors of the Fourth International World Wide Web Conference ( <unk> ) in 1995 in Boston . Kotok coordinated a birds of a feather meeting on Selection of Payment Vehicle for Internet Purchases on April 7 , 1997 at <unk> in Santa Clara , California . In La Jolla , California , he presented <unk> Systems to the Electronic Payments Forum in 1997 . 
 = = W3C : 1997 – 2006 = = 
 Kotok joined W3C as associate chairman in May 1997 . His role involved managing contractual relations with W3C hosts and member organizations , coordinating the worldwide W3C Systems and Web Team services to millions of pages and resources on the W3C website , and maintaining the W3C host site at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( <unk> ) , where he was a research scientist . 
 While he was associate chairman , Kotok was a member of the W3C management team , and worked closely with the W3C Advisory Board . He helped to establish a new W3C office in India and worked with an internal task force to reduce membership fees in developing countries . He was a major contributor to the W3C Patent Policy and chaired Patent Advisory Groups , including one for HTML . He briefly served as Domain Leader of the Technology and Society Domain which at that time included W3C 's activity in digital signatures , electronic commerce , public policy , <unk> , RDF metadata , privacy , and security . 
 = The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie = 
 The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie is a book of recipes collected over a lifetime by Charlotte , Lady Clark of Tillypronie , Scotland , and published posthumously in 1909 . The earliest recipe was collected in 1841 ; the last in 1897 . The book was edited by the artist Catherine Frances Frere , who had seen two other cookery books through to publication , at the request of Clark 's husband . 
 The book is considered a valuable compilation of Victorian era recipes . Lady Clark obtained the recipes by asking hostesses or cooks , and then testing each one at Tillypronie . She documented each recipe 's source with the name of her source , and often also the date . There is comprehensive coverage of plain British cooking , especially of meat and game , but the book has sections on all aspects of contemporary cooking including bread , cakes , eggs , cooking for invalids , jams , pies , sauces , sweets ( puddings ) and vegetables . She had lived in Italy and France , and the cuisines of these countries are represented by many dishes , as is Anglo @-@ Indian cooking with a section called " <unk> " . 
 The book was enjoyed by Virginia Woolf and acted as a source of inspiration to the cookery writer Elizabeth David . 
 = = Context = = 
 Tillypronie is a Victorian era house between Ballater and Strathdon in Scotland , just east of the Cairngorms National Park , overlooking the valley of the River Dee ; the gardens are open to the public . Lady Clark collected thousands of recipes for her own use between 1841 and 1897 ; among her house @-@ guests in the 1870s was Henry James , who commented in a letter " I bless the old house on the mountain and its genial and bountiful tenants " . Lady Clark was married to the diplomat Sir John Forbes Clark , second baronet . Sir John worked in Paris ( seeing the 1848 revolution there ) , moving to Brussels in 1852 and Turin from 1852 to 1855 ; he married Charlotte in 1851 . Living in Europe gave Lady Clark a detailed insight into Italian and French cooking – there are five recipes for <unk> sauce ; and she was well informed about Anglo @-@ Indian cookery , with dishes such as " Rabbit <unk> @-@ <unk> " . Her approach was to ask her hostess or the cook how any interesting or unusual dish was made , and then to try out the recipe back at Tillypronie to ensure that it worked . 
 After Lady Clark 's death in 1897 , her widower invited Catherine Frances Frere ( 1848 – 1921 ) , daughter of Sir Henry Bartle Frere , to assemble them into a book , asking : 
 I have asked you to stand sponsor for the publication of a selection from a number of cookery and household recipes , collected by my late wife – this for two reasons , firstly because I know you to be yourself not a little interested and versed in the science of Brillat Savarin ; and secondly , and mainly , because , from your intimate acquaintance with her for many years you can bear testimony to her having been , not the mere " housewife " on culinary things intent , but an exceptionally widely @-@ read woman , gifted with fine literary taste and judgement . ... In this confidence , and in the hope and belief that they may prove of service to many a young matron of like mind with her who made it , I confide the collection to you for your supervision and for publication . Yours sincerely , John F. Clark . 
 Frere was born in Malcolm Peth , Bombay on 25 September 1848 . In later life she lived in Westbourne Terrace , London . The Cookery Book was not Frere 's first publication ; at the age of 20 she had illustrated her sister Mary 's book , Old Deccan Days , Or , Hindoo Fairy Tales Current in Southern India , a compilation of folk tales ; their father was at the time Governor of Bombay . The book was popular , going into four editions between first publication in 1868 and 1889 . In the Preface to the Cookery Book she denies " the special knowledge of cookery with which Sir John so kindly credits me " , but admits she has always been interested in the " study " , and that she had seen " two other cookery books through the press for my friend the late Miss Hilda Duckett " : these were Hilda 's Where is it ? of Recipes ( 1899 ) and Hilda 's Diary of a Cape Housekeeper ( 1902 ) , both published by Chapman and Hall ; but Frere 's name had not appeared on their title pages .

 The first edition is of xviii + 584 pages . It is divided into sections as follows , starting immediately after the Table of Contents with no preamble : 
 There are no illustrations . 
 There is an Appendix , under Frere 's name , with sections summarized from the RSPCA on how " To spare animals unnecessary pain " and " Bad meat " ( which gives advice on the best ways to kill rabbits and birds ) . The index runs to 31 pages in two columns of small type . 
 = = = Approach = = = 
 Each recipe is presented quite plainly , with a title which is numbered if there is more than one recipe for a given dish . There is no list of ingredients : each recipe begins at once , as for instance " Pound the slightly scalded fish , pound also 1 / 2 lb. of suet shred very fine , and 2 <unk> of stale bread @-@ crumbs , and 1 egg well beaten . " Many recipes have a named source , sometimes with a date , as in " Rhubarb Jam . ( Mrs. Davidson , <unk> Manse . 1886 . ) " 
 Some of Lady Clark 's recipes are very brief , forming little more than notes to herself , as in her 
 Vegetable Marrow . No. 3 . Stuffed — Turin . ' <unk> ' . 
 The Turin vegetable marrows are small and short — perhaps 2 inches long ; they are stuffed with <unk> , and served in a thick sauce . 
 They come as a ' <unk> ' after the soup , and are sometimes called ' <unk> à la <unk> . ' " 
 It can be seen that instructions , ingredients and comments are intermixed . 
 The recipes in each section are listed alphabetically . Some entries are cross @-@ references , for example " ' <unk> à la <unk> ' and ' à la <unk> . ' See Vegetable Marrow . "

 For most of the twentieth century there was only one edition , that of 1909 , published by Constable : 
 Frere , Catherine Frances ( editor ) . ( 1909 ) The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie . London : Constable and Company . 
 This changed in the 1990s : 
 ( 1994 ) The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie , with an Introduction by <unk> Holt . Lewes : <unk> .

 The feminist author Virginia Woolf reviewed the book in the Times Literary Supplement in 1909 , writing that " Cookery books are delightful to read ... A charming directness stamps them , with their imperative ' Take an uncooked fowl and split its skin from end to end ' and their massive commonsense which stares frivolity out of countenance " . 
 The Spectator review in 1909 speculates that Lady Clark inherited the " practical study of cookery " from her father , " Mr. Justice Coltman " who though " abstemious himself " was " careful to provide a well @-@ furnished table for his guests " . The review remarks on 
 the distinguished origin of many of the recipes . Mr. Ford , of the famous " Handbook to Spain , " contributes some few Spanish dishes ; there is a recipe for ginger yeast which Miss Nightingale must often have tested ; the poet Rogers tells us how to make a " Poet 's Pudding , " and Lord Houghton gives directions for a mutton and oyster pudding .

 The cookery writer Elizabeth David describes one of Lady Clark 's recipes in her 1970 book Spices , Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen as follows : 
 Thick Parmesan Biscuits . A little @-@ known recipe from The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie ... it is for the ideas , the historical aspect and the feeling of authenticity , the certainty that these recipes were actually used and the dishes successful ... that this book is so valuable . This recipe is an exceptionally good one ... : 
 For a dozen biscuits : ¼ lb. plain flour , 2 oz. each of butter and grated Parmesan , the yolk of one egg , salt , cayenne pepper . Rub the butter into the flour , add the cheese , egg and seasonings . <unk> with a little water if necessary . Roll out the dough to the thickness of half an inch . Cut into 1 inch diameter rounds . Arrange on a baking sheet . Bake in the centre or lower centre of a very moderate oven , gas No. 2 , or 310 – 330 ° F. , for just on 20 minutes . Serve hot . 
 Lady Clark makes the point that it is the thickness of these biscuits that gives them their character ... the biscuits can be stored in a tin and heated up when wanted . 
 Sue Dyson and Roger McShane , reviewing the book on <unk> , call it " a valuable collection of British recipes " and 
 important for a number of reasons . The first is that it represents a broad range of recipes that were in common use in households throughout Britain in the 19th century and hence serves to codify the preparation of food at the time . The second is that it is not the work of just one person . Lady Clark was an avid collector of recipes and her work is a compilation form hundreds of home cooks . The third reason why we think it is important is this work of Lady Clark had a deep effect on , and was an inspiration for , the great Elizabeth David . 
 Dyson and McShane state ( after discussing the contents ) that " The recipes are not difficult as Lady Clark preferred simplicity and was annoyed with contrivance . " They write that " The recipes on meat and poultry are very strong and range over the normal meats such as beef and pork and then on to many game dishes as would be expected of someone living in the highlands of Scotland . " They conclude with the recommendation " An excellent addition to your food library ! " 
 Vanessa Kimbell of the Sourdough School writes that Frere carefully catalogued all the recipes , removing any that she could trace to a published source , and comments that they " are all delightfully straight forward " . She explains : 
 There are few keen cooks who do not collect recipes as they go along in life . A friend ’ s cake scribbled down on a scrap of paper , a page torn out and treasured from a newspaper . For Lady Clark of Tillypronie , a well @-@ travelled diplomat 's wife , and friend of the American author Henry James , collecting recipes was more than just a keen interest ; it was a way of life . Inspired by her father ’ s love of French cuisine , Lady Clark collected cooked and annotated over three thousand pages of manuscripts and recipes between 1841 and 1897 , including many from her time spent living in France and Italy . 
 Kimbell concludes that " This extraordinary book is a delight to cook from . [ Frere 's ] diligence in putting together this vast collection of recipes resulted in one of the most charming , straightforward and thorough recipe books of the late nineteenth century with recipes that are still remarkably very useable today . " . 
 In her introduction to the 1994 edition , <unk> Holt writes that while most cooks collect recipes , 
 Few though , equal the astonishing feat of Lady Clark of Tillypronie , who filled more than three thousand pages of manuscript , as Catherine Frere says , " not only written over every available margin , but often crossed like a shepherd 's plaid " , with culinary details and carefully recorded recipes of meals and dishes she enjoyed . 
 Holt observes of the book that 
 What strikes me so forcibly is the modernity of Lady Clark 's food . Her preference for simple cooking with unblemished , distinctive flavours – her worst criticism of a dish is that it tastes dull – makes her food attractive even a century later . And her eclecticism , born of her well @-@ travelled childhood and life as the wife of a diplomat , produced dishes that still appeal to present @-@ day tastes . 
 In her book A Caledonian Feast , Annette Hope calls Lady Clark " admirable " and writes that her 
 cookery book ( a collector 's item ) epitomises the gastronomic life of late Victorian aristocracy . Even before her marriage Lady Clark had travelled much with her family , in France and Italy ; there she developed an interest in good food which , unlike that of many contemporaries , was based much less on greed and a predilection for ostentation than on a delicate appreciation of quality . 
 Hope adds that Lady Clark 's 
 personal jottings – sometimes no more than aides @-@ mémoire – unconsciously convey the world of the late Victorian hostess in London , abroad , and at home in Tillypronie . Because the provenance of most recipes is noted , her pages are peopled with shadowy figures , some of whose names we recognise , others quite unknown , but all united in the confraternity of what James Boswell called the " Cooking Animal " . 
 = Jack Marsh = 
 Jack Marsh ( c . 1874 – 25 May 1916 ) was an Australian first @-@ class cricketer of Australian Aboriginal descent who represented New South Wales in six matches from 1900 – 01 to 1902 – 03 . A right @-@ arm fast bowler of extreme pace , Marsh was blessed with high athletic qualities and was regarded as one of the outstanding talents of his era . His career was curtailed by continual controversy surrounding the legality of his bowling action ; he was no @-@ balled multiple times for throwing . As a result of the debate over the legitimacy of his action , Marsh never established himself at first @-@ class level and was overlooked for national selection . In contemporary discourse , Marsh 's lack of opportunities has often been attributed to racial discrimination . 
 Born into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in northern New South Wales , Marsh first made an impression as a professional runner , travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate , winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler . While in Sydney , Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny . He was first no @-@ balled for throwing in 1897 , but it was not until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team . Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble , but was called for throwing . Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints , which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation . Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition , Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield . He made an immediate impression and led the first @-@ class bowling averages for the season after three matches . He was no @-@ balled in his second match by Bob Crockett , but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no @-@ balled him seventeen times , leading to angry crowd demonstrations . The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh 's action was fair and various theories were propounded , which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh . The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race . 
 Marsh only played in two more first @-@ class matches , which came in the two seasons following his no @-@ balling . In a later season , the touring England cricket team objected to his selection in an opposition team . There were calls for Marsh to be selected for Australia , but Noble , the New South Wales selector , refused to select him , citing his controversial action . In later years , Marsh turned to alcohol and was briefly jailed for assault . He was killed in a brawl outside a pub ; two men were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Marsh was born into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar , which sits on the Clarence River in northern New South Wales . His surname is believed to have possibly derived from that of Francis Henry Marsh , whose property Camira was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range . Details of Marsh 's itinerant pre @-@ cricket life are scarce , because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate . 
 Marsh made his first impression in the sporting arena as a professional runner , following his brother Larry to the Sydney athletics tracks in 1893 . A sprinter and hurdler , Marsh had several wins in notable races . He was known for his rapid acceleration , which accounted for him being particularly strong over 75 yd . Aside from his victories in New South Wales , he travelled to race in Queensland and Victoria . As with some other Indigenous runners , Marsh was exploited by his trainer and was suspended for " running stiff " in Sydney in 1895 . A more recent study by Max Bonnell has come to the conclusion that Marsh was a world @-@ class sprinter . He found that The Referee , the leading sports publication in Australia at the time , reported that Marsh had covered 100 yd in 9 @.@ 8 s , which was equal to the amateur world record set by American John Owen in 1890 . Marsh had also posted a time of 9 @.@ 9 s in the previous year . Eight years later a publication briefly noted that Marsh 's time was an Australian record . 
 Marsh also gained prominence in the inner @-@ southern Sydney suburb of La Perouse , which had a large Indigenous population , by demonstrating his boomerang skills . Marsh , while throwing boomerangs , was spotted by cricket officials and he was persuaded to take up the sport . 
 = = Club cricket = = 
 Marsh began playing cricket in a competition based around Moore Park , near central Sydney , representing South Sydney . Marsh 's career was surrounded by controversy from the outset . In November 1897 , he was no @-@ balled for throwing by William Curran in a match against Paddington . Following its merger with South Sydney , Marsh played for Sydney Cricket Club . Marsh 's second no @-@ ball incident at club level came when he played for a Colts XV against the New South Wales state team in a trial match in November 1900 , before the start of the 1900 – 01 Sheffield Shield season . Curran called him on the first day of the match . Marsh had an eventful day , bowling Test batsmen Victor Trumper , Frank Iredale and future Test player Bert Hopkins . Trumper was widely regarded as the finest batsman of his era , which was regarded as the " golden age " of cricket , and he was seen as one of the most stylish batsmen of all time . Marsh also collected the wickets of Test batsmen and future Australian captains Monty Noble and Syd Gregory . 
 The calls of throwing so infuriated Marsh that at the end of the day 's play , he announced that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day . Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing . Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent 's Hospital , in order to bind his bowling arm . The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints . Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action . Marsh 's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him . 
 Marsh and his club sought a speedy resolution to the problem because Sheffield Shield matches were due to begin in a matter of weeks . They perceived a danger that other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran 's lead and call Marsh , effectively outlawing him , resulting in the loss of the club 's leading strike bowler . By wearing the splints , Marsh showed his belief that Curran would call him on the second day . This never happened , because Curran withdrew from his position by the luncheon adjournment on the second day , believing that he had been humiliated . Curran 's resignation was widely criticised by the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action . Bowling " as fast as ever " , Marsh went on to finish with 6 / 125 from 33 overs as New South Wales were bowled out for 320 . 
 = = First @-@ class debut = = 
 Marsh made his first @-@ class debut when he was selected for the New South Wales team to play South Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 1900 , just a month after he was no @-@ balled for throwing . The selection indicated that the state selectors were prepared to overrule Curran 's judgment . In a high scoring match , Marsh was the most successful of the New South Wales bowlers , taking five wickets for the loss of 181 runs ( 5 / 181 ) . Clem Hill scored 365 not out , which remains the highest individual score compiled at the Adelaide Oval in a Sheffield Shield match . At the time , South Australia 's total of 575 was the highest ever score against New South Wales in the competition . Marsh took two early wickets to have South Australia 2 / 43 before Hill amassed his triple @-@ century . He returned to take three of the last four wickets , displaying an ability to break through the defences of batsmen — all of his wickets were bowled . 
 A week later , Marsh 's action was again under scrutiny when he played his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne . While Richard Callaway — the New South Wales umpire officiating the match — was satisfied with Marsh 's bowling action , his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler 's wrist . Crockett no @-@ balled Marsh three times in the match , but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call . Marsh took 3 / 39 and 3 / 51 respectively , dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister , Warwick Armstrong , Jack Worrall and Frank Laver . Marsh bowled three of his victims . 
 According to cricket historian Bernard Whimpress , the early signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne by the name of Old Boy . The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called , possibly predisposing the umpire to take action . If Old Boy could be relied on , then observers suspected that Marsh 's faster and slower ball were dubious . The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned , except to say that one ball per over was doubtful . The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England . A fortnight earlier , the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers . In Australia , Jim Phillips had set the tone by no @-@ balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones . The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean @-@ up campaign against dubious bowling actions . Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action . 
 Marsh 's third Sheffield Shield match was the return fixture against South Australia in January 1901 at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) ; New South Wales reversed the result of the corresponding match three weeks earlier . South Australia batted first and were bowled out for 157 , with Marsh taking the leading figures of 5 / 34 . These included the prize wickets of Hill and George Giffen , Test players who went on to be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame . New South Wales then piled on 918 before completing an innings victory by bowling the visitors out for 156 in the second innings . The margin of an innings and 605 runs set a new record for the largest victory in first @-@ class history . Marsh took 5 / 59 and did the bulk of the damage , removing five of South Australia 's top six specialist batsmen , at one stage reducing the visitors to 6 / 114 . Marsh bowled six of his opponents and was not questioned by either umpire . At this point , Marsh led the first @-@ class averages in bowling , with 21 wickets at a bowling average of 17 @.@ 38 in three matches . The match was Marsh 's career high point ; it was to be the only ten @-@ wicket match of his brief career . 
 The controversy over Marsh 's bowling action came to a head in the return match against Victoria at the SCG . The fixture had been slated for the Australia Day weekend but it was postponed by a week when Queen Victoria died . By the time the match was under way , public interest had started to wane . Some three decades later , J. C. Davis reflected on the match , noting that it stirred many memories , " some fragrant and some rather unpleasant " . The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was Crockett 's continual no @-@ balling of Marsh for throwing . 
 New South Wales batted first and were bowled out on the first afternoon for 170 . When the Victorians began their response , Crockett called Marsh for throwing three times in his first over , provoking rowdy responses from the spectators . The Sydney Mail said the crowd reaction was " a lot of abuse and unfair criticism " of Crockett . He was no @-@ balled a further two times in his second over and five of Victoria 's first nine runs were extras . Despite this , Victoria started poorly , losing five wickets by the time it reached 50 runs . Of the five wickets to fall , Marsh bowled future Test captain Armstrong and McAlister . The crowd showed its sympathy for Marsh when he rattled Armstrong 's stumps ; they cheered him loudly and verbally attacked Crockett . Marsh was called a total of 17 times during the innings , the most in a single first @-@ class innings in Australia . The calls produced angry reactions from the spectators on the hill of the Sydney Cricket Ground , who jeered " Crock ! Crock ! Crock ! " , regarding the umpire — not the bowler 's arm — as being crooked . Marsh went on to take 2 / 68 . At one point Marsh lost his temper and deliberately threw three consecutive balls . Despite the repeated calls , the captain Syd Gregory kept Marsh bowling from Crockett 's end — who was suspected of being biased towards his own state — rather than allowing Marsh to be examined by Crockett 's partner . 
 = = Reaction to Crockett = = 
 Crockett 's calls provoked a varied response from the media , which often ran counter to their state allegiances . The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh 's deliberate throws raised " uncertainty " , while the Australasian 's cricket writer Tom Horan — a Victorian who went by the pen name Felix — felt that Marsh was a soft target for Crockett , whom he regarded as a suspicious character . Curran 's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett 's position away from his parochial state base . The Victorian umpire was regarded as a tough @-@ minded umpire , much like Jim Phillips , who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket . Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not . When Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match , his action was deemed by Crockett 's umpiring partner Sammy Jones to be fair . By this time , Marsh 's confidence was low . He took his worst ever first @-@ class figures of 1 / 105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket . His only wicket was Test player Charlie McLeod , bowled for six . 
 Whimpress tabled various hypotheses for Crockett 's actions . At the time , Crockett was 37 years old and was ready to emerge from the shadow of Phillips , the eminent Australian umpire of the time . When Crockett called Marsh , it was his 29th match as a first @-@ class umpire and the no @-@ balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches . A cynical view of Crockett 's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target . This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian , his state of origin . The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called , and likely not a high profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders . Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh — an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17 @.@ 38 — was an ideal target . 
 At the time , the alteration to the no @-@ ball law made by the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) in 1899 was yet to be implemented in Australian first @-@ class cricket . This change allowed the umpire to call a throw from either end , whereas the law previously barred the umpire at square leg from doing so . The non @-@ implementation of the law diluted the power of Australian umpires , since the bowler could be switched to the other end and made immune from being called by the first umpire . As a result , Gregory 's unwillingness to switch Marsh to the opposite end surprised cricket observers . Australian administrators had been under pressure from England to crack down on dubious bowling actions . English captain Archie MacLaren had asserted that " If Australia expects an English team next September they will have to play according to the new reading of the law at home " . It was speculated that because Crockett was a lifelong employee of the Melbourne Cricket Club , which organised and sponsored English tours to Australia , he was under pressure to no @-@ ball bowlers in order to curry favour with English administrators . 
 = = Incidents against England = = 
 The controversy over Marsh 's bowling action again reared its head during the 1901 – 02 season , when MacLaren led his English tourists to Australia . The English played in a match at Bathurst where Marsh was selected , but MacLaren refused to play against him . Noble , who selected the New South Wales teams , used the complaints about Marsh to ignore growing calls to have the bowler selected for New South Wales and Australia . Without state backing , the remainder of Australia 's selectors were happy to rely on Noble 's state @-@ level veto to ignore Marsh . Marsh 's only first @-@ class match of the season was against Queensland in Brisbane . At the time , Queensland was not yet in the Sheffield Shield , so it was a one @-@ off match . The match was the subject of much media attention because it was the first time that two aborigines had played in opposing teams at first @-@ class level . Queensland 's Indigenous player was Alec Henry , another fast bowler who had been accused of throwing . The New South Wales team travelled north to the match by train , making a stop at Ipswich . As part of the media promotion of the match @-@ up between the pair , Henry was taken to Ipswich station to meet Marsh . Marsh was reported in the media as having said " Say old man , toss me up a soft one so I can get a smack at you " . Marsh took 2 / 64 and 3 / 67 in a drawn match , and bowled three of his victims , who were unable to cope with his pace . Marsh and Henry dismissed one another , each being bowled for nine to create a symmetry in the scorecard . 
 Marsh was again overlooked for selection during the 1902 – 03 Sheffield Shield season . He played his only first @-@ class match of the season against Queensland , in another one @-@ off match . In the last first @-@ class fixture of his career , Marsh scored his highest first @-@ class score of nine not out as New South Wales were bowled out for 191 . He then took 2 / 39 in the first innings as New South Wales took a 60 @-@ run first innings lead . He finished his career with 3 / 23 in the second innings , including a final burst of 3 / 0 , to help his team to a victory . Later in the season , Marsh played in a match for New South Wales against Australia , which was not first @-@ class . He took the wicket of Clem Hill as the match ended in a draw . 
 Marsh was never selected again , although he continued to dominate grade cricket . He was the leading wicket @-@ taker for three consecutive seasons from 1901 – 02 to 1903 – 04 , taking a total of 158 wickets at an average of 10 @.@ 94 . 
 Two years later against Plum Warner 's MCC team , there were further calls for Marsh to be selected for the Test team as Australia fell 1 – 2 behind in the Ashes . Marsh had taken 5 / 55 against the Englishmen in a match at Bathurst , delivering a mixture of fast bowling and off spin . His victims included George Hirst and Warner himself . No formal complaint about Marsh 's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows . The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh 's bowling was unfair , with Warner describing him as a " <unk> " , a 19th @-@ century term for a thrower . Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action . Despite this , the English players described him as the best bowler that they had faced on the tour . Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no @-@ ball Marsh out of the match if the Australian Test selectors picked the bowler . As a result , Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first @-@ class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 47 . The Australian Test batsman and captain Warren Bardsley rated Marsh alongside Fred Spofforth and England 's Sydney Barnes . The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed ; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20 , with 189 wickets at an average of just 16 @.@ 43 . Bardsley said that the only reason that Marsh was " kept ... out of big cricket was his color " . Jack Pollard said that Marsh " was clearly the best Australian bowler of his time but unfortunately that was a period when the White Australia policy prevailed . Marsh 's name was scratched from the list of players ... by an official who was simply carrying out the racist customs of the day . " 
 Popular with teammates and known for his sportsmanship , Marsh was regarded as an average fielder and had minimal batting skill , with a batting average of 5 @.@ 00 . He played out his days in the Sydney competition and topped the bowling aggregates from 1901 to 1904 . Les <unk> described Marsh as " a well set @-@ up , perfectly built ... man , with an ebony @-@ black , smooth , clear shining skin and twinkling black eyes " who " is quite good looking " . Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5 ft 7 ins ( 170 cm ) tall . In later years , Marsh experimented with the googly . Photographs of Marsh often show him fashionably dressed in a suit and sporting a moustache . 
 = = Later years = = 
 When Marsh 's cricket career ended in 1905 , he resumed professional sprinting ; in 1906 , he ran against Arthur Postle at a meeting organised by John Wren in Melbourne . The race was organised to give Postle , then Australia 's fastest man , a chance to break the 100 @-@ yard world record . In front of 12 @,@ 000 spectators on a wet track , Marsh starting from a two @-@ yard start maintained an early lead until Postle caught him on the line . Postle was declared the winner with a 10 @-@ second time , but some observers claimed that it was a dead heat . He retired from competitive sport after the race . 
 Marsh joined Alexander 's Hippodrome Company , travelling around Australia in a sideshow , where his cricketing fame brought much attention . His activities thereafter are unclear , but it is likely that he became an itinerant worker . In retirement , Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909 , something he blamed on alcohol . 
 Marsh died after an assault caused by an argument outside the pool room of the Royal Hotel in Orange , New South Wales . Two people were charged with manslaughter , but they were acquitted . Marsh was buried in an unmarked grave . The Bulletin wrote in Marsh 's obituary that he was " a darkly troubled man with manners which white brothers found impossible to put up with " .

The circumorbital ring consists of 10 – 16 scales . Across the top of the head , there are 7 – 11 <unk> scales . 3 – 4 scales separate the <unk> and the supralabials . There are 12 – 17 supralabials and 13 – 17 sublabials . The first 3 – 4 sublabials contact the chin shields , of which there is only one pair . Often , there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional . 
 Midbody there are 29 – 41 rows of dorsal scales . These are strongly keeled except for the outermost rows . The ventral scale count is 123 – 147 , the subcaudals 14 – 38 . Females have no more than 24 subcaudals . The anal scale is single . 
 The color pattern varies geographically . The head has two well @-@ marked dark bands : one on the crown and the other between the eyes . On the sides of the head , there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials . Below , the head is yellowish white with scattered dark blotches . Iris color ranges from gold to silver @-@ gray . Dorsally , the ground @-@ color varies from straw yellow , to light brown , to orange or reddish brown . This is overlaid with a pattern of 18 – 22 <unk> @-@ directed , dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail . Usually these bands are roughly chevron @-@ shaped , but may be more U @-@ shaped in some areas . They also form 2 – 6 light and dark cross @-@ bands on the tail . Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black , often obscuring other coloration , giving the animal a dusty @-@ brown or blackish appearance . The belly is yellow or white , with a few scattered dark spots . Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges . 
 One unusual specimen , described by Branch and Farrell ( 1988 ) , from Summer Pride , East London in South Africa , was striped . The pattern consisted of a narrow ( 1 scale wide ) pale yellowish stripe that ran from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail . 
 Generally , though , these are relatively dull @-@ looking snakes , except for male specimens from highland east Africa and Cape Province , South Africa , that usually have a striking yellow and black color pattern . 
 = = Geographic range = = 
 This species is probably the most common and widespread snake in Africa . It is found in most of sub @-@ Saharan Africa south to the Cape of Good Hope , including southern Morocco , Mauritania , Senegal , Mali , southern Algeria , Guinea , Sierra Leone , Côte d 'Ivoire , Ghana , Togo , Benin , Niger , Nigeria , Chad , Sudan , Cameroon , Central African Republic , northern , eastern and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo , Uganda , Kenya , Somalia , Rwanda , Burundi , Tanzania , Angola , Zambia , Malawi , Mozambique , Zimbabwe , Botswana , Namibia and South Africa . It also occurs on the Arabian peninsula , where it is found in southwestern Saudi Arabia and Yemen . 
 The type locality given is " <unk> bonae spei " [ Cape of Good Hope , South Africa ] . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 It is found in all habitats except true deserts , rain forests , and ( tropical ) alpine habitats . Most often associated with rocky grasslands . 
 It is not found in rainforest areas , such as along the coast of West Africa and in Central Africa ( i.e. , central DR Congo ) ; it is also absent from the Mediterranean coastal region of North Africa . On the Arabian peninsula , it is found as far north as Ta 'if . It has been reported to be found in the Dhofar region of southern Oman . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Normally a sluggish species , it relies on camouflage for protection . Locomotion is primarily rectilinear , using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by its own weight for traction . When agitated , it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed . Although mainly terrestrial , these snakes are good swimmers and can also climb with ease ; often they are found basking in low bushes . One specimen was found 4 @.@ 6 m above the ground in a densely branched tree . 
 If disturbed , they will hiss loudly and continuously , adopting a tightly coiled defensive posture with the fore part of their body held in a taut " S " shape . At the same time , they may attempt to back away from the threat towards cover . They may strike suddenly and at a high speed , to the side as easily as forwards , before returning quickly to the defensive position , ready to strike again . During a strike , the force of the impact is so strong , and the long fangs penetrate so deeply , that prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone . The fangs are apparently able to penetrate soft leather . 
 They can strike to a distance of about one third of their body length , but juveniles will launch their entire bodies forwards in the process . These snakes rarely grip their victims , instead releasing quickly to return to the striking position . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 Mostly nocturnal , they rarely forage actively , preferring instead to ambush prey as it happens by . Their prey includes mammals , birds , amphibians , and lizards . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Females produce a pheromone to attract males , which engage in neck @-@ wrestling combat dances . A female in Malindi was followed by seven males . They give birth to large numbers of offspring : litters of over 80 have been reported , while 50 – 60 is not unusual . Newborns are 12 @.@ 5 – 17 @.@ 5 cm in length . Very large specimens , particularly those from East Africa , give birth to the highest numbers of offspring . A Kenyan female in a Czech zoo gave birth to 156 young , the largest litter for any species of snake . 
 = = Captivity = = 
 These snakes do well in captivity , but there are reports of gluttony . <unk> ( 1969 ) mentions that specimens can be maintained for years on only one mouse a week , but that when offered all they can eat , the result is often death , or at best wholesale regurgitation . They are bad @-@ tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity , always hissing and puffing when approached . 
 = = Venom = = 
 This species is responsible for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake . This is due to a combination of factors , including its wide distribution , common occurrence , large size , potent venom that is produced in large amounts , long fangs , their habit of basking by footpaths and sitting quietly when approached . 
 The venom has cytotoxic effects and is one of the most toxic of any vipers based on LD50 . The LD50 values in mice vary : 0 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 mg / kg IV , 0 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 7 mg / kg IP , 4 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 7 mg / kg SC . Mallow et al . ( 2003 ) give an LD50 range of 1 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 75 mg / kg SC . Venom yield is typically between 150 – 350 mg , with a maximum of 750 mg . Brown ( 1973 ) mentions a venom yield of 180 – 750 mg . About 100 mg is thought to be enough to kill a healthy adult human male , with death occurring after 25 hours . 
 In humans , bites from this species can produce severe local and systemic symptoms . Based on the degree and type of local effect , bites can be divided into two symptomatic categories : those with little or no surface <unk> , and those with hemorrhages evident as <unk> , bleeding and swelling . In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness , but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome . Serious bites cause limbs to become <unk> flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles . Residual <unk> , however , is rare and usually these areas completely resolve . 
 Other bite symptoms that may occur in humans include edema , which may become extensive , shock , watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds , nausea and vomiting , subcutaneous bruising , blood blisters that may form rapidly , and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes . Swelling usually decreases after a few days , except for the area immediately around the bite site . Hypotension , together with weakness , dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported . 
 If not treated carefully , necrosis will spread , causing skin , subcutaneous tissue and muscle to separate from healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate . The slough may be superficial or deep , sometimes down to the bone . Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs . 
 The fatality rate highly depends on the severity of the bites and some other factors . Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15 % of all untreated cases ( usually in 2 – 4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ) , although some reports show that severe envenomations have a 52 % mortality rate . Most fatalities are associated with poor clinical management and neglect .

 = The Boat Race 1894 = 
 The 51st Boat Race took place on 22 March 1894 . The Boat Race is an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford went into the race leading by 27 – 22 in the event and of the eighteen participants , half had previous Boat Race experience . Umpired by former rower Frank Willan , Oxford won the race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 21 minutes 39 seconds , for their fifth consecutive victory in the event . It was the largest margin of victory since the 1883 race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the boat clubs of University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities , as of 2014 it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in the previous year 's race , and held the overall lead , with 27 victories to Cambridge 's 22 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford were coached by William Fletcher ( who rowed for Oxford in the 1890 , 1891 , 1892 and 1893 races ) , R. C. Lehmann ( former president of the Cambridge Union Society and captain of the 1st Trinity Boat Club ; although he had rowed in the trials eights for Cambridge , he was never selected for the Blue boat ) and Douglas McLean ( an Oxford Blue five times between 1883 and 1887 ) . Cambridge 's coach was Charles William Moore ( who represented Cambridge in the 1881 , 1882 , 1883 and 1884 races ) . 
 The umpire for the race for the sixth year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 3 lb ( 77 @.@ 3 kg ) , 7 pounds ( 3 @.@ 2 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge 's crew contained four rowers who had previously participated in the Boat Race , including Lionel Arthur Edward Ollivant , Charles Thurstan Fogg @-@ <unk> , Robert Orme <unk> and Trevor Gwyn Elliot Lewis . Oxford saw five member 's of the previous year 's crew return , including Charles Murray Pitman and Hugh Benjamin Cotton who were rowing in their third consecutive Boat Race . The Dark Blues also saw the introduction of William Burton Stewart , a rugby union Blue who Drinkwater described as " a useful heavy @-@ weight " who had rowed for Brasenose and Leander Club at the Henley Royal Regatta . Eleven of the sixteen rowers were educated at Eton College . All of the competitors in the race were registered as British . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . The umpire was accompanied on his launch by the Duke of York ( later to become King George V ) . Despite a poor tide , weather conditions were good and the race commenced at 9 : 12 a.m. Rating 41 strokes per minute , Cambridge took a brief early lead but were soon overhauled by Oxford who led by half a length by the Mile Post . 
 Taking advantage of the bend in the river , the Dark Blues continued to pull away and were clear of Cambridge by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge . At The Doves pub , Oxford were more than a length clear , and had extended that to three lengths clear by Chiswick and five by Barnes Bridge . <unk> down to a paddle , Oxford passed the finishing post with a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half length advantage , in a winning time of 21 minutes 39 seconds . It was Oxford 's fifth consecutive win , was their largest margin of victory since the 1883 race , and took the overall record in the event to 28 – 22 in their favour . 
 = Forskningsparken ( station ) = 
 Forskningsparken is a rapid transit station on the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro . It also serves as a light rail station for the Ullevål Hageby Line of the Oslo Tramway . It is located at the north of the Blindern campus of the University of Oslo in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo , Norway . The decision to build the station was made in 1998 , and it opened in 1999 , replacing the former station Vestgrensa , and allowed interchange between the metro and the tramway . The Ullevål Hageby Line was at the same time extended to serve the new Rikshospitalet . Forskningsparken is served by lines 3 , 4 and 6 of the metro , each operating every 15 minutes and providing services along both the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line . Lines 17 and 18 of the tramway serve Forskningsparken , operating to Rikshospitalet and the city center . 
 = = History = = 
 Vestgrensa had served the area now served by <unk> since the opening of the Sognsvann Line on 10 October 1934 . In 1991 , the Norwegian Parliament decided to build a new facility for Rikshospitalet at Gaustad , and to serve the hospital by an extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line . Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line of the rapid transit is located within a few hundred meters of the hospital . Vestgrensa was deemed too far away by planners , and a transfer station would need to be established between the light rail and the Sognsvann Line . At first , Blindern was considered , but instead it was later decided that there should be an all @-@ new station . 
 By 1994 , the tram route to the new hospital appeared to have political support , but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital . There also arose a disagreement between the city and the state as to who should be paying for the light rail line , should it should be built . Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start . The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999 , and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August . With the opening , line 4 was extended from Blindern , via <unk> , to Ullevål stadion . There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise , and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built . On 20 August 2003 , the Ring Line of the metro opened , and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The station is named after the Oslo Innovation Center ( Norwegian : Forskningsparken ) . It serves the northern side of the University of Oslo campus at Blindern . The campus is also served by the light rail station <unk> Blindern and the rapid transit station Blindern . To the north of the station is Rikshospitalet . The light rail offers transfer service to the hospital , but it is still within walking distance from Forskningsparken . The rapid transit line runs on an elevated section . The light rail station is located directly below the station , on <unk> . Designed by the architect firm Arkitektskap , both stations are open to the air and have sheds in both directions .

 The rapid transit station is served by lines 3 , 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro . Each line has a 15 @-@ minute headway during the day , with reduced frequency in the late evenings . Heading north , line 3 serves the Sognsvann Line , that includes many student housing areas . Line 4 and 5 serve the Ring Line , with line 4 making a full loop . All three lines head south into the Common Tunnel that serves the city center . Travel time to Stortinget is 8 minutes , while it is 5 minutes to Nydalen and 9 minutes to Sognsvann . Forskningsparken is 4 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 9 mi ) from Stortinget . The metro is operated by Oslo T @-@ banedrift on contract with Ruter . 
 The light rail station is served by lines 17 and 18 of the Oslo Tramway . Each line has a ten @-@ minute headway during the day , with half the frequency during evenings and in the weekends . Travel time to Rikshospitalet is 2 minutes , while it is 14 minutes to Stortorvet . The service is provided using SL95 trams operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter . Forskningsparken is one of eight transfer points between the tramway and rapid transit systems . 
 = Entertainment = 
 Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience , or gives pleasure and delight . It can be an idea or a task , but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience 's attention . Although people 's attention is held by different things , because individuals have different preferences in entertainment , most forms are recognisable and familiar . Storytelling , music , drama , dance , and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures , were supported in royal courts , developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens . The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products . Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale , ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre @-@ recorded products ; to a banquet adapted for two ; to any size or type of party , with appropriate music and dance ; to performances intended for thousands ; and even for a global audience . 
 The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement , so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter , although many entertainments have a serious purpose . This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony , celebration , religious festival , or satire for example . Hence , there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth . 
 An important aspect of entertainment is the audience , which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment . The audience may have a passive role , as in the case of persons watching a play , opera , television show , or film ; or the audience role may be active , as in the case of games , where the participant / audience roles may be routinely reversed . Entertainment can be public or private , involving formal , scripted performance , as in the case of theatre or concerts ; or unscripted and spontaneous , as in the case of children 's games . Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries , evolving due to changes in culture , technology , and fashion . Films and video games , for example , although they use newer media , continue to tell stories , present drama , and play music . Festivals devoted to music , film , or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days . 
 Some activities that once were considered entertaining , particularly public punishments , have been removed from the public arena . Others , such as fencing or archery , once necessary skills for some , have become serious sports and even professions for the participants , at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences . In the same way , other necessary skills , such as cooking , have developed into performances among professionals , staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment . What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another . 
 The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix . This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes , images , and structures . 
 = = Psychology and philosophy = = 
 Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as education and marketing even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals . The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as <unk> . 
 Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is " the attainment of gratification " . No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it ( except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment ) . This is in contrast to education ( which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn ) and marketing ( which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products ) . However , the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more " entertaining " and entertainment or marketing seek to be more " educational " . Such mixtures are often known by the neologisms " edutainment " or " infotainment " . The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields . Some education @-@ entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two . Some people are entertained by others ' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ( schadenfreude ) . 
 An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience when it skilfully considers universal philosophical questions such as : " What is the meaning of life ? " ; " What does it mean to be human ? " ; " What is the right thing to do ? " ; or " How do I know what I know ? " . Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas , whether they are presented in the form of a story , film , play , poem , book , dance , comic , or game . Dramatic examples include Shakespeare 's influential play Hamlet , whose hero articulates these concerns in poetry ; and films , such as The Matrix , which explores the nature of knowledge and was released world @-@ wide . Novels give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers . An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . Originally a radio comedy , this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel , film , television series , stage show , comic , audiobook , LP record , adventure game and online game , its ideas became popular references ( see Phrases from The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ) and has been translated into many languages . Its themes encompass the meaning of life , as well as " the ethics of entertainment , artificial intelligence , multiple worlds , God , and philosophical method " . 
 = = History = = 
 The " ancient craft of communicating events and experiences , using words , images , sounds and gestures " by telling a story is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another , it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times . Stories are still told in the early forms , for example , around a fire while camping , or when listening to the stories of another culture as a tourist . " The earliest storytelling sequences we possess , now of course , committed to writing , were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels . " Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed " toward variety " . Many entertainments , including storytelling but especially music and drama , remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression . Many types are blended or supported by other forms . For example , drama , stories and banqueting ( or dining ) are commonly enhanced by music ; sport and games are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal . Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities ( such as running and jumping ) into competition and then become entertainment . It is said , for example , that pole vaulting " may have originated in the Netherlands , where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge . Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle . " The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated . <unk> poles , for example , were originally made from woods such as ash , hickory or hazel ; in the 19th century bamboo was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of carbon fibre . Other activities , such as walking on stilts , are still seen in circus performances in the 21st century . <unk> combats , also known as " gladiatorial games " , popular during Roman times , provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport , punishment , and entertainment . 
 Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts . Hunting wild animals , for example , was introduced into the Roman Empire from Carthage and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle , supporting an international trade in wild animals . 
 Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions . During the Chinese Cultural Revolution , for example , Revolutionary opera was sanctioned by the Communist party and World War I , the Great Depression and the Russian revolution all had an impact on entertainment . 
 Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period , fashion , culture , technology , and economics . For example , a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open @-@ air theatre , a music hall , a movie theatre , a multiplex , or as technological possibilities advanced , via a personal electronic device such as a tablet computer . Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose @-@ built structures such as a theatre , auditorium , or stadium . One of the most famous venues in the Western world , the Colosseum , " dedicated AD 80 with a hundred days of games , held fifty thousand spectators , " and in it audiences " enjoyed " blood sport with the trappings of stage shows " . Spectacles , competitions , races , and sports were once presented in this purpose @-@ built arena as public entertainment . New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences . 
 = = = Court entertainment = = = 
 Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers , with different cultures using palaces , castles and forts in different ways . In the Maya city states , for example , " spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces ; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance . " Court entertainments also crossed cultures . For example , the durbar was introduced to India by the Mughals , and passed onto the British Empire , which then followed Indian tradition : " institutions , titles , customs , ceremonies by which a Maharaja or Nawab were installed ... the exchange of official presents ... the order of precedence " , for example , were " all inherited from ... the Emperors of Delhi " . In Korea , the " court entertainment dance " was " originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets . " 
 Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among commoners . This was the case with " masked dance @-@ dramas " in Korea , which " originated in conjunction with village shaman rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners " . Nautch dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces . Another evolution , similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice , was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment , such as happened during the Goryeo dynasty with the <unk> festival . Originally " solely religious or ritualistic , a secular component was added at the conclusion " . Former courtly entertainments , such as jousting , often also survived in children 's games . 
 In some courts , such as those during the Byzantine Empire , the genders were segregated among the upper classes , so that " at least before the period of the Komnenoi " ( 1081 – 1185 ) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets . 
 Court ceremonies , palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them , have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power . Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled ; between those with power and those without , serving to " dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler " . This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials , such as the Hong Kong handover ceremony in 1997 , at which an array of entertainments ( including a banquet , a parade , fireworks , a festival performance and an art spectacle ) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power . Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as " for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries " . Royal courts , such as the Korean one , also supported traditional dances . In Sudan , musical instruments such as the so @-@ called " slit " or " talking " drums , once " part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief " , had multiple purposes : they were used to make music ; " speak " at ceremonies ; mark community events ; send long @-@ distance messages ; and call men to hunt or war . 
 Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator : individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience , or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment . In the court at the Palace of Versailles , " thousands of courtiers , including men and women who inhabited its apartments , acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy " . 
 Like court entertainment , royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the aristocracy and the people . For example , the splendid 1595 Accession Day celebrations of Queen Elizabeth I offered tournaments and jousting and other events performed " not only before the assembled court , in all their finery , but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day 's entertainment . Entry for the day 's events at the Tiltyard in Whitehall was set at 12d " . 
 = = = Public punishment = = = 
 Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time , some once @-@ popular forms are no longer as acceptable . For example , during earlier centuries in Europe , watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment . Many forms of public humiliation also offered local entertainment in the past . Even capital punishment such as hanging and beheading , offered to the public as a warning , were also regarded partly as entertainment . Capital punishments that lasted longer , such as stoning and drawing and quartering , afforded a greater public spectacle . " A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable . Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room . " Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time " the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the [ ir ] loathing of writers and philosophers " . Both Dickens and Thackeray wrote about a hanging in Newgate Prison in 1840 , and " taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments " . 
 = = Children = = 
 Children 's entertainment is centred on play and is significant for their growth and learning . Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as puppets , clowns , pantomimes and cartoons are also enjoyed by adults . 
 Children have always played games . It is accepted that as well as being entertaining , playing games helps children 's development . One of the most famous visual accounts of children 's games is a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children 's Games , painted in 1560 . It depicts children playing a range of games which were presumably typical of the time . Many of these games , such as marbles , hide @-@ and @-@ seek , blowing soap bubbles and piggyback riding continue to be played . 
 Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children 's needs and interests . During the 20th century , starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of G. Stanley Hall , who " promoted the link between the study of development and the ' new ' laboratory psychology " , and especially with the work of Jean Piaget , who " saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development " , it became understood that the psychological development of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults . Hence , stories and activities , whether in books , film , or video games were developed specifically for child audiences . Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as television content rating systems , to guide the public and the entertainment industry . 
 In the 21st century , as with adult products , much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use . This constitutes a significant change from earlier times . The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen @-@ based entertainment and the " remarkable collapse of children 's engagement with nature " has drawn criticism for its negative effects on imagination , adult cognition and psychological well @-@ being .

 = = = Banquets = = = 
 Banquets have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times , continuing until the 21st century , when they are still being used for many of their original purposes – to impress visitors , especially important ones ( 4 , 6 , 9 ) ; to show hospitality ( 2 , 4 , 8 ) ; as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing , or both ( 2 , 3 ) . They were an integral part of court entertainments ( 3 , 4 ) and helped entertainers develop their skills ( 2 , 3 ) . They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ( 9 ) , weddings ( 7 ) , birthdays ( 10 ) civic or political achievements ( 5 ) , military engagements or victories ( 6 ) as well as religious obligations ( 1 ) . In modern times , banquets are commercially available , for example , in restaurants ( 10 ) and combined with a performance in dinner theatres . Cooking by professional chefs has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the Bocuse d 'Or .

 Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance . For example , it is used to enhance storytelling , it is indispensable in dance ( 1 , 4 ) and opera , and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions . 
 Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own , constituting an entire performance such as when concerts are given ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Depending on the rhythm , instrument , performance and style , music is divided into many genres , such as classical , jazz , folk , ( 4 , 5 , 8 ) , rock , pop music ( 6 , 9 ) or traditional ( 1 , 3 ) . Since the 20th century , performed music , once available only to those who could pay for the performers , has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry which broadcasts it or pre @-@ records it for sale . 
 The wide variety of musical performances , whether or not they are artificially amplified ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ) , all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists ( 6 ) , choral ( 2 ) or orchestral groups ( 5 , 8 ) , or ensemble ( 3 ) . Live performances use specialised venues , which might be small or large ; indoors or outdoors ; free or expensive . The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance . For example , some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music , its rendition or its interpretation ( 5 , 8 ) . Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ( 7 , 9 ) . Even more listeners are entertained by pre @-@ recorded music and listen privately ( 10 ) . 
 The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the human voice ( 2 , 6 ) or solely instrumental ( 1 , 3 ) or some combination of the two ( 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) . Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists , the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group , in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ( 10 ) , passing by ( 3 ) , small ( 1 , 2 ) or large ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms , notably a cappella and overtone singing , are unaccompanied . Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ( 7 ) . 
 = = = Games = = = 
 Games are played for entertainment — sometimes purely for entertainment , sometimes for achievement or reward as well . They can be played alone , in teams , or online ; by amateurs or by professionals . The players may have an audience of non @-@ players , such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship . On the other hand , players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play . Often , part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who will be part of their audience and who will be a player . 
 Equipment varies with the game . Board games , such as Go , Monopoly or backgammon need a board and markers . One of the oldest known board games is Senet , a game played in Ancient Egypt , enjoyed by the pharaoh Tutankhamun . Card games , such as whist , poker and Bridge have long been played as evening entertainment among friends . For these games , all that is needed is a deck of playing cards . Other games , such as bingo , played with numerous strangers , have been organised to involve the participation of non @-@ players via gambling . Many are geared for children , and can be played outdoors , including hopscotch , hide and seek , or Blind man 's bluff . The list of ball games is quite extensive . It includes , for example , croquet , lawn bowling and paintball as well as many sports using various forms of balls . The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels . Physical games can develop agility and competence in motor skills . Number games such as Sudoku and puzzle games like the Rubik 's cube can develop mental prowess . 
 Video games are played using a controller to create results on a screen . They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely . In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously , providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world . Video games are popular in East Asian countries such as South Korea . 
 = = = Reading = = = 
 Reading has been a source of entertainment for a very long time , especially when other forms , such as performance entertainments , were ( or are ) either unavailable or too costly . Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct , reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries . Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of orality and oral traditions survive in the form of performance poetry for example . However , they have drastically declined . " Once literacy had arrived in strength , there was no return to the oral prerogative . " The advent of printing , the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading . Furthermore , as fonts were standardised and texts became clearer , " reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure " . By the 16th century in Europe , the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established . 
 Among literature 's many genres are some designed , in whole or in part , purely for entertainment . <unk> , for example , use verse in a strict , predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers . Interactive books such as " choose your own adventure " can make literary entertainment more participatory . 
 Comics and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics , usually in combination with text , to convey an entertaining narrative . Many contemporary comics have elements of fantasy and are produced by companies that are part of the entertainment industry . Others have unique authors who offer a more personal , philosophical view of the world and the problems people face . Comics about superheroes such as Superman are of the first type . Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years of Charles M. Schulz who produced a popular comic called Peanuts about the relationships among a cast of child characters ; and Michael <unk> who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate social criticism . The Japanese Manga style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages . Caricature uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer 's face , to raising social awareness , to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured . 
 = = = Comedy = = = 
 Comedy is both a genre of entertainment and a component of it , providing laughter and amusement , whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece . It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment , including in literature , theatre , opera , film and games . In royal courts , such as for example , in the Byzantine court , and presumably , also in its wealthy households , " mimes were the focus of orchestrated humour , expected or obliged to make fun of all at court , not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family . This highly structured role of jester consisted of verbal humour , including teasing , jests , insult , ridicule , and obscenity and non @-@ verbal humour such as slapstick and horseplay in the presence of an audience . " In medieval times , all comic types – the buffoon , jester , hunchback , dwarf , <unk> , were all " considered to be essentially of one comic type : the fool " , who while not necessarily funny , represented " the shortcomings of the individual " . 
 Shakespeare wrote seventeen comedies which use many of the techniques still called upon by performers and writers of comedy , such as jokes , puns , parody , wit , observational humor or the unexpected effect of irony . One @-@ liner jokes and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature . In farce , the comedy is a primary purpose . 
 The meaning of the word " comedy " and the audience 's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture . Simple physical comedy such as slapstick is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages . However , as cultures become more sophisticated , national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another . 
 = = = Performance = = = 
 Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment , especially before the invention of audio and video recording . Performance takes a wide range of forms , including theatre , music and drama . In the 16th and 17th centuries , European royal courts presented masques that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing , singing and acting . Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular . It also encompass all three forms , demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill , collaboration and like the masque , production expertise as well . 
 Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause . However , all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience 's attention and thus , failing to entertain . Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct . 
 " Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or , or giving a good recitation ... helps to arrest the company 's attention ... Such at least was the case with me – the publican devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly , and the plan was , he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me , which , of course , the waiter did ... and I received the wet towel , full force , in the face , which staggered me ... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house . " William McGonagall ( Performance artist and poet ) 
 = = = = Storytelling = = = = 
 Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms . It is " not only entertainment , it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions " . Hence , although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience , they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative , such as film , drama , ballet , and opera . Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations , often to a very high artistic standard , for example , on illuminated manuscripts and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones . Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey . Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers , Chaucer used pilgrims in his literary work The Canterbury Tales in the 14th century , as did Wu Cheng 'en in the 16th century in Journey to the West . Even though journeys can now be completed much faster , stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology . 
 The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones — Scheherazade — a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition , of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories . The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium , such as music , film or games . For example , composers Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work ; director Pasolini made a film adaptation ; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale . Stories may be told wordlessly , in music , dance or puppetry for example , such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang , in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show . 
 Epic narratives , poems , sagas and allegories from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment . Examples include the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata ; Homer 's Odyssey and Iliad ; the first Arabic novel <unk> ibn <unk> ; the Persian epic Shahnameh ; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated Tale of the Genji . Collections of stories , such as Grimms ' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen , have been similarly influential . Originally published in the early 19th century , this collection of folk stories had significant influence in modern popular culture which subsequently used its themes , images , symbols and structural elements to create new forms of entertainment . 
 Some of the most powerful and long @-@ lasting stories are the foundation stories , also called origin or creation myths such as the Dreamtime myths of the Australian aborigines , the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh , or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world . These too are developed into books , films , music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value . 
 = = = = Theatre = = = = 
 Theatre performances , typically dramatic or musical , are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to Hellenistic times when " leading musicians and actors " performed widely at " poetical competitions " , for example at " Delphi , Delos , Ephesus " . Aristotle and his teacher Plato both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre . Aristotle posed questions such as " What is the function of the arts in shaping character ? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform ? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite ? " The " <unk> in Egypt , the Seleucids in Pergamum " also had a strong theatrical tradition and later , wealthy patrons in Rome staged " far more lavish productions " . 
 Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed over time ( 1 ) . For example , in England during the 18th century , " the prejudice against actresses had faded " and in Europe generally , going to the theatre , once a socially dubious activity , became " a more respectable middle @-@ class pastime " in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the variety of popular entertainments increased . Operetta and music halls became available , and new drama theatres such as the Moscow Art Theatre and the Suvorin Theatre in Russia opened . At the same time , commercial newspapers " began to carry theatre columns and reviews " which helped to make theatre " a legitimate subject of intellectual debate " in general discussions about art and culture . Audiences began to gather to " appreciate creative achievement , to marvel at , and be entertained by , the prominent ' stars ' . " Vaudeville and music halls , popular at this time in the United States , England , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , were themselves eventually superseded . 
 Plays , musicals , monologues , pantomimes , and performance poetry are part of the very long history of theatre which is also the venue for the type of performance known as stand @-@ up comedy . In the 20th century , radio and television , often broadcast live , extended the theatrical tradition that continued to exist alongside the new forms . 
 The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre . All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience , including the impromptu or improvised ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) ; the temporary ( 2 ) ; the elaborate ( 9 ) ; or the traditional and permanent ( 5 , 7 ) . They are erected indoors ( 3 , 5 , 9 ) or outdoors ( 2 , 4 , 6 ) . The skill of managing , organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft ( 10 ) . The audience 's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations , the stagecraft , the type of stage , and the type and standard of seating provided . 
 = = = = Cinema and film = = = = 
 Films are a major form of entertainment , although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose : documentary film , for example , aims to create a record or inform , although the two purposes often work together . The medium was a global business from the beginning : " The Lumière brothers were the first to send cameramen throughout the world , instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public . " In 1908 , Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I , films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment . " In the first decade of the [ 20th ] century cinematic programmes combined , at random , fictions and <unk> . " The Americans first " contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images , " but " the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle " . Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days . Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences . Animation , for example , which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work , is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences . The advent of computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) in the 21st century made it " possible to do spectacle " more cheaply and " on a scale never dreamed of " by Cecil B. DeMille . From the 1930s to 1950s , movies and radio were the " only mass entertainment " but by the second decade of the 21st century , technological changes , economic decisions , risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced . Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques , for example , rather than humans , were used not only to create realistic images of people , landscapes and events ( both real and fantastic ) but also to animate non @-@ living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form . Creators of The Lego Movie " wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera , not what we actually did , which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer . " The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre , recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre . This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries . 
 Films also re @-@ imagine entertainment from other forms , turning stories , books and plays , for example , into new entertainments . The Story of Film , a documentary about the history of film , gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium , as well as changes in the conception of film @-@ making . It demonstrates that while some films , particularly those in the Hollywood tradition that combines " realism and melodramatic romanticism " , are intended as a form of escapism , others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences . For example , the award winning Senegalese film <unk> takes government corruption as its theme . Charlie Chaplin 's film The Great Dictator was a brave and innovative parody , also on a political theme . Stories that are thousands of years old , such as Noah , have been re @-@ interpreted in film , applying familiar literary devices such as allegory and personification with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as " human folly " , good and evil , courage and despair , love , faith , and death – themes which have been a main @-@ stay of entertainment across all its forms . 
 As in other media , excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards , including ones from the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , the British Academy of Film and Television Arts , the Cannes International Film Festival in France and the Asia Pacific Screen Awards . 
 = = = = Dance = = = = 
 The many forms of dance provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures . Dance can be serious in tone , such as when it is used to express a culture 's history or important stories ; it may be provocative ; or it may put in the service of comedy . Since it combines many forms of entertainment – music , movement , storytelling , theatre – it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences . 
 Dance is " a form of cultural representation " that involves not just dancers , but " choreographers , audience members , patrons and impresarios ... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods . " Whether from Africa , Asia or Europe , dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political , social , spiritual and artistic influence . " Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group , they all develop . For example , in Africa , there are " Dahomean dances , Hausa dances , Masai dances and so forth . " Ballet is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of Louis XIV , the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers . Some dances , such as the quadrille , a square dance that " emerged during the Napoleonic years in France " and other country dances were once popular at social gatherings like balls , but are now rarely performed . On the other hand , many folk dances ( such as Scottish Highland dancing and Irish dancing ) , have evolved into competitions , which by adding to their audiences , has increased their entertainment value . " Irish dance theatre , which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music , has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation . " 
 Since dance is often " associated with the female body and women 's experiences " , female dancers , who dance to entertain , have in some cases been regarded as distinct from " decent " women because they " use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible " . Society 's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture , its history and the entertainment industry itself . For example , while some cultures regard any dancing by women as " the most shameful form of entertainment " , other cultures have established venues such as strip clubs where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as striptease are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences . 
 Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing , sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it . Nationalism , authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing . For example , during the Nazi regime , American dances such as swing , regarded as " completely un @-@ German " , had " become a public offense and needed to be banned " . Similarly , in Shanghai , China , in the 1930s , " dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society " and officials wondered if " other forms of entertainment such as brothels " should also be banned . Banning had the effect of making " the dance craze " even greater . In Ireland , the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 " banned – but did not stop – dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and barn dances . " In the US , various dances have been banned , either because like burlesque , they were suggestive , or because , like the Twist , they were associated with African Americans . " African American dancers were typically banned from performing in minstrel shows until after the Civil War . " 
 Dances can be performed solo ( 1 , 4 ) ; in pairs , ( 2 , 3 ) ; in groups , ( 5 , 6 , 7 ) ; or by massed performers ( 10 ) . They might be improvised ( 4 , 8 ) or highly choreographed ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 ) ; spontaneous for personal entertainment , ( such as when children begin dancing for themselves ) ; a private audience , ( 4 ) ; a paying audience ( 2 ) ; a world audience ( 10 ) ; or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ( 3 , 5 ) . They might be a part of a celebration , such as a wedding or New Year ( 6 , 8 ) ; or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose , such as a dance by warriors like a haka ( 7 ) . Some dances , such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2 , need a very high level of skill and training ; others , such as the can @-@ can , require a very high level of energy and physical fitness . Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ( 9 ) . 
 = = = = Animals = = = = 
 Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia . They have been hunted for entertainment ( as opposed to hunted for food ) ; displayed while they hunt for prey ; watched when they compete with each other ; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement . The Romans , for example , were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals . They watched as " lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and cymbals ; horses were trained to kneel , bow , dance and prance ... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards . " There were " violent confrontations with wild beasts " and " performances over time became more brutal and bloodier " . 
 Animals that perform trained routines or " acts " for human entertainment include fleas in flea circuses , dolphins in <unk> , and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a street organ . Animals kept in zoos in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica . 
 Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports – for example , horse racing is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment . Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry , one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races . In Australia , the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event . Like horse racing , camel racing requires human riders , while greyhound racing does not . People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively , whether they are trained , like horses , camels or dogs , or untrained , like cockroaches . 
 The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial , especially the hunting of wild animals . Some contests between animals , once popular entertainment for the public , have become illegal because of the cruelty involved . Among these are blood sports such as bear @-@ baiting , dog fighting and cockfighting . Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors . For example , the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as " a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship , and proponents , who view it as entertainment " has been tested in a court of law . Fox hunting , which involves the use of horses as well as hounds , and bullfighting , which has a strong theatrical component , are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history . They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport , entertainment or cultural tradition . Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment . However , " in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse , both sides have cultural claims . " 
 = = = = Circus = = = = 
 A circus , described as " one of the most brazen of entertainment forms " , is a special type of theatrical performance , involving a variety of physical skills such as acrobatics and juggling and sometimes performing animals . Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a big top , circus was first performed in permanent venues . Philip Astley is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and Jules <unk> is the French performer credited with developing the art of the trapeze , considered synonymous with circuses . Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs " at least since the beginning of the 17th century " : " tumbling , rope @-@ dancing , juggling , animal tricks and so on " . It has been claimed that " there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times . ... Between the demise of the Roman ' circus ' and the foundation of Astley 's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later , the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a village green . " 
 = = = = Magic = = = = 
 The form of entertainment known as stage magic or conjuring and recognisable as performance , is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times . ( References to magic , for example , can be found in the Bible , in Hermeticism , in Zoroastrianism , in the Kabbalistic tradition , in mysticism and in the sources of Freemasonry . ) 
 Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations : on stage , on television , in the street , and live at parties or events . It is often combined with other forms of entertainment , such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances . Performance magic relies on deception , psychological manipulation , sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible . Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini , for example , regarded him as a magician . 
 Fantasy magicians have held an important place in literature for centuries , offering entertainment to millions of readers . Famous wizards such as Merlin in the Arthurian legends have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries , while in the 21st century , the young wizard Harry Potter became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies ( as at June 2011 ) , making it the best @-@ selling book series in history . 
 = = = = Street performance = = = = 
 Street entertainment , street performance or " busking " are forms of performance that have been meeting the public 's need for entertainment for centuries . It was " an integral aspect of London 's life " , for example , when the city in the early 19th century was " filled with spectacle and diversion " . Minstrels or troubadours are part of the tradition . The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals . 
 There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance . The first form is the " circle show " . It tends to gather a crowd , usually has a distinct beginning and end , and is done in conjunction with street theatre , puppeteering , magicians , comedians , acrobats , jugglers and sometimes musicians . This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act . Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic . The second form , the " walk @-@ by act " , has no distinct beginning or end . Typically , the busker provides an entertaining ambience , often with an unusual instrument , and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd . Sometimes a walk @-@ by act will spontaneously turn into a circle show . The third form , " café busking " , is performed mostly in restaurants , pubs , bars and cafés . This type of act occasionally uses public transport as a venue . 
 = = = = Parades = = = = 
 Parades are held for a range of purposes , often more than one . Whether their mood is sombre or festive , being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic , parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences . <unk> and the modern variant , the motorcade , are examples of public processions . Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend , while others become part of the audience by happenstance . Whatever their mood or primary purpose , parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by . Occasionally , a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space ( such as the Trooping the Colour in 5 ) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast . 
 One of the earliest forms of parade were " triumphs " – grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils , given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories . They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor . " In the summer of 46 B.C.E. Julius Caesar chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month . " In Europe from the Middle Ages to the Baroque the Royal Entry celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets , passing various shows and displays . The annual Lord Mayor 's Show in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times . 
 Many religious festivals ( especially those which incorporate processions , such as Holy Week processions or the Indian festival of Holi ) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose . Sometimes , religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments , or like the Festa del <unk> in Venice , have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance . However , pilgrimages , such as the Christian pilgrimage of the Way of St. James , the Muslim Hajj and the Hindu Kumbh Mela , which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession , are not intended as entertainment : they are instead about an individual 's spiritual journey . Hence , the relationship between spectator and participant , unlike entertainments proper , is different . The manner in which the Kumbh Mela , for example , " is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption – renders the presence of voyeurs deeply problematic . " 
 Parades generally impress and delight ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) , often by including unusual , colourful costumes ( 6 , 7 ) . Sometimes they also commemorate ( 5 , 8 ) or celebrate ( 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) . Sometimes they have a serious purpose , such as when the context is military ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) , when the intention is sometimes to intimidate ; or religious , when the audience might participate or have a role to play ( 6 , 7 , 9 ) . Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ( 10 ) , it is likely to have a strong appeal , draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them . 
 = = = = Fireworks = = = = 
 Fireworks are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a " crowning feature of elaborate celebrations " in the 17th century . First used in China , classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes , fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for <unk> , especially the skilled Italian ones , who were summoned to other countries to organise displays . Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays " inspired by means of fire , sudden noise , smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign : awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might . Birthdays , name @-@ days , weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration . " One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire , the accompanying Music for the Royal Fireworks written by Handel has been popular ever since . Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes , courtly displays and personal celebrations , fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony . For example , during the Indian Dashavatara Kala of <unk> " the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing , dancing and display of fireworks " . 
 The " fire , sudden noise and smoke " of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment . For example , fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the millennium around the world . As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000 , firework displays and open @-@ air parties greeted the New Year as the time zones changed over to the next century . Fireworks , carefully planned and choreographed , were let off against the backdrop of many of the world 's most famous buildings , including the Sydney Harbour Bridge , the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt , the Acropolis in Athens , Red Square in Moscow , Vatican City in Rome , the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin , the Eiffel Tower in Paris , and Elizabeth Tower in London . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Sporting competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds . To distinguish the players from the audience , the latter are often known as spectators . Developments in stadium and auditorium design , as well as in recording and broadcast technology , have allowed off @-@ site spectators to watch sport , with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular . Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket . Their ultimate international competitions , the World Cup and test cricket , are broadcast around the world . Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports , they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non @-@ players worldwide . A comparable multi @-@ stage , long @-@ form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France , unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia , being run instead in the countryside . 
 Aside from sports that have world @-@ wide appeal and competitions , such as the Olympic Games , the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country in which it is played . For example , in the United States , baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment ; in Bhutan , the national sport is archery ; in New Zealand , it is rugby union ; in Iran , it is freestyle wrestling . Japan 's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history . In some cases , such as the international running group Hash House Harriers , participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves , largely independent of spectator involvement , where the social component is more important than the competitive . 
 The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions . For example , the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia . While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world , people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess . Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of ice hockey which is an important entertainment in Canada . 
 = = = Fairs , expositions , shopping = = = 
 Fairs and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times , displaying wealth , innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves . Whether in a medieval market or a small shop , " shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday " . However , in the modern world , " merchandising has become entertainment : spinning signs , flashing signs , thumping music ... video screens , interactive computer kiosks , day care .. cafés " . 
 By the 19th century , " expos " which encourage arts , manufactures and commerce had become truly international and were not only hugely popular but were having an enormous impact on international ideas . For example , the 1878 Paris Exposition facilitated international cooperation about ideas , innovations and standards . From London 1851 to Paris 1900 , " in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London , Paris , Vienna , Philadelphia , Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world . " Since World War II " well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles " . As a form of spectacle and entertainment , expositions influenced " everything from architecture , to patterns of globalisation , to fundamental matters of human identity " and in the process established the close relationship between " fairs , the rise of department stores and art museums " , the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Some entertainments , such as at large festivals ( whether religious or secular ) , concerts , clubs , parties and celebrations , involve big crowds . From earliest times , crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers , especially when combined with the recreational consumption of intoxicants such as alcohol . The Ancient Greeks had Dionysian Mysteries , for example , and the Romans had Saturnalia . The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of social norms of behaviour , sometimes causing injury or even death , such as for example , at the Altamont Free Concert , an outdoor rock festival . The list of serious incidents at nightclubs includes those caused by stampede ; overcrowding ; terrorism , such as the 2002 Bali bombings that targeted a nightclub ; and especially fire . Investigations , such as that carried out in the US after The Station nightclub fire often demonstrate that lessons learned " regarding fire safety in nightclubs " from earlier events such as the Cocoanut Grove fire do " not necessarily result in lasting effective change " . Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers , such as the medieval Lord of Misrule or , in modern times , security officers who control access ; and also ongoing improvement of relevant standards such as those for building safety . The tourism industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task . 
 = = Industry = = 
 Although kings , rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment , people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible , attended a live performance . Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience , packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry . Sometimes referred to as show business , the industry relies on business models to produce , market , broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms , including performances of all types . The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study . 
 The film industry is a part of the entertainment industry . Components of it include the Hollywood and Bollywood film industries , as well as the cinema of the United Kingdom and all the cinemas of Europe , including France , Germany , Spain , Italy and others . The sex industry is another component of the entertainment industry , applying the same forms and media ( for example , film , books , dance and other performances ) to the development , marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis . 
 Amusement parks entertain paying guests with rides , such as roller coasters , train rides , water rides , and dark rides , as well as other events and associated attractions . The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named " lands " . Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme , such as the various SeaWorld parks that focus on the theme of sea life . 
 One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment . While jobs such as writer , musician and composer exist as they always have , people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been . New jobs have appeared , such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry , and attendants in an amusement park . 
 Prestigious awards are given by the industry for excellence in the various types of entertainment . For example , there are awards for Music , Games ( including video games ) , Comics , Comedy , Theatre , Television , Film , Dance and Magic . Sporting awards are made for the results and skill , rather than for the entertainment value . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Architecture for entertainment = = = 
 Purpose @-@ built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings , among the most recognisable of which are theatre structures . For the ancient Greeks , " the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community , made apparent in their monumentality , in the effort put into their design , and in the care put into their detail . " The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a circus . In modern times , some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers . The Sydney Opera House , for example , is a World Heritage Site and The O ₂ in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor arena , a music club , a cinema and exhibition space . The Bayreuth Festspielhaus in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition . 
 Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety . The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk . The Hillsborough disaster is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths . <unk> and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues . 
 In the 21st century , entertainment venues , especially stadia , are " likely to figure among the leading architectural genres " . However , they require " a whole new approach " to design , because they need to be " sophisticated entertainment centres , multi @-@ experience venues , capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways " . Hence , architects now have to design " with two distinct functions in mind , as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences , and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience " . 
 = = = Architecture as entertainment = = = 
 Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding . Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao , designed by Frank Gehry , are of this type , becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum . Other apparently usable buildings are really follies , deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical . 
 On the other hand , sometimes architecture is entertainment , while pretending to be functional . The tourism industry , for example , creates or renovates buildings as " attractions " that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose . They are instead re @-@ purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences . Buildings , history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase . Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that " the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues / theme parks becomes hard to define " . Examples include " the preservation of the Alcázar of Toledo , with its grim Civil War History , the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana , [ such as , for example , Cape Coast Castle ] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya " . The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park 's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional . 
 = = Effects of developments in electronic media = = 
 = = = Globalisation = = = 
 By the second half of the 20th century , developments in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe . The technology enabled people to see , hear and participate in all the familiar forms – stories , theatre , music , dance – wherever they live . The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs , along with increasing miniaturisation . <unk> and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier , faster and global . 
 = = = Obsolescence = = = 
 In the 1940s , radio was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information . In the 1950s , it was television that was the new medium and it rapidly became global , bringing visual entertainment , first in black and white , then in colour , to the world . By the 1970s , games could be played electronically , then hand @-@ held devices provided mobile entertainment , and by the last decade of the 20th century , via networked play . In combination with products from the entertainment industry , all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally . People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music , film or game , they could choose the time and place to use it . The " proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption " together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films . One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods . As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media , over the course of one generation , television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown , to novel , to ubiquitous and finally to superseded . One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console , " about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953 " . It is expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century , television will be completely replaced by online entertainment . The so @-@ called " digital revolution " has resulted in an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments , business , industries and individuals as they all try to keep up . Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly become a competitor with television viewing " in terms of comfort , safety and the constant flow of audio @-@ visual information and entertainment available " . Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes , where television , regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents , will need to be replaced by access to the internet . At the same time , the ongoing need for entertainers as " professional <unk> " shows the continuity of traditional entertainment . 
 = = = Convergence = = = 
 By the second decade of the 21st century , analogue recording was being replaced by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge . For example , convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry : whereas " success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run . Today , ... a series of exhibition ' windows ' , such as DVD , pay @-@ per @-@ view , and fibre @-@ optic video @-@ on @-@ demand are used to maximise profits . " Part of the industry 's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services . Media convergence is said to be more than technological : the convergence is cultural as well . It is also " the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities , policy institutions and other groups " . Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence . Others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and impact on a range of delivery methods . The " greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer , via terrestrial , satellite or cable television , and of course , via the Internet " also affects entertainment venues , such as sports stadia , which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways – for example , audiences can " watch highlights , call up statistics " , " order tickets and merchandise " and generally " tap into the stadium 's resources at any time of the day or night " . 
 The introduction of television altered the availability , cost , variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect . For example , the possibility and popularity of user @-@ generated content , as distinct from commercial product , creates a " networked audience model [ that ] makes programming obsolete " . Individuals and corporations use video hosting services to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment . 
 While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery , the forms that make up the content are in themselves , relatively stable . Storytelling , music , theatre , dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries . 
 = Battle of Rennell Island = 
 The Battle of Rennell Island ( Japanese : <unk> ) took place on 29 – 30 January 1943 . It was the last major naval engagement between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Guadalcanal campaign of World War II . It occurred in the South Pacific between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands . 
 In the battle , Japanese naval land @-@ based torpedo bombers , seeking to provide protection for the impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal , made several attacks over two days on US warships operating as a task force south of this island . In addition to approaching Guadalcanal with the objective of engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range , the U.S. task force was protecting an Allied transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there . 
 As a result of the Japanese air attacks on the task force , one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk , a destroyer was heavily damaged , and the rest of the U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area . Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle , the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943 , leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia , and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 The last major attempt by the Japanese to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and Tulagi was defeated during the decisive Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November 1942 . Thereafter , the Japanese Navy was only able to deliver subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal . Because of the threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal , plus nearby U.S. aircraft carriers , the Japanese delivered these supplies at night , usually by destroyer or submarine , in operations the Allies called the " Tokyo Express . " However , these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island , who by 7 December 1942 , were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition , disease , and Allied ground or air attacks . On 12 December 1942 , the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned . Despite initial opposition from Army leaders , who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies , on 31 December 1942 the Imperial General Headquarters , with approval from the Emperor , agreed to evacuate all Japanese forces from the island and establish a new line of defense for the Solomons on New Georgia . 
 The evacuation was code @-@ named Operation Ke ( ケ号作戦 ) , and was scheduled to begin on 14 January 1943 . An important element in the plan was an air superiority campaign starting 28 January 1943 , to inhibit Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting the final stage of the Ke operation , which was the actual evacuation of all Japanese troops from Guadalcanal . 
 Allied forces misinterpreted the Ke preparations as the beginning of another Japanese offensive to try to retake Guadalcanal . At the same time , Admiral William Halsey , Jr . , the Allied theatre commander , was under pressure from his superiors to complete the replacement of the 2nd Marine Regiment , which had been in combat on Guadalcanal since August , with fresh Army troops . Halsey hoped to take advantage of what he believed was an impending Japanese offensive to draw Japanese naval forces into a battle , while at the same time delivering the replacement Army troops to Guadalcanal . On 29 January 1943 , Halsey sent five task forces toward the southern Solomons area to cover the relief convoy and to engage any Japanese naval forces that came into range . These five task forces included two fleet carriers , two escort carriers , three battleships , 12 cruisers , and 25 destroyers . 
 In front of this array of task forces was Task Group 62 @.@ 8 , the troop convoy of four transports and four destroyers . Ahead of the troop convoy , between Rennell Island and Guadalcanal , was Task Force 18 ( TF 18 ) Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen , a close support group of heavy cruisers USS Wichita , Chicago , and Louisville , light cruisers Montpelier , Cleveland , and Columbia ; escort carriers Chenango and Suwannee ; and eight destroyers . Admiral Giffen commanded TF 18 from Wichita . A fleet carrier task force — centered on the carrier Enterprise — steamed about 250 mi ( 220 nmi ; 400 km ) behind TG 62 @.@ 8 and TF 18 . The other fleet carrier and battleship task forces were about 150 mi ( 130 nmi ; 240 km ) farther back . Admiral Giffen , with Wichita and the two escort carriers , had just arrived in the Pacific after participating in Operation Torch in the North African Campaign . Also , Chicago had just arrived back in the South Pacific , after completing repairs from damage suffered during the Battle of Savo Island almost six months before . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Prelude = = = 
 In addition to protecting the troop convoy , TF 18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers , stationed at Tulagi , at 21 : 00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up " The Slot " north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the troop transports at Guadalcanal . However , the escort carriers , under Commodore Ben Wyatt , were too slow ( 18 kn ( 21 mph ; 33 km / h ) ) to allow Giffen 's force to make the scheduled rendezvous , so Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14 : 00 and pushed on ahead at 24 kn ( 28 mph ; 44 km / h ) . Wary of the threat from Japanese submarines , which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area , Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti @-@ submarine defense , not expecting an air attack . The cruisers were aligned in two columns , spaced 2 @,@ 500 yd ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) apart . Wichita , Chicago , and Louisville , in that order , were to starboard , and Montpelier , Cleveland , and Columbia were to port . The six destroyers were in a semicircle 2 mi ( 1 @.@ 7 nmi ; 3 @.@ 2 km ) ahead of the cruiser columns . 
 Giffen 's force was tracked by Japanese submarines , who reported its location and movement . Around mid @-@ afternoon , based on the submarine reports , 16 Mitsubishi G4M Type 1 bombers from the 705 Air Group ( 705AG ) and 16 Mitsubishi G3M Type 96 bombers from the 701 Air Group ( 701AG ) took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen 's force . One Type 96 turned back with engine trouble , leaving 31 bombers in the attack force . The leader of the 705AG aircraft was Lieutenant <unk> Nakamura and Lieutenant Commander Joji Hagai commanded the 701AG planes . 
 = = = Action on 29 January = = = 
 At sunset , as TF 18 headed northwest 50 mi ( 43 nmi ; 80 km ) north of Rennell Island and 160 mi ( 140 nmi ; 260 km ) south of Guadalcanal , several of Giffen 's ships detected unidentified aircraft on radar 60 mi ( 52 nmi ; 97 km ) west of their formation . Having previously insisted on absolute radio silence , Giffen gave no orders about what to do about the unidentified contacts , or any orders at all , for that matter . With the setting of the sun , TF 18 's combat air patrol ( CAP ) from the two escort carriers returned to their ships for the night , leaving Giffen 's ships without air cover . 
 The radar contacts were , in fact , the approaching 31 Japanese torpedo bombers , who circled around to the south of TF 18 so that they could attack from the east , with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them . From this direction , the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky , but Giffen 's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon . The 705AG aircraft attacked first , beginning at 19 : 19 . Nakamura 's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire from Giffen 's ships . 
 Believing the attack was over , Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and continue towards Guadalcanal on the same course and at the same speed . Meanwhile , a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and <unk> to mark the course and speed of TF 18 for the impending attack by Hagai 's bombers . 
 At 19 : 38 , 701AG attacked , planting two torpedoes in Chicago , causing heavy damage and bringing the cruiser to a dead stop . Another torpedo hit Wichita but did not explode . Two bombers were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire , including Hagai 's ; he was killed . At 20 : 08 , Giffen ordered his ships to reverse direction , to slow to 15 kn ( 17 mph ; 28 km / h ) , and to cease firing their anti @-@ aircraft guns . The absence of muzzle flashes concealed the ships from the Japanese aircraft , who all departed the area by 23 : 35 . In pitch darkness , Louisville managed to take the crippled Chicago under tow and slowly headed south , away from the battle area , escorted by the rest of TF 18 . 
 = = = Action on 30 January = = = 
 Halsey immediately took steps to try to protect Chicago , notifying the escort carriers to make sure they had a CAP in place at first light , ordering the Enterprise task force to approach and augment the escort carrier CAP , and sending the fleet tug Navajo to take over the tow from Louisville , which was accomplished at 08 : 00 . Between daybreak and 14 : 00 , numerous Japanese scout aircraft approached TF 18 . Although they were all chased away by the CAP , they observed and reported the position of Chicago . At 12 : 15 , a force of 11 Type 1 torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group ( <unk> ) , based at Kavieng and staging through Buka , launched to attack the damaged U.S. cruiser . An Australian coastwatcher in the Solomon Islands warned the U.S. forces of the bombers , and estimated their arrival time as 16 : 00 . However , Halsey ordered the other cruisers to leave Chicago behind and head for Efate in the New Hebrides . They departed at 15 : 00 , leaving behind six destroyers to protect Chicago and Navajo . 
 At 15 : 40 , Enterprise was 43 mi ( 37 nmi ; 69 km ) away from Chicago , with ten of her fighters forming a CAP over the damaged cruiser . At this time , four of the CAP fighters chased and shot down a scout Type 1 bomber . At 15 : 54 , Enterprise 's radar detected the incoming bomber flight , and launched 10 more fighters . The escort carriers , however , had difficulties in getting their aircraft launched , and their aircraft did not attack the bombers until the engagement was over . 
 At first , the Japanese bombers appeared to be trying to approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them . Four other CAP fighters chased the <unk> aircraft as they entered the anti @-@ aircraft fire from Chicago 's escorting destroyers . Two of the bombers were shot down before they could release their ordnance . Six more were shot down moments later , but not before they dropped their torpedoes . 
 One torpedo hit the destroyer USS La Vallette in her forward engine room , killing 22 of her crew and causing heavy damage . Chicago was hit by four torpedoes , one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces . Captain Ralph O. Davis of Chicago ordered the ship to be abandoned , and she sank , stern first , 20 minutes later . Navajo and the escorting destroyers rescued 1 @,@ 049 survivors from Chicago , but 62 of her crew died . A final attack force of Japanese torpedo bombers failed to find the remaining U.S. ships . Navajo took La Vallette under tow , and all of the remaining ships of TF 18 made port at Espiritu Santo without further incident . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Japanese widely publicized the results of the engagement , claiming to have sunk a battleship and three cruisers . The U.S. on the other hand , tried to conceal the loss of Chicago from the public for some time , with Admiral Chester Nimitz threatening to " shoot " any of his staff who leaked the loss of Chicago to the press . Halsey and Nimitz blamed Giffen for the defeat and so stated in Giffen 's official performance report for the period . The defeat and resulting recriminations did not affect Giffen 's career ; he continued to lead Allied battleship and cruiser task forces in the Pacific until 1944 and was later promoted to Vice Admiral . 
 With Japanese aircraft engaged with TF 18 , the Allied transports completed their mission of replacing the remaining Marines on Guadalcanal over the last two days in January 1943 . During this time , the other Allied task forces , including the two fleet carrier task forces , took station in the Coral Sea , in anticipation of an expected Japanese offensive in the southern Solomons . 
 In reality , however , the Japanese completed the secret evacuation of their remaining forces from Guadalcanal ( Operation Ke ) over three nights between 2 and 7 February 1943 . With TF 18 forced to retreat , very few Allied naval forces were left in the immediate Guadalcanal area , allowing the Japanese to retrieve most of their remaining ground forces . The Allies did not realize the evacuation was happening until it was over . Building on their success in securing Guadalcanal , the Allies continued their campaign in the Solomon Islands to its successful conclusion . 
 = Like a Rolling Stone = 
 " Like a Rolling Stone " is a 1965 song by the American singer @-@ songwriter Bob Dylan . Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965 , when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England . Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus . " Like a Rolling Stone " was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited . 
 During a difficult two @-@ day preproduction , Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song , which was demoed without success in 3 / 4 time . A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format , and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the organ riff for which the track is known . However , Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song 's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound , and was hesitant to release it . It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single . Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track , " Like a Rolling Stone " reached number two in the US Billboard charts ( number one in Cashbox ) and became a worldwide hit . 
 Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements , the youthful , cynical sound of Dylan 's voice , and the directness of the question " How does it feel ? " " Like a Rolling Stone " transformed Dylan 's image from folk singer to rock star , and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music . Rolling Stone magazine listed the song at number one in their " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " list . The song has been covered by numerous artists , from The Jimi Hendrix Experience and The Rolling Stones to The Wailers and Green Day . 
 At an auction in 2014 , Dylan 's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $ 2 million , a world record for a popular music manuscript . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 In the spring of 1965 , after returning from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back , Dylan was unhappy with the public 's expectations of him , as well as the direction his career was taking , and seriously considered quitting the music business . In a 1966 Playboy interview , he described his dissatisfaction : " Last spring , I guess I was going to quit singing . I was very drained , and the way things were going , it was a very draggy situation ... But ' Like a Rolling Stone ' changed it all . I mean it was something that I myself could dig . It 's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don 't dig you . " 
 The song grew out of an extended piece of verse . In 1966 , Dylan described its genesis to journalist Jules Siegel : 
 It was ten pages long . It wasn 't called anything , just a rhythm thing on paper all about my steady hatred directed at some point that was honest . In the end it wasn 't hatred , it was telling someone something they didn 't know , telling them they were lucky . Revenge , that 's a better word . I had never thought of it as a song , until one day I was at the piano , and on the paper it was singing , " How does it feel ? " in a slow motion pace , in the utmost of slow motion . 
 During 1965 , Dylan composed prose , poems , and songs by typing incessantly . Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London 's Savoy Hotel captures this process . However , Dylan told two interviewers that " Like a Rolling Stone " began as a long piece of " vomit " ( 10 pages long according to one account , 20 according to another ) that later acquired musical form . Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way . In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal , Dylan called the creation of the song a " breakthrough " , explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career . He said that he found himself writing " this long piece of vomit , 20 pages long , and out of it I took ' Like a Rolling Stone ' and made it as a single . And I 'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what I should do ... After writing that I wasn 't interested in writing a novel , or a play . I just had too much , I want to write songs . " 
 From the extended version on paper , Dylan crafted four verses and the chorus in Woodstock , New York . In 2014 , when the handwritten lyrics were put up for auction , the four @-@ page manuscript revealed that the full refrain of the chorus does not appear until the fourth page . A rejected third line , " like a dog without a bone " gives way to " now you ’ re unknown " . Earlier , Dylan had considered working the name Al Capone into the rhyme scheme , and he attempted to construct a rhyme scheme for " how does it feel ? " , penciling in " it feels real , " " does it feel real , " " shut up and deal , " " get down and kneel " and " raw deal . " The song was written on an upright piano in the key of G sharp and was changed to C on the guitar in the recording studio . 
 For the recording session , Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar . Invited to Dylan 's Woodstock home for the weekend to learn new material , Bloomfield recalled , " The first thing I heard was ' Like a Rolling Stone ' . I figured he wanted blues , string bending , because that 's what I do . He said , ' Hey , man , I don 't want any of that B.B. King stuff ' . So , OK , I really fell apart . What the heck does he want ? We messed around with the song . I played the way that he dug , and he said it was groovy . " 
 The recording sessions were produced by Tom Wilson on June 15 – 16 , 1965 , in Studio A of Columbia Records , 799 Seventh Avenue , in New York City . This would be the last song Wilson would produce for Dylan . In addition to Bloomfield , the musicians enlisted were Paul Griffin on piano , Joe Macho , Jr. on bass , Bobby Gregg on drums , and Bruce Langhorne on tambourine , all booked by Wilson . Gregg and Griffin had previously worked with Dylan and Wilson on Bringing It All Back Home . 
 In the first session , on June 15 , five takes of the song were recorded in a markedly different style ( 3 / 4 waltz time , with Dylan on piano ) from the eventual release . The lack of sheet music meant the song had to be played by ear . However , its essence was discovered in the course of the chaotic session . The musicians did not reach the first chorus until the fourth take , but after the following harmonica fill Dylan interrupted , saying , " My voice is gone , man . You wanna try it again ? " This take was subsequently released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 ( Rare & Unreleased ) 1961 – 1991 . The session ended shortly afterward . 
 When the musicians reconvened the following day , June 16 , Al Kooper joined the proceedings . Kooper , at that time a 21 @-@ year @-@ old session guitarist , was not originally supposed to play but was present in the studio as Wilson 's guest . When Wilson stepped out , Kooper sat down with his guitar with the other musicians , hoping to take part in the recording session . By the time Wilson returned , Kooper , who had been intimidated by Bloomfield 's guitar playing , was back in the control room . After a couple of rehearsal takes , Wilson moved Griffin from Hammond organ to piano . Kooper then approached Wilson and told him he had a good part for the organ . Wilson belittled Kooper 's organ skills but didn 't explicitly forbid him to play . As Kooper later put it , " He just sort of scoffed at me ... He didn 't say ' no ' — so I went out there . " Wilson was surprised to see Kooper at the organ but allowed him to play on the track . When Dylan heard a playback of the song , he insisted that the organ be turned up in the mix , despite Wilson 's protestations that Kooper was " not an organ player . " 
 The June 16 session saw 15 recorded takes . By now the song had evolved into its familiar form , in 4 / 4 time with Dylan on electric guitar . After the fourth take — the master take that was released as a single — Wilson happily commented , " That sounds good to me . " Despite this , Dylan and the band recorded the song 11 more times . 
 The recording sessions that produced " Like a Rolling Stone " , including all 20 takes and the individual " stems " that comprise the four @-@ track master , are included on the 6 @-@ disc and 18 @-@ disc versions of The Bootleg Series Vol . 12 : The Cutting Edge 1965 – 1966 , released in 2015 .
