 = Second Partition of Poland = 
 The 1793 Second Partition of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth was the second of three partitions ( or partial annexations ) that ended the existence of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795 . The second partition occurred in the aftermath of the War in Defense of the Constitution and the Targowica Confederation of 1792 , and was approved by its territorial beneficiaries , the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia . The division was ratified by the coerced Polish parliament ( Sejm ) in 1793 ( see the Grodno Sejm ) in a short @-@ lived attempt to prevent the inevitable complete annexation of Poland , the Third Partition . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1790 , on the political front , the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was successfully forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy , Prussia . The Polish @-@ Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed , giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself . The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie , established the separation of the three branches of government , and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm . Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours , wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth . Once again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia 's permission , and once again the Empress Catherine II was angered ; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France , Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792 . 
 In the War in Defense of the Constitution , the army of the Russian Empire , invited by the pro @-@ Russian , conservative , Polish magnates ' alliance , the Confederation of Targowica , fought against the Polish forces supporting the Constitution . The conservative nobility ( szlachta ) believed that the Russians would help them restore their Golden Liberty . Abandoned by their Prussian allies , the badly outnumbered Polish pro @-@ Constitution forces fought under Prince Józef Poniatowski a defensive war with some measure of success , but were ultimately ordered to abandon their efforts by their supreme commander , King Stanisław August Poniatowski . The King decided to join the Targowica Confederation , as demanded by the Russians . 
 Russia invaded Poland to ensure the defeat of the Polish reforms , with no overt goal of another partition ( it viewed Poland as its protectorate , and saw little need in giving up chunks of Poland to other countries ) . Frederick William II of Prussia , however , saw those events as an opportunity to strengthen his country . Frederick demanded from Catherine that for his country 's abandoning Poland as a close ally , and for Prussian participation in the War of the First Coalition against revolutionary France ( a participation that Russia encouraged , and in which Prussia recently suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Valmy ) , Prussia should be compensated – preferably with parts of the Polish territory . Russia soon decided to accept the Prussian offer . 
 = = Partition = = 
 On 23 January 1793 Prussia signed a treaty with Russia , agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory . Russian and Prussian military took control of the territories they claimed soon afterward , with Russian troops already present , and Prussian troops meeting only nominal resistance . In 1793 , deputies to the Grodno Sejm , the last Sejm of the Commonwealth , in the presence of Russian forces , agreed to the Russian and Prussian territorial demands . The Grodno Sejm became infamous not only as the last sejm of the Commonwealth , but because its deputies had been bribed and coerced by the Russians ( Russia and Prussia wanted official , legal sanction from Poland for their demands ) . 
 Russia took 250 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 97 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , while Prussia took 58 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 22 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . The Commonwealth lost about 307 000 km ² , being reduced to 215 000 km ² . 
 Russia received the Kiev Voivodeship , Bracław Voivodeship , Podole Voivodeship and Minsk Voivodeship , and parts of the Vilnius Voivodeship , Nowogródek Voivodeship , Brest Litovsk Voivodeship and the Volhynian Voivodeship . This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 22 July . Russia reorganized its newly acquired territories into Minsk Viceroyalty and Izyaslav Viceroyalty ( which in 1795 was split into <unk> and Volhynian <unk> ) . 
 Prussia received the cities of Gdańsk ( Danzig ) and Toruń ( Thorn ) , and Gniezno Voivodeship , Poznań Voivodeship , Sieradz Voivodeship , Kalisz Voivodeship , Płock Voivodeship , Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship , <unk> Voivodeship , Dobrzyń Land , and parts of the Kraków Voivodeship , Rawa Voivodeship and Masovian Voivodeship . This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 23 September or 25 September ( sources vary ) . Prussia organized its newly acquired territories into South Prussia . 
 The Commonwealth lost about 5 million people ; only about 4 million people remained in the Polish – Lithuanian lands . 
 What was left of the Commonwealth was merely a small buffer state with a puppet king , and Russian garrisons keeping an eye on the reduced Polish army . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Targowica confederates , who did not expect another partition , and the king , Stanisław August Poniatowski , who joined them near the end , both lost much prestige and support . The reformers , on the other hand , were attracting increasing support . In March 1794 the Kościuszko Uprising begun . The defeat of the Uprising in November that year resulted in the final Third Partition of Poland , ending the existence of the Commonwealth .

 Terry @-@ Thomas ( born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens ; 10 July 1911 – 8 January 1990 ) was an English comedian and character actor who became known to a worldwide audience through his many films during the 1950s and 1960s . He often portrayed disreputable members of the upper classes , especially cads , toffs and bounders , using his distinctive voice ; his costume and props tended to include a monocle , waistcoat and cigarette holder . His striking dress sense was set off by a 1 ⁄ 3 @-@ inch ( 8 @.@ 5 mm ) gap between his two upper front teeth . 
 Born in London , Terry @-@ Thomas made his film debut , uncredited , in The Private Life of Henry VIII ( 1933 ) . He spent several years appearing in smaller roles , before wartime service with Entertainments National Service Association ( ENSA ) and Stars in Battledress . The experience helped sharpen his cabaret and revue act , increased his public profile and proved instrumental in the development of his successful comic stage routine . Upon his demobilisation , he starred in Piccadilly Hayride on the London stage and was the star of the first comedy series on British television , How Do You View ? ( 1949 ) . He appeared on various BBC radio shows , and made a successful transition into British films . His most creative period was the 1950s when he appeared in Private 's Progress ( 1956 ) , The Green Man ( 1956 ) , Blue Murder at St Trinian 's ( 1957 ) , I 'm All Right Jack ( 1959 ) and Carlton @-@ Browne of the F.O. ( 1959 ) . 
 From the early 1960s Terry @-@ Thomas began appearing in American films , coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in films such as Bachelor Flat , It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife . From the mid @-@ 1960s he frequently starred in European films , in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande <unk> . In 1971 Terry @-@ Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease , which slowly brought his career to a conclusion : his last film role was in 1980 . He spent much of his fortune on medical treatment and , shortly before his death , was living in poverty , existing on charity from the Actors ' Benevolent Fund . A charity gala was held in his honour , which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life : 1911 – 33 = = = 
 Terry @-@ Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove , Finchley , North London . He was the third of four children born to Ernest Frederick Stevens , managing director of a butcher 's business at Smithfield Market and part @-@ time amateur actor , and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens ( née Hoar ) . As a child , Terry @-@ Thomas was often referred to as Tom , the diminutive used by his family . He led a generally happy childhood , but believed that his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place . By the time he reached adolescence , his parents ' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics . In an attempt to bring them together , Terry @-@ Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines , reciting jokes , and singing and dancing around the family home . The performances seldom worked , and his father became increasingly removed from his family . His parents had divorced by the 1920s . 
 In 1921 Terry @-@ Thomas began to nurture his distinctive , well @-@ spoken voice , reasoning that " using good speech automatically suggested that you were well @-@ educated and made people look up to you " . He used the speech of the actor Owen Nares as a basis for his own delivery . Terry @-@ Thomas became fascinated by the stage , and regularly attended the Golders Green Hippodrome to see the latest shows . It was there that he developed an interest in fashion , and adopted the debonair dress @-@ sense of his hero Douglas Fairbanks . Terry @-@ Thomas attended <unk> School in Hendon Lane , Finchley , which was a welcome escape from the stresses of his parents ' break @-@ up . When he was 13 , he transferred to Ardingly College , a public school in West Sussex . He excelled in Latin and Geography and briefly took up drama . The latter subject later led to his expulsion from the school , after his frequent and inappropriate use of ad lib during lessons . He also took up a position in the school jazz band , first playing the ukulele and then percussion and additionally he often performed comedy dancing routines to the band 's music . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas enjoyed his time at Ardingly , and relished his association with upper middle class school friends . His academic abilities were modest , and he only came to the notice of staff through his frequent tomfoolery . Although he initially felt intimidated by his school surroundings , his confidence grew as he put on " a bold , undiluted and sustained show of chutzpah " , according to his biographer , Graham McCann . On his return home to Finchley to start a break in 1927 , his more mature manner impressed the family 's housekeeper Kate Dixon , who seduced the young student at the family home . He stayed at Ardingly for one more term and returned home to London , but made no plans to further his education or start long @-@ term work . Instead , he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market , where he earned 15 shillings a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company . By his own admission he never stopped " farting around " and often kept his colleagues entertained with impersonations of the Hunchback of Notre @-@ Dame and Erich von Stroheim . He also invented various characters including Colonel <unk> @-@ <unk> and Cora Chessington @-@ Crabbe , and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues . His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company 's management who prompted him to enrol in the company 's amateur drama club . He made his début with the drama company in the role of Lord Trench in The Dover Road which was staged at the Fortune Theatre , London . The production was popular with audiences , and he subsequently became a regular performer in many amateur productions . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas made his professional stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric <unk> 's Dining Club in South Kensington . He was billed as Thos Stevens , but only appeared as a minor turn . His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience , but earned him a commission of 30 shillings . After this he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre . In 1933 he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment . He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing in order to make his pitch . In his spare time he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs . He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews . The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues , and they earned well from it . News soon travelled of the couple 's talent , and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood . He found the dance @-@ style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment . 
 = = = Early performances : 1933 – 39 = = = 
 By 1933 Terry @-@ Thomas had moved out of Finchley and into a friend 's flat ; the friend was a film extra who introduced him to the idea of working in the industry . Terry @-@ Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film , The Private Life of Henry VIII , which starred Charles Laughton in the title role . Between 1933 and 1941 Terry @-@ Thomas appeared in 16 films , as an uncredited extra in all but one ; he later said that " this work suited me down to the ground . It wasn 't really like work to me . I got an enormous kick out of it " . His first speaking role came in the 1935 Buddy Rogers comedy Once in a Million where he shouted " A thousand ! " during an auction . During the 1936 musical comedy This 'll Make You Whistle , starring Jack Buchanan , he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank . In between his film work he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in Golders Green . 
 During this period he billed himself as Thomas ( or Thos ) Stevens , but reorganised the name to its backward spelling of Mot <unk> ; the name did not last long and he changed it to Thomas Terry . He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry , so inverted the name to Terry Thomas . He did not add the hyphen until 1947 , and later explained that it was " not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together . They didn 't mean much apart ; together they made a trade name " : the hyphen was also " to match the gap in his front teeth " . By now he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage . In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke , he used a cigarette holder and later purchased " the most irresistible holder in Dunhill 's . It was slightly outré because it was made of lacquered , black <unk> ... with a gold band twisting neatly round it " . Adding to his look were a " monocle , raffish waistcoat and red carnation " . He later wrote that " <unk> I was an eccentric . But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would have loved to have been a genuine eccentric " . 
 In 1937 , Terry @-@ Thomas met the South African dancer and choreographer Ida Florence <unk> , who went by the stage @-@ name Pat Patlanski , while she was auditioning in London for a partner for her flamenco dancing act . Patlanski was keen to employ Terry @-@ Thomas as a comedian rather than a dancer , and they established a cabaret double @-@ act billed as " Terri and Patlanski " , which was immediately popular with audiences . The couple became romantically involved and married on 3 February 1938 at Marylebone register office , afterwards moving to 29 Bronwen Court in St John 's Wood . Despite the success of Terri and Patlanski , the act only lasted three months and they took on small engagements on the cabaret circuit . On 6 June 1938 Terry @-@ Thomas made his first radio broadcast on the BBC London Regional dance programme Friends to Tea . He later recounted that " I didn 't give a very good performance ... I was a dismal failure " . At the end of the summer of 1938 they were hired by the bandleader Don Rico , who incorporated them into his orchestra , with Patlanski playing the piano and Terry @-@ Thomas acting as the compère . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 The Entertainments National Service Association ( ENSA ) was formed in 1938 in order to provide entertainment to the British Armed Forces ; Terry @-@ Thomas and Patlanski signed up in 1939 and during the Phoney War were posted to France , where they appeared in a variety show . From early in their marriage , Patlanski had started having affairs , a move which prompted Terry @-@ Thomas to reciprocate ; he made sure that he was sent on tour to France where a girlfriend was due to perform , although Patlanski accompanied him on the trip . During the tour , Terry @-@ Thomas ensured Patlanski was sent back to the UK to enable him to continue his affair . On his return to Britain , he continued with his solo variety act , while also acting as the head of the cabaret section of ENSA at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , where he clashed regularly with his counterparts running the drama sections , Sir Seymour Hicks and Lilian Braithwaite . Terry @-@ Thomas aimed to produce " good shows , sophisticated , impeccable and highly polished " , which included the violinist Eugene Pini playing light classical music , and the Gainsborough Girls chorus line . 
 In April 1942 Terry @-@ Thomas received his call @-@ up papers ; he later wrote that " it would have seemed rather rude and ungrateful to refuse " ; as a result , he left ENSA and reported to the Royal Corps of Signals training depot in Ossett , West Yorkshire . Within two weeks of his arrival he hired Ossett Town Hall and staged a concert , which included a freshly @-@ written sketch about his feet , which had been suffering in his army boots . After basic training he was promoted to the rank of corporal and he applied for a commission . He was turned down because training had caused a duodenal ulcer , and his hearing was still problematic ; as a result he was downgraded from A1 to B1 fitness at the start of 1943 . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas continued to appear in cabaret and variety shows while in the army , including at the Astoria cinema in York , where he was seen by George Black . Black established the entertainment troupe , Stars in Battledress , which was composed of entertainers who were serving in the forces , and he invited Terry @-@ Thomas to join . In February 1943 he appeared in his first Stars in Battledress show at London 's Olympia , where he introduced the sketch " Technical Hitch " . This involved him portraying a harassed BBC announcer introducing records that are missing . In order to cover up for the absent records he would use his vocal range of four and a half octaves to mimic the singers ; he included " impersonations of Britain 's clipped crooner Noël Coward , the African @-@ American bass @-@ baritone Paul Robeson , the Peruvian songbird Yma Sumac , the Austrian tenor Richard Tauber and ... the entire Luton Girls Choir " . The show went on a national tour , with the stand @-@ up comedian Charlie Chester as compere , during which Terry @-@ Thomas refined and polished his act and finished as " one of the most prominent and influential members of Stars in Battledress " . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas , along with his Stars in Battledress unit , travelled through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months . After the tour , and with his demobilisation approaching , he took compassionate leave in order to have free time while still receiving army pay . During his absence he went on a tour of the UK organised by George Black , accompanied on the piano by a former colonel , Harry Sutcliffe . Terry @-@ Thomas finished the war as a sergeant , and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946 .

 The ENSA and Stars in Battledress tours of Britain and Europe had raised Terry @-@ Thomas 's profile and , by October 1946 , he was appearing alongside Sid Field in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre , London . The show was described by Graham McCann as " the West End 's biggest money @-@ spinner for years " . Terry @-@ Thomas compered the show as well as appearing in some of the sketches , including his own " Technical Hitch " routine . In 1959 he described the effect of Piccadilly Hayride on his career , saying " This show made me overnight . I 'd arrived " . Ivor Brown , writing in The Observer , remarked on the " glorious rag of BBC modes , moods and intonations by Mr. Terry Thomas , a grand discovery " . Within three weeks of starting his run , Terry @-@ Thomas was invited to appear at the Royal Variety Performance on 4 November 1946 at the London Palladium . Piccadilly Hayride ran for 778 performances and ended on 17 January 1948 . The show was seen by over a million people and earned £ 350 @,@ 000 at the box office . In conjunction with Piccadilly Hayride , Terry @-@ Thomas undertook a number of other additional one @-@ off appearances in cabaret and private functions . He also appeared in editions of Variety <unk> and Workers ' Playtime on BBC radio . His ever @-@ evolving act consisted of imitations , including that of his friend , the musician Leslie Hutchinson ( known as " Hutch " ) ; sketches , including " Technical Hitch " ; urbane monologues , and " languid shaggy dog stories " . 
 At the end of his run with Piccadilly Hayride , Terry @-@ Thomas took a three @-@ week break to recover from nervous exhaustion and a recurrence of his peptic ulcer . He went back to cabaret and acted as a compere at the London Palladium before making his radio breakthrough on 12 October 1948 with his own series on the BBC Home Service . Consisting of a " mixture of sketches , solo routines , musical interludes and a range of popular and topical star guests " , To Town with Terry was broadcast weekly and ran for 24 episodes until 28 March 1949 . He was disappointed with the series , saying " I was never totally satisfied with [ it ] ... The perfectionist in me always made me aware of anything that was less than first class " . He also appeared in his first post @-@ war film , A Date with a Dream , in 1949 , alongside his wife . 
 On 26 October 1949 Terry @-@ Thomas wrote and starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service , How Do You View ? , noted for being the first comedy series on British television . The programme was based around an on @-@ screen persona of Terry @-@ Thomas as " a glamorous , mischievous and discreetly cash @-@ strapped man @-@ about @-@ town " , introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur ; Janet Brown ( Butterworth 's real @-@ life wife ) ; Avril Angers ; H.C. Walton as the family retainer , Moulting ; and Diana Dors . The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry @-@ Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC 's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios . The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being " inventive ... truly televisual and not just a radio programme in costume " . The series ran until 21 December 1949 ; a second series followed between April and May 1950 , with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry @-@ Thomas providing additional material . By the third series , which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951 , the audience reached four million viewers . In total there were five series of How Do You View ? ; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952 . Writing about Terry @-@ Thomas on television , Wilfred <unk> observed that " he has ... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment : a large , rather gaunt face , pre @-@ fabricated for close @-@ ups ; the notorious space of one @-@ third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth ; a mouth that is full of expression . Add to these pictoral [ sic ] advantages his eight @-@ inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes " . 
 In between filming How Do You View ? , Terry @-@ Thomas continued performing on radio as well as in cabaret , in Britain and increasingly the US . In October and November 1949 he appeared at the Palmer House Night Club , Chicago ; in June 1951 he appeared at The Wedgwood Room , Waldorf Astoria Hotel , New York , and between 22 December 1951 and 29 February 1952 he returned to the London Palladium for 109 performances in Humpty Dumpty . In September 1952 he travelled to Malaysia to entertain British troops in a series of concert parties , before returning to the UK to appear in the Royal Variety Performance in November . He finished the year in South Africa , as Honourable Idle Jack in Dick Whittington , which finished in January 1953 ; he considered the pantomime to be " so tatty and unrehearsed it was pathetic " . 
 In June 1953 Terry @-@ Thomas broadcast the pilot episode of the radio show , Top of the Town ; the show was successful and the BBC commissioned a series of 16 episodes , which ran between November 1953 and February 1954 . In between recording sessions , he appeared at the London Palladium in the revue Fun and the Fair , with George Formby and the Billy Cotton band , from October 1953 . Fun and the Fair was unsuccessful at the box office and closed on 19 December 1953 , after 138 performances . Terry @-@ Thomas then reprised his role of Idle Jack for a run of performances in the Granada theatres of Sutton and Woolwich , and the Finsbury Park Empire , which ran to the end of January 1954 . That year , he separated from Patlanski following an increase in domestic tension and the plethora of affairs in which they had both indulged . Patlanski moved out of the shared home , and the couple lived separate lives ; the press did not report the separation until 1957 . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas spent the 1954 summer season performing at the Winter Gardens Pavilion , Blackpool before starring in a second series of Top of the Town , which ran from October 1954 to February 1955 . At the end of the series he appeared as Hubert Crone in the play Room for Two , which had a UK tour prior to a run at the Prince of Wales Theatre , London . The last stop on the UK tour was at the Brighton Hippodrome , where Terry @-@ Thomas broke his arm on stage ; he returned to the show five days later when the tour reached London . He later joked that " the audience roared with laughter when I fell and made horrible faces , so much so that I considered breaking the other arm for an encore " . The London run was not a success and the show closed after 48 performances .

 In February 1956 Terry @-@ Thomas appeared on Desert Island Discs , and chose two songs from his " Technical Hitch " routine as part of his selection . Later that year he appeared in his first major film roles : Charles <unk> in The Green Man , and Major Hitchcock , " a charlatan military officer on the take " , in Private 's Progress , directed by the Boulting brothers . Terry @-@ Thomas only appeared in the latter film briefly , with a total screen time of about ten minutes , but his biographer Graham McCann thought that the actor " came close to stealing the show from the central character " , Windrush played by Ian Carmichael . Terry @-@ Thomas 's depiction of the character was not how he wished to play it : his desired choice was that of a " silly @-@ ass " sergeant major , but the role was written as a strict , alcohol and prescription drug @-@ dependent Army officer . He was initially disappointed with the role , and turned it down but , after being persuaded to accept it by his agent , he embraced its possibilities . One of his lines , delivered in his clipped upper @-@ class voice , was " You 're an absolute shower " , which became a catchphrase for him . The Boulting brothers were so impressed with Terry @-@ Thomas 's performance that they signed him up to a five @-@ film deal . 
 The first of the five films was Brothers in Law , in which Terry @-@ Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green , a performance which was based on Sid Field 's characterisation in Piccadilly Hayride . Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry @-@ Thomas , Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107 takes because of Terry @-@ Thomas 's unfamiliarity with filming techniques ; he initially struggled to hit his marks , or give his line and move on , while still acting . Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as " an unique experience for him , and had a wonderful after @-@ effect " . Following Brothers in Law he was cast as Romney Carlton @-@ Ricketts in Blue Murder at St Trinian 's by producers Frank <unk> and Sidney Gilliat , before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in Happy Is the Bride . Terry @-@ Thomas starred in two further films in 1957 . The first was as Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim , an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis . Although Amis thought that Terry @-@ Thomas has been " totally miscast as Bertrand , the posturing painter and leading shit " of the book , the critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Terry @-@ Thomas as being " the nearest to a complete success " in the film , in a portrayal that " suggests possibilities for more serious roles " . His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry <unk> in The Naked Truth ; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time , and the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which , Graham McCann considered that each actor 's performance " highlight [ ed ] what was special about the other " . During one scene Terry @-@ Thomas was dumped in a near @-@ freezing lake , and his health was affected for some time afterwards . 
 In 1958 Terry @-@ Thomas received the first of his two film award nominations , the BAFTA Award for the " Best British Actor in 1959 " for the part of Ivan in the Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer film tom thumb . He later described the film as his second favourite ; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time , and later said that " my part was perfect , but Peter 's was bloody awful . He wasn 't difficult about it , but he knew it " . Terry @-@ Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago ; filming went on for 85 days during 1957 – 58 , and he took painkillers to enable him to continue . The role was physically demanding , and required him to ride a horse , run long distances and fight in a duel . He stated that he fought and ran " just as [ he ] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro " . Towards the end of filming , Terry @-@ Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero , where he drank champagne , as well as taking codeine tablets , and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly . He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude , and " their attitude made me extremely angry and when I get angry ... I just go completely off my nut " . The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry @-@ Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule ; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen 's notes , the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed . For much of the rest of 1958 , Terry @-@ Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life , alongside Harry Secombe , Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques . He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called " Filling the Gap " ; the show ran for a total of 380 performances between May and December 1958 . He also released his first record , Strictly T @-@ T , a collection of comic songs and sketches . 
 In 1959 Terry @-@ Thomas published his first autobiography , Filling the Gap , named after his spot in Large as Life ; he explained that " everything that has been printed about me is lies . I 'm not suggesting the writers were lying , I was " . During the year he also appeared in two further instalments of the <unk> brothers ' series of institutional satires , having appeared in the previous three . The first , in which he was joined again by Sellers , was Carlton @-@ Browne of the F.O. , in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton @-@ Browne , a character he described as being " rubble from the nostrils up " , " a certain type of Englishman , the Englishman who reads The Times and no other newspaper . A <unk> carrier . A squash player . A bowler hat wearer . White collar , stiff , of course " . Film writer Andrew Spicer thought that Terry @-@ Thomas 's role " was the quintessential upper @-@ class ' silly @-@ ass ' , a sad relic of a vanished world " . The film was initially chosen as Britain 's entry for the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival until the Foreign Office petitioned the British Film Producers ' Association for it to be withdrawn on the basis that the Russians might consider the film to accurately portray British diplomatic behaviour . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas 's final film with the Boulting brothers was I 'm All Right Jack , a post @-@ war follow @-@ up to Private 's Progress with Terry @-@ Thomas reprising the role of Major Hitchcock to an industrial setting , as the " <unk> incompetent " personnel manager . Many of the other cast from Private 's Progress also returned , including Attenborough , Carmichael and Dennis Price ; they were joined by Peter Sellers , who took most of the plaudits from the critics , although Stanley Kauffman , writing in The New Republic also delighted in Terry @-@ Thomas 's " finesse " and " extraordinary skill " . The Los Angeles Times retrospectively considered I 'm All Right Jack and Carlton @-@ Browne of the F.O. to have been Terry @-@ Thomas 's best works . His final film of 1959 was as William Delany Gordon in Too Many Crooks . Bosley Crowther of The New York Times thought that Terry @-@ Thomas provided " some of the <unk> <unk> to be seen on the contemporary screen " , going on to say that the actor 's " skill is exercised in demonstrating how magnificently and completely a mad @-@ cap comedian can completely blow his top . His eyes flash , his lips curl , his sibilants whistle and he glares like a maniac " . Filming took place during the daytime ; in the evenings he appeared at the London Palladium , something he found trying on his nervous system . 
 In 1960 Terry @-@ Thomas appeared as Raymond <unk> in School for Scoundrels , a film his biographer , Robert Ross , called " the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well @-@ mannered , well @-@ read and well @-@ educated lounge lizard : T @-@ T the man as T @-@ T the film star " . He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael , and they were joined by Alastair Sim and Janette Scott . Michael Brooke , writing for the British Film Institute , thought Terry @-@ Thomas was " outstanding as a classic British bounder " . Later the same year he appeared in Make Mine Mink as Major Albert Rayne , a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang of mink coat thieves with his female co @-@ lodgers . When he made an appearance at a screening of the film in Dalston , north @-@ east London , he was presented with a white mink waistcoat by a local furrier . 
 In 1961 Terry @-@ Thomas played Archibald Bannister in A Matter of WHO , which he described as " my first ( fairly ) serious role " . He was joined in the film by his second cousin Richard Briers , with Terry @-@ Thomas noting that he provided " no <unk> help " in getting Briers the part . The film was not well received by the critics ; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was " murdered by the critics " , although it was " something of a success " in America . By this time Terry @-@ Thomas had decided to stop being a stand @-@ up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films . He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own , declaring " it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema ! " Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films , he decided to try Hollywood , and moved to America . 
 = = = Breaking into Hollywood : 1961 – 65 = = = 
 Terry @-@ Thomas spent part of 1961 in America , filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in Bachelor Flat — his first Hollywood role — before flying to Gibraltar to film Operation Snatch , in which he teamed up with Lionel Jeffries . By the end of 1961 Terry @-@ Thomas was appearing on radio , in guest spots on American television shows , such as the December broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show , and was frequently the subject of US newspaper interviews . In 1962 Bachelor Flat and Operation Snatch were both released , and were followed by two more films : a large @-@ budget biopic from Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer called The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm , in which Terry @-@ Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian Buddy Hackett , and Kill or Cure , in which he appeared with Eric Sykes , a friend since they worked together in Large as Life . 
 On 1 February 1962 Terry @-@ Thomas and Pat Patlanski divorced , having spent the previous eight years estranged . He had by then split from his mistress of the previous few years , <unk> Desmond , who returned to Australia shortly afterwards and married a surgeon ; Terry @-@ Thomas resumed his bachelor life @-@ style . The break @-@ up with Desmond caused him great upset , and he sought solace with Belinda Cunningham , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old whom he had met on holiday in Majorca two years previously . The couple began a romance , and married in August 1963 at Halstead Registry Office in Colchester , Essex . The following year she gave birth to their first son — Timothy Hoar — at the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London . 
 In 1963 Terry @-@ Thomas was offered the role of Lt @-@ Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne in It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World , and turned down the opportunity before leaving for the UK . By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind , so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer from the airport to signal his acceptance , and " popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part " the same day . He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set , later commenting that " I was the only non @-@ American , and I found it exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed . They were always ' on ' . " One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy , whom Terry @-@ Thomas considered " an extra @-@ special man " ; Tracy and Buster Keaton — who also appeared in the film — were described by Terry @-@ Thomas as " the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness " . 
 Later in 1963 he picked up his second film nomination , the Golden Globe for Best Comedy Actor for his portrayal of Spender in The Mouse on the Moon . He also tried his hand at production , with three 15 @-@ minute travelogues : Terry @-@ Thomas in Tuscany , Terry @-@ Thomas in the South of France and Terry @-@ Thomas in Northern Ireland . He did not enjoy the producer 's role , complaining that " for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand , everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was . I had to be on the watch the whole time " . He worked consistently during 1963 , appearing in television programmes on both sides of the Atlantic ; these included Terry @-@ Thomas , a one @-@ off variety show on BBC television in July that included Donald Sutherland . 
 In 1964 Terry @-@ Thomas started filming the role of Charles <unk> in How to Murder Your Wife , a part which brought him £ 100 @,@ 000 , his largest fee up to that point . He said that it was his favourite to make , " because I felt that I did a very good job " . He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon , the film 's star , partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit : the two became friends and Terry @-@ Thomas was invited to Lemmon 's wedding . Throughout the rest of the year Terry @-@ Thomas continued to appear on US television , again in Burke 's Law , but also on What 's My Line ? and An Hour with Robert Goulet , both on CBS ; he also released another record , Terry @-@ Thomas <unk> America , a collection of songs and sketches , described by Billboard as " a funny , funny comedy masterpiece " . His earlier record Strictly T @-@ T was also released in the US . 
 Alongside How to Murder Your Wife , there were two further releases for Terry @-@ Thomas in 1965 : Strange Bedfellows , in which he played the part of a mortician , and Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines . In the latter , he played Sir Percy Ware @-@ Armitage , a character the film historian Andrew Spicer calls " a cartoon version " of his usual persona in a " bloated mid @-@ Atlantic <unk> [ y ] " . In the film , Terry @-@ Thomas appeared again with Eric Sykes , an experience Sykes later described as magical . The roles of Ware @-@ Armitage and his sidekick were written especially for Terry @-@ Thomas and Sykes at the behest of the director Ken Annakin . 
 = = = European cinema : 1966 – 70 = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1960s Terry @-@ Thomas was tiring of the Hollywood lifestyle , and , during the latter half of the 1960s , he worked with European filmmakers , returning occasionally to the US when he was filming there . In one of his French @-@ produced films , La Grande <unk> , he played Sir Reginald , a stranded Royal Air Force pilot travelling through occupied France with characters played by <unk> and Louis de <unk> . The film , released in 1966 , held the record for highest box @-@ office takings in France until 2004 , and it remains " one of the most popular films with television audiences in France " . Terry @-@ Thomas undertook a number of roles with the Italian cinema industry . For one of the Italian @-@ produced films , the 1967 farce Arabella , he played four parts and used " the help of wigs , moustaches and lashings of Max Factor " to help achieve the different characterisations , which were all with the Italian actress Virna Lisi . 
 Although the European films allowed him to travel and gave him a constant source of income , he received bigger fees from his less @-@ frequent engagements in US films , which he continued to appear in , joking that he " knew the fat cheques in the pipe @-@ line were endless " . One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly 's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man ; he was disappointed by Kelly 's direction , later saying " I found him a very prudish director , not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked " . Terry @-@ Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene , Jayne Mansfield , commenting that " I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her " . An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day : in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out ? , which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher . Day would instruct Terry @-@ Thomas how he should act in a scene ( he would " listen ... politely , then do it my own way , as if the conversation had never taken place " ) . She would also launch into improvisations while filming ; director Hy <unk> would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry @-@ Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print . The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called " limp " , and Christopher Young described as " such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy " . 
 In 1967 Terry @-@ Thomas met his long @-@ time friend Denholm Elliott in Bel Air and the pair talked about Elliott 's new villa in Santa <unk> des Riu on the Spanish island of Ibiza . Terry @-@ Thomas was intrigued by the possibility of a Mediterranean retreat and visited the island on the way to film Monte Carlo : C 'est La Rose with Princess Grace of Monaco who was playing herself . Although he initially struggled to find the right plot of ground for the right price , he eventually settled on an appropriate location ; declaring he was " allergic to architects " , he designed the house himself . His former wife Pat moved to the nearby island of Majorca , and Terry @-@ Thomas 's relationship with her became warm and friendly ; Patlanski also had a firm friendship with Terry @-@ Thomas 's wife . 
 In between films Terry @-@ Thomas appeared on television on both sides of the Atlantic . In the US in March – April 1967 he was in " The Five Daughters Affair " , a two @-@ part story in the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. , and on 22 May he appeared on The Red Skelton Hour . On British television , in an episode of the Comedy Playhouse called " The Old Campaigner " , he played James Franklin @-@ Jones , a salesman for a plastics company who was continually searching for love affairs while travelling on business . This character was " yet another variation on his rakish cad persona " , according to Mark Lewisohn . The episode was well @-@ received , and a six @-@ part series was commissioned that ran over December 1968 and January 1969 . Although the series performed well in the ratings , a second series was not commissioned . In between the pilot and the series of The Old Campaigner , in April 1968 , Terry @-@ Thomas appeared on the British ITV network in a one @-@ off variety special , The Big Show , which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues . Robert Ross commented that Terry @-@ Thomas " seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in movies ... the top raconteur was back where he belonged " . In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director Ken Annakin for a joint Italian , French and British production Monte Carlo or Bust ! . The film was " the only copper @-@ bottomed sequel to ... Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines " , according to Richard Ross . Terry @-@ Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware @-@ Armitage , the " thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware @-@ Armitage " , his role in Those Magnificent Men . Terry @-@ Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year , including Arthur ? Arthur ! ( which he joked had " never been shown anywhere — as far as I know ! " ) , as well as on television in the UK , US and Australia . 
 The 1970s began well for Terry @-@ Thomas ; television appearances in the UK and US were augmented by filming for The Abominable Dr. <unk> , which became what author Bruce Hallenbeck called a " camp classic " , despite being described by Time Out critic David Pirie , as " the worst horror film made in England since 1945 " ; the film was released in 1971 . On 1 August 1970 Terry @-@ Thomas made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs ; his luxury item was a case of brandy , chosen because it lasted longer than champagne . 
 = = = Dealing with Parkinson 's : 1971 – 83 = = = 
 While appearing in Don 't Just Lie There , Say Something ! at the Metro Theatre , Sydney in 1971 , Terry @-@ Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor , who noticed his patient 's left hand was shaking slightly ; the doctor suggested a visit , upon his return to the UK , to a specialist , who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson 's disease . Fearing the condition would affect offers of work , he did not make the news public , but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors , a shuffling gait , stooped posture and affected speech , he made the news known — partly to stop rumours of on @-@ set drunkenness . 
 He continued to work as much as possible , although — as the film historian Geoff Mayer pointed out — the situation " reduced his film career to supporting roles and cameos " . The lucrative voice @-@ over role of Sir Hiss in the 1973 Walt Disney film Robin Hood was one notable part , while others were less well @-@ known , such as The Vault of Horror , a film described by Richard Ross as a " cornball terror " , in which he starred with Curd Jürgens , Tom Baker and Denholm Elliott . He also continued to appear on television shows in both the US and UK , as well as advertisements , including appearing with June Whitfield for Birds Eye fish fingers ; a series of vermouth advertisements filmed in Italy ; and an award @-@ winning series for Benson & Hedges along with Eric Sykes . 
 During the 1970s he starred in a series of low @-@ budget British films , including two in 1975 , Spanish Fly — called a " gruesome smutfest " by the writer Christopher Fowler — and The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones , described by the Film Review Digest as a " cheap , crude , sexed @-@ up rehash " of the other film adaptations of Henry Fielding 's source novel . 
 In 1977 he starred in The Last Remake of Beau Geste and The Hound of the Baskervilles , the latter starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as Holmes and Watson ; Terry @-@ Thomas thought that " it was the most outrageous film I ever appeared in ... there was no magic ... it was bad ! " By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement , a sign of how serious his condition had become . His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted . Between 1978 and 1980 , he spent much time with medical consultants . Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier , Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde @-@ White . As a result , he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company . Derek Jarman offered Terry @-@ Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest , but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas undertook his final film role in 1980 in <unk> a 40 ! , a German and Italian co @-@ production that was " nondescript and barely screened " , according to Robert Ross , and did not even have a theatrical release in its two domestic markets . He continued his involvement in the film industry , where he funded three films during the early 1980s ( noted by Ross to be " destined from the outset for B @-@ picture status or straight @-@ to @-@ video exposure " ) ; he commented that " I have made a loss of one hundred per cent " . In 1982 , with his condition worsening , Terry @-@ Thomas featured in two episodes of the BBC series The Human Brain , which examined his condition ; his frank interview brought much public awareness of the disease and raised £ 32 @,@ 000 for the Parkinson 's Disease Society . Privately , he was becoming more depressed ; his London flat had been sold to provide badly @-@ needed funds , and his work offers were decreasing . 
 = = = Final years and death : 1983 – 90 = = = 
 By 1983 , with his medical bills at £ 40 @,@ 000 a year , Terry @-@ Thomas 's financial resources were dwindling . He and his wife sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage once owned by his former wife Pat Patlanski , which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year . Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography , Terry @-@ Thomas Tells Tales . Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984 , Terry @-@ Thomas refused to release the script and continued to make alterations , but never completed his copyediting : the book was finally published after his death . 
 By 1984 Terry @-@ Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition and when he was interviewed that year , he admitted that " one doctor said I 've got about four more years to live . God forbid ! I shall probably blow my brains out first " . In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain , so they moved back to London . They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three @-@ room , unfurnished charity flat , where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors ' Benevolent Fund . Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat , and was shocked by the change he saw : " [ S ] <unk> there , motionless , he was just a mere shadow . A crippled , crushed , shadow . It was really bloody awful . " 
 On 9 April 1989 the actor Jack Douglas and Richard Hope @-@ Hawkins organised a benefit concert for Terry @-@ Thomas , after discovering he was living in virtual obscurity , poverty and ill health . The gala , held at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , ran for five hours , and featured 120 artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman . The show raised over £ 75 @,@ 000 for Terry @-@ Thomas and Parkinson 's UK . The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry @-@ Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming , Surrey . He died there on 8 January 1990 , at the age of 78 . The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church , Busbridge , where the theme from Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines was played ; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium . 
 = = Screen persona and technique = = 
 Although there were exceptions , Terry @-@ Thomas 's screen characters were generally similar ; Geoff Mayer wrote that " although there would be variations , he would remain the ' rotter ' , a pretentious , elitist , seedy , sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life " . Eric Sykes , with whom Terry @-@ Thomas shared a number of screen moments , stated that it was " always the same character and always funny " . Andrew Spicer , writing for the British Film Institute , called him " the definitive postwar cad or rotter " . Terry @-@ Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented , writing in the 1980s that " T @-@ T with his permanent air of caddish disdain ... bounder ... aristocratic rogue ... upper @-@ class English twit ... genuine English eccentric ... one of the last real gentlemen ... wet , genteel Englishman ... high @-@ bred idiot ... cheeky <unk> ... camel @-@ haired cad ... amiable buffoon ... pompous Englishman ... twentieth @-@ century dandy ... stinker ... king of the cads ... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry @-@ Thomas " . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas identified himself as a comedy actor , but regarded himself " first and foremost , as a comedian with a built @-@ in ability to inject humour into situations " . He worked hard at the humour element , especially during his days in cabaret and revue ; he wrote that he " spent an enormous amount of time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it , but it didn 't get me very far . I decided that humour was like a good watch . It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started poking around , it went wonky " . While working on his television series How do you View ? , he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well , even if he gave the best lines to others ; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others , including Jack Lemmon , who appeared with Terry @-@ Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife . Lemmon commented that " like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors . He worked with you , not at you " . 
 Before starting filming or making an entrance on stage , Terry @-@ Thomas had a routine he would undertake : " my own technique to get myself going was ... to jump in the air and execute a few dance steps " . His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions . Filming a scene in a cinema in Private 's Progress , a close @-@ up was needed showing his character " registering shock , fury , indignation and anything else I could stuff in " ; he " just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank . It 's a trick I 've used often since . In this way , the audience does the work " . Terry @-@ Thomas said " I like to do my own stunts " , which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat . This included some dangerous work ; for example , during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines , he ran along the roof of a moving train . 
 = = Legacy and reputation = = 
 Following Terry @-@ Thomas 's death , Lionel Jeffries called him " the last of the great gentlemen of the cinema " , while the director Michael Winner commented that " no matter what your position was in relation to his , as the star he was always terribly nice . He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much " . Reviewing his career in The Guardian , Adrian Turner considered that " we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time . Not to put too serious a point on it , his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the ' never had it so good ' ethos of the Macmillan era . During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism , much in demand in America , who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain " ; he also said that Terry @-@ Thomas was " a national treasure " . Gilbert Adair , writing in The Independent , considered that " for three decades , and in literally scores of films , he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder " ; Adair wrote that " the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician , double @-@ barrelled <unk> " . Terry @-@ Thomas 's friend Jack Lemmon called him " a consummate professional ... he was a gentleman , a delight to be with personally , let alone professionally , and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much — he made it look simple " . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas 's image of an English cad was used by others . The personification started in the 1960s when the voice actor Ivan Owen , who had worked alongside Terry @-@ Thomas in " Stars in Battledress " , based the voice for Basil Brush on that of Terry @-@ Thomas , in a characterisation which also copied Terry @-@ Thomas 's " penchant for bad , self @-@ satisfied , golf @-@ club @-@ bore jokes " . The 1960s also witnessed the fictional cartoon character Dick Dastardly in two Hanna @-@ Barbera cartoon series ( Wacky Races and Dastardly and <unk> in Their Flying Machines ) , who was inspired by Terry @-@ Thomas . 
 Other actors have also used Terry @-@ Thomas 's persona as an inspiration for their characters : Dustin Hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of the character Captain Hook in Hook on Terry @-@ Thomas ; Rupert Everett disclosed that when he provided the voice for Prince Charming in Shrek 2 Terry @-@ Thomas " was vocally my role model while I was doing it " ; and Paul Whitehouse 's character , the 13th Duke of <unk> , from The Fast Show was also modelled on Terry @-@ Thomas 's on @-@ screen persona . 
 Terry @-@ Thomas 's popularity continued after his death . In February 1999 the National Film Theatre ran a season of Terry @-@ Thomas films ; an <unk> spokesman described how attendees to the films turned up " in evening dress , with false moustaches and carrying cigarettes in long holders ... everyone has been trying to steal the cardboard cutouts of Terry ... We 've never had a response like it . To be honest , we are rather unprepared . Nobody expected Terry @-@ Thomas Fever " . 
 Some of the innovations Terry @-@ Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others ; How Do You View ? later provided the " prologue " format of Up Pompeii ! , and was the first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches — a practice continued later , particularly with the shows of Morecambe and Wise . Terry @-@ Thomas 's anecdotes , stringing several stories together , later inspired Ronnie Corbett in his monologue spot in his series The Two Ronnies .

 SMS Comet was an aviso of the Imperial German Navy , the second and final member of the Meteor class . She had one sister ship , Meteor . Comet was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in 1890 , launched in January 1892 , and commissioned in April 1893 . Like her sister , Comet was plagued by excessive vibration and poor handling , which limited her active duty career . She ended her career as a mine hulk in Emden . After the German defeat in World War I , she was sold for scrapping in 1921 .

 Comet was 79 @.@ 86 meters ( 262 @.@ 0 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 9 @.@ 58 m ( 31 @.@ 4 ft ) and a maximum draft of 3 @.@ 68 m ( 12 @.@ 1 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 117 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 099 long tons ; 1 @,@ 231 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 19 @.@ 5 kn ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) and a range of approximately 960 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 780 km ; 1 @,@ 100 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . Comet had a crew of 7 officers and 108 enlisted men . 
 As built , the ship was armed with four 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns placed in single pivot mounts , two side @-@ by @-@ side forward , and two side @-@ by @-@ side aft . The guns were supplied with between 462 and 680 rounds of ammunition . Comet also carried three 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck @-@ mounted launchers on the broadside . She was protected with a 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) thick deck , along with 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) of steel armor plating for the conning tower .

 Comet was built by the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin . She was laid down in 1890 and launched on 15 January 1892 . After the completion of fitting @-@ out work , she was transferred to Kiel , where she was commissioned for sea trials . Comet was commissioned into the German fleet on 29 April 1893 . That summer , she served in the newly formed III Division of the Maneuver Fleet for the annual maneuvers in August and September . 
 Comet served only briefly with the fleet , owing in large part to her poor handling and excessive vibration at high speed . She and her sister ship Meteor were quickly placed in reserve , though in 1899 they were reclassified as light cruisers . Starting on 3 May 1904 , Comet was employed as a harbor defense ship in Danzig . She was stricken from the naval register on 24 June 1911 and starting in 1913 was used as a mine hulk in Emden . She served in this capacity through World War I and was broken up in 1921 in Hamburg . 
 = Clathrus columnatus = 
 Clathrus columnatus , commonly known as the column stinkhorn , is a saprobic species of basidiomycete fungus in the family Phallaceae . It has a widespread distribution , and has been found in Africa , Australasia , and the Americas . It may have been introduced to North America with exotic plants . Similar to other stinkhorn fungi , the fruiting body , known as the receptaculum , starts out as a subterranean " egg " form . As the fungus develops , the receptaculum expands and erupts out of the protective volva , ultimately developing into mature structures characterized by two to five long vertical orange or red spongy columns , joined together at the apex . The fully grown receptaculum reaches heights of 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) tall . The inside surfaces of the columns are covered with a fetid olive @-@ brown spore @-@ containing slime , which attracts flies and other insects that help disseminate the spores . Although once considered undesirable , the fungus is listed as edible . It is found commonly in mulch . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first named by the French botanist Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc in 1811 . Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck transferred it into Laternea in 1858 , a genus intended to accommodate those Clathrus @-@ like species with arms arranged in columns rather than a network ; in its current meaning , Laternea includes species that have gleba suspended below the arch of the receptaculum by trabeculae ( columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the receptaculum ) . Other genera to which the species has been transferred include <unk> by Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1932 , <unk> by Eduard Fischer in 1933 , and <unk> by Cunningham in 1942 . <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are now considered obsolete genera , as they have been subsumed into Clathrus . 
 The specific epithet columnatus is Latin , meaning " supported by pillars " . The mushroom is commonly known as the " column stinkhorn " . Curtis Gates Lloyd wrote in 1906 " in Florida , it is known to the natives as " Dead Men 's Fingers . " 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body , or receptaculum , of Clathrus columnatus consists of two to five ( usually four ) spongy vertical columns , which are separate where they arise from the volva , but joined together at the top in an arch . The columns are joined together in pairs ; the opposite pairs are joined by a short and broad arch similar in structure to the columns . The columns , which are narrower at the base than above , are reddish @-@ orange above and yellowish @-@ pink below . Young specimens have the fruit body compressed into the small interior space of an " egg " , which consists of a peridium that is surrounded by a gelatinous layer that encloses the compressed fruiting body . The egg , usually gray or grayish @-@ brown , typically reaches diameters of 3 to 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) before the columns grow . The volva remains at the base of the fruit body as a thick , loose , whitish sack . The mycelial cords found at the base of the volva are made of two types of tissues : a central bundle of fine hyphae that extend in a longitudinal direction , and an outer cortical layer of coarser hyphae that form a loose but highly interwoven structure . Full @-@ grown columns can extend to 5 to 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) above the ground , a location that optimizes spore dispersal . The fetid @-@ smelling gleba , the spore @-@ bearing mass , is smeared on the upper inner surface of the columns . 
 The spores are elliptical , smooth , and have dimensions of 3 @.@ 5 – 5 by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 µm . They have thin walls , and are covered by a transparent envelope .

 The words of William Gilson Farlow , published in 1890 , serve as a warning to those who might be inclined to consume Clathrus columnatus : " The odor of fully grown specimens of the order <unk> is so repulsive that the question as to their poisonous character when eaten by men has not often been the subject of experiment . " Farlow described two cases of poisoning , one involving a young girl " who ate a small piece of the fungus , and was seized with violent convulsions followed by loss of speech and a deep sleep lasting 52 hours " ; the other case involved hogs that ate the fungus found in patches in oak woods , and died 12 – 15 hours later . Despite this early report of poisoning , Orson K. Miller , Jr. notes that the taste of the egg is mild , and lists the species as edible .

 Pseudocolus fusiformis , Clathrus <unk> , and C. ruber have similarities to Clathrus columnatus . The lattice stinkhorn , C. ruber , has a larger , more globular , lattice @-@ like receptacle . The " stinky squid " , P. fusiformis , has arms that are attached at the bases , and free at the top . It grows on rotting logs and chip @-@ mulched soil , in contrast to C. columnatus , which grows on sandy soil . C. <unk> has a smaller stature ( up to 9 cm tall ) , and only has two columns . 
 = = Development = = 
 The American botanist Edward Angus Burt published a detailed description of the development of C. columnatus in 1896 . He found that the egg consists of cortical and medullary systems continued upward from the mycelial strand in the earliest stage . The cortical layer gives rise to the outer layer of the volva , the cortical plates and the pseudoparenchyma ( thin @-@ walled , usually angular , randomly arranged cells that are tightly packed ) of the receptaculum . The medullary portion gives rise to the gelatinous masses of the gelatinous layer of the volva , to the gleba , and to the gelatinous tissue of the chambers of the receptaculum . The elongation of the receptacle begins at the base and after its elongation , the gleba hangs suspended from the arch of the receptaculum by medullary tissue constituting the chamber masses of the receptacle . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all Phallaceae species , C. columnatus is saprobic , and uses extracellular digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter , like wood . As a consequence of its predilection for dead wood , the fungus is often associated with disturbed habitats . It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch , wood chips or other cellulose @-@ rich materials . The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots , stumps , and other woody material . The species grows in sandy soil , near woody debris , in lawns , gardens , and cultivated soil . Fruit bodies appear singly , or scattered , and can arise in the summer , autumn , and early winter , especially after wet weather . 
 Like other member of the Phallaceae family , the mature fungus attracts insects with its smell to help disperse its spores . <unk> fasciata , a stinkhorn beetle of the sap beetle family , has been recorded feeding on the gleba of Mexican specimens . 
 In 1980 Donald Malcolm Dring summarized the known geographical distribution of C. columnatus ; the fungus has been collected in Australia , New Zealand , Oceania , New Guinea , Africa , and North and South America ; According to Australian mycologist Tom May , the Australian distribution is " presumably erroneous " , as it is based on only a single collection in 1948 . In Central America , it has been collected from Costa Rica . It is also found in China , in Jiangsu , Fujian , and Guangdong . The North American distribution extends south to Mexico , and north to New York ; it is also in Hawaii . The fungus is less common in the southeastern and southern United States . It is thought to have been introduced to North America , as it typically appear in landscaped areas or other locations where exotic plants have been established . 
 = The Boat Race 1895 = 
 The 52nd Boat Race took place on 30 March 1895 . The Boat Race is an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race along the River Thames between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . The 1895 race was umpired by former Oxford rower Frank Willan with one of the Oxford coaches , R. C. Lehmann being a former Cambridge alumnus . Although Cambridge made the quicker start , Oxford recovered , had the lead by Hammersmith Bridge , and won by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 20 minutes 50 seconds . It was their sixth victory in a row and took the overall record in the event to 29 – 22 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the boat clubs of University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; as of 2014 it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the 1895 race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in the previous year 's race , and held the overall lead , with 28 victories to Cambridge 's 22 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were G. C. Bourne ( who rowed for Oxford in the 1882 and 1883 races ) , Douglas McLean ( an Oxford Blue five times from 1883 through 1887 ) , and R. C. Lehmann . Lehmann was a former president of the Cambridge Union Society and captain of the 1st Trinity Boat Club ; although he had rowed in the trial eights for Cambridge , he was never selected for the Blue boat . The Cambridge team was coached by Stanley Muttlebury ( who rowed for Cambridge five times between the 1886 and 1890 races ) . 
 Both crews suffered variously during the buildup to the race . A hard frost which persisted late into the season hindered training , forcing both crews to move to Bourne End and more open water . Both crews were then struck by influenza , Cambridge three weeks before the race and Oxford the week of the race itself . As such , Cambridge were in good form going into the race , Oxford less so . 
 James Brooks Close was the non @-@ rowing president of the Cambridge University Boat Club – he had rowed in the 1872 , 1873 and 1874 races . His election was considered by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater as " a bold step " in an attempt to overcome dissension as a result of Cambridge 's heavy defeat the prior year . Close was called away during the crew 's practice , and Francis Cargill Begg took captaincy of the crew . The umpire for the race for the seventh year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 1 @.@ 875 lb ( 76 @.@ 9 kg ) , 1 @.@ 125 pounds ( 0 @.@ 5 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge 's cox Francis Cargill Begg was the only Light Blue participant with Boat Race experience , having steered the boat in the previous year 's race . Oxford 's crew contained six rowers who had previously rowed in the event , including Hugh Benjamin Cotton and Charles Murray Pitman , both of whom were taking part in their fourth consecutive race . Seven of the Oxford crew were educated at Eton College . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . In a heavy wind and a strong tide , Willan started the race at 4 : 08 pm . Cambridge , outrating their opponents at the start , took an early lead , but Oxford 's steady rhythm drew them back level and then ahead . By Hammersmith Bridge , the Dark Blues held a lead of three @-@ quarters of a length and took advantage of Cambridge experiencing rough water . With a well @-@ timed spurt from Oxford 's boat club president and stroke Pitman , the Dark Blues went clear of Cambridge and held a two @-@ length lead by the time they reached Chiswick . 
 With a lead of three lengths by Barnes Bridge , Oxford slowed to a paddle and passed the finishing post with a lead of two and a quarter lengths , in a winning time of 20 minutes 50 seconds . It was the Dark Blues ' sixth consecutive victory and took the overall record to 29 – 22 in their favour . 
 = David Lewis ( politician ) = 
 David Lewis , CC QC ( born David Losz ; June 23 , or October 1909 – May 23 , 1981 ) was a Canadian labour lawyer and social democratic politician . He was national secretary of the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) from 1936 to 1950 , and one of the key architects of the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) in 1961 . In 1962 , he was elected as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) , in the Canadian House of Commons , for the York South electoral district . While an MP , he was elected the NDP 's national leader , and served from 1971 until 1975 . After his defeat in the 1974 federal election , he stepped down as leader and retired from politics . He spent his last years as a university professor at Carleton University , and as a travel correspondent for the Toronto Star . In retirement , he was named to the Order of Canada for his political service . After suffering from cancer for a long time , he died in Ottawa in 1981 . 
 Lewis ' politics were heavily influenced by the Jewish Labour Bund , which contributed to his support of parliamentary democracy . He was an avowed anti @-@ communist , and while a Rhodes Scholar prevented communist domination of the Oxford University Labour Club . In Canada , he played a major role in removing communist influence from the labour movement . 
 In the CCF , he took the role of disciplinarian and dealt with internal organizational problems . He helped draft the Winnipeg Declaration , which moderated the CCF 's economic policies to include acceptance of capitalism , albeit subject to stringent government regulation . As the United Steelworkers of America ( USW ) ' s legal counsel in Canada , he helped them take over the International Union of Mine , Mill , and Smelter Workers ( Mine @-@ Mill ) . His involvement with the USW also led to a central role in the creation of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1956 . 
 The Lewis family has been active in socialist politics since the turn of the twentieth century , starting with David Lewis ' father 's involvement in the Bund in Russia , continuing with David , and followed by his eldest son , Stephen Lewis , who led the Ontario NDP from 1970 until 1978 . When David was elected the NDP 's national leader in 1971 , he and Stephen became one of the first father @-@ and @-@ son @-@ teams to simultaneously head Canadian political parties . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = The Bund and Jewish life in the Pale = = = 
 David Losz was born in Russia sometime after Svisloch 's first snowfall in October 1909 to Moishe Losz and his wife Rose ( née <unk> ) . His official birth date of June 23 was the one he gave the immigration officer when he arrived in Canada . Lewis 's political activism began in the shtetl he lived in from 1909 until 1921 . Svisloch was located in the Pale of Settlement , the western @-@ most region of the Russian Empire , in what is now Belarus . After World War I it became a Polish border town , occasionally occupied by the Soviet Union during the Polish @-@ Soviet War of the early 1920s . Jewish people were in the majority , numbering 3 @,@ 500 out of Svisloch 's 4 @,@ 500 residents . Unlike many of the other <unk> in the Pale , it had an industrial economy based on tanning . Its semi @-@ urban industrial population was receptive to social democratic politics and the labour movement , as embodied by the Jewish Labour Bund . 
 Moishe ( or Moshe ) Losz was Svisloch 's Bund Chairman . The Bund was an outlawed socialist party that called for overthrowing the Tsar , equality for all , and national rights for the Jewish community ; it functioned as both political party and labour movement . Lewis spent his formative years immersed in its culture and philosophy . The Bund 's membership , although mostly ethnically Jewish , was secular humanist in practice . 
 Moishe and David were influenced by the Bund 's political pragmatism , embodied in its maxim that " It is better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain a purist . " David would bring this philosophy to the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) and New Democratic Party ( NDP ) ; in clashes between the parties ' " ideological missionaries and the power pragmatists when internal debates raged about policy or action " , he was in the latter camp . 
 When the Russian Civil War and the Polish @-@ Soviet War were at their fiercest , in the summer of 1920 , Poland invaded , and the Red Russian Bolshevik army counter @-@ attacked . The Bolsheviks reached the Svisloch border in July 1920 . Moishe Losz openly opposed the Bolsheviks and would later be jailed by them for his opposition . When the Polish army recaptured Svisloch on August 25 , 1920 , they executed five Jewish citizens as " spies " . Unsafe under either regime and with his family 's future prospects bleak , Moishe left for Canada in May 1921 , to work in his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's Montreal clothing factory . By August , he saved enough money to send for his family , including David and his siblings , Charlie and Doris . 
 David Lewis was a secular Jew , as was Moishe . However , his maternal grandfather , Usher <unk> , was religious and , in the brief period between May and August 1921 before David emigrated , gave his grandson the only real religious training he would ever receive . David did not actively take part in a religious service again until his granddaughter Ilana 's Bat Mitzvah in the late 1970s . In practice , the Lewis family , including David , his wife Sophie , and their children Janet , Nina , Stephen , and Michael , were atheists . 
 = = = Early life in Canada = = = 
 The family came to Canada by boat and landed in Halifax , Nova Scotia . They then went by rail to Montreal to meet Moishe Lewis . David Lewis was a native Yiddish speaker and understood very little English . He learned it by buying a copy of Charles Dickens ' novel The Old Curiosity Shop and a Yiddish @-@ English dictionary . A Welsh teacher at Fairmount Public School , where Lewis was a student , helped him learn English but also passed on his Welsh accent . 
 Lewis entered Baron Byng High School in September 1924 . He soon became friends with A.M. ( Abe ) Klein , who became one of Canada 's leading poets . He also met Irving Layton , another future prominent Canadian writer , to whom he acted as political mentor . Baron Byng High School was predominantly Jewish because it was in the heart of Montreal 's non @-@ affluent Jewish community , and was ghetto @-@ like because Jews were forbidden from attending many high schools . 
 Besides poets , at high school Lewis met Sophie Carson , who eventually became his wife . Klein , their mutual friend , introduced them . Carson was a first generation Jewish @-@ Canadian from a religious family . Her father did not approve of Lewis , because he was a recent immigrant to Canada , and in Carson 's father 's opinion had little to no possibility of success . 
 After high school , Lewis spent five years at McGill University in Montreal : four in arts , and one in law . While there , he helped found the Montreal branch of the Young People 's Socialist League . He gave lectures sponsored by this anti @-@ communist socialist club , and was its nominal leader . One of his favourite professors was Canadian humorist , and noted Conservative party proponent , Stephen Leacock , whom Lewis liked more for his personality than for his discipline , economics . 
 In his third year , Lewis founded The <unk> campus magazine . It published many of his anti @-@ communist views , though the December 1930 issue included an article he wrote expressing his approval of the Russian Revolution and calling for a greater understanding of the Soviet Union ; throughout his career , he would attack communism , but would always have a sympathy for the 1917 revolutionaries . Also at McGill , Lewis met and worked with prominent Canadian socialists like F.R. Scott , Eugene Forsey , J. King Gordon , and Frank Underhill . He would work with all of them again in the 1940s and 50s in the CCF . 
 = = Rhodes Scholarship and Oxford = = 
 With Scott 's encouragement , Lewis applied for a Rhodes Scholarship during his first year at law school . The interviews for the Quebec representative were conducted in Montreal . The examining board included the then @-@ president of the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) , Sir Edward Beatty . In response to a question about what he would do if he became prime minister , Lewis stated that he would nationalize the CPR . Despite this answer and his socialist views in general , his responses to the board 's cross @-@ examination satisfied them that he was not a communist , and they awarded him the scholarship . 
 = = = Political involvement = = = 
 When David Lewis entered Lincoln College , Oxford , in 1932 , he immediately took a leadership role in the university 's socialist @-@ labour circles . Michael Foot , the future leader of the British Labour Party , mentioned in an interview that Lewis was , 
 the most powerful socialist debater in the place . I don 't think with any rival ... He had a very powerful influence indeed amongst students , partly because he had so much more experience than the rest of us but partly because he had brilliant debating powers . I mean one of the best I 've ever heard . If you talk of tough political debates , well , he was absolutely unbeatable ... I knew him [ at Oxford ] when I was a Liberal [ and ] he played a part in converting me to socialism . 
 When Lewis came to Oxford , the Labour Club was a tame organization adhering to Christian activism , or genteel socialist theories like those expressed by R.H. Tawney in his book The <unk> Society . Lewis ' modified Bundist interpretation of Marxism , which Smith labels " Parliamentary Marxism " , ignited renewed interest in the club after the disappointment of Ramsay MacDonald 's Labour government . 
 The Oxford newspaper Isis noted Lewis ' leadership ability at this early stage in his career . In its February 7 , 1934 , issue , while Lewis was president , they wrote of the club : " The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable . If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are , then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable . " 
 In February 1934 , British fascist William Joyce ( Lord Haw Haw ) visited Oxford . Lewis and future Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe organized a noisy protest by planting Labour Club members in the dance hall where Joyce was speaking and having groups of two and three of them leave at a time , making much noise on the creaking wooden floors . They were successful in drowning out Joyce , and he did not complete his speech . Afterwards , a street fight erupted between Joyce 's Blackshirt supporters and members of the Labour Club , including Lewis . 
 Lewis prevented the communists from making inroads at Oxford . Ted Jolliffe stated " there was a difference between his speeches at the Union and his speeches at the Labour Club . His speeches at the Union had more humour in them ; the atmosphere was entirely different . But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious ... His influence at the Labour Club , more than anyone else 's , I think , explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there . There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in . " He increased the Labour Club 's membership by three quarters by the time he left . 
 In accordance with <unk> , Lewis rejected violent revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat . The Bund insisted that the revolution should be through democratic means , as Marx had judged possible in the late 1860s , and that democracy should prevail afterwards . Influenced by Fabianism , Lewis became an <unk> in his approach to replacing non @-@ socialist governments . As Lewis biographer Cameron Smith points out : 
 So what he ended up with was a modified Bundist interpretation of Marxism . Call it , if you will , Parliamentary Marxism . It was a Marxian analysis of economics and a parliamentary approach to politics . And if David were forced to choose , he would have chosen Parliamentary over Marxism . 
 Lewis was a prominent figure in the British Labour Party , which , in emphasizing parliamentary action and organizational prowess , took an approach similar to the Bund 's . Upon his 1935 graduation , the party offered him a candidacy in a safe seat in the British House of Commons . This left Lewis with a difficult decision : whether to stay in England or go home to Canada . If he had stayed in England , he likely would have been a partner in a prominent London law firm associated with Stafford Cripps and become a cabinet minister the next time Labour formed a government . Cripps , then a prominent barrister and Labour Party official , was grooming Lewis to be Prime Minister . Lewis ' other choice was to return to Montreal and help build the fledgling Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) , with no guarantee of success . A personal note from J. S. Woodsworth , dated June 19 , 1935 , asked Lewis to take this latter option ; in the end , he did . 
 = = = Oxford Union = = = 
 Besides his political involvement , Lewis was active with the Oxford Union , probably the most prestigious and important debating club in the English @-@ speaking world . His first debate , in January 1933 , was on the resolution " That the British Empire is a menace to International good will " ; Lewis was one of the participants for the " Aye " side . They lost . 
 The February 9 , 1933 , debate brought Lewis some level of early prominence . The resolution was " That this House will under no circumstances fight for its King or Country " and was so controversial that it was news around the British Empire and beyond . Lewis again spoke for the " Aye " side . They won overwhelmingly and caused a newspaper uproar throughout the Empire . The Times of London entered the fray by pooh @-@ <unk> those who took the Union and their motion seriously . 
 Lewis became a member of the Union 's Library Committee on March 9 , 1933 , and its treasurer in March 1934 . After two failed attempts , he was narrowly elected president in late November 1934 . He was president during the Hilary term , from the beginning of January until the end of April 1935 . The Isis commented that " ... David Lewis ... will be , beyond question , the least Oxonian person ever to the lead the Society . In appearance , background , and intellectual outlook he is a grim antithesis to all the suave , slightly delicate young men who for generations have sat on the Union rostrum ... "

 = = = Return to Canada = = = 
 Sophie Carson had accompanied Lewis to Oxford , and they wed August 15 , 1935 , shortly after their return . The wedding took place in his parents ' home ; though a rabbi officiated , most traditional Jewish practices were not observed . 
 In 1935 David Lewis became the National Secretary of the CCF . As Smith puts it : 
 Into this political whirlwind stepped David . A centralist in a nation that was decentralizing . A socialist in a country that voted solidly capitalist . A campaigner for a party with no money , facing two parties each of which was big , powerful , and affluent . A professional , in a party of amateurs who mostly thought of themselves as a movement , not a party . An anti @-@ Communist at a time when Canadian Communists were about to enter their heyday . A publicist seeking a unified voice for a party riven with dissent . An organizer whose leader , J.S. Woodsworth , really didn 't believe in organization , thinking that the CCF should remain a loosely knit , co @-@ operative association and believed this so implicitly that when it came time to appoint Lewis full @-@ time to the job of national secretary [ in 1938 ] he resisted , fearing the CCF would lose its spontaneity . 
 That Lewis not only survived , but prevailed is a testament to his skill and perseverance . 
 Most of the founders of the CCF – including Woodsworth , Tommy Douglas , M. J. Coldwell , and Stanley Knowles , – were informed by the Social Gospel , to which Lewis , with his Marxist socialism balanced by the Bund 's democratic principles , felt an affinity . Both the Bund and the Social Gospel were focused on the material present rather than the afterlife . Both called on people to change their environment for the better rather than hoping that God might do it for them . Social justice , the brotherhood of man , and moral self @-@ improvement were common to both . 
 It became obvious after the October 1937 Ontario election that the CCF needed an image change ; it was seen by the electorate as too far left . F.R. Scott pointed this out to Lewis in a letter , recommended moderating some of the party 's policies , and advised that " ... in the political arena we must find our friends among the near right . " 
 In August 1938 , Lewis quit his job at the Ottawa law firm of Smart and Biggar to work full @-@ time as the CCF National Secretary . His starting salary was $ 1 @,@ 200 per year , a low sum of money , even at that time , for a job with so much responsibility . 
 = = = Trying to create an organization = = = 
 As National Secretary , Lewis emphasized organization over ideology and forging links to unions . He worked to moderate the party 's image and downplay the Regina Manifesto 's more radical language , which seemed to scare off moderate voters . The offending language included " No CCF government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning " . Lewis , federal leader M.J. Coldwell , and <unk> Gillis would spend the next 19 years trying to modify this declaration , finally succeeding with the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration . 
 At the 1944 CCF convention , Lewis won a concession " that even large business could have a place in the party – if they behave . " Rather than opposing all private enterprise , Lewis was concerned with preventing monopoly capitalism . He passed a resolution reading " The socialization of large @-@ scale enterprise , however , does not mean taking over every private business . Where private business shows no signs of becoming a monopoly , operates efficiently under decent working conditions , and does not operate to the detriment of the Canadian people , it will be given every opportunity to function , to provide a fair rate of return and to make its contribution to the nation 's wealth . " This resolution allowed for a mixed @-@ economy that left most jobs in the private sphere . 
 Lewis did not share the desire of some members to keep the CCF " ideologically pure " , and adhered to the Bundist belief that " it was better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain ' purist ' . " However , the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party , and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations . Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments , saying " ... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action . If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose ... then we are saying and doing a false thing even if , in the abstract , it is true ... When , in heaven 's name are we going to learn that working @-@ class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday @-@ school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences . " 
 David Lewis was the party 's " heavy " , which did not help his popularity among CCF members , but after witnessing what he considered to be the European left 's self @-@ destruction in the 1930s , he was quick to end self @-@ immolating tactics or policies . He would tolerate some criticism of the party by its members , but when he believed that it rose to self @-@ mutilation , he suppressed it ruthlessly . This was most apparent when Lewis attacked and discredited Frank Underhill and his handling of Woodsworth House . Early in Lewis ' career , Underhill was one of his mentors ; this did not matter when Woodsworth House was stricken with financial difficulties in the late 1940s . Lewis was quick to blame and then discharged Underhill and the rest of the Woodsworth executive of their responsibilities . It was an unfortunate event that cost the CCF in the academic and intelligentsia world . To sum up Lewis ' reign , discipline and solidarity were paramount . There had to be limits to discussion and tolerance of dissenting views . 
 = = = Make this your Canada = = = 
 In 1943 , Lewis co @-@ wrote Make this Your Canada with F.R. Scott , then the CCF 's National Chairman . The book 's main argument was that national economic planning had proven itself during wartime with the King government 's imposition of wage and price controls through the Wartime Prices and Trade Board . Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime , and that Canada should adopt a mixed economy . They also called for public ownership of key economic sectors , and for the burden to be placed on private companies to demonstrate that they could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government could in the public sector . The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party 's decision @-@ making process . By Canadian standards , the book was popular , and sold over 25 @,@ 000 copies in its first year of publication .

 Lewis first ran for the CCF in the 1940 federal election in York West . He placed a distant third , receiving 8 @,@ 330 fewer votes than the second @-@ place Liberal candidate , Chris J. Bennett . Despite his poor showing in his first election , the party asked Lewis to run in the 1943 by @-@ election in the Montreal , Quebec , federal riding of Cartier , made vacant by the death of Peter <unk> . Lewis ' opponents included Fred Rose of the communist Labor – Progressive Party . It was a vicious campaign , immortalized by A.M. Klein in an uncompleted novel called Come the Revolution . The novel was broadcast in the 1980s on Lister Sinclair 's Ideas programme on CBC Radio One . If the Communist rhetoric could be believed , " Lewis was a Fascist done up in brown . " 
 Rose won and became the only ( as of 2013 ) Communist to sit in the House of Commons . Lewis placed fourth . The sizable Jewish vote mostly went to Rose . The leftist " common front " punished Lewis by supporting Rose , who was seen to be of the community ; Lewis lived in Ottawa at the time . It took Lewis many years to recover from this campaign , and its reverberation coloured Lewis ' decision on where to run . 
 = = = 1945 elections : disappointment and defeat = = = 
 The Canadian federal and the Ontario elections of 1945 were possibly the most crucial to Canada in the 20th century . They took place at the beginning of the welfare state , and the elections would set the course of political thought to the end of the century and beyond . The year was a disaster for the CCF , both nationally and in Ontario . It never fully recovered , and in 1961 would dissolve and become the New Democratic Party . As NDP strategist and historian Gerald Caplan put it : " June 4 , and June 11 , 1945 , proved to be black days in CCF annals : socialism was effectively removed from the Canadian political agenda . " 
 The anti @-@ socialist crusade by the Ontario Conservative Party , mostly credited to the Ontario Provincial Police ( OPP ) special investigative branch 's agent D @-@ 208 ( Captain William J. Osborne @-@ Dempster ) and the Conservative propagandists Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson , diminished the CCF 's initially favourable position : the September 1943 Gallup poll showed the CCF leading nationally with 29 percent support , with the Liberals and Conservatives tied for second place at 28 percent . By April 1945 , the CCF was down to 20 percent nationally , and on election day it received only 16 percent . 
 Another factor in the CCF 's defeat was the unofficial coalition between the Liberal Party of Canada and the communist Labor @-@ Progressive Party . It guaranteed a split in the left @-@ of @-@ centre vote . 
 Lewis ran in Hamilton West instead of the CCF @-@ friendly Winnipeg North riding that had elected CCF and Labour Party candidates since the 1920s and had a substantial Jewish population . Historians and activists disagree on Lewis ' reasons for doing so , but Caplan suggests that the shock of the Cartier election probably made him reluctant to fight another intense campaign against a Jewish Communist candidate . Whatever his reasons , he was soundly defeated . In the 1949 federal election , Lewis ran again in the Hamilton area , in the riding of Wentworth . He lost again , placing a relatively distant third . 
 = = = Fighting Communist influence = = = 
 The 1945 defeats were partially the result of an alliance between the Liberals and the communist Labor – Progressive Party ( LPP ) . The LPP focused in on CCF @-@ held seats , deliberately splitting the vote , and declared a " Liberal – Labour " coalition on May 29 , 1944 . They declared open warfare on the CCF in 1944 , with spokesman John Weir stating in the LPP 's Canadian Tribune newspaper that " a resounding defeat of the CCF at the polls must be [ their ] main objective . " 
 The Canadian Congress of Labour ( CCL ) supported the CCF , but the Trades and Labour Congress ( TLC ) refused to officially endorse them . This lack of unity between the two main Canadian umbrella labour organizations hurt the CCF , and was part of the Liberal – Communist alliance : TLC president <unk> <unk> was a Liberal , and vice @-@ president Pat Sullivan was a Communist . 
 In the Ontario provincial election , the communists urged trade union members to vote for the right @-@ wing Conservative George Drew rather than the CCF . 
 Lewis and Charles Millard , of the Canadian Congress of Labour , decided to purge organized labour 's decision @-@ making bodies of communists . Their first target was the Sudbury , Ontario , CCF riding association and its affiliated International Union of Mine , Mill , and Smelter Workers ( Mine @-@ Mill ) Local 598 . However , Local 598 was not under Communist control : out of 11 @,@ 000 dues @-@ paying members , fewer than 100 were communists . Over the next twenty years , a fierce and ultimately successful battle was waged by Millard 's United Steel Workers of America ( USW ) to take over Local 598 . 
 The attacks on the Sudbury CCF were even more costly , at least in terms of voter support . Sudbury 's Bob Carlin was one of the few CCF Members of Provincial Parliament ( MPPs ) to survive the Drew government 's 1945 landslide victory . Carlin had been part of Ted Jolliffe 's team that had orchestrated the CCF 's 1943 breakthrough , but was first and foremost a union man . He was a long @-@ time labour organizer , going back to 1916 and the predecessor to the Mine @-@ <unk> : the Western Federation of Miners . Carlin was loyal to his union , in whose service he had spent ten years , and to the men and woman who helped build it , regardless of their political affiliation ; this made him unpopular with the CCF establishment in both Toronto and Ottawa . 
 Millard , Jolliffe , and Lewis did not directly accuse Carlin of being a communist . Instead , they attacked him for not dealing with communists in Local 598 , which was built by both communists and <unk> ( with the latter firmly in control of the executive ) . Lewis and Jolliffe made the case to expel him from the Ontario CCF caucus at a Toronto special meeting of the CCF executive and the legislative caucus on April 13 , 1948 . In essence , Carlin became a casualty of Steel 's plans to raid Mine @-@ Mill . The CCF lost the seat in the 1948 Ontario election , placing fourth . The Conservatives won the seat and Carlin , as an independent , finished a close second . It was not until the CCF became the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) and the Mine @-@ Mill versus USW war was over , in 1967 , that another social democrat – Elie Martel in Sudbury East – was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the city . 
 Lewis and Millard 's crusade to limit communist influence received an unexpected boost from the Soviet Union , in Nikita Khrushchev 's 1956 denunciation of Stalinism . In his " Secret Speech " , On the Personality Cult and its Consequences , delivered to a closed session of the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , Khrushchev denounced Stalin for his cult of personality , and his regime for " violation of Leninist norms of legality " . When the excesses of Stalin 's regime were exposed , it caused a split in the communist movement in Canada and permanently weakened it . By the end of 1956 , the LPP 's influence in the trade union movement and politics was spent . 
 = = Private labour law practice = = 
 Lewis resigned as national secretary in 1950 and moved to Toronto to practise law in partnership with Ted Jolliffe . He became the chief legal advisor to the USW 's Canadian division , and assisted them in their organizing efforts and battles with the Mine @-@ Mill union . Lewis focused on his law practice for the next five years . In his first year , he paid more in income tax than he had earned annually as CCF National Secretary . 
 He bought his first house , in the Bathurst Street – St. Clair Avenue West area of Toronto , during this period . After his father Moishe died in 1951 , his mother Rose moved into the 95 Burnside Drive Lewis home from Montreal . This is the home where his son Stephen Lewis would spend his teenage years , and the other three children would grow up . 
 = = = Winnipeg Declaration and the New Party = = = 
 Although he gave @-@ up day @-@ to @-@ day running of the party 's organization , he stayed on the national executive as the English @-@ speaking vice @-@ president from 1950 to 1954 . After four years of comparatively limited involvement with CCF internal politics , Lewis became the party 's national chairman , by winning the election to replace Percy Wright . He , along with Lorne Ingle , the person that replaced him as national secretary in 1950 , became the main drafters of the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration , which replaced the Regina Manifesto . The lead @-@ up to the August 1956 CCF convention had Lewis working full @-@ time in his labour practice , including work on the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the Trades and Labour Congress to form the Canadian Labour Congress ( CLC ) , and putting in long hours organizing the committee that wrote the Declaration . He collapsed in his office in May 1956 ; after administering several tests for a possible cardiac condition , the doctors concluded that Lewis collapsed of exhaustion . He stayed in bed for a week and recovered enough to help the Declaration pass ten weeks later . The Winnipeg convention was the CCF 's swan song . Even with the Declaration 's modified tone , which removed state planning and nationalization of industry as central tenets of the party 's platform , the CCF suffered a crippling defeat in the 1958 federal election , which became known as the " Diefenbaker sweep " . It was obvious to Lewis , Coldwell and the rest of the CCF executive that the CCF could not continue as it was , and , with the co @-@ operation of the CLC , they started exploring how to broaden its appeal . 
 = = = CCF President = = = 
 In 1958 , Lewis worked closely with the CLC 's president , Claude Jodoin , and the CLC 's executive vice @-@ president Stanley Knowles to merge the labour and social democratic movements into a new party . Coldwell did not want to continue as the party 's national leader , because he lost his parliamentary seat in the election . Lewis persuaded him to stay on until the new party was formed . Lewis was elected party president at the July 1958 convention in Montreal , which also endorsed a motion for the executive and National Council to " enter into discussions with Canadian Labour Congress " and other like @-@ minded groups to lay the groundwork for a new party . 
 = = = Leadership succession crisis = = = 
 By 1960 , progress was being made in creating a new party , but Lewis had to again act as disciplinarian . Since Coldwell lost his seat , he was constantly considering resignation , but was repeatedly dissuaded by the party . With Coldwell lacking a seat , the CCF caucus chose Hazen Argue as its leader in the House of Commons . During the lead @-@ up to the 1960 CCF convention , Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down . This leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party . Lewis and the rest of the new party 's organizers opposed Argue 's manoeuvres , and wanted Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas to be the new party 's first leader . To prevent their plans from derailing , David Lewis attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party 's leadership . He was unsuccessful . There was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor . Coldwell quit and Argue replaced him as leader . 
 In July 1961 , the CCF became the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) . They elected Tommy Douglas as their leader by a convincing 1391 to 380 margin over Argue . Six months later , Argue quit the party and crossed the floor to join the Liberals . 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s , David Lewis reflected on this incident and he concluded that he had not handled the leadership transition well : 
 I , as president of the CCF , was very much in the wrong in trying to get a unanimous vote for Tommy . It arose out of a tradition we had had – no one opposed Woodsworth , no one had opposed Coldwell . They were chosen . 
 I met with Hazen and tried to dissuade him from being a candidate . It was wrong . This attitude produced bitterness around the Hazen @-@ Douglas contest . 
 = = 1962 – 1971 : Member of Parliament for York South = = 
 Two days after the end of the NDP 's 1961 founding convention , Tommy Douglas wrote a letter to Sophie Lewis , David 's wife , telling her that David must run in the next election . Lewis decided to run in his home riding of York South , which was concurrently held provincially , in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario , by the NDP 's Ontario leader , Donald C. MacDonald . 
 Diefenbaker 's government had to call an election sometime in 1962 , so there was time to plan Lewis ' campaign . He had two campaign managers : his son Stephen and Gerry Caplan . One of their main strategies was to gain votes in the riding 's affluent Jewish enclave in the Village of Forest Hill . Lewis , however , was perceived by the Jewish community as an outsider because he did not take part in community events or belong to a synagogue . His opposition to the creation of the state of Israel , a result of his Bundist politics , also did not sit well with the mostly Zionist community . It took extra effort on Stephen 's and Caplan 's parts to convince community members that David was a legitimate Jewish voice and that he would not harm their businesses . Besides resistance from the Jewish community , in his role as party national vice @-@ president David Lewis had to tackle the impending doctors ' strike in Saskatchewan , the result of the CCF government 's implementation of Medicare . He called the province 's doctors " blackmailers " for suggesting such a strike . Lewis also appeared on one of the NDP 's few national television spots . He appeared on the national CTV Television Network with Walter Pitman to present the NDP 's platform on a planned economy , in a conversation @-@ style election broadcast . On June 18 , 1962 , Lewis was elected in York South , and finally became an MP . Since Tommy Douglas lost in his seat , Lewis was considered the front @-@ runner to become house leader until Douglas entered the house in an October by @-@ election . 
 Lewis ' first term as MP was a short one , as Diefenbaker 's minority government was defeated in the April 8 , 1963 , general election . Lewis lost in Forest Hill , as his support among its Jewish community evaporated and returned to the Liberals , who were seen as best able to contain the Social Credit Party , which was perceived to be anti @-@ Semitic . This was only a temporary set @-@ back . With Diefenbaker in opposition ( and unlikely to resurrect the coalition in Quebec that gave him his majority in 1958 ) and Social Credit a diminished force , Lewis returned to the House of Commons in the 1965 general election . He was re @-@ elected in the 1968 election , and became the NDP leader in the House of Commons after Douglas lost his seat . At the 1969 Winnipeg National Convention , Douglas announced that he intended to step @-@ down as leader by 1971 , which meant that Lewis became the de facto leader in the interim . 
 The October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Lewis in the spotlight , as he was the only NDP MP with any roots in Quebec . He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 implementation of the War Measures Act . The Act , enacted previously only for wartime purposes , imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties , and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects , usually with little to no evidence required . Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec , since it was federal legislation , it was in @-@ force throughout Canada . Some police services , from outside of Quebec , took advantage of it for their own purposes , which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation , as Lewis and Douglas suspected . Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons . They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it . Lewis stated at a press scrum that day : " The information we do have , showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec . But , there is no information that there was unintended , or apprehended , or planned insurrection , which alone , would justify invoking the War Measures Act . " About five years later , many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so , and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it . Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield went so far as to say that , " Quite frankly , I 've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis , and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that , although they took a lot of abuse at the time .... I don 't brood about it . I 'm not proud of it . " 
 = = Leader of the NDP = = 
 Stephen Lewis was coming into his own during this period . In 1963 , at the age of 26 , he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario . Following the engineered 1970 resignation of Donald C. MacDonald , Stephen was elected leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party . During the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 1970s , the father @-@ and @-@ son @-@ team led the two largest sections of the NDP . 
 In February 1968 , Stephen Lewis , as a supposed representative of the Ontario NDP legislative caucus , asked the 63 @-@ year @-@ old Tommy Douglas to step down as leader so that a younger person could take over . Donald C. MacDonald stated that Lewis was not representing the caucus , but acting on his own . Though Douglas was taken aback by the suggestion , his defeat in the ensuing election bolstered Stephen 's case and on October 28 , 1969 , Douglas announced that he would step down as leader before the NDP 's 1971 convention . 
 David Lewis ran to succeed Douglas as national leader . The 1971 leadership convention was a tumultuous affair . A new generation of NDP activists known as The Waffle proposed many controversial resolutions , including nationalization of all natural resource industries and support for Quebec Sovereignty . It took the combined efforts of the NDP establishment — and the sizable trade union delegation — to vote down these resolutions , which caused many bitter debates and sharply divided the convention . Lewis , as the leading establishment figure , won the party 's leadership on April 24 in a surprisingly close race that required four ballots before he could claim victory over the Waffle 's James <unk> . <unk> had been prominently featured in media coverage leading up to and during the convention . Lewis ' perceived heavy @-@ handedness in dealing with The Waffle at this and previous conventions made him many enemies , as had his involvement in most of the CCF and NDP 's internal conflicts during the previous 36 years . Many members who had felt his wrath as party disciplinarian plotted their revenge against him . At his first press conference after winning the leadership , Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle , as they were soundly defeated at the convention , and that he made no promises to them . He also warned the party 's Quebec wing that they could continue to theorize about possible self @-@ determination resolutions , but that come election time they must pledge themselves to the party 's newly confirmed federalist policy . He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP , but left it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972 , when the party 's Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order . 
 David Lewis led the NDP through the 1972 federal election , during which he uttered his best known quotation , calling Canadian corporations " corporate welfare bums " , a term also used in the title of his 1972 book Louder Voices : The Corporate Welfare Bums . This election campaign also employed the first dedicated plane for the NDP leader 's tour , dubbed " Bum Air " by reporters , because it was a slow , twin engine , turbo @-@ prop driven Handley Page Dart Herald . In previous campaigns , the party 's leader , Tommy Douglas , had to use commercial Air Canada flights to get around during the election , with few people in his entourage . 
 The 1972 election returned a Liberal minority government and elected the greatest number of NDP MPs until the 1988 " Free Trade " election , and left the NDP holding the balance of power until 1974 . The NDP propped up Pierre Trudeau 's Liberal government in exchange for the implementation of NDP proposals such as the creation of Petro @-@ Canada as a crown corporation . Lewis wanted to topple the government in a vote of no @-@ confidence as early as possible , because he saw no strategic advantage to supporting the Trudeau government : he believed that Trudeau would get the credit if a program was well @-@ received , and that the NDP would be vilified if it was unpopular . 
 In hindsight , Lewis ' no @-@ win evaluation of the situation appears correct : the party would not be rewarded for its efforts by the electorate . In the 1974 election , the NDP were reduced to 16 seats . Lewis lost his seat , leading him to resign as party leader in 1975 . It was revealed immediately after the election that he had been battling leukemia for about two years ; he had reportedly kept everyone , including his family , unaware of his condition . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Lewis became a professor at the Institute of Canadian Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa during this time . In 1978 , as a travel correspondent for The Toronto Star , Lewis visited Svisloch one last time , and noted that , " not one Jew now lives there . " The Holocaust wiped out the town 's Jewish community , and with it his extended family . 
 He completed the first volume , of a planned two , of his memoirs , The Good Fight : Political Memoirs 1909 – 1958 in 1981 . He died shortly thereafter , on May 23 , 1981 , in Ottawa . He is the father of Stephen Lewis , a former Ontario NDP leader who in the early and mid @-@ first decade of the 21st century was the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa . His other son , Michael Lewis , was a former Ontario NDP Secretary and a leading organizer in the NDP . He is also the father of Janet Solberg , president of the Ontario NDP in the 1980s . His other twin daughter is Nina Libeskind , the wife and business partner of architect Daniel Libeskind . Stephen 's son , broadcaster Avram ( Avi ) Lewis , is his grandson .

 The 84th Boat Race took place on 19 March 1932 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race was umpired by former Oxford rower Harcourt Gilbey Gold on a shortened because of repairs to Putney Bridge . Cambridge won by five lengths , the largest winning margin for three years , in a time of 19 minutes 11 seconds , their ninth consecutive victory . The win equalled the record victorious streaks of Oxford between 1861 and 1869 , and 1890 and 1898 , and took the overall record to 43 – 40 in their favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1931 race by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , and led overall with 42 victories to Oxford 's 40 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford were coached by H. R. Barker ( who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1908 and 1909 races ) and John Houghton Gibbon ( who had participated in the 1899 and 1900 races , and umpired the previous year 's race ) . Cambridge 's coaches were F. E. Hellyer ( who had rowed for the Light Blues in the 1910 and 1911 races ) , J. A. MacNabb ( rowed in the 1924 race ) and Peter Haig @-@ Thomas ( four @-@ time Blue for Cambridge between 1902 and 1905 ) . The race was umpired by Harcourt Gilbey Gold , former Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four @-@ time Blue , rowing in each race between 1896 and 1899 . 
 The start of this year 's race was moved to the University of London Boat Club , approximately 400 yards ( 370 m ) further upstream . After discussion between the umpire , the two boat club presidents , the coaches Haig @-@ Thomas and Gibbons , and a representative of the Port of London Authority , the course was shortened to avoid potential eddies around temporary buttresses erected by Putney Bridge which was undergoing repair . As noted by former Oxford rower E. P. Evans , writing in The Manchester Guardian , " no comparisons of times with previous races can be made , because the points on the course will be different " . It was the first time since the 1863 race that the event was not conducted between the University Stone and Mortlake . 
 Cambridge were considered to be favourites to win the race : according to Evans , they had " a command of their boat " although Oxford had " acquired more ' drive ' from the coaching of Colonel J. H. Gibbon " . The rowing correspondent for The Times stated that the Cambridge crew were " the steadiest and best combined crew since that of 1924 " , while Oxford were " not remarkable for good form " and " not very well together in their blade nor very long nor very steady . " 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 2 @.@ 75 lb ( 77 @.@ 3 kg ) , 3 @.@ 5 pounds ( 1 @.@ 6 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxford saw four rowers return to the crew with Boat Race experience . Cambridge 's crew also contained four participants who had taken part in the event previously , including bow David Haig @-@ Thomas and number six Harold Rickett . Two participants in the race were registered as non @-@ British , both of whom rowed for Cambridge : Lewis Luxton and William Sambell were Australian .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . Weather conditions were favourable , with bright sunshine , little wind and calm water , and umpire Gold started the race at 10 : 30 a.m. Oxford made the quicker start , marginally out @-@ rating the Light Blues and led by a quarter @-@ length by the end of the Fulham Wall . They extended this lead to one third of a length by the time the crews passed the Mile Post . <unk> increased their stroke rate and drew level by the Crab Tree pub , and spurting at Harrods Furniture Depository they led by half a length . 
 As the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge , Cambridge drew clear and held a two @-@ length lead by the Doves pub . In rough water along Chiswick Reach , Oxford struggled and at Chiswick Steps they were eleven seconds behind the Light Blues . Despite a spurt from the Dark Blues , Cambridge passed under Barnes Bridge five lengths ahead . They held that lead to pass the finishing post in a time of 19 minutes 11 seconds , the largest winning margin since the 1929 race . It was their ninth consecutive victory and the first time in the history of the race that Cambridge had equalled the successful winning streaks of Oxford between 1861 and 1869 , and 1890 and 1898 .

 USS Leary ( DD @-@ 158 ) was a Wickes @-@ class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II . She was named for Lieutenant Clarence F. Leary , posthumously awarded the Navy Cross in World War I. 
 Commissioned in 1919 , she saw a number of fleet exercises and training cruises , as well as a brief period of decommissioning from 1922 to 1930 . She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be equipped with sonar , and the first to detect a German ship with it . With the outbreak of World War II , she escorted a number of convoys to Iceland , the Caribbean , and west Africa to support the war effort , later being upgraded to serve as an antisubmarine warfare vessel . On 24 December 1943 , while escorting Card through rough seas in the North Atlantic , she was torpedoed three times by German submarine U @-@ 275 and sank with the loss of 98 men . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Leary was one of 111 Wickes @-@ class destroyers built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919 . She , along with nine of her sisters , were constructed at New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyards in Camden , New Jersey using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel . 
 She had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 070 long tons ; 1 @,@ 200 short tons ) an overall length of 314 feet ( 96 m ) , a beam of 30 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 30 m ) and a draught of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . On trials , Leary reached a speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . She was armed with four 4 " / 50 caliber guns , two 3 " / 23 caliber guns , and twelve 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . She had a regular crew complement of 176 officers and enlisted men . She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers . 
 Specifics on Leary 's performance are not known , but she was one of the group of Wickes @-@ class destroyers known unofficially as the ' Liberty Type ' to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works , which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines . The ' Liberty ' type destroyers deteriorated badly in service , and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy . Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy , with most only able to make 2 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 600 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) instead of the design standard of 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight . 
 She was the first ship to be named for Clarence F. Leary . A subsequent USS Leary would be commissioned , this one a Gearing @-@ class destroyer completed in 1945 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Leary was laid down on 6 March 1918 and launched on 18 December 1918 . She was sponsored by Mrs. Anne Leary , the mother of Clarence F. Leary . She was commissioned on 5 December 1919 under the command of Commander F. C. Martin . 
 She departed Boston on 28 January 1920 , underwent her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean and then conducted training operations along the East Coast of the United States . In January 1921 , she joined the Pacific Battle Fleet , and through February took part in a large @-@ scale battle exercise off the coast of Peru . In March , Leary transited the Panama Canal and reported to the commander of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . She then was on station during bombing tests conducted by the U.S. Army Air Forces against naval targets , overseen by Billy Mitchell . She resumed her training exercises off the Caribbean until June 1922 , when in accordance with the Washington Naval Conference , she was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Yard . 
 Recommissioned on 1 May 1930 with a home port in Newport , Rhode Island , Leary alternated between the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet , carrying out training maneuvers and taking part in several fleet problems . After 1935 , most of her time was taken up conducting training cruises for reserves and midshipmen . In April 1937 , she underwent a shipyard overhaul , including being equipped with a radar . Leary was the first U.S. navy vessel to be equipped with the device . In September 1939 , Leary and Hamilton established a continuous patrol off the coast of New England against German U @-@ Boats . On 9 September 1941 , she began escort missions to Iceland . She was also the first to make contact with a German U @-@ Boat , while escorting a British convoy in the North Atlantic on 9 November 1941 . 
 With the entry of the United States into World War II following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Leary undertook regular convoy escort duties . After 26 February 1942 , she spent a year escorting convoys from a mid @-@ ocean meeting point to Icelandic ports . On 7 February 1943 , she left for Boston and reassignment . During this time , she was given a shipyard overhaul at Boston Navy Yard and converted into an anti @-@ submarine warfare ship . On 1 March , she left Boston for Guantanamo Bay , and undertook anti @-@ submarine exercises with R @-@ 5 . She then resumed escort duty , and made several trips to Trinidad and several Caribbean ports . Returning to New York on 25 June , she began <unk> transatlantic convoys , and successfully escorted two of them through Aruba and to Algiers and Casablanca . She later joined Task Group 21 @.@ 41 under the command of Captain Arnold J. Isbell and escorting Card . 
 On 24 December 1943 , the task group was caught in a storm in the North Atlantic when at 01 : 58 in the morning , Leary made a ping on a U @-@ Boat off her starboard bow . After her commander , James E. Kyes , ordered her to battle stations but before the destroyer could react , she was struck by a <unk> torpedo fired by German submarine U @-@ 275 . The torpedo struck her starboard side and detonated in the after engine room , killing all of the men there and damaging both propeller shafts . She quickly developed a 20 degree list to starboard , and was unable to move in the heavy seas . Unbeknownst to the task group , a second German submarine , U @-@ 382 fired at Leary but missed . Soon after , Kyes ordered the crew to abandon ship . Two additional torpedoes from U @-@ 275 rocked the ship , and it rapidly sank , stern first . She took 98 men with her , including Kyes . Survivors were picked up by her sister ship , Schenck . 
 Three or four minutes after the second torpedo hit , the executive officer , Lt. R. B. Watson , concluded a quick inspection of the ship , during which he found a thick , gooey substance covering the deck . He was astonished to see two seamen sitting on a torpedo tube , calmly eating Boston cream pie . The cook had just baked a batch , the explosion <unk> most of it on the deck . 
 Leary received one battle star for her service in World War II . For his actions in ensuring the safety of his crew , Kyes was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross . The Gearing @-@ class destroyer James E. Kyes was later named for him .

 The Koli Point action , during 3 – 12 November 1942 , was an engagement between U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army forces and Imperial Japanese Army forces around Koli Point on Guadalcanal during the Guadalcanal campaign . The U.S. forces were under the overall command of Major General Alexander Vandegrift , while the Japanese forces were under the overall command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake . 
 In the engagement , U.S. Marines from the 7th Marine Regiment and U.S. Army soldiers from the 164th Infantry Regiment under the tactical command of William H. Rupertus and Edmund B. Sebree , attacked a concentration of Japanese Army troops , most of whom belonged to the 230th Infantry Regiment , commanded by Toshinari Shōji . Shōji 's troops had marched to the Koli Point area after the failed Japanese assaults on U.S. defenses during the Battle for Henderson Field in late October 1942 . 
 In the engagement , the U.S. forces attempted to encircle and destroy Shōji 's forces . Although Shōji 's unit took heavy casualties , he and most of his men were able to evade the encirclement attempt and escape into the interior of Guadalcanal . As Shōji 's troops endeavored to reach Japanese positions in another part of the island , they were pursued and attacked by a battalion @-@ sized patrol of U.S. Marine Raiders .

 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia , and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the 11 @,@ 000 Allied troops — under the command of Major General Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of U.S. Marines — had secured Tulagi and nearby small islands as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal . The airfield was later named Henderson Field by Allied forces . The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the " Cactus Air Force " ( CAF ) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal . To protect the airfield , the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point . 
 In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General Harukichi Hyakutake — with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces . Beginning on 19 August , various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island . 
 Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field , the Japanese were unable to use large , slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island . Instead , the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands to carry their forces to Guadalcanal . The Japanese warships , mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa , were usually able to make the round trip down " The Slot " to Guadalcanal and back in a single night , thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack . Delivering the troops in this manner , however , prevented most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , from being carried to Guadalcanal with them . These high @-@ speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese . 
 The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917 @-@ man force was defeated on 21 August in the Battle of the Tenaru . The next attempt took place from 12 – 14 September , with the 6 @,@ 000 soldiers under the command of Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi being defeated in the Battle of Edson 's Ridge . After their defeat at Edson 's Ridge , Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal . 
 As the Japanese regrouped , the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses . On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment to Guadalcanal . These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift — beginning on 19 September — to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter . 
 General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi 's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River . Vandegrift , therefore , decided to conduct a series of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley . 
 The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau , conducted between 23 and 27 September 1942 by elements of three U.S. Marine battalions , was repulsed by Kawaguchi 's troops under Colonel Akinosuke Oka 's local command . In the second action , between 6 and 9 October , a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River , attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd ( Sendai ) Infantry Division under the command of generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment . The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau . 
 In the meantime , Major General Millard F. Harmon — commander of U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific — convinced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley — commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific Area — that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive . Thus on 13 October , a naval convoy delivered the 2 @,@ 837 @-@ strong 164th U.S. Infantry Regiment , a North Dakota Army National Guard formation from the U.S. Army 's Americal Division , to Guadalcanal . 
 = = = Battle for Henderson Field = = = 
 Between 1 and 17 October , the Japanese delivered 15 @,@ 000 troops to Guadalcanal , giving Hyakutake 20 @,@ 000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive . Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau , the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult . Thus , after observation of the American defenses around Lunga Point by his staff officers , Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field . His 2nd Division ( augmented by troops from the 38th Division ) — under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7 @,@ 000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each — was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River . The 2nd Division was split into three units ; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment , the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi consisting of troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment ( from the 38th Infantry Division ) , and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment . 
 On 23 October , Maruyama 's forces struggled through the jungle to reach the American lines . Kawaguchi — on his own initiative — began to shift his right wing unit to the east , believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area . Maruyama — through one of his staff officers — ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan . When he refused , Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shōji , commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment . That evening , after learning that the left and right wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines , Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19 : 00 on 24 October . The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama 's forces . 
 Finally , late on October 24 Maruyama 's forces reached the U.S. Lunga perimeter . Over two consecutive nights Maruyama 's forces conducted numerous , unsuccessful frontal assaults on positions defended by troops of the 1st Battalion , 7th Marines ( 1 / 7 ) under Lieutenant Colonel Chesty Puller and the U.S. Army 's 3rd Battalion , 164th Infantry Regiment , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall . U.S. Marine and Army rifle , machine gun , mortar , artillery and direct canister fire from 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) anti @-@ tank guns " wrought terrible carnage " on the Japanese . More than 1 @,@ 500 of Maruyama 's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed . Shōji 's right wing units did not participate in the attacks , choosing instead to remain in place to cover Nasu 's right flank against a possible attack in that area by U.S. forces that never materialized . 
 At 08 : 00 on 26 October , Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat . Maruyama 's left wing and division reserve survivors were ordered to retreat back to the Matanikau River area while the right wing unit under Shōji was told to head for Koli Point , 13 mi ( 21 km ) east of the Lunga River . 
 To provide support for the right wing units ( now called the Shōji Detachment ) marching towards Koli , the Japanese dispatched a Tokyo Express run for the night of 2 November to land 300 fresh troops from a previously uncommitted company of the 230th Infantry Regiment , two 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) mountain guns , provisions , and ammunition at Koli Point . American radio intelligence intercepted Japanese communications concerning this effort and the Marine command on Guadalcanal determined to try to intercept it . With many of the American units currently involved in an operation west of the Matanikau , <unk> could spare only one battalion . The 2nd Battalion , 7th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 7 ) — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Herman H. Hanneken — marched east from Lunga Point at 06 : 50 on 2 November and reached Koli Point after dark the same day . After crossing the Metapona River at its mouth , Hanneken deployed his troops along 2 @,@ 000 yd ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) in the woods facing the beach to await the arrival of the Japanese ships . 
 = = Action = = 
 Early on the morning of 3 November , the five Japanese destroyers on the express run arrived at Koli Point and began to unload their cargoes and troops about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) east of Hanneken 's battalion . Hanneken 's force remained concealed and attempted in vain to contact their headquarters by radio to report the landing . At dawn , after a Japanese patrol discovered the Marines , both adversaries began to engage each other with mortar , machine gun , and small arms fire . Soon after , the Japanese <unk> and began to fire the two mountain guns that they had landed during the night . Hanneken , still unable to contact his headquarters to request support and now taking casualties plus running low on ammunition , decided to retreat . Hanneken 's battalion withdrew by bounds , recrossing the Metapona and then the Nalimbiu River 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further west , where Hanneken was finally able to establish contact with his superiors at 14 : 45 to report his situation . 
 In addition to Hanneken 's report of sizable Japanese forces at Koli Point , Vandegrift 's staff also possessed a captured Japanese document that outlined a plan to land the remainder of the 38th Infantry Division at Koli to attack the Marine Lunga defenses from the east . Unaware that the Japanese had abandoned the plan , Vandegrift decided that the threat from Koli Point needed to be dealt with immediately . Thus , he ordered most of the Marine units currently engaged west of the Matanikau to return to Lunga Point . Puller 's battalion ( 1 / 7 ) was ordered to prepare to move to Koli Point by boat . The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 164th Infantry Regiment ( 2 / 164 and 3 / 164 ) prepared to march inland to the Nalimbiu River . The 3rd Battalion , 10th Marines began to move its 75 mm pack howitzers across the Ilu river to provide artillery support . Marine Brigadier General William Rupertus was placed in command of the operation . 
 At the same time that the U.S. forces were mobilizing , Shōji and his troops were beginning to reach Koli Point east of the Metapona River at Gavaga Creek . Late in the day , 31 CAF aircraft attacked Shōji 's forces , inflicting about 100 deaths and injuries on the Japanese . Some of the CAF aircraft also mistakenly attacked Hanneken 's men , causing several deaths and injuries to the Marines . 
 At 06 : 30 on 4 November , the 164th troops began their march towards Koli Point . Around the same time , Rupertus and Puller 's battalion landed at Koli Point near the mouth of the Nalimbiu River . Rupertus decided to wait for the army troops to arrive before attacking Shōji 's forces . Because of heat , humidity , and difficult terrain the 164th troops didn 't complete the 7 mi ( 11 km ) march to the Nalimbiu until nightfall . In the meantime , the U.S. Navy cruisers Helena , San Francisco , and destroyer Sterett bombarded Shōji 's positions with artillery fire , killing many officers and soldiers from the 9th and 10th Companies , 230th Infantry . 
 On the morning of 5 November , Rupertus ordered the 164th troops to cross to the east bank of the Nalimbiu and envelop the inland flank of any Japanese forces that might be facing Puller 's battalion . The two battalions crossed the river about 3 @,@ 500 yd ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) inland and pivoted north to advance along the east bank . The army troops encountered few Japanese but were greatly slowed by difficult terrain and stopped short of the coast for the night . That same day , the Japanese troops that had been landed by the warships on 3 November , made contact with and joined Shōji 's forces . 
 The next day , Puller 's battalion crossed the Nalimbiu as the 164th troops resumed their march towards the coast . On 7 November , the Marines and army units joined forces at the coast and pushed east to a point about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of the Metapona , where they dug in near the beach because of sightings of a Japanese Express run heading for Guadalcanal that might land reinforcements at Koli that night . The Japanese , however , successfully landed the reinforcements elsewhere on Guadalcanal that night and these reinforcements were not a factor in the Koli Point action . 
 Meanwhile , Hyakutake ordered Shōji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area . To cover the withdrawal , a sizable portion of Shōji 's forces dug @-@ in and prepared to defend positions along Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere , about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of the Metapona . The two mountain guns landed on 3 November — in combination with mortars — kept up a constant rate of fire on the advancing Americans . On 8 November , Puller 's and Hanneken 's battalions and the 164th soldiers attempted to surround Shōji 's forces by approaching Gavaga overland from the west and landing by boat near Tetere in the east . In action during the day , Puller was wounded several times and was evacuated . Rupertus , who was suffering from dengue fever , relinquished command of the operation to U.S. Army Brigadier General Edmund B. Sebree . 
 On 9 November , the U.S. troops continued with their attempt to encircle Shōji 's forces . On the west of Gavaga Creek , 1 / 7 and 2 / 164 extended their positions inland along the creek while 2 / 7 and other 164th troops took positions on the east side of Shōji 's positions . The Americans began to compress the pocket while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery , mortars , and aircraft . A gap , however , existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines , which 2 / 164 was supposed to have closed . Taking advantage of this route , Shōji 's men began to escape the pocket . 
 The Americans closed the gap in their lines on 11 November , but by then Shōji and between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south . On 12 November , Sebree 's forces completely overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left in the pocket . The Americans counted the bodies of 450 – 475 Japanese dead in the area and captured most of Shōji 's heavy weapons and provisions . The American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As Shōji 's forces began their march to rejoin the main body of Japanese forces west of the Matanikau River , the U.S. 2nd Marine Raider Battalion — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson , which had been guarding an airfield construction effort underway at Aola Bay , 30 mi ( 48 km ) further east from Koli Point — set off in pursuit . Over the next month , with the aid of native scouts , Carlson 's raiders repeatedly attacked trailing elements and stragglers from Shōji 's forces , killing almost 500 of them . In addition , a lack of food and tropical diseases felled more of Shōji 's men . By the time the Japanese reached the Lunga River , about halfway to the Matanikau , only 1 @,@ 300 men remained with Shōji 's main body . Several days later , when Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau , only 700 – 800 survivors were still with him . Survivors from Shōji 's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen , the Galloping Horse , and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943 . 
 Speaking of the Koli Point action , U.S. Sergeant ( later Brigadier General ) John E. Stannard , who participated as a member of the 164th Regiment , stated that the battle for Koli Point was " the most complex land operation , other than the original landing , that the Americans had conducted on Guadalcanal up to that time . " He added , " The Americans learned once again that offensive operations against the Japanese were much more complicated and difficult than was defeating banzai charges . " The Americans later abandoned the attempt to construct an airfield at Aola . Instead , the Aola construction units moved to Koli Point where they successfully built an auxiliary airfield beginning on 3 December 1942 . 
 The next major Japanese reinforcement effort failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau . Although most of Shōji 's troops had escaped from Koli Point , the inability of the Japanese to keep their forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced prevented them from contributing effectively to what turned out to be Japan 's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces .

 = British Commandos = 
 The British Commandos were formed during the Second World War in June 1940 , following a request from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Winston Churchill , for a force that could carry out raids against German @-@ occupied Europe . Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade , the Commandos ' ranks would eventually be filled by members of all branches of the British Armed Forces and a number of foreign volunteers from German @-@ occupied countries . 
 Reaching a wartime strength of over 30 individual units and four assault brigades , the Commandos served in all theatres of war from the Arctic Circle to Europe and from the Mediterranean and Middle East to South @-@ East Asia . Their operations ranged from small groups of men landing from the sea or by parachute to a brigade of assault troops spearheading the Allied invasions of Europe and Asia . 
 After the war most Commando units were disbanded , leaving just the Royal Marines 3 Commando Brigade . However , the present day Royal Marine Commandos , Parachute Regiment , Special Air Service , and Special Boat Service can all trace their origins to the original Commandos . The Second World War Commando legacy also extends to mainland Europe and the United States : the French Naval commandos , Dutch Korps <unk> , Belgian Paracommando Brigade and the United States Army Rangers were all influenced to some degree by the British Commandos . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The British Commandos were a formation of the British Armed Forces organized for special service in June 1940 . After the events leading to the British Expeditionary Force 's ( BEF ) evacuation from Dunkirk , after the disastrous Battle of France , Winston Churchill , the British Prime Minister , called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale . Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German @-@ occupied Europe , and stated : " they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast . " One staff officer , Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke , had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill , the Chief of the Imperial General Staff . Dill , aware of Churchill 's intentions , approved Clarke 's proposal and on 23 June 1940 , the first Commando raid took place . 
 The request for volunteers for special service was initially restricted to serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain , and from men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army divisions who had served in the Norwegian Campaign . 
 By the autumn of 1940 more than 2 @,@ 000 men had volunteered and in November 1940 these new units were organised into a Special Service Brigade consisting of four battalions under the command of Brigadier J. C. Haydon . The Special Service Brigade was quickly expanded to 12 units which became known as Commandos . Each Commando had a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer and numbered around 450 men ( divided into 75 man troops that were further divided into 15 man sections ) . Technically these men were only on secondment to the Commandos ; they retained their own regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay . The Commando force came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters . The man initially selected as the commander of Combined Operations was Admiral Roger Keyes , a veteran of the Gallipoli Campaign and the Zeebrugge Raid in the First World War . Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Vice Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten . Major @-@ General Robert Laycock was the last Commander of Combined Operations ; he took over from Mountbatten in October 1943 . 
 = = Organisation = = 
 = = = Commando units = = = 
 The Commando units formed in the United Kingdom were : No. 1 , No. 2 , No. 3 , No. 4 , No. 5 , No. 6 , No. 7 , No. 8 ( Guards ) , No. 9 , No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) , No. 11 ( Scottish ) , No. 12 , No. 14 ( Arctic ) , No. 30 , and No. 62 Commando . At the same time there were four Commando units formed in the Middle East : No. 50 , No. 51 , No , 52 , and the Middle East Commando . The No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando was formed from volunteers from the occupied territories and enemy aliens . It was the largest Commando unit formed , and contained troops from France , Belgium , Poland , Norway , the Netherlands , and No. 3 ( X ) Troop . The No. 3 ( X ) Troop consisted of enemy aliens ; it was also known as the English , Jewish , or British troop and was officially renamed the Miscellaneous Troop in 1944 . Most of the troop had German , Austrian , or Eastern European backgrounds , while others were political or religious refugees from Nazi Germany . 
 Some Commandos were designated for different tasks from the start . No. 2 Commando was always intended to be a parachute unit . In June 1940 they began parachute training and were re @-@ designated the 11th Special Air Service ( SAS ) Battalion , which eventually became the 1st Parachute Battalion . After their re @-@ designation a new No. 2 Commando was formed . Other Commandos were grouped together in a larger formation known as Layforce and sent to the Middle East . The Special Air Service and the Special Boat Squadron were formed from the survivors of Layforce . The men of No. 14 ( Arctic ) Commando were specially trained for operations in the Arctic Circle and specialised in using small boats and canoes to attack shipping . The joint service unit No. 30 Commando was formed for intelligence gathering . Its members were trained in the recognition of enemy documents , search techniques , safe cracking , prisoner handling , photography , and escape techniques . No. 62 Commando or the Small Scale Raiding Force was a small 55 – man unit under the operational control of the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) . They carried out raids planned by SOE such as Operation Postmaster on the Spanish island of Fernando Po off the coast of West Africa . 
 In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in accordance with a new war establishment . Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops ( instead of the previous 10 ) . Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks ; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft . The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the ' Glen ' type landing ship and one unit in the ' Dutch ' type landing ship . The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer , 12 motorcycles ( six with sidecars ) , two 15 hundredweight ( cwt ) trucks , and one 3 @-@ ton truck . These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations . 
 In February 1942 the Royal Marines were tasked to organise Commando units of their own . In total nine Commando units were formed by the Royal Marines : No. 40 , No. 41 , No. 42 , No. 43 , No. 44 , No. 45 , No. 46 , No. 47 and the last , No. 48 , which was only formed in 1944 . In 1943 two other Commando units were formed . The first was the Royal Naval Commandos , who were established to carry out tasks associated with establishing , maintaining , and controlling beachheads during amphibious operations . The other was the Royal Air Force Commandos , who would accompany an invasion force either to make enemy airfields serviceable , or to make new airstrips operational and contribute to their defence . 
 = = = 1943 reorganization = = = 
 In 1943 , the formation of the Commando unit was changed . Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group , five fighting troops , a heavy weapons troop , and a signals platoon . The fighting troops consisted of 65 men of all ranks divided into two 30 – man sections which were subdivided into three 10 – man subsections . The heavy weapons troop was made up of 3 @-@ inch mortar and Vickers machine gun teams . The Commandos were provided with the motor transport needed to accompany them on operations . Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer 's car , 15 motorcycles ( six with side cars ) , ten 15 cwt trucks , and three 3 @-@ ton trucks . The heavy weapons troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters . This gave them enough vehicles of their own to accommodate two fighting troops , the heavy weapons troop , and the Commando Headquarters . 
 By now the Commandos started to move away from smaller raiding operations . They were formed into four brigades to spearhead future Allied landing operations . The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges . Of the remaining 20 Commando units , 17 were used in the formation of the four Special Service brigades . The three remaining Commandos ( Nos. 12 , 14 , and 62 ) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids . The increased tempo of operations , together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties , forced their disbandment by the end of 1943 . The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando . 
 From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed . It was responsible for two sub – units : the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings . Both units had an establishment of five troops and a heavy weapons troop of fully trained commandos . The men in these troops were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the Commando units in the field . In December 1944 , the four Special Service brigades were re @-@ designated as Commando brigades . 
 = = Training = = 
 When the Commando units were originally formed in 1940 , training was the responsibility of the unit commanding officers . Training was hampered by the general shortage of equipment throughout the British Army at this time , as most arms and equipment had been left behind at Dunkirk . In December 1940 a Middle East Commando depot was formed with the responsibility of training and supplying reinforcements for the Commando units in that theatre . In February 1942 the Commando training depot at Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands was established by Brigadier Charles Haydon . Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Vaughan , the Commando depot was responsible for training complete units and individual replacements . The training regime was for the time innovative and physically demanding , and far in advance of normal British Army training . The depot staff were all hand picked , with the ability to outperform any of the volunteers . Training and assessment started immediately on arrival , with the volunteers having to complete an 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) march with all their equipment from the <unk> Bridge railway station to the commando depot . When they arrived they were met by Vaughan , who stressed the physical demands of the course and that any man who failed to live up to the requirements would be ' returned to unit ' ( RTU ) . 
 Exercises were conducted using live ammunition and explosives to make training as realistic as possible . Physical fitness was a prerequisite , with cross country runs and boxing matches to improve fitness . Speed and endurance marches were conducted up and down the nearby mountain ranges and over assault courses that included a zip @-@ line over Loch Arkaig , all while carrying arms and full equipment . Training continued by day and night with river crossings , mountain climbing , weapons training , unarmed combat , map reading , and small boat operations on the syllabus . Living conditions were primitive in the camp , with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts and they were responsible for cooking their own meals . Correct military protocols were enforced : Officers were saluted and uniforms had to be clean , with brasses and boots shining on parade . At the end of each course the final exercise was a simulated night beach landing using live ammunition . 
 Another smaller Commando depot , known as the Commando Mountain and Snow Warfare training camp , was established at Braemar . This camp was run by two famous mountaineers : the depot commander Squadron Leader Frank Smythe and chief instructor Major John Hunt . The depot provided training for operations in Arctic conditions , with instruction in climbing snow @-@ covered mountains , cliff climbing , and small boat and canoe handling . Training was conducted in how to live , fight , and move on foot or on skis in snowy conditions . 
 A major change in the training programme occurred in 1943 . From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations . Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire , and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces . More emphasis was put on joint training , with two or more Commando units working together in brigades . By the end of the war 25 @,@ 000 men had passed through the Commando course at Achnacarry . This total includes not only the British volunteers , but volunteers from Belgium , France , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , and the United States Army Rangers , which were modelled on the Commandos . 
 = = = Weapons and equipment = = = 
 As a raiding force , the Commandos were not issued the heavy weapons of a normal infantry battalion . The weapons used were the standard British Army small arms of the time ; most riflemen carried the Lee – Enfield rifle and section fire support was provided by the Bren light machine gun . The Thompson was the submachine gun of choice , but later in the war the Commandos also used the cheaper and lighter Sten gun . Commando sections were equipped with a higher number of Bren and Thompson guns than a normal British infantry section . The Webley Revolver was initially used as the standard sidearm , but it was eventually replaced by the Colt 45 pistol , which used the same ammunition as the Thompson submachine gun . One weapon specifically designed for the Commandos was the De Lisle carbine . Modelled on the Lee – Enfield rifle and fitted with a silencer , it used the same .45 cartridge as the Thompson and was designed to eliminate sentries during Commando raids . Some were used and proved successful on operations , but the nature of the Commando role had changed before they were put into full production and the order for their purchase was cancelled . The Fairbairn @-@ Sykes Fighting Knife was designed especially for Commandos ' use in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , although a whole range of clubs and knives were used in the field . Some of the heavier and crew – served weapons used included the Boys anti @-@ tank rifle and the 2 @-@ inch mortar for indirect fire support . After 1943 , the Projector , Infantry , Anti Tank , known as the PIAT , replaced the now obsolete Boys anti @-@ tank rifle . With the formation of the heavy weapons troops , Commandos were issued the 3 @-@ inch mortar and the Vickers machine gun . The issue of the medium Vickers machine gun to Commando units set them apart from typical British Army infantry divisions , who tended to only employ the weapon in specialist machine gun battalions . 
 Initially the Commandos were indistinguishable from the rest of the British Army and volunteers retained their own regimental head @-@ dress and insignia . No. 2 Commando adopted Scottish head @-@ dress for all ranks and No. 11 ( Scottish ) Commando wore the Tam O <unk> with a black hackle . The official head @-@ dress of the Middle East Commandos was a bush hat with their own <unk> cap badge . This badge was modelled on their issue fighting knife ( the Mark I trench knife ) which had a <unk> for a handle . In 1942 the green Commando beret and the Combined Operations tactical recognition flash were adopted . 
 As the men were equipped for raiding operations and only lightly armed , they did not carry anti @-@ gas protective equipment or large packs , and the standard British steel helmet was replaced by a woollen cap comforter . Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently . All ranks carried a toggle rope , several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles . During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety . The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition , explosives , and other demolition equipment . A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces ' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war . 
 = = Operations = = 
 The very first Commando raid – Operation Collar on 23 June 1940 – was not actually carried out by a Commando unit , but by one of their predecessors : No.11 Independent Company . The mission , led by Major Ronnie Tod , was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer and Le Touquet . The operation was a limited success ; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke , who had accompanied the raiders as an observer . A second and similarly inconsequential raid , Operation Ambassador , was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey on the night of 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company . One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came over their heads . Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings . When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore , and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up . 
 The size of the raiding force depended on the objective . The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10 @,@ 500 man Operation Jubilee . Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some , like Operation Gauntlet , were conducted over a number of days . In north west Europe there were 57 raids made between 1940 and 1944 . Of these 36 were against targets in France . There were 12 raids against Norway , seven raids in the Channel Islands , and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands . The success of the raids varied ; Operation Chariot , the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire , has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time , but others , like Operation Aquatint and Operation <unk> , resulted in the capture or death of all involved . The smaller raids ended in mid @-@ 1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock , who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences , something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans . 
 = = = Norway = = = 
 The first Commando raid in Norway , Operation Claymore , was conducted in March 1941 by men of No.s 3 and 4 Commandos . This was the first large scale raid from the United Kingdom during the war . Their objective was the undefended Norwegian Lofoten Islands . They successfully destroyed the fish @-@ oil factories , petrol dumps , and 11 ships , while capturing 216 Germans , encryption equipment , and codebooks . 
 In December 1941 there were two raids . The first was Operation <unk> , a raid on the Lofoten Islands by No. 12 Commando on 26 December . The German garrison was in the midst of their Christmas celebrations and was easily overcome ; the Commandos re @-@ embarked after two days . Operation Archery was a larger raid at <unk> Island . This raid involved men from Nos. 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 Commandos , a Royal Navy flotilla , and limited air support . The raid caused significant damage to factories , warehouses , and the German garrison , and sank eight ships . After this the Germans increased the garrison in Norway by an extra 30 @,@ 000 troops , upgraded coastal and inland defences , and sent a number of capital ships to the area . 
 In September 1942 men from No. 2 Commando took part in Operation <unk> , a raid against the <unk> hydroelectric power plant . The Commandos were landed by submarine and succeeded in blowing up some pipelines , turbines , and tunnels . This effectively destroyed the generating station and the aluminium plant was shut down permanently . One Commando was killed in the raid and another seven were captured while trying to escape . They spent a short time at Colditz Castle before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp . Shortly after their arrival at <unk> they were executed . They were the first victims of the secret Commando Order , which mandated the execution of all captured Commandos . The three remaining Commandos managed to reach Sweden and were eventually returned to No. 2 Commando . 
 In 1943 , the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) , No. 12 , and No. 14 ( Arctic ) Commandos assisted the Royal Navy in carrying out anti – shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters . The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were at anchor in the Norwegian fjords . In April 1943 , seven men of No. 14 ( Arctic ) Commando took part in a raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate . They managed to sink several ships using limpet mines , but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camps , where they were executed . 
 The Germans responded to the numerous raids directed at Norway by increasing the number of troops stationed there . By 1944 the garrison had risen to 370 @,@ 000 men . In comparison , a British infantry division in 1944 had an establishment of 18 @,@ 347 men . 
 = = = Channel Islands = = = 
 There were seven Commando missions carried out on the Channel Islands . Operation Ambassador was the first and largest of these , employing 140 men from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company in a night raid on 14 July 1940 . Later raids were much smaller ; only 12 men of No. 62 Commando took part in Operation Dryad in September 1942 , when they captured seven prisoners and located several German codebooks . Operation Branford , a reconnaissance mission that aimed to identify a suitable gun position to support future raids on Alderney , followed only days later . In October of that year 12 men from No.s 12 and 62 Commandos took part in Operation Basalt , a raid on Sark that saw four Germans killed and one taken prisoner . 
 All the other Channel Islands raids were less successful . In January 1943 , Operation <unk> , a raid on Herm , was a failure . After three attempts to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top , but there were no signs of any German occupation troops or of the island 's population . The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943 . The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield . The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation . In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark , but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island 's cliffs .

 During 1941 , the Middle East Commandos and Layforce were tasked to carry out a campaign of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean . At the time that Layforce was raised , the British had the ascendency in the theatre , as they had largely defeated the Italians . It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes . However , the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook . By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire . The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve . As the strategic situation worsened , it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner intended , as they were called upon as reinforcements to the rest of the army . 
 In May 1941 the majority of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete . Almost as soon as they landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south . They were ill equipped for this type of operation , as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery ; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns . By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos , running low on ammunition , rations , and water , fell back towards Sphakia . In the end , the vast majority of the commandos were left behind on the island , becoming prisoners of war . About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed , missing , or wounded ; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island . In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid , but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength . Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances . The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid , combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept , had largely served to make the force ineffective . The decision was made to disband Layforce . 
 In November 1942 , No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos formed part of the spearhead for Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch . Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes like the Attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir . As a result , the decision was made for the Commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders . The Tunisia Campaign followed the Torch landings . No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos were involved in the first battle of <unk> between February and March 1943 . Both Commando units remained in theatre until April , when the decision was made to withdraw them from the fighting in North Africa . Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units , the strength of the two units had fallen and they were no longer considered effective . 
 In May 1943 a Special Service Brigade comprising No. 2 , No. 3 , No. 40 ( RM ) , and No. 41 ( RM ) Commandos was sent to the Mediterranean to take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily . The two Royal Marines Commandos were the first into action , landing ahead of the main force . The 2nd Special Service Brigade serving in the Italian campaign was joined in November 1943 by the Belgian and Polish Troops of No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando . The Polish troop captured a German occupied village on its own when the 2 / 6th Battalion Queen 's Regiment failed to reach a rendezvous on time . On 2 April 1945 the whole of the now named 2nd Commando Brigade were engaged in Operation Roast at Comacchio lagoon in north east Italy . This was the first major action of the big spring offensive to push the Germans back across the River Po and out of Italy . After a fierce three @-@ day battle the Commandos succeeded in clearing the spit separating the lagoon from the Adriatic and secured the flank of the 8th Army . This fostered the idea that the main offensive would be along the coast and not though the <unk> Gap . Major Anders Lassen ( Special Air Service ) and Corporal Thomas Peck Hunter No. 43 ( Royal Marine ) Commando were each awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for their actions during Operation Roast . 
 = = = France = = = 
 There were 36 Commando raids targeted against France between 1940 – 1944 , mostly small affairs involving between 10 and 25 men . Some of the larger raids involved one or more commando units . In March 1942 , No. 2 Commando plus demolition experts from seven other Commando units took part in Operation Chariot , also known as the St. Nazaire Raid . The destroyer HMS Campbeltown , accompanied by 18 smaller ships , sailed into St. Nazaire where Campbeltown was rammed directly into the Normandie dock gates . The Commandos engaged the German forces and destroyed the dock facilities . Eight hours later , delayed @-@ action fuses set off the explosives in the Campbeltown , which wrecked the dock gates and killed some 360 Germans and French . A total of 611 soldiers and sailors took part in Chariot ; 169 were killed and 200 ( most wounded ) taken prisoner . Only 242 men returned . Of the 241 Commandos who took part 64 were killed or missing and 109 captured . Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman and Sergeant Thomas Durrant of the Commandos , plus three members of the Royal Navy , were awarded the Victoria Cross . Eighty others received decorations for gallantry . 
 On 19 August 1942 a major landing took place at the French coastal town of Dieppe . The main force was provided by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division , supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos . The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval that was in a position to fire upon the landing at Dieppe . The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German coastal convoy . Only a handful of commandos , under the second in command Major Peter Young , landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs . Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire . Although unable to destroy the guns , they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire . In a subsidiary operation No. 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at <unk> . Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England . Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid . 
 During the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944 two Special Service Brigades were deployed . The 1st Special Service Brigade landed behind the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword Beach . Their main objective was to fight through to the 6th Airborne Division that had landed overnight and was holding the northern flank and the bridges over the Orne River . The Commandos cleared the town of Ouistreham and headed for the bridges , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) away . Arriving at the Pegasus Bridge , the Commandos fought on the left flank of the Orne bridgehead until they were ordered to withdraw . The brigade remained in Normandy for ten weeks , sustaining 1 @,@ 000 casualties , including the brigade commander , Brigadier Lord Lovat . The all Royal Marines 4th Special Service Brigade was also involved in the Normandy landings . No. 48 Commando landed on the left flank of Juno Beach and No. 41 Commando landed on the right flank of Sword Beach and then assaulted Lion @-@ sur @-@ Mer . No. 48 Commando landed in front of the St. Aubin @-@ sur @-@ Mer strong point and lost forty percent of its men . The last 4th Brigade unit ashore was No. 47 Commando , which landed on Gold Beach near the town of <unk> . Five of the Landing Craft Assault carrying them ashore were sunk by mines and beach obstacles , which resulted in the loss of 76 of their 420 men . These losses delayed their advance to their primary objective , the port of Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin , which they captured the following day .

 The Battle of the Scheldt started 1 November 1944 , with 4th Special Service Brigade assigned to carry out a seaborne assault on the island of Walcheren . The plan was for the island to be attacked from two directions , with the Commandos coming by sea and the Canadian 2nd Division and the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division attacking across the causeway . No. 4 Commando landed at Flushing and No. 41 and 48 at Westkapelle . No. 47 Commando was held in reserve and landed after No.s 41 and 48 . They were to advance past No. 48 Commando and attempt to link up with No. 4 Commando in the south . On the first day No. 41 captured an artillery observation tower at Westkapelle and cleared the rest of the town . They then moved along the coast and dealt with the coastal defence installations . 
 No. 48 Commando quickly captured a radar station and then advanced on a gun battery south of Westkapelle , which was captured before nightfall . On 2 November No. 47 Commando advanced through No. 48 Commando to attack a gun battery at <unk> . The attack failed , with the unit suffering heavy casualties , including all the rifle troop commanders . The next day No. 47 , supported by No. 48 Commando , again attacked the <unk> gun battery . This time they managed to continue the advance and link up with No. 4 Commando . The capture of these batteries allowed the navy to start sweeping the channel into Antwerp for mines . On 5 November , No. 41 Commando captured the gun battery north east of <unk> ; this left only one battery still under German control . The brigade regrouped and concentrated its assault on the last position . Just before the attack began on 9 November , the 4 @,@ 000 men in the battery surrendered . This was quickly followed by the surrender of the rest of the island 's garrison .

 In January 1945 the 1st Commando Brigade were involved in Operation <unk> , where Lance Corporal Henry Harden of the Royal Army Medical Corps , attached to No. 45 ( Royal Marine ) Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 The 1st Commando Brigade next took part in Operation Plunder , the crossing of the Rhine River in March 1945 . After a heavy artillery bombardment on the evening of 23 March 1945 , the brigade carried out the initial assault under cover of darkness with the 15th ( Scottish ) Division and the 51st ( Highland ) Division . The Germans had moved most of their reserve troops to the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen , which had just been captured by the U.S. 9th Armored Division . The Commandos crossed the Rhine at a point 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Wesel . Their crossing was unopposed and the brigade headed to the outskirts of Wesel . Here they waited until a raid of 200 bombers of the Royal Air Force finished their attack , during which over 1 @,@ 000 tons of bombs were dropped . Moving into the city just after midnight , the Commandos met resistance from defenders organised around an anti @-@ aircraft division . It was not until 25 March that all resistance ended and the brigade declared the city taken .

 During the Burma Campaign in 1944 – 1945 , the 3rd Commando Brigade participated in several coastal landings of the Southern Front offensive . These landings culminated in the battle of Hill 170 at <unk> . Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross . The Commandos ' victory in the 36 @-@ hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division . Further amphibious landings by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the overland advance of the 82nd ( West Africa ) Division made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable . A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty @-@ Eighth Japanese Army . The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation Zipper , the planned invasion of Malaya . The Zipper landings were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead .

 At the end of the Second World War all the British Army , Royal Navy , Royal Air Force , and some Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded , leaving only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade ( with supporting Army elements ) . As of 2010 the British Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade , which consists of both Royal Marines and British Army components , as well as commando @-@ trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force . Other units of the British armed forces that can trace their origins to the British Commandos of the Second World War are the Parachute Regiment , the Special Air Service , and the Special Boat Service . 
 Of the Western nations represented in No. 10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando only Norway did not develop a Commando force . The French troops were the predecessors of the Naval commandos . The Dutch Troops were the predecessors of the Korps <unk> and the Belgian Troops were the predecessors of the Paracommando Brigade . The 1st Battalion of the United States Army Rangers were also influenced by the British Commandos . Their first volunteers were from troops stationed in Northern Ireland , who were sent to train at the Commando depot at Achnacarry . However , subsequent Ranger battalions were formed and trained independent of British influence . 
 The men serving with the Commandos were awarded 479 decorations during the war . This includes eight Victoria Crosses awarded to all ranks . Officers were awarded 37 Distinguished Service Orders with nine bars for a second award and 162 Military Crosses with 13 bars . Other ranks were awarded 32 Distinguished Conduct Medals and 218 Military Medals . In 1952 the Commando Memorial was unveiled by the Queen Mother . It is now a Category A listed monument in Scotland , dedicated to the men of the original British Commando Forces raised during Second World War . Situated around a mile from <unk> Bridge village , it overlooks the training areas of the Commando Training Depot established in 1942 at Achnacarry Castle .

 In the British Army battle honours are awarded to regiments that have seen active service in a significant engagement or campaign , generally ( although not always ) one with a victorious outcome . The following battle honours were awarded to the British Commandos during the Second World War . 
 = USS Arizona ( BB @-@ 39 ) = 
 USS Arizona was a Pennsylvania @-@ class battleship built for and by the United States Navy in the mid @-@ 1910s . Named in honor of the 48th state 's recent admission into the union , the ship was the second and last of the Pennsylvania class of " super @-@ dreadnought " battleships . Although commissioned in 1916 , the ship remained stateside during World War I. Shortly after the end of the war , Arizona was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference . The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the Greco @-@ Turkish War to represent American interests for several months . Several years later , she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and remained there for the rest of her career . 
 Aside from a comprehensive modernization in 1929 – 31 , Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars , including the annual Fleet Problems ( training exercises ) . When an earthquake struck Long Beach , California , in 1933 , Arizona 's crew provided aid to the survivors . Two years later , the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film , Here Comes the Navy , about the romantic troubles of a sailor . In April 1940 , she and the rest of the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , as a deterrent to Japanese imperialism . 
 During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , Arizona was bombed . She exploded and sank , killing 1 @,@ 177 officers and crewmen . Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day , Arizona could not be fully salvaged , though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse . The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial , dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack , straddles the ship 's hull . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Pennsylvania @-@ class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors , the Nevada class . Arizona had an overall length of 608 feet ( 185 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 97 feet ( 29 @.@ 6 m ) ( at the waterline ) , and a draft of 29 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . This was 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) longer than the older ships . She displaced 29 @,@ 158 long tons ( 29 @,@ 626 t ) at standard and 31 @,@ 917 long tons ( 32 @,@ 429 t ) at deep load , over 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 060 t ) more than the older ships . The ship had a metacentric height of 7 @.@ 82 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) at deep load . 
 The ship had four direct @-@ drive Parsons steam turbine sets , each of which drove a propeller 12 feet 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) in diameter . They were powered by twelve Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) , but only achieved 33 @,@ 376 shp ( 24 @,@ 888 kW ) during Arizona 's sea trials , when she met her designed speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . However , she did manage to reach 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) during a full @-@ power trial in September 1924 . She was designed to normally carry 1 @,@ 548 long tons ( 1 @,@ 573 t ) of fuel oil , but had a maximum capacity of 2 @,@ 305 long tons ( 2 @,@ 342 t ) . At full capacity , the ship could steam at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) for an estimated 7 @,@ 552 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 990 km ; 8 @,@ 690 mi ) with a clean bottom . She had four 300 @-@ kilowatt ( 402 hp ) turbo generators . 
 Arizona carried twelve 45 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ inch guns in triple gun turrets . The turrets were numbered from I to IV from front to rear . The guns could not elevate independently and were limited to a maximum elevation of + 15 ° which gave them a maximum range of 21 @,@ 000 yards ( 19 @,@ 000 m ) . The ship carried 100 shells for each gun . Defense against torpedo boats was provided by twenty @-@ two 51 @-@ caliber five @-@ inch guns mounted in individual casemates in the sides of the ship 's hull . Positioned as they were they proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas . At an elevation of 15 ° , they had a maximum range of 14 @,@ 050 yards ( 12 @,@ 850 m ) . Each gun was provided with 230 rounds of ammunition . The ship mounted four 50 @-@ caliber three @-@ inch guns for anti @-@ aircraft defense , although only two were fitted when completed . The other pair were added shortly afterward on top of Turret III . Arizona also mounted two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes and carried 24 torpedoes for them . 
 The Pennsylvania @-@ class design continued the all @-@ or @-@ nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the ship begun in the Nevada class . The waterline armor belt of Krupp armor measured 13 @.@ 5 inches ( 343 mm ) thick and only covered the ship 's machinery spaces and magazines . It had a total height of 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) , of which 8 feet 9 @.@ 75 inches ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) was below the waterline ; beginning 2 feet 4 inches ( 0 @.@ 7 m ) below the waterline , the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of 8 inches ( 203 mm ) . The transverse bulkheads at each end of the ship ranged from 13 to 8 inches in thickness . The faces of the gun turrets were 18 inches ( 457 mm ) thick while the sides were 9 – 10 inches ( 229 – 254 mm ) thick and the turret roofs were protected by 5 inches ( 127 mm ) of armor . The armor of the barbettes was 18 to 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 457 to 114 mm ) thick . The conning tower was protected by 16 inches ( 406 mm ) of armor and had a roof eight inches thick . 
 The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) ; over the steering gear the armor increased to 6 @.@ 25 inches ( 159 mm ) in two plates . Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from 1 @.@ 5 to 2 inches ( 38 to 51 mm ) in thickness . The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical mantlet that ranged from 9 to 15 inches ( 230 to 380 mm ) in thickness . A three @-@ inch torpedo bulkhead was placed 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) inboard from the ship 's side and the ship was provided with a complete double bottom . Testing in mid @-@ 1914 revealed that this system could withstand 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) of TNT .

 The keel of battleship number 39 was laid on the morning of 16 March 1914 with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt in attendance . The builders intended to set a world @-@ record ten months between the ship 's keel @-@ laying and launch , for what the New York Times declared would be " the world 's biggest and most powerful , both offensively and defensively , superdreadnought ever constructed , " but the ship was only a little over half complete a year later . She was launched on 19 June 1915 , making it about fifteen months from keel @-@ laying to launch . In the meantime , the ship was named after the newest state in the union by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels . 
 The New York Times estimated that 75 @,@ 000 people attended the launch , including John <unk> Mitchel , the mayor of New York City , George W. P. Hunt , the governor of Arizona , and many high @-@ ranking military officials . Several warships were also nearby , including many of the new dreadnoughts which had already entered service ( Florida , Utah , Wyoming , Arkansas , New York , and Texas ) . Esther Ross , the daughter of an Arizona pioneer family , was given the honors of ship sponsor and christening . To acknowledge a ban on alcohol recently passed by the state legislature , the state 's governor decided that two bottles would be used : one full of sparkling wine from Ohio , and another filled with water from the Roosevelt Dam . After the launch , Arizona was towed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for fitting @-@ out . 
 Arizona was commissioned into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain . She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after the crew had cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock . After <unk> the ship 's magnetic compasses , the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise . Outside Guantanamo Bay , a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs , although she was able to enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19 – 20 December . The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship , so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out . It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard .

 Arizona left the yard on 3 April 1917 , and three days later , the United States declared war on Germany . Assigned to Battleship Division 8 operating out of the York River , Arizona was only employed as a gunnery training ship for the crewmen on armed merchant vessels crossing the Atlantic in convoys . Shortly after the war began , eight of her 5 @-@ inch guns ( the four guns farthest forward and the sternmost four guns ) were removed to equip merchant ships . When the ship sailed near the wreck of the old San Marcos ( ex @-@ Texas ) , the wreck was sometimes used as a target for the 14 @-@ inch guns . Arizona rarely ventured into the ocean for fear of U @-@ boats , and when she did , it was only in the company of other battleships and escort ships . Four coal @-@ fired American dreadnoughts were eventually sent across the Atlantic in December 1917 as Battleship Division Nine , but Arizona was not among them , as it was easier to obtain coal than oil in the United Kingdom . Life for Arizona 's crew was not all training as the race @-@ boat team from Arizona was able to win the Battenberg Cup in July 1918 by beating the team from Nevada by three lengths over the three @-@ mile course . 
 The fighting ended on 11 November 1918 with an armistice . A week later , the ship left the United States for the United Kingdom , arriving on 30 November 1918 . After two weeks berthed at Portland Harbor , Arizona sailed for France . On 13 December 1918 , Arizona joined nine battleships and twenty @-@ eight destroyers escorting President Woodrow Wilson on the ocean liner George Washington into Brest for one day on Wilson 's journey to the Paris Peace Conference . The ten battleships departed France the next day , taking less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic , and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades , celebrations , and a full naval review by Secretary Daniels . Arizona was the first in line and rendered a nineteen @-@ gun salute to Daniels . Along with many of the other members of the recently returned fleet , she was anchored off New York City for the next several weeks and open to the public . 
 = = 1920s = = 
 Arizona sailed from New York for Hampton Roads , where she arrived on 22 January , and she continued south to Guantanamo Bay not long after , arriving on 8 February . The time in Caribbean waters was mostly used in training for battles and fleet maneuvering , although it included a liberty visit to Port of Spain . In April , Arizona 's crew won the Battenberg Cup rowing competition for the second straight year before the ship was deployed to France once again to escort President Wilson back to the United States . While the ship was awaiting Wilson 's departure , she was redeployed to Smyrna ( now Izmir ) in Turkey in response to tensions between Greece and Italy over the awarding of Smyrna to Greece in the Paris Peace Treaty . The Greek and Italian governments had each deployed a major warship to the area ( Georgios Averof and Caio Duilio , respectively ) to enforce their interests . Shortly after Arizona arrived , Greek ground forces arrived in transports and were off @-@ loaded in the port . The resultant chaos in the city caused many American citizens in the area to seek shelter on board Arizona . 
 When the crisis abated , Arizona was ordered to Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) before she sailed for home on 15 June . She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul , where six 5 @-@ inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized . Work was completed in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training . During this time , Arizona was fitted with a flying @-@ off platform similar to the one given to Texas in March 1919 . In April , Arizona lost the Battenberg Cup to Nevada , and in June she was present for the Naval Academy 's graduation ceremonies . In August she became the flagship of Battleship Division Seven , although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral 's flagship . 
 In company with six battleships and eighteen destroyers , Arizona was sent south again to transit the Panama Canal in January 1921 . After meeting up with the Pacific Fleet , Arizona continued on to Peru for a week before the two fleets combined to practice battle maneuvers . After a short return to the Atlantic , which included an overhaul in New York , Arizona returned to Peru in the summer before she began operating from her new home port of San Pedro , California , part of Los Angeles , where she was based until 1940 . 
 For the rest of the 1920s , Arizona 's service consisted of routine training exercises . Naval historian Paul Stillwell remarked that " the Pacific years included a great deal of sameness and repetition " , and his chronology of the ship 's movements is filled with phrases like " torpedo @-@ defense practice " , " battle @-@ practice rehearsal " , " gunnery practice " , " en route to … " , and " anchored at … " . A recurring theme in these years were the annual Fleet Problems , which began in 1923 and simulated large fleet actions by having most of the active fleet face off against each other . The first two simulated an attack on the Panama Canal from the west , while in 1925 they attempted to defend the Hawaiian Islands . Other 1920s Fleet Problems included the Caribbean , near Central America , the West Indies , and Hawaii . On 27 July 1923 the ship joined President Warren G. Harding 's naval review in Seattle . Harding died just one week later , and Arizona joined the Pacific Fleet to fire a salute in his honor on 3 August . 
 = = Modernization = = 
 Four months after Fleet Problem IX in January 1929 , Arizona was modernized at the Norfolk Navy Yard . New tripod masts , surmounted by three @-@ tiered fire @-@ control directors for the main and secondary armament , replaced the old hyperboloid cage masts ; the number of 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) guns was reduced to 12 and the guns re @-@ positioned one deck higher , and eight 25 @-@ caliber 5 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft guns replaced the 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns with which she had been originally equipped . The ship 's main gun turrets were modified to increase the maximum elevation of their guns to 30 ° . The compressed @-@ air catapult on the quarterdeck was replaced by one that used black powder . Her deck armor was increased by the addition of a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) thickness of Special Treatment Steel and the ship was bulged to protect her from torpedoes . An additional bulkhead was added to the sides of the boiler rooms for the same purpose . Arizona 's machinery was almost entirely replaced ; her high @-@ pressure turbines were replaced by more powerful geared turbines from the cancelled battleship Washington and six new boilers replaced her originals . Their additional power offset the ship 's increased displacement as demonstrated during her sea trials ; Arizona made 20 @.@ 7 knots ( 38 @.@ 3 km / h ; 23 @.@ 8 mph ) with 35 @,@ 081 shp ( 26 @,@ 160 kW ) at a displacement of 37 @,@ 654 long tons ( 38 @,@ 258 t ) . 
 = = 1930s = = 
 On 19 March 1931 , even before Arizona was put through post @-@ modernization sea trials , she hosted President Herbert Hoover for a brief vacation in the Caribbean . The President visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands . Returning on 29 March , Arizona conducted her sea trials at Rockland , Maine , and had another catapult fitted on the top of Turret III , before she was transferred to the West Coast in August with her sister Pennsylvania . In February 1932 , the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked Pearl Harbor on Sunday morning , 7 February . After returning to the West Coast from Fleet Problem XIV in 1933 , the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby Long Beach , California , on 10 March . Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts , providing food , treating the injured and providing security from looters . 
 In early 1934 , the ship and her crew were featured in a James Cagney film for Warner Brothers , Here Comes the Navy , which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on @-@ board location shots . In the early morning of 26 July , Arizona collided with a fishing trawler , Umatilla , that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery . Two men aboard the Umatilla were killed in the collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident . The court recommended that the ship 's captain , Captain MacGillivray Milne , be court @-@ martialed . This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , Cuba , while the ship was participating in that year 's Fleet Problem off the East Coast . Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast . In the meantime , Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September , with Arizona as his flagship . 
 Rear Admiral George Pettengill relieved Bryant on 4 March 1935 and the ship participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later . Arizona made a port visit to Balboa , Panama , in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII . On 8 June , Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain , and , 15 days later , Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill . During gunnery practice on 24 July , the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret , burning one crewman . The turret 's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion , but the water leaked into the turret 's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out . Due to the navy 's limited budget , the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel @-@ saving measure . In Fiscal Year 1936 – 37 , the ship was anchored for 267 days ; the following year it was in port for 255 days . The ship spent the rest of her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii . 
 On 2 January 1937 , Rear Admiral John Greenslade assumed command of Battleship Division Two from Bloch and transferred his flag to the battleship Maryland on 13 April . Rear Admiral Manley Simons , commander of Battleship Division One , transferred his flag to Arizona on 7 August . He was relieved by Rear Admiral Adolphus Wilson on 8 November . Captain Alfred Winsor Brown relieved Baum on 11 December . The ship participated in Fleet Problem XIX off Hawaii in April – May 1938 . Captain Brown died in his sleep on 7 September and Captain Isaac C. Kidd assumed command of the ship on 17 September 1938 . That same day , Rear Admiral Chester Nimitz assumed command of Battleship Division One . Nimitz was relieved on 27 May 1939 by Rear Admiral Russell Willson . 
 Arizona 's last fleet problem was off Hawaii in April – May 1940 . At its conclusion , the United States Pacific Fleet was retained in Hawaiian waters , based at Pearl Harbor , to deter the Japanese . She was overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard , Bremerton , Washington , from October 1940 to January 1941 . During this refit , her anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased to twelve 5 @-@ inch guns , the foundation for a search radar was added atop her foremast , her anti @-@ aircraft directors were upgraded and a platform for four water @-@ cooled .50 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) caliber M2 Browning machine guns was installed at the very top of the mainmast . Her last flag change @-@ of @-@ command occurred on 23 January 1941 , when Willson was relieved by Isaac Kidd , by that time a rear admiral . Captain Harold C. Train assumed command of the ship on 3 February . 
 Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh relieved Train on 3 February 1941 . The battleship 's last training exercise was night @-@ firing in company with the battleships Nevada and Oklahoma , on the night of 4 December . All three ships moored at quays along Ford Island on the following day . On 6 December , the repair ship Vestal came alongside to assist the ship 's crew with minor repairs . 
 = = Attack on Pearl Harbor = = 
 Shortly before 08 : 00 local time on 7 December 1941 , Japanese aircraft from six aircraft carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor , and wrought devastation on the warships and the facilities defending Hawaii . On board Arizona , the ship 's air raid alarm went off at about 07 : 55 , and the ship went to general quarters soon after . Shortly after 08 : 00 , 10 Nakajima B5N " Kate " torpedo bombers , five each from the carriers Kaga and Hiryū , attacked Arizona . All of the aircraft were carrying 410 @-@ millimeter ( 16 @.@ 1 in ) armor @-@ piercing shells modified into 797 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 757 lb ) bombs . Flying at an estimated altitude of 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) , Kaga 's aircraft bombed Arizona from amidships to stern . Soon after , Hiryu 's bombers hit the bow area . 
 The aircraft scored four hits and three near misses on and around Arizona . The near miss off the port bow is believed to have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed , although no torpedo damage has been found . The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain 's pantry , causing a small fire . The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship , abreast the mainmast , probably detonating in the area of the anti @-@ torpedo bulkhead . The next bomb struck near the port rear 5 @-@ inch AA gun . 
 = = = Magazine explosion = = = 
 The last bomb hit at 08 : 06 in the vicinity of Turret II , likely penetrating the armored deck near the ammunition magazines located in the forward section of the ship . While not enough of the ship is intact to judge the exact location , its effects are indisputable : about seven seconds after the hit , the forward magazines detonated in a cataclysmic explosion , mostly venting through the sides of the ship and destroying much of the interior structure of the forward part of the ship . This caused the forward turrets and conning tower to collapse downward some 25 – 30 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 – 9 @.@ 1 m ) and the foremast and funnel to collapse forward . The explosion killed 1 @,@ 177 of the 1 @,@ 512 crewmen on board at the time , over half of the lives lost during the attack . It touched off fierce fires that burned for two days ; debris showered down on Ford Island in the vicinity . The blast from this explosion also put out fires on the repair ship Vestal , which was moored alongside . 
 Two competing theories have arisen about the cause of the explosion . The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship 's saluting guns and catapult charges . This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship 's main armament . A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open , possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby . The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine . The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament , but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate . Thus the 14 @-@ inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder . The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode . It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found , as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine the cause of the magazine explosion . 
 = = = Awards and recognition = = = 
 After the attack , several sailors received medals for their conduct and actions under fire . Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua , the ship 's damage control officer , earned the Medal of Honor for his cool @-@ headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the ship . Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor also went to Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd , the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war , and to Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh , who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the ammunition magazines destroyed her . The ship herself was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II . 
 = = Salvage and memorial = = 
 Arizona was placed " in ordinary " ( declared to be temporarily out of service ) at Pearl Harbor on 29 December , and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1942 . She was so badly damaged by the magazine explosion that she was not thought fit for service even if she could be salvaged , unlike many of the other sunken ships nearby . Her surviving superstructure was scrapped in 1942 , and her main armament was salvaged over the next year and a half . The aft main gun turrets were removed and reinstalled as United States Army Coast Artillery Corps Battery Arizona at <unk> Point on the west coast of Oahu and Battery Pennsylvania on the <unk> Peninsula , covering Kaneohe Bay at what is now Marine Corps Base Hawaii . Battery Pennsylvania fired its guns for the first and last time on V @-@ J Day in August 1945 while training , while the nearby Battery Arizona was never completed . Both forward turrets were left in place , although the guns from Turret II were salvaged and later installed on the battleship Nevada in the fall of 1944 after having been straightened and relined . Nevada later fired these same guns against the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Iwo Jima .

 It is commonly — albeit incorrectly — believed that Arizona remains perpetually in commission , like the USS Constitution . Arizona is under the control of the National Park Service , but the U.S. Navy still retains the title . Arizona retains the right , in perpetuity , to fly the United States flag as if she were an active , commissioned naval vessel . 
 The wreck of Arizona remains at Pearl Harbor to commemorate the men of her crew lost that December morning in 1941 . On 7 March 1950 , Admiral Arthur W. Radford , commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet at that time , instituted the raising of colors over her remains . Legislation during the administrations of presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy resulted in the designation of the wreck as a national shrine in 1962 . A memorial was built across the ship 's sunken remains , including a shrine room listing the names of the lost crew members on a marble wall . The national memorial was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966 . The ship herself was designated a National Historic Landmark on 5 May 1989 . Upon their death , survivors of the attack may have their ashes placed within the ship , among their fallen comrades . Veterans who served aboard the ship at other times may have their ashes scattered in the water above the ship . 
 While the superstructure and two of the four main gun turrets were removed , the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water . Since her sinking , oil still leaks from the hull , with more than 2 @.@ 3 quarts ( 2 @.@ 18 l ) escaping into the harbor per day . The Navy , in conjunction with the National Park Service , has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull , being careful to honor its role as a war grave . The Navy is considering non @-@ intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor . 
 One of the original Arizona bells now hangs in the University of Arizona Student Union Memorial Center bell tower . The bell is rung after every home football victory . A gun , mast , and anchor from Arizona are in Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza just east of the Arizona state capitol complex in downtown Phoenix , Arizona . The gun 's plaque states that it was not on the ship during the Pearl Harbor attack , but was being relined and was later mounted on USS Nevada ( BB @-@ 36 ) . It is paired with a gun from USS Missouri ( BB @-@ 63 ) to represent the start and end of the Pacific War for the United States . Other artifacts from the ship , such as items from the ship 's silver service , are on permanent exhibit in the Arizona State Capitol Museum . 
 Every two years the Navy awards " The USS Arizona Memorial Trophy " to the ship , determined by the Chief of Naval Operations , to have achieved the highest combat readiness in Strike warfare , Surface Fire Support and Anti @-@ Surface warfare . The 3 foot tall bronze trophy on a black marble base was provided to the Navy by the citizens of the state of Arizona on 7 December 1987 . 
 = History of saffron = 
 Human cultivation and use of saffron spans more than 3 @,@ 500 years and extends across cultures , continents , and civilizations . Saffron , a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus ( Crocus sativus ) , has through history remained among the world 's most costly substances . With its bitter taste , hay @-@ like fragrance , and slight metallic notes , the <unk> @-@ rich saffron has been used as a seasoning , fragrance , dye , and medicine . 
 The saffron crocus is a genetically monomorphic clone native to Southwest Asia ; it was probably first cultivated in or near Greece . The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was likely Crocus cartwrightianus , which originated in Crete or Central Asia ; C. <unk> and C. pallasii are other possible sources . The saffron crocus is now a triploid that is " self @-@ incompatible " and male sterile ; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction — all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual " divide @-@ and @-@ set " of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation . If C. sativus is a mutant form of C. cartwrightianus , then it may have emerged in late Bronze Age Crete . 
 Humans may have bred C. cartwrightianus specimens by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas . The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th @-@ century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal , and it has since been traded and used over the course of four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders . The C. sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia , later reaching parts of North Africa , North America , and Oceania . Global production on a by @-@ mass basis is now dominated by Iran , which accounts for some nine @-@ tenths of the annual harvest . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The ultimate origin of the English word saffron is , like that of the cultivated saffron clone itself , of somewhat uncertain origin . It immediately stems from the Latin word <unk> via the 12th @-@ century Old French term <unk> . Etymology beyond that point is conflicted . <unk> may derive via the Persian intercessor <unk> , or za <unk> . 
 Others give an alternative derivation : that <unk> ( za <unk> ) is the <unk> form of the Persian word <unk> <unk> ( <unk> + par + <unk> — " having yellow leaves " ) . An even older form is the Akkadian <unk> , " saffron " . The Latin form <unk> is also the source of the Catalan <unk> , Italian <unk> , but Portuguese <unk> , and Spanish <unk> come from the Arabic az @-@ <unk> . The Latin term crocus is certainly a Semitic loan word . It is adapted from the Aramaic form <unk> via the Arabic term <unk> and the Greek intermediate <unk> <unk> , which once again signifies " yellowish " . Its ultimate origin might be from the Sanskrit <unk> unless this was itself borrowed from Semitic . 
 = = Minoan and Greco @-@ Roman = = 
 Saffron played a significant role in the Greco @-@ Roman pre @-@ classical period bracketed by the 8th century BC and the 3rd century AD . The first known image of saffron in pre @-@ Greek culture is much older and stems from the Bronze Age . A saffron harvest is shown in the Knossos palace frescoes of Minoan Crete , which depict the flowers being picked by young girls and monkeys . One of these fresco sites is located in the " <unk> 3 " building at Akrotiri , on the Aegean island of Santorini — the ancient Greeks knew it as " Thera . " These frescoes likely date from the 16th or 17th century <unk> but may have been produced anywhere between 3000 – 1100 BC . They portray a Minoan goddess supervising the plucking of flowers and the gleaning of stigmas for use in the manufacture of what is possibly a therapeutic drug . A fresco from the same site also depicts a woman using saffron to treat her bleeding foot . These " Theran " frescoes are the first botanically accurate visual representations of saffron 's use as an herbal remedy . This saffron @-@ growing Minoan settlement was ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent volcanic eruption sometime between 1645 and 1500 BC . The volcanic ash from the destruction entombed and helped preserve these key herbal frescoes . 
 Ancient Greek legends tell of brazen sailors embarking on long and perilous voyages to the remote land of Cilicia , where they traveled to procure what they believed was the world 's most valuable saffron . The best @-@ known Hellenic saffron legend is that of Crocus and Smilax : The handsome youth Crocus sets out in pursuit of the nymph Smilax in the woods near Athens ; in a brief dallying interlude of idyllic love , Smilax is flattered by his amorous advances , but all too soon tires of his attentions . He continues his pursuit ; she resists . She bewitches Crocus : he is transformed — into a saffron crocus . Its radiant orange stigmas were held as a relict glow of an undying and unrequited passion . The tragedy and the spice would be recalled later : 
 Crocus and Smilax may be turn 'd to flow 'rs , 
 And the <unk> spring from bounteous show 'rs 
 I pass a hundred legends stale , as these , 
 And with sweet novelty your taste to please . 
 For the ancient <unk> , saffron gathered around the Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value , particularly for use in perfumes and ointments . Herodotus and Pliny the Elder , however , rated rival Assyrian and Babylonian saffron from the Fertile Crescent as best — to treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets . Greek saffron from the <unk> Cave of Mount Parnassus was also of note : the color offered by the <unk> crocus is used as a benchmark in the Argonautica of Apollonius <unk> and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of Martial . 
 Cleopatra of late Ptolemaic Egypt used a quarter @-@ cup of saffron in her warm baths , as she prized its colouring and cosmetic properties . She used it before encounters with men , trusting that saffron would render lovemaking yet more pleasurable . Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments : when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging , an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with <unk> @-@ tree remnants , ox fat , coriander , and myrrh . This ointment or poultice was applied to the body . The physicians expected it to " [ expel ] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog 's blood when it is cooked " . Urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil @-@ based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans ; this was used topically on men . Women ingested a more complex preparation . 
 In Greco @-@ Roman times saffron was widely traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians . Their customers ranged from the perfumers of Rosetta , in Egypt , to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes , who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre . For the Greeks , saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae . Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute ; there , royal robes were triple @-@ dipped in deep purple dyes ; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners , the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip , which gave a less intense purple hue . 
 The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or <unk> and scattered it about their public spaces : royal halls , courts , and amphitheatres alike . When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets ; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths . They used it as mascara , stirred saffron threads into their wines , cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri , and offered it to their deities . Roman colonists took saffron with them when they settled in southern Roman Gaul , where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy . Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th @-@ century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century . 
 = = Middle Eastern and Persian = = 
 Saffron @-@ based pigments have been found in the prehistoric paints used to illustrate beasts in 50 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old cave art found in modern @-@ day Iraq , which was even then northwest of the Persian Empire . The Sumerians used saffron as an ingredient in their remedies and magical potions . Sumerians did not cultivate saffron . They gathered their stores from wild flowers , believing that divine intervention alone enables saffron 's medicinal properties . Such evidence suggests that saffron was an article of long @-@ distance trade before Crete 's Minoan palace culture reached a peak in the 2nd millennium BC . Saffron was also honoured as a sweet @-@ smelling spice over three millennia ago in the Hebrew Tanakh : 
 Your lips drop sweetness like honeycomb , my bride , syrup and milk are under your tongue , and your dress had the scent of Lebanon . Your cheeks are an orchard of pomegranates , an orchard full of rare fruits , spikenard and saffron , sweet cane and cinnamon . 
 In ancient Persia , saffron ( Crocus sativus ' <unk> ' ) was cultivated at <unk> and Isfahan in the 10th century BC . There , Persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds . Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities , and as a brilliant yellow dye , perfume , and a medicine . Thus , saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy . Indeed , Persian saffron threads , used to spice foods and teas , were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac . These fears grew to <unk> travelers to abstain from eating saffron @-@ laced Persian cuisine . In addition , Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood to use as a body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun . Later , Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns . They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice . Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water , taking after Cyrus the Great . Much like Cyrus , he believed it would heal his many wounds , and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment . He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him . The Greek soldiers , taken with saffron 's perceived curative properties , continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia . 
 = = East and South Asian = = 
 Various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron 's first arrival in South and East Asia . The first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records . These suggest to many experts that saffron , among other spices , was first spread to India via Persian rulers ' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks . They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire . Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes . Once sold , Kashmiri saffron was used in the treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye . 
 On the other hand , traditional Kashmiri legend states that saffron first arrived in the 11th or 12th century AD , when two foreign and itinerant Sufi ascetics , Khwaja Masood Wali and Hazrat Sheikh <unk> , wandered into Kashmir . The foreigners , having fallen sick , beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain . When the chieftain obliged , the two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks . To this day , grateful prayers are offered to the two saints during the saffron harvesting season in late autumn . The saints , indeed , have a golden @-@ domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in the saffron @-@ trading village of <unk> , India . However , the Kashmiri poet and scholar Mohammed Yusuf Teng disputes this . He states that <unk> had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia . Indeed , such ancient indigenous cultivation is alluded to in Kashmiri Tantric Hindu epics of that time . 
 Ancient Chinese Buddhist accounts from the <unk> @-@ <unk> monastic order ( or <unk> ) present yet another account of saffron 's arrival in India . According to legend , an <unk> Indian Buddhist missionary by the name of <unk> ( or <unk> ) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC . Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop . From there , saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent . In addition to use in foods , saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden @-@ yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye . 
 Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia . Saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts , including the vast Bencao Gangmu ( " Great Herbal " ) pharmacopoeia , a tome dating from around 1600 BC ( and attributed to Emperor Shen @-@ Ung ) which documents thousands of <unk> @-@ based medical treatments for various disorders . Yet around the 3rd century AD , the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance . The Chinese medical expert Wan Zhen wrote that " [ t ] he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir , where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha " . Wan reflected on how saffron was used in his time : " The [ saffron crocus ] flower withers after a few days , and then the saffron is obtained . It is valued for its uniform yellow colour . It can be used to <unk> wine . " 
 In modern times saffron cultivation has spread to Afghanistan due to the efforts of the European Union and the United Kingdom . Together they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash @-@ strapped Afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to lucrative — and illicit — opium production .

 Saffron cultivation in Europe declined steeply following the fall of the Roman Empire . For several centuries thereafter , saffron cultivation was rare or non @-@ existent throughout Europe . This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy . One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of Tours to Charles Martel in AD 732 . Two centuries after their conquest of Spain , Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia , Castile , La Mancha , and Valencia . 
 In France , saffron cultivation probably started during the 13th century . Crocus sativus was likely introduced from Spain and from the Middle @-@ East by pilgrims , merchants , and Knights . Its first uses are documented in the south @-@ west of the Kingdom around 1250 . It is indeed unlikely that Kings and Religious didn 't try growing Crocus sativus by that time : Saffron was rare , expensive , and demanded , and Crocus sativus could be farmed under France 's latitudes . By the 14th century , the wide use of saffron for spicing and coloring food is documented in recipe books such as the " Viandier de Taillevent " , written by the King 's cook . And by the 15th century , local saffron farming is attested with taxes levied by the religious power , which reveal how important saffron crops must have been . For instance , in 1478 , the saffron tax levied by the Bishop of Albi reached 1 / 12th of saffron production . 
 Saffron demand skyrocketed when the Black Death of 1347 – 1350 struck Europe . It was coveted by plague victims for medicinal purposes , and yet many of the farmers capable of growing it had died off . Large quantities of non @-@ European saffron thus was imported . The finest saffron threads from Muslim lands were unavailable to Europeans because of hostilities stoked by the Crusades , so Rhodes and other places were key suppliers to central and northern Europe . Saffron was one of the contested points of hostility that flared between the declining landed gentry and upstart and increasingly wealthy merchants . The fourteen @-@ week @-@ long " Saffron War " was ignited when one 800 lb ( 363 kg ) shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by nobles . The load , which was en route to the town of Basel , would at today 's market prices be valued at more than US $ 500 @,@ 000 . That shipment was eventually returned , but the wider 13th – century trade was subject to mass piracy . Thieves plying Mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal <unk> and <unk> @-@ marketed saffron bound for Europe . Wary of such unpleasantness , Basel planted its own corms . Several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests made Basel extremely prosperous compared to other European towns . Citizens sought to protect their status by outlawing the transport of corms out of the town ; guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms . Yet ten years later the saffron harvest had waned . Basel abandoned the crop . 
 The pivot of central European saffron trade moved to Nuremberg . The merchants of Venice continued their rule of the Mediterranean sea trade , trafficking varieties from Sicily , France and Spain , Austria , Crete and Greece , and the Ottoman Empire . <unk> goods also made the rounds : those soaked in honey , mixed with marigold petals , or kept in damp cellars — all to add quick and cheap bulk . Irritated Nuremberg authorities passed the <unk> code to de @-@ louse the saffron trade . <unk> were thus fined , imprisoned , and executed — by immolation . England was next to have its turn as a major producer . One theory has it that the crop spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of Edward III . In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England . Norfolk , Suffolk , and south Cambridgeshire were especially affected with corms . Rowland Parker provides an account of its cultivation in the village of Foxton during the 16th and 17th centuries , " usually by people holding a small amount of land " ; an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth a kingly GB £ 6 , making it " a very profitable crop , provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available ; unpaid labor was one of the basic features of farming then and for another two centuries . " 
 In France , saffron production became very important in the 17th and 18th centuries , reaching a few tons . By then , saffron farming had spread throughout the entire Kingdom . Saffron was especially grown in <unk> , Angoumois , Gascony , Gâtinais , Normandy , Périgord , Poitou , Provence , and Quercy . Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century , possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops , to particularly cold winters , and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries . 
 In England , cultivation persisted only in the light , well @-@ drained , and chalk @-@ based soils of the north Essex countryside . The Essex town of Saffron Walden got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre ; its name was originally <unk> Walden , and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate the importance of the crop to the townsfolk ; the town 's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus . Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages , rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron 's use and cultivation . Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere , unadorned , and <unk> foods . Saffron was also a labor @-@ intensive crop , which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose . And finally , an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent spice trade meant that the English , as well as other Europeans , had many more — and cheaper — seasonings to dally over . 
 This trend was documented by the Dean of Manchester , a Reverend William Herbert . He collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of the saffron crocus . He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation over the course of the 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution ; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes , which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms , did not help . In addition , the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate , coffee , tea , and vanilla . Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain , where the saffron harvest was culturally primal , did significant cultivation prevail .

 Saffron made its way to the New World when thousands of Alsatian , German , and Swiss Anabaptists , Dunkards , and others fled religious persecution in Europe . They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania , in the Susquehanna River valley . These settlers , who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch , were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to America — in a trunk . It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the <unk> Church . <unk> , as members were known , were great lovers of saffron , and had grown it back in Germany . Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean , while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold . 
 However the War of 1812 destroyed many of the merchantmen that ferried American saffron abroad . Pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory , and trade with the Caribbean markets never recovered . Nevertheless , Pennsylvania Dutch growers developed many uses for the now abundant saffron in their own home cooking — cakes , noodles , and chicken or trout dishes . Saffron cultivation survived into modern times principally in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania .

 " Hello Sunshine " is a song by the Welsh band Super Furry Animals from their album Phantom Power . It was the seventeenth single released by the group and reached number 31 on the UK Singles Chart in October 2003 . 
 Several versions of the track were released : the single version omits the short sample of the song " By the Sea " by Wendy and Bonnie which begins the album version , while two remixes , by Weevil and <unk> , appear on the album Phantom Phorce . An animated music video , featuring drawings by regular Super Furries sleeve designer Pete Fowler , was produced to accompany the release of " Hello Sunshine " as a single . The track received mostly positive reviews from critics . 
 The band turned down " a seven @-@ figure offer " from Coca @-@ Cola to allow the use of " Hello Sunshine " in an advertising campaign citing alleged malpractice on the part of the drinks firm . The group have stated that despite the financial incentives of licensing their songs , they are happy to simply be able to make a living from music . 
 = = Recording and themes = = 
 The track begins with a sample of the song " By the Sea " by the teenage sibling duo Wendy and Bonnie , from their 1969 album Genesis , which Super Furries singer Gruff Rhys has described as " amazing songs , amazing lyrics and amazing voices " . The decision to begin the track with a snippet of " By the Sea " came about due to laziness on the band 's part — the track had originally being conceived as a duet but the group " never got around to getting anyone to sing " with them so they " chopped up the Wendy & Bonnie song and stuck it on [ as ] it 's in the same key [ and ] seemed to make sense " . The edit version , issued as a single , does not contain the sample . 
 " Hello Sunshine " shares the same key , D major , the same guitar tuning , D @-@ A @-@ D @-@ D @-@ A @-@ D , and was written around the same time as several other songs from Phantom Power including the " Father Father " instrumentals , " Golden Retriever " , " Cityscape Skybaby " and " Out of Control " . The track was recorded at the Super Furry Animals ' own studio in Cardiff along with the rest of Phantom Power . Rhys has stated that the song is " a courting ballad with a ' been so down looks like up to me ' mentality " . 
 = = Musical structure = = 
 The album version of " Hello Sunshine " is 3 minutes 35 seconds long and is in the key of D major . The track begins with 43 seconds of the track " By the Sea " from Wendy & Bonnie 's 1969 album Genesis featuring sparse fingerstyle guitar and female harmony vocals . The last syllable of the line " ... so hard to say goodbye " is held and pans from left to right until " Hello Sunshine " itself begins with Gruff Rhys singing the title phrase , joined by the band on the second word . The first verse follows with simple piano and bass guitar backing Rhys 's acoustic guitar to a basic 4 / 4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan . The first chorus enters at 1 minute 13 seconds with Rhys being joined by falsetto harmony backing vocals on the lines " In honesty it 's been a while , since we had reason left to smile " . The song breaks down for the bridge with just arpeggio guitar , simple bass and occasional drum rolls playing as the lines " Hello sunshine , come into my life " are sung . 
 Another verse follows featuring the lyrics " I 'm a minger , you 're a minger too , so come on minger , I want to ming with you " ( quoted in many reviews of Phantom Power ) before the second chorus . This time the bridge leads , not into another verse , but the song 's middle 8 which again sees Rhys backed by multiple falsetto harmony backing vocals . The outro follows during which the title phrase is sung five times before a lead guitar line heralds the end of the song with Rhys singing " Come into my life " .

 A radio edit of " Hello Sunshine " was issued to radio stations and was also used in the music video . This version of the track is 2 minutes and 54 seconds long and omits the opening extract from " By the Sea " . The rest of song is identical to the album version . 
 Two remixes were included on the DVD version of Phantom Power and the album Phantom Phorce . The first , by Weevil , is 4 minutes 22 seconds in length and is largely based around samples of lead guitar from the track along with occasional snippets of Rhys 's vocal . Samples of Ieuan 's drums are also used in the second half of the song . The track ends with a brief clip of the band 's road manager , in the guise of ' Kurt Stern ' , giving a fictionalised account of Phantom Power 's production . The second remix , by <unk> , is 10 minutes 31 seconds long , is " utterly minimal " and barely resembles the original with no recognisable vocal or musical samples from the album or radio versions .

 " Hello Sunshine " received generally positive reviews with musicOMH calling it " one of the best tracks from … Phantom Power " , and Rolling Stone describing it as a " gorgeous opening track " . The ' summery ' nature of the track was commented on by several journalists with The Observer calling " Hello Sunshine " a " gloriously hazy opener " and Music Critic describing it as " passionately mellow summer doo @-@ wop " . However BBC Wales , although describing the track as " an excellent song and a near perfect album opener " , called the decision to release " Hello Sunshine " as a single " rather mystifying " stating that it is " a world away from the SFA we 've grown to love over the years " . The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 film Snow Cake and also appeared in " The Heartbreak " , an episode of The O.C.

The charity has frequently criticized the Coca @-@ Cola company 's impact on local communities . In late 2005 Rhys reiterated that , although licensing one of their tracks for use in advertising would make a big difference financially , the Super Furries are happy to simply be able to make a living from making music .

 = = Music video = = 
 An animated music video was produced for " Hello Sunshine " , directed by Pete Fowler , Neil McFarland and Passion Pictures and featuring Fowler 's cartoon drawings . The video begins with the sun rising over a country landscape . A small , blue , ' Hello Sunshine ' winged horse flies across the sky and is watched by a man holding a 1 : 16 scale model kit for the same horse . The picture of the horse on the box flies away as he looks at it and lands on one of five hot air balloons flown by cartoon representations of the Super Furry Animals . The video cuts to a brief shot of a man staring through a shop window at an advertising display featuring models of the ' Hello Sunshine ' horse before we see Gruff Rhys coming across a huge statue of the same horse in his car . 
 The next shot shows the ' Hello Sunshine ' horse forming part of a stained glass window in a place of worship as a priest urges his followers ( all dressed in dark blue with a gold pendant of the ' Hello Sunshine ' horse around their necks ) to help him cause two rockets at either side of him to rise into the air and explode in the clouds . These rockets cause a thunder storm . The resultant lightning strikes an ' Hello Sunshine ' horse as it flies through the air and a duplicate horse is created . This happens repeatedly until the sky is full of small horses which fly out of the storm and towards the Super Furries ' hot air balloons . The last section shows the band playing " Hello Sunshine " and being confronted by the ' Hello Sunshine ' horse who Rhys strokes on the nose . The video appears on the DVD release of the band 's greatest hits album Songbook : The Singles , Vol . 1 .

 = Canadian Heraldic Authority = 
 The Canadian Heraldic Authority ( CHA ; French : L <unk> <unk> du Canada ) is part of the Canadian honours system under the Canadian monarch , whose authority is exercised by the Governor General of Canada . The authority is responsible for the creation and granting of new coats of arms ( armorial bearings ) , flags , and badges for Canadian citizens and corporate bodies . The authority also registers existing armorial bearings granted by other recognized heraldic authorities , approves military badges , flags , and other insignia of the Canadian Forces , and provides information on heraldic practices . 
 The CHA is the Canadian counterpart of the College of Arms in London , Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland , and the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland and is well known for its innovative designs , many incorporating First Nations symbolism . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority , Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom : either the College of Arms in London or the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh . This process was quite lengthy — and costly . In addition , the heralds of the College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols . In time , many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office which would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians . 
 As early as 1967 , plans were reportedly in the works to transfer overview of heraldry from the College of Arms in the UK to Canada . The push for a wholly Canadian heraldic system came largely from the Heraldry Society of Canada ( now the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada ) almost from its inception , though it was not seen as a priority by successive national governments . In 1986 , Vicki Huntington , a politician from British Columbia , forwarded a brief written by the <unk> calling for the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority to a staff member in then @-@ Secretary of State David Crombie 's office . Mr. Crombie had his department organise a meeting in Ottawa the following year , to which many national and international heraldic experts were invited . The meeting concluded with " a strong recommendation to government that an Authority be created . " 
 Two years later , the Queen of Canada issued the 1988 letters patent authorising the governor general " to exercise or provide for the exercise of all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to Us as Queen of Canada in respect of the granting of armorial bearings in Canada " . These letters patent were presented by Prince Edward to the governor general on behalf of the Crown . Subsequently , the Governor General , Jeanne Sauvé , authorised the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 4 June 1988 . As a result , Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority . Canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms . Additionally , all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade @-@ Marks Act . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The authority is located at Rideau Hall , the residence of the monarch and governor general . The governor general , as the personal representative of the Canadian sovereign , is the highest authority in Canadian heraldry . Below the governor general is the Herald Chancellor , a position held by the Secretary of the Governor General . The CHA is currently organized in an office called the Chancellery of Honours , the same office that issues Canadian orders and decorations , such as the Order of Canada . The deputy secretary that administers the Chancellery of Honours is also the Deputy Herald Chancellor . 
 The authority itself is headed by the Chief Herald of Canada , whose job is to oversee and direct all operations of the CHA , and bears the main responsibility of granting arms , though the governor general has the authority to grant arms directly . The position of chief herald was inaugurated by Robert Watt at the inception of the CHA in 1988 and held by him until his retirement in 2007 . Since 26 June 2007 , the office of chief herald has been held by Claire Boudreau , formerly Saint @-@ Laurent Herald . 
 = = = Heralds of Arms = = = 
 Below the chief herald are the Heralds of Arms , full @-@ time workers at the CHA and considered part of the Public Service of Canada . The names of the various offices were taken from significant Canadian rivers . Though the titles are territorial designations , as per heraldic tradition , each herald serves the entire country . Each is assigned a badge of office . The Heralds of Arms are : 
 = = = Honorary positions = = = 
 The authority also allows for two types of honorary positions : Heralds Emeritus and Heralds Extraordinary . The emeritus title is reserved for Canadian heralds who have retired ; the title of extraordinary is an honorary position for those who have made notable contributions to heraldry . Honorary heralds can be enlisted by the CHA to perform work for them . Each honorary position grants the individual a badge and a title also based on a Canadian river . 
 Current holders of honorary positions 
 = = Obtaining arms = = 
 = = = Eligibility = = = 
 Any Canadian citizen or corporate body can petition for a grant of new arms or registration of existing arms . In general , eligibility for a grant of arms is based on an individual 's contributions to the community , although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published . A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements , such as through admission to the Order of Canada , and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms . Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters . 
 = = = Grant process = = = 
 In order to request either a coat of arms , flag , and / or badges , a letter must be addressed to the Chief Herald of Canada . The letter must clearly ask " to receive armorial bearings from the Canadian Crown under the powers exercised by the Governor General " and include proof of Canadian citizenship or permanent residence as well as a biography or curriculum vitae of the petitioner . Corporate petitions must include a brief history of the company , proof of incorporation in Canada , financial reports , and a copy of the corporation 's governing body resolution seeking a grant of arms . 
 The Chief Herald of Canada can approve or reject the petition . If the petition is approved , the authority to make the grant is given through a warrant signed by the Herald Chancellor or the Deputy Herald Chancellor . The authorisation is then sent to one of the heralds , and the process begins . The granting of arms is regarded as an honour from the monarch , via the governor general , and thus are bestowed only on those whom the Chief Herald has deemed individuals worthy of receiving a grant of arms . 
 First , the assigned herald develops a written description based on consultation with the petitioner . The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design . The Fraser Herald , serving as the CHA 's principal artist , must review the design . At all stages the documents must be approved by both the petitioner and the Chief Herald . The final step is to prepare the letters patent , the official notice of an award of arms , which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings . Under Canadian bilingualism laws , letters patent are written in both English and French , though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document . 
 Completed grant documents are recorded in the Public Register of Arms , Flags and Badges of Canada and the notice of the grant is published in the Canada Gazette , Part I , under the section " Government House " . 
 The Government of Canada requires that the above processes be financed by the petitioner ; that is the person requesting the grant or registration of arms , who pays the fees associated with the request and grant / registration . The processing fee for all petitioners is CAD $ 435 ( plus GST ) , with the cost of one preliminary design ranging from $ 200 to $ 1 @,@ 000 . The cost of the final design , as illustrated on the letters patent , ranges from $ 900 to $ 3 @,@ 500 . In Canada , the petitioner does not " buy " a coat of arms , the arms themselves are freely given to qualified individuals , but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists for the services rendered . The average time needed to complete a grant is about 12 to 14 months , though it can take longer for particularly detailed or intricate arms . 
 = = = Registration of existing arms = = = 
 Those individuals and institutions who already possess legitimate awards of arms may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered . There is no cost associated with application for registration and it takes less time , approximately three months , than application for a new award of arms .

 The current arms of the authority were confirmed in a warrant by the Governor General on 15 January 1994 , in honour of the authority 's fifth anniversary , which was celebrated the previous year . The full armorial bearings of the Canadian Heraldic Authority incorporate aboriginal symbolism , as seen in the mythical raven @-@ bears , as well as the national symbol of the maple leaf and the traditional Canadian colours of red and white , which were made official by King George V in 1921 . 
 The crest is a modification of the Royal Crest of Canada : a lion wearing a crown and bearing a maple leaf . The crest of the authority features the same lion , instead holding a white shield containing a red maple leaf , symbolising the governor general 's authority under the Crown to grant armorial bearings to Canadians . 
 The shield itself is white with a red maple leaf , similar to the middle portion of the Canadian flag . The white shield upon the leaf represents " a sign of heraldry to be created and recorded for Canadians . " 
 The raven @-@ bears , a new heraldic beast which combined several creatures that are important to aboriginal symbolism , were proposed by the heralds in honour of the United Nations ' International Year of the World 's Indigenous Peoples , also occurring in 1993 . The raven @-@ bears are standing on an outcrop of what is known as the Canadian Shield , a geological formation which the authority foundation is based on . The Canadian Shield is formed by rocks , which are covered in red coloured maple leaves and by golden maple seeds . The motto that was chosen is Latin for Let us honour those who honour our country . 
 The shield and crest alone comprise the Badge of the CHA , which is used on the seal of the Authority and on the letters patent that grant and register armorial bearings . A wreath behind the arms is composed of red maple leaves bound with gold straps .

 " Holidays of Future Passed " is the ninth episode of the twenty @-@ third season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 11 , 2011 . Most of the episode is set thirty years into the future , when Bart and Lisa take their children with them to Homer and Marge 's house over Christmas , while a pregnant Maggie goes into labor . Bart has divorced his wife Jenda and is struggling to become a better father for his two boys , while Lisa has trouble connecting with her rebellious teenage daughter Zia . The Simpsons creator Matt Groening made a minor uncredited cameo appearance as a sports commentator shouting " goal ! " during a football ( soccer ) game . 
 Originally written as a potential series finale , the episode has received highly positive reception from television critics who often cited it as the best episode of the season . It has been particularly praised for its humor and for its emotional scenes , such as one where Bart and Lisa sit in their old treehouse and talk about how difficult parenting is . During the original broadcast , " Holidays of Future Passed " was watched by about 6 @.@ 43 million people . Since then , it has garnered attention in the media for a segment taking place thirty years in the future in which it is implied that the city of Dearborn , Michigan is " still under sharia law " . Commentators have had mixed opinions on what the segment is mocking , whether it is the increasing Islamic influence in the US , specifically in Dearborn , or rather those who are thinking that Dearborn is under sharia law in December 2011 , the time that the episode aired .

 After stuffing themselves with turkey on Thanksgiving , it is time to take the annual Christmas card family photo , and when Bart and Lisa complain about it , Marge notes that they will grow to appreciate the photos when they become older and have children of their own . Lisa questions why Marge would assume they will even have children in the first place , and the episode jumps thirty years into the future via a series of Simpsons Christmas cards . The photos finally settle on a future where Bart is a jobless , divorced dad with two sons whom he does not see often ; Lisa is a successful businesswoman who is married to Milhouse and has a rebellious daughter named Zia ; and Maggie is the lead singer of a famous band and in the late stages of pregnancy . In his apartment , Bart is visited by his sons , who inform him that their mother Jenda teleported them to his place because she wants him to act like a proper father by having him spend time with them . However , he plans on dropping them off at his parents ' house instead . Meanwhile , Lisa fears that Zia is spending too much of her time going into the " Ultranet " , a digital world that people enter with their consciousness by plugging themselves into a laptop . Milhouse suggests to Lisa that she spend time with Zia in order for them to have a better connection , so Lisa decides to take Zia to her parents ' house . Meanwhile , Maggie flies home from London to Springfield to celebrate Christmas with her parents . 
 When Bart and Lisa arrive at their parents ' home , they stay there with their children . Unfortunately for Lisa , she only gets unhelpful advice from Marge on how to be a better parent , while Zia continues to go into the Ultranet . A furious Lisa ignores it and accuses Marge of being a bad parent . She tells her belief that it 's the parents right to butt in their children 's lives regardless . Marge gets mad at Lisa for her accusations and their conflicting styles of parenting causes a rift in their relationship . Meanwhile , Bart is heartbroken to find out that Jenda has remarried while he has not found anyone new . Feeling depressed , he tells Homer to take his grandsons out . The boys become angry with their father for not spending time with them , but the two have a great time with their grandfather . Bart and Lisa then encounter each other in their old treehouse , where they become slightly drunk and talk about how difficult parenting is . Lisa admitted she had an affair with Nelson a couple of times when Milhouse was away . After exchanging inspirational advice , they realize that they need to try harder to connect with their children . Lisa comes into Marge 's room to apologize for her earlier behavior that made both of them get angry with each other . Marge understands how stressed out Lisa 's been with a lack of communication she has with Zia and finally offers her some helpful advice . Meanwhile , upon arriving in Springfield , Maggie starts experiencing contractions and Kearney , now a taxi driver , drives her to the hospital . 
 Homer takes Bart 's sons to a cryonics facility where Grampa has been frozen alive to prevent a disease from killing him . Although a cure has now been discovered , he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him . Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance , since he knows Bart loves them . At that point , Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons , admitting how much he treasures them . Touched , the two boys forgive him for not having included them in his life much , while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well . Meanwhile , Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia 's private world . Entering it , Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next to a series of posters depicting historical women who have made a difference in the world . When Zia arrives , Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last , and secretly hides her life as a party poser . With the conflicts resolved , Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo . Marge arrives with Maggie , who has given birth to a baby girl .

 The episode , titled " Holidays of Future Passed " , was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Rob Oliver . It was first announced to the press at the Comic @-@ Con convention in San Diego , California on July 23 , 2011 , during a panel with the producers of The Simpsons . " Holidays of Future Passed " is the eleventh episode of the series with a Christmas theme , and the fourth episode set in the future ( the others being " Lisa 's Wedding " from 1995 , " Bart to the Future " from 2000 , and " Future @-@ Drama " from 2005 ) . Originally there was a joke in the episode about a meltdown occurring at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in the future ; however , it was cut following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that resulted in several nuclear accidents in Japan . 
 The Simpsons creator Matt Groening made a minor cameo in the episode , though his appearance is not mentioned in the closing credits . In the episode , a robot examines the health of Maggie 's fetus . Maggie 's band is present , and one of the band members presses a button on the robot 's " face " , which is a screen showing its facial expressions , and a football ( soccer ) game comes on instead . A sports commentator , voiced by Groening , gives a long " goal ! " shout that is heard over the game . According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma , as the episode was being recorded , " there were only sounds of crowd cheering during that shot and Matt said we needed to spice it up somehow . " After going through some different ideas , the staff settled on a commentator shouting " goal ! " . The staff members wanted Groening to provide the voice and he finished the recording in two takes . 
 In a 2013 interview with former show writer Conan O 'Brien , Jean stated that this episode was intended to serve as a series finale in the case that cast negotiations earlier in the year forced the show to end .

 Since airing , " Holidays of Future Passed " has received highly positive reviews from television critics , particularly for its humor and emotional scenes . In his list of " The 50 Best TV Episodes of 2011 " , BuddyTV 's John Kubicek placed the episode at number forty @-@ nine , writing that the " various glimpses of how all the other characters have changed during the time jump was a cavalcade of comedy moments . " Rex Huffman of The Times @-@ Reporter cited it as " an amusing episode " , and Ology 's Josh Harrison described it as " legitimately funny " . Harrison noted that " seeing so many futuristic versions of familiar characters put an interesting spin on the holiday season . " He also commented : " The whole episode hinges on a surprisingly heartfelt scene that sees Bart and Lisa — both a bit sloshed — meeting up in the treehouse to discuss the challenges of parenting . " Similarly , Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote that " Holidays of Future Passed " found " a sweet spot that combined a barrage of non @-@ stop jokes with a tenderness often lacking in latter @-@ day Simpsons episodes . There is even a conversation between the adult Bart and Lisa that rings surprisingly true for adult siblings wrestling with their shared familial past . " 
 Writing for HitFix , Alan Sepinwall cited " Holidays of Future Passed " as the best future @-@ set episode of The Simpsons since the first one , " Lisa 's Wedding " . He noted that it was " the emotional side of things " that made the episode successful , such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children , and also Homer 's transformation into a " very wise , sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age . " Sepinwall particularly praised the scene at the cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as " really sweet " , and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as " a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [ Grampa ] because he 's such a pain in the ass . " Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future , highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as " the Andy Rooney of 2041 " and Ralph Wiggum as " an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another . " In February 2012 , " Holidays of Future Passed " was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of " Nine Latter @-@ Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics " . He noted that the " reconciliations between Bart and Lisa and their kids are moving . " 
 At the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2012 , " Holidays of Future Passed " was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming Less Than One Hour ) . 
 = = = Response to Islamic references = = = 
 A segment of " Holidays of Future Passed " was inspired by a controversy over the growing Islamic influence in the city of Dearborn , Michigan , which , according to Bill Gallagher of WJBK , has " a significant Muslim community " . The biggest mosque in the United States is also located there . During the segment in question , set in Milhouse and Lisa 's future home , Milhouse tells Lisa that he has started to feel the symptoms of his seasonal allergies now that Christmas has arrived . He is apparently allergic to Christmas @-@ related things such as holly , mistletoe , and the red part of candy cane . Lisa advises Milhouse to go and stay in Michigan over the holidays , where Christmas is not celebrated because it is " still under sharia law . " Milhouse agrees to do this , but complains that they always make him wear a veil there , pointing to a photo on the wall in which he is standing outside of the University of Michigan – Dearborn dressed in a burqa . 
 In a news report about this segment that aired on WJBK , Gallagher noted that it " poked fun at the untrue and unfounded notion that somehow Muslim sharia law prevails in Dearborn . " Dawud Walid , head of the Michigan branch of the Council on American @-@ Islamic Relations , commented in the report that The Simpsons " is a very prolific show . Now [ it ] is addressing this anti @-@ sharia fear mongering issue , and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it . " The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan – Dearborn . A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report . One student said : " It 's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate is . I think it 's pretty funny , " while another noted : " I don 't think it 's a good thing [ to mock anti @-@ Islamic bigotry ] because we can change it by talking , not making fun . " 
 = Whitechapel murders = 
 The Whitechapel murders were committed in or near the impoverished Whitechapel district in the East End of London between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891 . At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper . 
 Most , if not all , of the victims — Emma Elizabeth Smith , Martha Tabram , Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , Mary Jane Kelly , Rose Mylett , Alice McKenzie , Frances Coles , and an unidentified woman — were prostitutes . Smith was sexually assaulted and robbed by a gang . Tabram was stabbed 39 times . Nichols , Chapman , Stride , Eddowes , Kelly , McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut . Eddowes and Stride were killed on the same night , minutes and less than a mile apart ; their murders were nicknamed the " double event " , after a phrase in a postcard sent to the press by someone claiming to be the Ripper . The bodies of Nichols , Chapman , Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal mutilations . Mylett was strangled . The body of the unidentified woman was dismembered , but the exact cause of her death is unclear . 
 The Metropolitan Police , City of London Police , and private organisations such as the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were involved in the search for the killer or killers . Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests , the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture . The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums , which were subsequently improved . The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day . 
 = = Context = = 
 In the late Victorian era , Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal rookery in London . The area around Flower and Dean Street was described as " perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis " ; Dorset Street was called " the worst street in London " . Assistant Police Commissioner Robert Anderson recommended Whitechapel to " those who take an interest in the dangerous classes " as one of London 's prime criminal " show places " . Robbery and violence were commonplace . The district was characterised by extreme poverty , sub @-@ standard housing , homelessness , drunkenness and endemic prostitution . These factors were focused in the institution of the common lodging @-@ house , which provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate and the destitute , among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered . All the identified victims lived in the heart of the rookery in Spitalfields , including three in George Street ( later named <unk> Street ) , two in Dorset Street , two in Flower and Dean Street and one in <unk> Street . 
 Police work and criminal prosecutions relied heavily on confessions , witness testimony , and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime . Forensic techniques , such as fingerprint analysis , were not in use . Policing in London was — and still is — divided between two forces : the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area , and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile ( 2 @.@ 9 km2 ) of the city centre . The Home Secretary , a senior minister of the United Kingdom government , controlled the Metropolitan Police , whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London . Beat constables walked regular , timed routes . 
 Eleven deaths in or near Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891 were gathered into a single file , referred to in the police docket as the Whitechapel murders . Much of the original material has been either stolen or destroyed . 
 = = Victims and investigation = = 
 = = = Emma Smith = = = 
 On Tuesday 3 April 1888 , following the Easter Monday bank holiday , prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed at the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane , Whitechapel , in the early hours of the morning . Although injured , she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street , Spitalfields . She told the deputy keeper , Mary Russell , that she had been attacked by two or three men , one of them a youth . Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital , where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina , rupturing her peritoneum . She developed peritonitis and died at 9 am on 4 April 1888 . The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex , Wynne Edwin Baxter , who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims . The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police , Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel , investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught . Walter Dew , a detective constable stationed with H Division , later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper , but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang . Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men , but either refused to or could not describe them . Prostitutes were often managed by gangs , and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them , or as part of their intimidation . She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal , and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings . 
 = = = Martha Tabram = = = 
 On Tuesday 7 August , following a Monday bank holiday , prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2 : 30 am . Her body was found at George Yard Buildings , George Yard , Whitechapel . She had been stabbed 39 times with a short blade . On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute , and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby , Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade , but without positive results . The police did not connect the murder with Smith 's , but they did connect it with the later murders . Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings , as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed , but a connection cannot be ruled out . 
 = = = Mary Ann Nichols = = = 
 On Friday 31 August , prostitute Mary Ann Nichols was murdered in Buck 's Row ( since renamed Durward Street ) , a back street in Whitechapel . Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3 : 45 am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance . Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound . Several shallower incisions across the abdomen , and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards . As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or Bethnal Green Division of the Metropolitan Police , it was at first investigated by the local detectives . On the same day , James Monro resigned as the head of the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) over differences with Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Charles Warren . Initial investigations into the murder had little success , although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang , as in the case of Smith . The Star newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline . Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline , Henry Moore and Walter Andrews from the Central Office at Scotland Yard . On the available evidence , Coroner Baxter concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3 am where she was found . In his summing up , he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram , as the lethal weapons were different in those cases , and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat . However , by the time the inquest into Nichols ' death had concluded , a fourth woman had been murdered , and Baxter noted " The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable . " 
 = = = Annie Chapman = = = 
 The mutilated body of the fourth woman , prostitute Annie Chapman , was discovered at about 6 : 00 am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street , Spitalfields . Chapman had left her lodgings at 2 am on the day she was murdered , with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent . Her throat was cut from left to right . She had been disembowelled , and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders . The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing . The pathologist , George Bagster Phillips , was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6 – 8 inches ( 15 – 20 cm ) long . However , the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts . As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene , it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff , who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens . 
 On 10 September , the police arrested a notorious local called John <unk> , dubbed " Leather Apron " , who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes . His alibis for the two most recent murders were corroborated , and he was released without charge . At the inquest one of the witnesses , Mrs Elizabeth Long , testified that she had seen Chapman talking to a man at about 5 : 30 am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street , where Chapman was later found . Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer . Mrs Long described him as over forty , a little taller than Chapman , of dark complexion , and of foreign , " shabby @-@ genteel " appearance . He was wearing a brown deer @-@ stalker hat and a dark overcoat . Another witness , carpenter Albert <unk> , had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time , and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence . 
 In his memoirs , Walter Dew recorded that the killings caused widespread panic in London . A mob attacked the Commercial Road police station , suspecting that the murderer was being held there . Samuel Montagu , the Member of Parliament for Whitechapel , offered a reward of £ 100 ( roughly £ 10 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) after rumours that the attacks were Jewish ritual killings led to anti @-@ Semitic demonstrations . Local residents founded the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee under the chairmanship of George Lusk and offered a reward for the apprehension of the killer — something the Metropolitan Police ( under instruction from the Home Office ) refused to do because it could lead to false or misleading information . The Committee employed two private detectives to investigate the case . 
 Robert Anderson was appointed head of the CID on 1 September , but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th . Superintendent Thomas Arnold , who was in charge of H ( Whitechapel ) Division , went on leave on 2 September . Anderson 's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused , and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co @-@ ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard . A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders , but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large . 
 = = = Double event : Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes = = = 
 On Sunday 30 September , the body of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was discovered at about 1 am in <unk> 's Yard , inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street ( since renamed Henriques Street ) , Whitechapel . She was lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut from left to right . She had been killed just minutes before , and her body was otherwise unmutilated . It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard , perhaps Louis <unk> , who discovered the body . However , some commentators on the case conclude that Stride 's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated , that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road , and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design . Most experts , however , consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride 's murder with at least two of the earlier ones , as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night . 
 At 1 : 45 am Catherine Eddowes ' mutilated body was found by PC Edward Watkins at the south @-@ west corner of Mitre Square , in the City of London , about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street . She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat from left to right with a sharp , pointed knife at least 6 inches ( 15 cm ) long . Her face and abdomen were mutilated , and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between her torso and left arm . Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed . The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham , coroner for the City of London . The examining pathologist , Dr Frederick Gordon Brown , believed the perpetrator " had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs " and from the position of the wounds on the body he could tell that the murderer had knelt to the right of the body , and worked alone . However , the first doctor at the scene , local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira , disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs . His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders , who was also present at the autopsy . Because of this murder 's location , the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry . 
 At 3 am a blood @-@ stained fragment of Eddowes ' apron was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to 108 to 119 Goulston Street , Whitechapel , about a third of a mile ( 500 m ) from the murder scene . There was chalk writing on the wall of the doorway , which read either " The <unk> are the men that will not be blamed for nothing " or " The <unk> are not the men who will be blamed for nothing . " At 5 am , Commissioner Warren attended the scene and ordered the words erased for fear that they would spark anti @-@ Semitic riots . Goulston Street was on a direct route from Mitre Square to Flower and Dean Street , where both Stride and Eddowes lived . 
 The Middlesex coroner , Wynne Baxter , believed that Stride had been attacked with a swift , sudden action . She was still holding a packet of <unk> ( breath <unk> sweets ) in her left hand when she was discovered , indicating that she had not had time to defend herself . A grocer , Matthew Packer , implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer ; however , he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious . At the inquest , the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held , swallowed or consumed grapes . They described her stomach contents as " cheese , potatoes and farinaceous powder [ flour or milled grain ] " . Nevertheless , Packer 's story appeared in the press . Packer 's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder , but all but two of the descriptions differed . Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there , and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old , who was shabbily dressed , wore a peaked cap , and had a fair moustache . Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende 's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer . However , Lawende stated that he would not be able to identify the man again , and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions . 
 Criticism of the Metropolitan Police and the Home Secretary , Henry Matthews , continued to mount as little progress was made with the investigation . The City Police and the Lord Mayor of London offered a reward of £ 500 ( roughly £ 50 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) for information leading to the capture of the villain . The use of bloodhounds to track the killer in the event of another attack was considered , but the idea was abandoned because the trail of scents was confused in the busy city , the dogs were inexperienced in an urban environment , and the owner was concerned that the dogs would be poisoned by criminals if their role in crime detection became known . 
 On 27 September , the Central News Agency received a letter , dubbed the " Dear Boss " letter , in which the writer , who signed himself " Jack the Ripper " , claimed to have committed the murders . On 1 October , a postcard , dubbed the " Saucy Jacky " postcard and also signed " Jack the Ripper " , was received by the agency . It claimed responsibility for the most recent murders on 30 September , and described the murders of the two women as the " double event " , a designation which has endured . 
 On Tuesday 2 October , an unidentified female torso was found in the basement of New Scotland Yard , which was under construction . It was linked to the Whitechapel murders by the press , but it was not included in the Whitechapel murders file , and any connection between the two is now considered unlikely . The case became known as the Whitehall Mystery . On the same day , the psychic Robert James Lees visited Scotland Yard and offered to track down the murderer using paranormal powers ; the police turned him away and " called [ him ] a fool and a lunatic " . 
 The head of the CID , Anderson , eventually got back from leave on 6 October and took charge of the investigation for Scotland Yard . On 16 October , George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee received another letter claiming to be from the killer . The handwriting and style were unlike that of the " Dear Boss " letter and " Saucy Jacky " postcard . The letter arrived with a small box containing half of a human kidney preserved in alcohol . The letter 's writer claimed that he had extracted it from the body of Eddowes and that he had " fried and ate " the missing half . Opinion on whether the kidney and the letter were genuine was and is divided . By the end of October , the police had interviewed more than 2 @,@ 000 people , investigated " upwards of 300 " , and detained 80 . 
 = = = Mary Kelly = = = 
 On Friday 9 November , prostitute Mary Jane Kelly was murdered in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller 's Court , behind 26 Dorset Street , Spitalfields . One of the earlier victims , Chapman , had lived in Dorset Street , and another , Eddowes , was reported to have slept rough there . Kelly 's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10 : 45 am lying on the bed . The first doctor at the scene , Dr George Bagster Phillips , believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat . After her death , her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room . Her breasts had been cut off , her face mutilated beyond recognition , and her thighs partially cut through to the bone , with some of the muscles removed . Unlike the other victims , she was undressed and wore only a light chemise . Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair , with the exception of some found burnt in the grate . Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light , as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle . Kelly 's murder was the most savage , probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street . Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed , which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew , by someone she believed to be a client , or when she was asleep or intoxicated . 
 The coroner for North East Middlesex , Dr Roderick Macdonald , MP , presided over the inquest into Kelly 's death at Shoreditch Town Hall on 12 November . Amid scenes of great emotion , an " enormous crowd " of mourners attended Mary Kelly 's funeral on 19 November . The streets became gridlocked and the cortège struggled to travel from Shoreditch mortuary to the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Leytonstone , where she was laid to rest . 
 On 8 November , Charles Warren resigned as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police after the Home Secretary informed him that he could not make public statements without Home Office approval . James Monro , who had resigned a few months earlier over differences with Warren , was appointed as his replacement in December . On 10 November , the police surgeon Thomas Bond wrote to Robert Anderson , head of the London CID , detailing the similarities between the five murders of Nichols , Chapman , Stride , Eddowes and Kelly , " no doubt committed by the same hand " . On the same day , the Cabinet resolved to offer a pardon to any accomplice who came forward with information that led to the conviction of the actual murderer . The Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that the Whitechapel murderer remained unidentified despite 143 extra plain @-@ clothes policemen deployed in Whitechapel in November and December . 
 = = = Rose Mylett = = = 
 On Thursday 20 December 1888 , a patrolling constable found prostitute Rose Mylett ( also known as Catherine Millett and Lizzie Davis ) , 29 , strangled in Clarke 's Yard , off Poplar High Street . Mylett had lodged at 18 George Street , as had Emma Smith . Four doctors who examined Mylett 's body thought she had been murdered , but Robert Anderson thought she had accidentally hanged herself on the collar of her dress while in a drunken stupor . At Anderson 's request Dr Bond examined Mylett 's body , and he agreed with Anderson . Commissioner Monro also suspected it was a suicide or natural death as there were no signs of a struggle . The coroner , Wynne Baxter , told the inquest jury that " there is no evidence to show that death was the result of violence " . Nevertheless , the jury returned a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or persons unknown " and the case was added to the Whitechapel file . 
 = = = Alice McKenzie = = = 
 Alice McKenzie was possibly a prostitute , and was murdered at about 12 : 40 am on Wednesday 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley , Whitechapel . Like most of the previous murders , her left carotid artery was severed from left to right and there were wounds on her abdomen . However , her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders , and a shorter blade was used . Commissioner Monro and one of the pathologists examining the body , Bond , believed this to be a Ripper murder , though another of the pathologists , Phillips , and Robert Anderson disagreed , as did Inspector Abberline . Later writers are also divided , and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim , or that the unknown murderer tried to make it look like a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself . At the inquest , Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities , and concluded : " There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases , which have happened in this neighbourhood , and if the same person has not committed this crime , it is clearly an imitation of the other cases . " 
 = = = Pinchin Street torso = = = 
 A woman 's torso was found at 5 : 15 a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street , Whitechapel . No other body parts were found , despite a search of the area , and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified . Chief Inspector Swanson and Commissioner Monro noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat . The pathologists , however , noted that the general <unk> of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death . Newspaper speculation that the body belonged to Lydia Hart , who had disappeared , was refuted after she was found recovering in hospital after " a bit of a spree " . Another claim that the victim was a missing girl called Emily Barker was also refuted , as the torso was from an older and taller woman . The age of the victim was estimated at 30 – 40 years . 
 Swanson did not consider this a Ripper case , and instead suggested a link to similar dismembered body cases in Rainham and Chelsea , as well as the " Whitehall Mystery " . Monro agreed with Swanson 's assessment . These three murders and the Pinchin Street case are suggested to be the work of a serial killer , nicknamed the " Torso killer " , who could either be the same person as " Jack the Ripper " or a separate killer of uncertain connection . Links between these and three further murders — the " Battersea Mystery " of 1873 and 1874 , in which two women were found dismembered , and the 1884 " Tottenham Court Road Mystery " — have also been postulated . Experts on the murders — colloquially known as " <unk> " — such as Stewart Evans , Keith Skinner , Martin Fido , and Donald Rumbelow , discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings on the basis of their different modi operandi . 
 Monro was replaced as Commissioner by Sir Edward Bradford on 21 June 1890 , after a disagreement with Home Secretary Matthews over police pensions . 
 = = = Frances Coles = = = 
 The last of the murders in the Whitechapel file was committed on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch . Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2 : 15 am at Swallow Gardens , a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street , Whitechapel . Minor wounds on the back of her head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice , from left to right and then back again . Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body . Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station , and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore , who had been involved in the previous murder investigations , arrived by 5 am . A man named James Sadler , who had been seen with Coles earlier , was arrested by the police and charged with her murder . A high @-@ profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler 's past history and his whereabouts at the time of the previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper . However , Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Abberline retired in 1892 , and Matthews lost office in that year 's general election . Arnold retired the following year , and Swanson and Anderson retired after 1900 . There are no documents in the Whitechapel murder file dated after 1896 . The murderer or murderers were never identified and the cases remain unsolved . Sensational reportage and the mystery surrounding the identity of the killer or killers fed the development of the character " Jack the Ripper " , who was blamed for all or most of the murders . Hundreds of books and articles discuss the Whitechapel murders , and they feature in novels , short stories , comic books , television shows , and films of multiple genres . 
 The poor of the East End had long been ignored by affluent society , but the nature of the murders and of the victims drew attention to their living conditions . The murders galvanised opinion against the overcrowded , unsanitary slums of the East End , and led to demands for reform . On 24 September 1888 , George Bernard Shaw commented sarcastically on the media 's sudden concern in social justice in a letter to The Star newspaper : 
 Whilst we conventional Social Democrats were wasting our time on education , agitation and organisation , some independent genius has taken the matter in hand , and by simply murdering and disembowelling ... women , converted the proprietary press to an inept sort of communism . 
 Acts of Parliament , such as the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 and the Public Health Amendment Act 1890 , set minimum standards for accommodation in an effort to transform degenerated urban areas . The worst of the slums were demolished in the two decades following the Whitechapel murders . 
 = Huon Peninsula campaign = 
 The Huon Peninsula campaign was a series of battles fought in north @-@ eastern Papua New Guinea in 1943 – 44 during the Second World War . The campaign formed the initial part of an offensive that the Allies launched in the Pacific in late 1943 and resulted in the Japanese being pushed north from Lae to Sio on the northern coast of New Guinea over the course of a four @-@ month period . For the Australians , a significant advantage was gained through the technological edge that Allied industry had achieved over the Japanese by this phase of the war , while the Japanese were hampered by a lack of supplies and reinforcements due to Allied interdiction efforts at sea and in the air . 
 The campaign was preceded by an amphibious landing by troops from the Australian 9th Division east of Lae on 4 September 1943 . This was followed by an advance west along the coast towards the town where they were to link up with 7th Division advancing from Nadzab . Meanwhile , Australian and US forces mounted diversionary attacks around Salamaua . Heavy rain and flooding slowed the 9th Division 's advance , which had to cross several rivers along the way . The Japanese rear guard also put up a stiff defence and , as a result , Lae did not fall until 16 September , when troops from the 7th Division entered it ahead of the 9th , and the main body of the Japanese force escaped north . Less than a week later , the Huon Peninsula campaign was opened as the Australians undertook another amphibious landing further east , aimed at capturing Finschhafen . 
 Following the landing at Scarlet Beach , the Allies set about moving south to secure Finschhafen , which saw fighting around Jivevaneng also . In mid @-@ October , the Japanese launched a counterattack against the Australian beachhead around Scarlet Beach , which lasted for about a week and resulted in a small contraction of the Australian lines and a splitting of their force before it was defeated . After this , the Australians regained the initiative and began to pursue the Japanese who withdrew inland towards the high ground around Sattelberg . Amidst heavy fighting and a second failed Japanese counterattack , Sattelberg was secured in late November and the Australians began an area advance to the north to secure a line between Wareo and Gusika . This was completed by early December , and was followed by an advance by Australian forces along the coast through Lakona to Fortification Point , overcoming strong Japanese forces fighting delaying actions . 
 The final stage of the campaign saw the Japanese resistance finally break . A swift advance by the Australians along the northern coast of the peninsula followed and in January 1944 they captured Sio . At the same time , the Americans landed at Saidor . After this , mopping up operations were undertaken by Allied forces around Sio until March . A lull period then followed in northern New Guinea until July when US forces clashed with the Japanese around the Driniumor River . This was followed by further fighting in November 1944 when the Australians opened a fresh campaign in Aitape – Wewak . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 The Huon Peninsula is situated along the north @-@ east coast of Papua New Guinea , and stretches from Lae in the south on the Huon Gulf to Sio in the north along the Vitiaz Strait . Along the coast , between these two points , numerous rivers and streams cut the terrain . Of these , the most prominent are the Song , Bumi and Mape Rivers . These waterways flow from the mountainous interior which is formed through the conglomeration of the Rawlinson Range in the south , with the Cromwell Mountains in the east . These meet in the centre of the peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif , which joins the Finisterre Range further west . Apart from a thin , flat coastal strip , at the time of the campaign , the area was thickly covered with dense jungle , through which very few tracks had been cut . The terrain was rugged and for the most part the tracks , until improved by engineers , were largely unpassable to motor transport and as a result throughout the campaign a large amount of the Allied resupply effort was undertaken on foot . 
 During planning , the Allies identified three areas as key and decisive terrain in the area : the beach north of Katika , which was later codenamed " Scarlet " by the Allies , the 3 @,@ 150 @-@ foot ( 960 m ) high peak called Sattelberg 5 miles ( 8 km ) to the south @-@ west , which dominated the area due to its height , and Finschhafen , possessing a small airfield and sitting on the coast in a bay which offered protected harbour facilities 5 @.@ 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 0 km ) south of Scarlet Beach . The Japanese , too , regarded Sattelberg and Finschhafen as key areas . In addition to these , they identified a ridge that ran between the village of Gusika on the coast , about 3 @.@ 4 miles ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) north of Katika , and Wareo 4 @.@ 66 miles ( 7 @.@ 5 km ) inland to the west . The importance of this ridge lay in the track that ran along it , over which the Japanese supplied their forces around Sattelberg . It also offered a natural barrier to any advance north from Finschhafen , making it a potential defensive line . 
 = = = Military situation = = = 
 By 1943 , Japanese expansionary moves in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) had ceased . Their advance in Papua New Guinea had been halted the previous year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track . Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay , Buna – Gona , Wau and on Guadalcanal had forced the Japanese on to the back foot . As a result of these victories , the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid @-@ 1943 and began making plans to continue to push the Japanese back in New Guinea . 
 Allied planners began formulating their plans for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands . The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul . The reduction of this base came to be seen as a key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel . 
 In order to achieve this , the Allies needed access to a number of airbases in the region . Allied high commanders , including General Douglas MacArthur , directed that two airbases be secured : one at Lae and another at Finschhafen . The capture of Lae would provide the Allies with a port to supply Nadzab and would facilitate operations in the Markham Valley . Gaining control of Finschhafen , and the wider Huon Peninsula , was an important precursor to conducting operations in New Britain by providing a natural harbour , and enabling control of the strategically important Vitiaz and Dampier Straits . 
 = = = Opposing forces = = = 
 At the time , there were no US ground forces under MacArthur 's command in action against the Japanese , and the task of securing Finschhafen was allocated to Australian troops from the 9th Division . A veteran formation of the all @-@ volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) , the 9th Division was vastly experienced , having fought in the North African campaign , where it had held Tobruk against a German onslaught earlier in the war and had been heavily engaged at the First and Second Battle of El Alamein . In early 1943 , the division had been brought back to Australia , and it had subsequently been reorganised to take part in jungle warfare . With an establishment of 13 @,@ 118 men , the division consisted of three brigades of infantry – the 20th , 24th and 26th – each consisting of three battalions , along with organic battalion @-@ level engineer , pioneer , artillery , and armoured formations attached at divisional level . In support of the 9th Division , Militia infantry units from the 4th Brigade would also take part in the fighting after the initial fighting . American forces would also be involved , mainly providing logistical , naval and engineering support . 
 Air support was provided by No. 9 Operational Group RAAF , which included several Royal Australian Air Force squadrons such as No. 4 Squadron RAAF , flying CAC Boomerangs and Wirraways , and No. 24 Squadron RAAF equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers ; these units undertook numerous close air support and resupply missions throughout the campaign . American Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts and Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightnings from the 348th and 475th Fighter Groups were also used to provide fighter cover for Allied shipping , while heavy and medium bombers from the Fifth Air Force carried out strategic bombing missions to reduce Japanese airbases around Wewak and New Britain , and raided Japanese lines of communication in concert with PT boats . Due to the <unk> of using wheeled transport in the jungle , Allied logistics was undertaken primarily by means of water transport such as landing craft and barges which moved supplies along the coast , with overland supply to combat units being completed by New Guinean labourers and , at times , by Australian combat troops themselves , which were re @-@ roled temporarily to undertake portage tasks as required , and augmented where possible with jeeps . 
 The main Japanese force in the campaign was provided by the XVIII Army under the command of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi and was headquartered at Madang . This force consisted of three divisions – the 20th , the 41st and the 51st – and a number of smaller forces which included naval infantry and garrison units . Around the Finschhafen area in mid @-@ September 1943 , the main forces were drawn from the 20th Division 's 80th Infantry and 26th Field Artillery Regiments , the 41st Division 's 238th Infantry Regiment , the naval 85th Garrison Unit and a company from the 51st Division 's 102nd Infantry Regiment . These forces were under the command of Major General <unk> Yamada , commander of the 1st Shipping Group , although tactical command was devolved at local level due to the geographical spread of the Japanese units . These units were situated across a broad area between the <unk> River , east of Lae to Arndt Point , Sattelberg , <unk> , <unk> , Finschhafen , <unk> and on Tami Island . The largest concentrations were around Sattelberg and Finschhafen , where the main forces came under the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri , commander of the 20th Division . The strength and efficiency of the Japanese units had been reduced by disease , and their employment in road construction tasks between Madang and Bogadjim . 
 Like the Allies , the Japanese also relied on water transport to ferry supplies and reinforcements around the New Guinea , using a force of three submarines to avoid interdiction by Allied aircraft which had previously inflicted heavy casualties during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea . These submarines were augmented by barges , although they were limited in supply and were subject to attack by Allied aircraft and PT boats . Once the supplies had been landed , resupply parties were used to carry the stores overland on foot along a number of key tracks to their main troop concentrations around Sattelberg and Finschhafen . Air support was provided by the 4th Air Army , consisting primarily of the 7th Air Division and 14th Air Brigade , along with some elements from the 6th Air Division . Based in Wewak , the Japanese aircraft were mainly used to escort Japanese shipping and attack Allied shipping around the main beachhead during the campaign , with a secondary task of undertaking ground attack missions in support of Japanese troops . The 11th Naval Air Fleet , based at Rabaul , also undertook anti @-@ shipping missions . Despite having these units available , heavy Allied bombing of Japanese airfields around Wewak in August 1943 greatly reduced the number of aircraft available to the Japanese and limited their ability to apply airpower throughout the campaign . 
 The Japanese force lacked for transport , engineer and logistical support and was hampered by a lack of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure . In contrast , the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Following MacArthur 's directive to secure the airfields at Lae and Finschhafen , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Allied Forces , South West Pacific Area , General Thomas Blamey , an Australian , ordered the capture of the Huon Peninsula . The 9th Division under Major General George Wootten was tasked with the job . The initial focus was upon securing Lae . The Allies formulated a plan to achieve this that would see the 9th Division conduct an amphibious landing east of Lae , while the 7th Division would move by air to Nadzab in the Markham Valley , which had been secured by parachute troops from the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment and the 2 / 4th Field Regiment . From Nadzab , the 7th Division would advance on Lae from the south to support the 9th Division 's drive towards Lae . At the same time , the Australian 3rd Division and the US 162nd Infantry Regiment would fight a diversionary action around Salamaua . 
 After training in Queensland and at Milne Bay in New Guinea , the 9th Division embarked upon US ships assigned to Rear Admiral Daniel Barbey 's naval task force – VII Amphibious Force – as part of what was the " largest amphibious operation ... undertaken by Allied forces in the South @-@ West Pacific " to that point in the war . The 20th Brigade , under the command of Brigadier Victor Windeyer , was chosen to spearhead the assault with a landing at a beach 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the east of Lae . In preparation , early on 4 September 1943 , five destroyers laid down a heavy bombardment that lasted six minutes . Upon its conclusion , the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion led the 20th Brigade ashore , with the brigade 's other two battalions , the 2 / 15th and 2 / 17th , coming ashore shortly afterwards in the second and third waves . Unopposed on the ground , the Australian infantry quickly began to move inland as further reinforcements arrived . About 35 minutes after the initial landing , as the Australian divisional headquarters and the 2 / 23rd Infantry Battalion were coming ashore , a small force of Japanese aircraft attacked the landing craft carrying the infantry ashore . As a result , two of these craft were heavily damaged and numerous casualties inflicted , including the 2 / 23rd 's commanding officer , who was killed when a Japanese bomb landed on the bridge of LCI @-@ 339 . 
 Further Japanese air attacks came in the afternoon . A force of about 70 Japanese aircraft , coming from bases on New Britain , were beaten off over Finschhafen . Another group , however , achieved success around Morobe , attacking empty transports that were making their egress from Finschhafen , while off Cape Ward Hunt another group attacked an Allied convoy carrying follow @-@ on forces , including the rest of Brigadier David Whitehead 's 26th Brigade . Aboard LST @-@ 471 , 43 were killed and another 30 wounded , while eight were killed and 37 wounded on LST @-@ 473 . This did not prevent the flow of supplies and the arrival of further reinforcements in the shape of the 24th Brigade , under Brigadier Bernard Evans , the following day . The Australians then began the arduous advance west towards Lae , passing through " thick jungle , swamps , kunai grass and numerous rain @-@ swollen rivers and streams " which , along with heavy rain , slowed their progress . On the night of 5 / 6 September , the Japanese launched an attack on the lead Australian battalion , but they were unable to prevent its advance . At this point , the 26th Brigade moved inland to strike towards Lae from the north @-@ east while the 24th carried the advance along the coast . 
 At this point , the 9th Division 's advance began to be hampered by a lack of supplies which , along with the rugged terrain , resulted in slow progress . It was not until 9 September that they reached the Busu River . The 2 / 28th Infantry Battalion was leading the Australian advance at this stage and the soldiers waded across . The current was strong and many of the men – 13 of whom drowned – were swept downstream . Nevertheless , the 2 / 28th was able to establish a beachhead west of the river . At this point , heavy rain began to fall again , and the river rose once more , preventing any other units from crossing . This effectively isolated the single Australian battalion , which was then subjected to repeated attacks by the Japanese . On 14 September , the 26th Brigade was able to force its way across and the advance continued . Along the coast the 24th Brigade was held up by a determined Japanese defence in front of the <unk> River , which was the final crossing before Lae . The stream was finally forded on 16 September , by which time Lae had fallen to troops from the 7th Division . 
 In the fighting for Lae over 2 @,@ 200 Japanese were killed . In contrast , the Australian casualties were considerably lighter , with the 9th Division losing 77 killed and 73 missing . Despite the Allied success in capturing Lae , the Japanese had achieved a " creditable defence " , which had not only slowed the Allied advance , but had allowed the bulk of the Japanese forces in the vicinity to get away , withdrawing north into the Huon Peninsula , where they could continue to fight on .

 = = = Finschhafen = = = 
 Lae had fallen sooner than the Allies had anticipated and they exploited the advantage quickly . The first phase of the new campaign consisted of an amphibious landing by Allied troops north of Siki Cove near the confluence of the Siki River and south of the Song at a beach codenamed " Scarlet " . Positioned further east on the peninsula from Lae , in terms of strategic importance , Finschhafen overshadowed Lae in the minds of the Allied planners , due to its potential to support operations across the Vitiaz Strait into New Britain . As a result of faulty intelligence , which underestimated the size of the Japanese force in the area , the assault force chosen by the Allied commanders consisted of only a single Australian infantry brigade – the 20th . Meanwhile , the 7th Division would move north @-@ west from Lae in a separate campaign , advancing through the Markham and Ramu Valleys towards the Finisterre Range . 
 After a short period of preparation , the 20th Brigade 's landing took place on 22 September 1943 . It was the first opposed amphibious landing that Australian forces had made since Gallipoli . Navigational errors resulted in the troops being landed on the wrong beaches , with some of them coming ashore at Siki Cove and taking heavy fire from the strong Japanese defences in pillboxes and behind obstacles . After re @-@ organising on the beach , the Australians pushed inland . The Japanese put up stiff resistance around the high ground at Katika , but were eventually forced back . By the end of the day , having suffered 94 casualties , the Australians had secured a beachhead " several kilometres " deep . Late in the day , a force of around 30 Japanese bombers , escorted by up to 40 fighters , from the Wewak @-@ based 4th Air Army based was sent to attack Allied shipping around Finschhafen . Forewarned by the destroyer USS Reid , which was serving as an air picket and fighter controller in the Vitiaz Strait , the Allies were able to concentrate five squadrons of US fighter aircraft over the convoy and in the aerial battle that followed 39 Japanese aircraft were shot down and the raid turned back . 
 The next day the Australians commenced their advance south towards the village of Finschhafen , about 5 @.@ 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 0 km ) south of the landing beach , with the 2 / 15th Infantry Battalion leading the way to the Bumi River . The Japanese had established strong defences along the river 's southern bank , which the Australians attempted to outflank by sending a force to the west , climbing through steep terrain . Once they had located a suitable place to cross the river , they began wading across but were fired upon by a group of Japanese naval infantry who were positioned on a high feature overlooking the river . Despite taking casualties , the Australians were able to establish themselves south of the Bumi and at that point the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion began to advance on Finschhafen from the west . Meanwhile , the 2 / 15th attacked the left flank of the Japanese that had opposed their crossing . After advancing up the steep slope under fire , sometimes on their hands and knees , the 2 / 15th took the position at the point of the bayonet , killing 52 Japanese in close combat . 
 The continued advance south by the Australians spread them thin on the ground . Due to concerns that their western flank was exposed , the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion was sent along the Sattelberg track to deflect any Japanese thrusts from there . At Jivevaneng , the battalion was stopped and there the Japanese 80th Infantry Regiment launched a series of determined attacks against them , trying to break through to the coast . 
 At this point , Australian fears of a Japanese counterattack grew and they requested reinforcements from their higher commander , General Douglas MacArthur . However , the request was denied as MacArthur 's intelligence staff believed that there were only 350 Japanese in the vicinity . Actually , there were already 5 @,@ 000 Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12 @,@ 000 as they began to prepare for their planned counterattack . The Australians received some reinforcements in the shape of the 2 / 43rd Infantry Battalion . The arrival of this unit meant that the 2 / 17th , deadlocked around Jivevaneng , could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen , thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on that objective . 
 After an attack across the <unk> Creek by the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion , which cost the Australians 80 casualties on 1 October , the Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw . On 2 October , the town fell to the Australians and the Japanese abandoned the Kakakog Ridge amidst heavy Australian air and artillery attacks . Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen , it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion , a Militia infantry battalion . This unit had cleared the coastal area in the south of the peninsula , advancing from Lae over the mountains . Meanwhile , the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg . Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October . The following day , the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion was sent to Kumawa to follow up the retreating Japanese forces , and for the next couple of days minor clashes resulted before it established itself at Jivevaneng again on 7 October . 
 = = = Japanese counterattack = = = 
 The Japanese had begun planning a counterattack during the Australian advance on Finschhafen . The main part of the 20th Division was moved down from Madang as the Japanese began concentrating their forces around Sattelberg , with the main force arriving there on 11 October . The Japanese plans became known to the Australians through captured documents and by mid @-@ October 1943 the Australian 24th Infantry Brigade had been brought up to reinforce the 20th . When the Japanese counterattack came , the first wave fell upon the 24th Brigade around Jivevaneng on 16 October but the attack , having been put in a piecemeal fashion , was pushed back . The next day Japanese aircraft attacked Allied forces around Scarlet Beach and this was followed shortly an amphibious landing which was all but destroyed at sea by fire from American and Australian anti @-@ aircraft and machine @-@ guns . It was during this assault that an American soldier , Private Nathan Van Noy , from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment , performed the actions for which he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . Only a small number of Japanese managed to make it ashore amidst the devastating fire and , by the following day , these all had been killed or wounded by Australian infantry conducting mopping up operations . 
 The main elements of the Japanese counterattack had penetrated the forward and thinly stretched Australian lines throughout the previous night . The Japanese exploited the gaps in the line between the 2 / 28th Infantry and the 2 / 3rd Pioneer Battalions , and launched an attack towards the coast with the objective of capturing the high ground 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) west of Scarlet Beach , and splitting the Australian forces at Katika . 
 The 24th Brigade withdrew from Katika and the high ground to the north of Scarlet Beach to strengthen the defences around the beachhead in response to the Japanese penetration , while the 20th Brigade was moved into position along the Siki Creek to block the Japanese advancing towards Finschhafen . Australian resistance was strong despite giving up the advantage of the high ground , with field and anti @-@ aircraft artillery engaging at ranges as short as 220 yards ( 200 m ) " over open sights " . As result , the Japanese attack was turned away from Scarlet Beach and channelled down Siki Creek . Nevertheless , they succeeded in breaking through to Siki Cove by 18 October and effectively drove a wedge between the 24th Brigade in the north and the 20th Brigade in the south . In doing so , they captured a considerable amount of Allied supplies , including ammunition , weapons and rations , helping to replenish their own dwindling supplies . 
 During the night of 18 / 19 October , the Japanese cut the route that the Australians were using to supply the 2 / 17th defending Jivevaneng and established a road block astride the Jivevaneng – Sattelberg road . The 2 / 17th and a number of other Australian units , such as most of the 2 / 3rd Pioneer Battalion , as well as part of the 2 / 28th , became isolated behind Japanese lines . In order to keep them supplied , emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF .
