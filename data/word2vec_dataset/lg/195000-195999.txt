 The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae . Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use . Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy . Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur clade Theropoda . 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 Aves and a sister group , the clade Crocodilia , contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria . During the late 1990s , Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica . However , an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century , and is used by many scientists including adherents of the <unk> system . Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds . This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils , and assigning them , instead , to the Avialae , in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs . 
 Gauthier identified four conflicting ways of defining the term " Aves " , which is a problem because the same biological name is being used four different ways . Gauthier proposed a solution , number 4 below , which is to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group , the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants . He assigned other names to the other groups . 
 Aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers ( alternately <unk> ) 
 Aves can mean those that fly ( alternately Avialae ) 
 Aves can mean all reptiles closer to birds than to crocodiles ( alternately <unk> [ = <unk> ] ) 
 Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants ( a " crown group " ) . ( alternately Neornithes ) 
 Under the fourth definition Archaeopteryx is an avialan , and not a member of Aves . Gauthier 's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of paleontology and bird evolution , though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent . Avialae , initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves , is often used synonymously with the vernacular term " bird " by these researchers . 
 Most researchers define Avialae as branch @-@ based clade , though definitions vary . Many authors have used a definition similar to " all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus . " Avialae is also occasionally defined as an <unk> @-@ based clade ( that is , one based on physical characteristics ) . Jacques Gauthier , who named Avialae in 1986 , re @-@ defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight , and the birds that descended from them . 
 = = = Dinosaurs and the origin of birds = = = 
 Based on fossil and biological evidence , most scientists accept that birds are a specialized subgroup of theropod dinosaurs , and more specifically , they are members of Maniraptora , a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids , among others . As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds , the previously clear distinction between non @-@ birds and birds has become blurred . Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China , which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs , contribute to this ambiguity . 
 The consensus view in contemporary paleontology is that the flying theropods , or avialans , are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs , which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids . Together , these form a group called <unk> . Some basal members of this group , such as Microraptor , have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly . The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small . This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal , have been able to glide , or both . Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non @-@ avialan feathered dinosaurs , who primarily ate meat , recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores . 
 The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics : teeth , clawed fingers , and a long , lizard @-@ like tail , as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds . It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor . 
 = = = Early evolution = = = 
 The earliest known avialan fossils come from the <unk> Formation of China , which has been dated to the late Jurassic period ( Oxfordian stage ) , about 160 million years ago . The avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis <unk> , Xiaotingia <unk> , and Aurornis <unk> . The well @-@ known early avialan , Archaeopteryx , dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks ( about 155 million years old ) from Germany . Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds , but were later lost during bird evolution . These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life , and long feathers or " hind wings " covering the hind limbs and feet , which may have been used in aerial maneuvering . 
 <unk> diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous Period . Many groups retained primitive characteristics , such as clawed wings and teeth , though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups , including modern birds ( Aves ) . While the earliest forms , such as Archaeopteryx and <unk> , retained the long bony tails of their ancestors , the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group <unk> . In the late Cretaceous , around 95 million years ago , the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell . 
 = = = Early diversity of bird ancestors = = = 
 The first large , diverse lineage of short @-@ tailed avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes , or " opposite birds " , so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds . Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches , from sand @-@ probing shorebirds and fish @-@ eaters to tree @-@ dwelling forms and seed @-@ eaters . While they were the dominant group of avialans during the Cretaceous period , enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the Mesozoic era . 
 Many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify , the Euornithes ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi @-@ aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . Unlike the enantiornithes , which dominated land @-@ based and arboreal habitats , most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird @-@ like species , waders , and swimming and diving species . The later included the superficially gull @-@ like Ichthyornis , the <unk> , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keeled breastbones , toothless , beaked portions of their jaws ( though most non @-@ avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight . 
 = = = Diversification of modern birds = = = 
 All modern birds lie within the crown group Aves ( alternately Neornithes ) , which has two subdivisions : the <unk> , which includes the flightless ratites ( such as the ostriches ) and the weak @-@ flying <unk> , and the extremely diverse <unk> , containing all other birds . These two subdivisions are often given the rank of superorder , although <unk> and Zusi assigned them " cohort " rank . Depending on the taxonomic viewpoint , the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9 @,@ 800 to 10 @,@ 050 . 
 Due largely to the discovery of <unk> , a late Cretaceous neognath member of the duck lineage , Aves is known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era . Studies using a " morphological clock " analysis have estimated that the actual origin of modern birds probably occurred slightly earlier than the earliest known fossils , during the mid @-@ Cretaceous period . 
 The earliest divergence within the Neognathes was that of the <unk> , the superorder containing the Anseriformes ( ducks , geese , swans and screamers ) and the Galliformes ( the pheasants , grouse , and their allies , together with the mound builders and the <unk> and their allies ) . The earliest fossil remains of true birds come from the possible galliform <unk> <unk> , dated to about 85 million years ago , but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists . The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous , and the split between the <unk> from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event , but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs . This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence ; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation , while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation . Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial , but recent results show that all the extant groups of birds originated from only a small handful of species that survived the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction .

 Cladogram of modern bird relationships based on Jarvis , E.D. et al . ( 2014 ) with some clade names after Yury , T. et al . ( 2013 ) . 
 The classification of birds is a contentious issue . Sibley and Ahlquist 's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds ( 1990 ) is a landmark work on the classification of birds , although it is frequently debated and constantly revised . Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate , but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves ; evidence from modern bird anatomy , fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem , but no strong consensus has emerged . More recently , new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders . The most recent effort is drawn above and is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 representative species . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents , reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel 's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres ( 270 mi ) inland in Antarctica . The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions . It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics , however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics . Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world 's oceans and in them , with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres ( 980 ft ) . 
 Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans . Some of these introductions have been deliberate ; the ring @-@ necked pheasant , for example , has been introduced around the world as a game bird . Others have been accidental , such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity . Some species , including cattle egret , yellow @-@ headed caracara and galah , have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 Compared with other vertebrates , birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations , mostly to facilitate flight . 
 = = = Skeletal system = = = 
 The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones . They have large air @-@ filled cavities ( called pneumatic cavities ) which connect with the respiratory system . The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures . The orbits are large and separated by a bony septum . The spine has cervical , thoracic , lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical ( neck ) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible , but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae . The last few are fused with the pelvis to form the <unk> . The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders . The forelimbs are modified into wings . 
 = = = <unk> system = = = 
 Like the reptiles , birds are primarily <unk> , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine . Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and ( with exception of the ostrich ) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a <unk> waste . However , birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively <unk> , excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia . They also excrete creatine , rather than creatinine like mammals . This material , as well as the output of the intestines , emerges from the bird 's cloaca . The cloaca is a multi @-@ purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cloaca , and females lay eggs from it . In addition , many species of birds regurgitate pellets . Males within <unk> ( with the exception of the kiwis ) , the Anseriformes ( with the exception of screamers ) , and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes ( but fully developed in <unk> ) possess a penis , which is never present in <unk> . The length is thought to be related to sperm competition . When not copulating , it is hidden within the <unk> compartment within the cloaca , just inside the vent . The digestive system of birds is unique , with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth . Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight . Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies , including protein from the intestines , as additional energy during migration . 
 = = = Respiratory and circulatory systems = = = 
 Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups . Upon inhalation , 75 % of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air . The other 25 % of the air goes directly into the lungs . When the bird exhales , the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs . Thus , a bird 's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation . Sound production is achieved using the syrinx , a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea ; the trachea being elongated in some species , increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird 's size . 
 In birds , the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch ( or pharyngeal arch ) , unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta . The <unk> receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system . Unlike in mammals , the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus . 
 = = = = Heart type and features = = = = 
 The avian circulatory system is driven by a four @-@ chambered , <unk> heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac . This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication . The heart itself is divided into a right and left half , each with an atrium and ventricle . The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by <unk> valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction . Being <unk> , the heart 's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the <unk> node , located on the right atrium . The <unk> node uses calcium to cause a <unk> signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left <unk> bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles . The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers . Much like a mammalian heart , the avian heart is composed of <unk> , myocardial and <unk> layers . The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls , due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body . Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass . This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight . 
 = = = = Organization = = = = 
 Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood ; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals . As a result , birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal . The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction , and become more rigid as they move away from the heart . Blood moves through the arteries , which undergo vasoconstriction , and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body . As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow . Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur . <unk> are organized into capillary beds in tissues , it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste . In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues . Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart . Veins , unlike arteries , are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure . As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart . Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium , then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen . <unk> blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body . 
 = = = Nervous system = = = 
 The nervous system is large relative to the bird 's size . The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight @-@ related functions , while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns , navigation , mating and nest building . Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis , New World vultures and tubenoses . The avian visual system is usually highly developed . Water birds have special flexible lenses , allowing accommodation for vision in air and water . Some species also have dual fovea . Birds are <unk> , possessing ultraviolet ( UV ) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green , red and blue ones . This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light , which is involved in courtship . Birds have specialized light @-@ sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons . These photo @-@ receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring , and thus regulate breeding activities . 
 Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye ; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers . Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers . Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging — kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents . The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking . Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane , a third eyelid that moves horizontally . The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds . The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the <unk> . Most birds cannot move their eyes , although there are exceptions , such as the great cormorant . Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field , while birds with eyes on the front of their heads , such as owls , have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field . The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers , although in some birds , such as the Asio , Bubo and Otus owls , these feathers form tufts which resemble ears . The inner ear has a cochlea , but it is not spiral as in mammals . 
 = = = Defence and intraspecific combat = = = 
 A few species are able to use chemical defenses against predators ; some Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant oil against an aggressor , and some species of <unk> from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers . 
 A dearth of field observations limit our knowledge , but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death . The screamers ( <unk> ) , some jacanas ( Jacana , <unk> ) , the spur @-@ winged goose ( <unk> ) , the torrent duck ( <unk> ) and nine species of lapwing ( Vanellus ) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon . The steamer ducks ( <unk> ) , geese and swans ( <unk> ) , the solitaire ( Pezophaps ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , some <unk> ( <unk> ) and stone curlews ( <unk> ) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents . The jacanas <unk> and <unk> have an expanded , blade @-@ like radius . The extinct <unk> was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail . Swans , for instance , may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young . 
 = = = Chromosomes = = = 
 Birds have two sexes : either female or male . The sex of birds is determined by the Z and W sex chromosomes , rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals . Male birds have two Z chromosomes ( ZZ ) , and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome ( WZ ) . 
 In nearly all species of birds , an individual 's sex is determined at fertilization . However , one recent study demonstrated temperature @-@ dependent sex determination among the Australian <unk> , for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female @-@ to @-@ male sex ratio . This , however , was later proven to not be the case . These birds do not exhibit temperature @-@ dependent sex determination , but temperature @-@ dependent sex mortality . 
 = = = Feathers , plumage , and scales = = = 
 Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds ( though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds ) . They facilitate flight , provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation , and are used in display , camouflage , and signaling . There are several types of feathers , each serving its own set of purposes . Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called <unk> . The distribution pattern of these feather tracts ( <unk> ) is used in taxonomy and systematics . The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body , called plumage , may vary within species by age , social status , and sex . 
 Plumage is regularly moulted ; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the " non @-@ breeding " plumage , or — in the Humphrey @-@ Parkes terminology — " basic " plumage ; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey @-@ Parkes system as " alternate " plumages . Moulting is annual in most species , although some may have two moults a year , and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years . Moulting patterns vary across species . In passerines , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first . When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outermost <unk> begin to drop . After the innermost <unk> are moulted , the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( centrifugal moult ) . The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap . A small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flightless . As a general rule , the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair . Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae . The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers , in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward , secondaries inward , and the tail from center outward . Before nesting , the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly . The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation . 
 Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily , spending an average of around 9 % of their daily time on this . The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland ; these secretions protect the feathers ' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent , inhibiting the growth of feather @-@ degrading bacteria . This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants , which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting , to remove feather parasites . 
 The scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks , claws , and spurs . They are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus , but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds . Most bird scales do not overlap significantly , except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers . The scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 Most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes . Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding , feeding , and predator avoidance and escape . Birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pectoralis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the supracoracoideus , as well as a modified forelimb ( wing ) that serves as an aerofoil . Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy @-@ intensive soaring flight . About 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds . <unk> often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . Though flightless , penguins use similar musculature and movements to " fly " through the water , as do auks , shearwaters and dippers . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Most birds are diurnal , but some birds , such as many species of owls and nightjars , are nocturnal or crepuscular ( active during twilight hours ) , and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate , by day or night . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 Birds ' diets are varied and often include nectar , fruit , plants , seeds , carrion , and various small animals , including other birds . Because birds have no teeth , their digestive system is adapted to process <unk> food items that are swallowed whole . 
 Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists , while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists . Birds ' feeding strategies vary by species . Many birds glean for insects , invertebrates , fruit , or seeds . Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch . Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial ' biological control agents ' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs . Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds , sunbirds , <unk> , and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co @-@ adapted flowers . Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates ; shorebirds ' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches . Loons , diving ducks , penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater , using their wings or feet for propulsion , while aerial predators such as sulids , kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey . Flamingos , three species of prion , and some ducks are filter feeders . Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers . 
 Some species , including frigatebirds , gulls , and skuas , engage in kleptoparasitism , stealing food items from other birds . Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting , rather than a significant part of any species ' diet ; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40 % of their food and on average stole only 5 % . Other birds are scavengers ; some of these , like vultures , are specialised carrion eaters , while others , like gulls , corvids , or other birds of prey , are opportunists . 
 = = = Water and drinking = = = 
 Water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands . Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food . They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise , saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting . Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils . 
 Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat . Some species , especially of arid zones , belonging to the pigeon , finch , <unk> , button @-@ quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads . Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes . Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers . Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food . The pigeon family , flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks . 
 = = = Feather care = = = 
 Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird , require maintenance . Apart from physical wear and tear , feathers face the onslaught of fungi , ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice . The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland . Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves . While some birds dip into shallow water , more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves . Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust @-@ bathe . A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers . Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures , therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat . These migrations vary among the different groups . Many landbirds , shorebirds , and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations , usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions . These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non @-@ breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere . Before migration , birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs . Migration is highly demanding energetically , particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling . <unk> have a flight range of around 2 @,@ 500 km ( 1 @,@ 600 mi ) and shorebirds can fly up to 4 @,@ 000 km ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) , although the bar @-@ tailed godwit is capable of non @-@ stop flights of up to 10 @,@ 200 km ( 6 @,@ 300 mi ) . Seabirds also undertake long migrations , the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters , which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan , Alaska and California , an annual round trip of 64 @,@ 000 km ( 39 @,@ 800 mi ) . Other seabirds disperse after breeding , travelling widely but having no set migration route . Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons . 
 Some bird species undertake shorter migrations , travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food . <unk> species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next . This type of migration is normally associated with food availability . Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range , with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics ; others undertake partial migrations , where only a fraction of the population , usually females and subdominant males , migrates . Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions ; in Australia , surveys found that 44 % of non @-@ passerine birds and 32 % of passerines were partially migratory . <unk> migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions . It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food . Some species may also be nomadic , holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability . Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive , irruptive , nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations . 
 The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time ; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in <unk> , Wales , within 13 days , a distance of 5 @,@ 150 km ( 3 @,@ 200 mi ) . Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods . For diurnal migrants , the sun is used to navigate by day , and a stellar compass is used at night . Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock . Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris . These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth 's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals . Signals can be interspecific ( between species ) and intraspecific ( within species ) . 
 Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance , to display breeding condition in sexually selected species , or to make threatening displays , as in the <unk> 's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks . Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds , particularly between species . Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays , which have developed from non @-@ signalling actions such as preening , the adjustments of feather position , pecking , or other behaviour . These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair @-@ bonds . The most elaborate displays occur during courtship , where " dances " are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements ; males ' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays . 
 Bird calls and songs , which are produced in the syrinx , are the major means by which birds communicate with sound . This communication can be very complex ; some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently , allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs . 
 Calls are used for a variety of purposes , including mate attraction , evaluation of potential mates , bond formation , the claiming and maintenance of territories , the identification of other individuals ( such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season ) , and the warning of other birds of potential predators , sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat . Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication . The <unk> snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers , woodpeckers drum territorially , and palm cockatoos use tools to drum . 
 = = = <unk> and other associations = = = 
 While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups , other birds may form large flocks . The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency . Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests , where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system . This has led to the development of many mixed @-@ species feeding flocks , which are usually composed of small numbers of many species ; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources . Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases . 
 Birds sometimes also form associations with non @-@ avian species . Plunge @-@ diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna , which push shoaling fish towards the surface . <unk> have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses , in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators . 
 = = = Resting and roosting = = = 
 The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times . Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep , where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye @-@ opening " peeks " , allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats . Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight . It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight . Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow @-@ wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time . The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock . This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock . This adaptation is also known from marine mammals . Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators . Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety . 
 Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers , although others place their beaks among their breast feathers . Many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . <unk> birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep . Many ground birds , such as quails and pheasants , roost in trees . A few parrots of the genus <unk> roost hanging upside down . Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species , including owlet @-@ nightjars , nightjars , and woodswallows . One species , the common <unk> , even enters a state of hibernation . Birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 = = = = Social systems = = = = 
 Ninety @-@ five percent of bird species are socially monogamous . These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or — in some cases — for several years or until the death of one mate . Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care , which is especially important for species in which females require males ' assistance for successful brood @-@ rearing . Among many socially monogamous species , extra @-@ pair copulation ( infidelity ) is common . Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males , but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other <unk> . Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation , a hundred days in some species . Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism . For females , possible benefits of extra @-@ pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate . Males of species that engage in extra @-@ pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise . 
 Other mating systems , including polygyny , polyandry , polygamy , polygynandry , and promiscuity , also occur . <unk> breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males . Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances . 
 Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display , typically performed by the male . Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song . Some displays , however , are quite elaborate . Depending on the species , these may include wing or tail drumming , dancing , aerial flights , or communal lekking . Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection , although in the polyandrous phalaropes , this is reversed : plainer males choose brightly coloured females . Courtship feeding , billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners , generally after the birds have paired and mated . 
 Homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds , including copulation , pair @-@ bonding , and joint parenting of chicks . 
 = = = = Territories , nesting and incubation = = = = 
 Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season ; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks . Species that are unable to defend feeding territories , such as seabirds and swifts , often breed in colonies instead ; this is thought to offer protection from predators . Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites , and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense . 
 All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate . Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs , while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs . There are many exceptions to this pattern , however ; the ground @-@ nesting nightjars have pale eggs , and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage . Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite 's egg , which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts . 
 Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest . Most species create somewhat elaborate nests , which can be cups , domes , plates , beds scrapes , mounds , or burrows . Some bird nests , however , are extremely primitive ; albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground . Most birds build nests in sheltered , hidden areas to avoid predation , but large or colonial birds — which are more capable of defence — may build more open nests . During nest construction , some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite @-@ reducing toxins to improve chick survival , and feathers are often used for nest insulation . Some bird species have no nests ; the cliff @-@ nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock , and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet . The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground @-@ nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial . 
 Incubation , which optimises temperature for chick development , usually begins after the last egg has been laid . In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared , whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation . <unk> from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches , areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds . Incubation can be an energetically demanding process ; adult albatrosses , for instance , lose as much as 83 grams ( 2 @.@ 9 oz ) of body weight per day of incubation . The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun , decaying vegetation or volcanic sources . Incubation periods range from 10 days ( in woodpeckers , cuckoos and passerine birds ) to over 80 days ( in albatrosses and kiwis ) . 
 The diversity of characteristics of birds is great , sometimes even in closely related species . Several avian characteristics are compared in the table below . 
 = = = = Parental care and fledging = = = = 
 At the time of their hatching , chicks range in development from helpless to independent , depending on their species . Helpless chicks are termed altricial , and tend to be born small , blind , immobile and naked ; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial . <unk> chicks need help <unk> and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks . Chicks at neither of these extremes can be semi @-@ precocial or semi @-@ altricial . 
 The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species . At one extreme , parental care in megapodes ends at hatching ; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately . At the other extreme , many seabirds have extended periods of parental care , the longest being that of the great frigatebird , whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months . The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched . The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation . 
 In some species , both parents care for nestlings and fledglings ; in others , such care is the responsibility of only one sex . In some species , other members of the same species — usually close relatives of the breeding pair , such as offspring from previous broods — will help with the raising of the young . Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida , which includes such birds as the true crows , Australian magpie and fairy @-@ wrens , but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite . Among most groups of animals , male parental care is rare . In birds , however , it is quite common — more so than in any other vertebrate class . Though territory and nest site defence , incubation , and chick feeding are often shared tasks , there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty . 
 The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically . The chicks of the <unk> murrelets , like the ancient murrelet , leave the nest the night after they hatch , following their parents out to sea , where they are raised away from terrestrial predators . Some other species , such as ducks , move their chicks away from the nest at an early age . In most species , chicks leave the nest just before , or soon after , they are able to fly . The amount of parental care after fledging varies ; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help , while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging . Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration . 
 = = = = Brood parasites = = = = 
 Brood parasitism , in which an egg @-@ layer leaves her eggs with another individual 's brood , is more common among birds than any other type of organism . After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird 's nest , they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host 's own brood . Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites , which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young , or non @-@ obligate brood parasites , which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young . One hundred bird species , including <unk> , <unk> , and ducks , are obligate parasites , though the most famous are the cuckoos . Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host 's young , which allows them to destroy the host 's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host 's chicks ; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks . 
 = = = = Sexual selection = = = = 
 Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors , with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway . Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and color differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations . Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified ; intersexual selection , also known as female choice ; and intrasexual competition , where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate . Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual ’ s fitness . Conflicts between an individual fitness and signaling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behavior are " honest " traits . Signals must be costly to ensure that only good @-@ quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviors . 
 = = = = Inbreeding depression = = = = 
 Inbreeding causes early death ( inbreeding depression ) in the zebra finch <unk> guttata . Embryo survival ( that is , hatching success of fertile eggs ) was significantly lower for sib @-@ sib mating pairs than for unrelated pairs . 
 Darwin ’ s finch <unk> scandens experiences inbreeding depression ( reduced survival of offspring ) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability . 
 = = = = Inbreeding avoidance = = = = 
 <unk> matings by the purple @-@ crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression ( greater than 30 % reduction in <unk> of eggs ) . Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings ( see Promiscuity # Other animals for 90 % frequency in avian species ) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding . However , there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings . Nevertheless , 43 % of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young . 
 Inbreeding depression occurs in the great tit ( Parus major ) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness . In natural populations of Parus major , inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace , which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative . 
 Southern pied babblers <unk> bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways . The first is through dispersal , and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates . Although both males and females disperse locally , they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered . Within their group , individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite @-@ sex breeder is unrelated . 
 Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring , usually males , delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin . Female offspring rarely stay at home , dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently , or to join unrelated groups . In general , inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness ( inbreeding depression ) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles . Cross @-@ fertilization between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions . While some birds are generalists , others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements . Even within a single habitat , such as a forest , the niches occupied by different species of birds vary , with some species feeding in the forest canopy , others beneath the canopy , and still others on the forest floor . Forest birds may be insectivores , frugivores , and nectarivores . Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing , plant eating , and piracy or kleptoparasitism . Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds , while vultures are specialised scavengers . <unk> are animals that are specialized at preying on birds . 
 Some nectar @-@ feeding birds are important pollinators , and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal . Plants and pollinating birds often <unk> , and in some cases a flower 's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar . 
 Birds are often important to island ecology . Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not ; on those islands , birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals . For example , in New Zealand the moas were important browsers , as are the <unk> and <unk> today . Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa . Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas , principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano , which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas . 
 A wide variety of avian ecology field methods , including counts , nest monitoring , and capturing and marking , are used for researching avian ecology . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 Since birds are highly visible and common animals , humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man . Sometimes , these relationships are mutualistic , like the cooperative honey @-@ gathering among <unk> and African peoples such as the <unk> . Other times , they may be commensal , as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities . Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests , and some pose an aviation hazard . Human activities can also be detrimental , and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction ( hunting , avian lead poisoning , pesticides , roadkill , and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds ) . 
 Birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis , salmonellosis , campylobacteriosis , <unk> ( avian tuberculosis ) , avian influenza ( bird flu ) , <unk> , and <unk> over long distances . Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans . 
 = = = Economic importance = = = 
 Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs , called poultry , are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans ; in 2003 , 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide . Chickens account for much of human poultry consumption , though domesticated turkeys , ducks , and geese are also relatively common . Many species of birds are also hunted for meat . Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas . The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl ; other widely hunted birds include pheasants , wild turkeys , quail , doves , partridge , grouse , snipe , and woodcock . <unk> is also popular in Australia and New Zealand . Though some hunting , such as that of muttonbirds , may be sustainable , hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species . 
 Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers ( especially the down of geese and ducks ) , which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding , and seabird feces ( guano ) , which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen . The War of the Pacific , sometimes called the Guano War , was fought in part over the control of guano deposits . 
 Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes . Colourful birds , such as parrots and mynas , are bred in captivity or kept as pets , a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species . Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing , respectively . Messenger pigeons , used since at least 1 AD , remained important as recently as World War II . Today , such activities are more common either as hobbies , for entertainment and tourism , or for sports such as pigeon racing . 
 Amateur bird enthusiasts ( called birdwatchers , <unk> or , more commonly , birders ) number in the millions . Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species . Bird feeding has grown into a multimillion @-@ dollar industry ; for example , an estimated 75 % of households in Britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter . 
 = = = In religion and mythology = = = 
 Birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology . In religion , birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity , such as in the Cult of Makemake , in which the <unk> manu of Easter Island served as chiefs or as attendants , as in the case of Hugin and Munin , the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin . In several civilizations of ancient Italy , particularly Etruscan and Roman religion , priests were involved in augury , or interpreting the words of birds while the " <unk> " ( from which the word " auspicious " is derived ) watched their activities to foretell events . They may also serve as religious symbols , as when Jonah ( Hebrew : <unk> , dove ) embodied the fright , passivity , mourning , and beauty traditionally associated with doves . Birds have themselves been deified , as in the case of the common peacock , which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India . In religious images preserved from the Inca and <unk> empires , birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms . Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds . 
 = = = In culture and folklore = = = 
 Birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times , when they were represented in early cave paintings . Some birds have been perceived as monsters , including the mythological Roc and the Māori 's legendary <unk> , a giant bird capable of snatching humans . Birds were later used as symbols of power , as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors . With the advent of scientific interest in birds , many paintings of birds were commissioned for books . Among the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon , whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society . Birds are also important figures in poetry ; for example , Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey , and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2 . The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a ' burden ' . Other English metaphors derive from birds ; vulture funds and vulture investors , for instance , take their name from the scavenging vulture . 
 Perceptions of bird species vary across cultures . Owls are associated with bad luck , witchcraft , and death in parts of Africa , but are regarded as wise across much of Europe . Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia , but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe and harbingers of war in Scandinavia . 
 = = = In music = = = 
 In music , birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways : they can be inspired by birdsong ; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition , as Vivaldi and Beethoven did , along with many later composers ; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works , as Ottorino Respighi first did ; or like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg , they can duet with birds . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species , such as the barn swallow and European starling , they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species . Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times , although the most dramatic human @-@ caused avian extinctions , eradicating an estimated 750 – 1800 species , occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian , Polynesian , and Micronesian islands . Many bird populations are declining worldwide , with 1 @,@ 227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009 . 
 The most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss . Other threats include overhunting , accidental mortality due to structural collisions or long @-@ line fishing bycatch , pollution ( including oil spills and pesticide use ) , competition and predation from nonnative invasive species , and climate change . 
 Governments and conservation groups work to protect birds , either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions . Such projects have produced some successes ; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004 , including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet . 
 = Kepler @-@ 10b = 
 Kepler @-@ 10b is the first confirmed terrestrial planet to have been discovered outside the Solar System . Discovered after several months of data collection during the course of the NASA @-@ directed Kepler Mission , which aims to discover Earth @-@ like planets crossing in front of their host stars , the planet 's discovery was announced on January 10 , 2011 . Kepler @-@ 10b has a mass of 3 @.@ 33 ± 0 @.@ 49 Earth masses and a radius of 1 @.@ 4 Earth radii . However , it lies extremely close to its star , Kepler @-@ 10 , and as a result is too hot to support life . Its existence was confirmed using measurements from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii . 
 = = Nomenclature and history = = 
 Kepler @-@ 10 , the star that hosts Kepler @-@ 10b , is located 560 light @-@ years from our solar system in the Draco constellation . It is approximately the same size as the Sun , with an estimated age of 12 billion years . Planet Kepler @-@ 10b was the first planet to be discovered in the orbit of its star . For this , it was designated the star 's b planet . The star , in turn , was named for the Kepler Mission , a NASA @-@ led operation aimed at discovering terrestrial planets that transit , or cross in front of , their host stars with respect to Earth . The planet 's discovery was announced to the public on January 10 , 2011 . 
 The transit method of discovering exoplanets relies upon carefully monitoring the brightness of a star . If a planet is present and crosses the line of sight between Earth and the star , the star will dim at a regular interval by an amount that depends upon the radius of the transiting planet . In order to measure the mass of a planet , and rule out other phenomena that can mimic the presence of a planet transiting a star , candidate transiting planets are followed up with the radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets . 
 Kepler @-@ 10b 's discovery was based on eight months of data collected with the Kepler telescope from May 2009 to January 2010 . The planet 's first transits were observed in July 2009 . According to the collected data , Kepler @-@ 10 dimmed by one part in ten thousand every 0 @.@ 83 days . Kepler @-@ 10 was the first star in the field of view of the Kepler telescope identified as capable of harboring a small transiting planet , and was considered a high priority target for ground based radial velocity observations intended to confirm the mass of Kepler @-@ 10b . Radial velocity measurements with the Keck I telescope taken intermittently between August 2009 and August 2010 revealed a periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of Kepler @-@ 10 consistent with a planet of the nature observed by Kepler , confirming the planet 's existence and allowing its mass to be determined . The planet 's discovery was announced to the public on January 10 , 2011 . 
 On January 13 , 2011 , 3 days after the planet 's discovery was announced , The Economist published an article suggesting “ Vulcan ” as an unofficial name for the planet , after both the hypothetical planet , and the Roman god of the same name . 
 In September 2011 , the detection of secondary transit and phases were announced . This allowed to determine the temperature and albedo of the planet . This is the first terrestrial exoplanet with observed phases . Detection of phases was possible due to extreme day / night side temperature variations and the amount of starlight the planet receives due to its proximity to the host star . 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 Kepler @-@ 10b 's discovery excited astronomers , who hoped to use data about it to inquire into the formation and structure that terrestrial , Earth @-@ size planets tend to have in common . Geoff Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley said that the discovery was ranked “ as among the most profound scientific discoveries in human history , ” and that the planet “ will go into every textbook worldwide . ” Marcy also described Kepler @-@ 10b as " a bridge between the gas giant planets we ’ ve been finding and the Earth itself . " Diana Valencia at the University of Côte d 'Azur in Nice , France considered the planet more of a " super @-@ Mercury " than a super @-@ Earth , granted its physical characteristics . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 10b is most noted for its rocky surface . It has a diameter 1 @.@ 4 times that of the Earth , and a mass of 3 @.@ 33 ± 0 @.@ 49 times that of Earth . The density of Kepler @-@ 10b is 5 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 8 g cm − 3 . It orbits its star , Kepler @-@ 10 , in less than a day , at less than a twentieth of the distance from Mercury to the Sun . Its surface temperature on the star lit side is approximately 1833 K , which is as hot as a blast furnace and hot enough to melt iron . 
 Though CoRoT @-@ 7b was discovered before Kepler @-@ 10b and has been claimed to be rocky , there is more room for other interpretations in the case of CoRoT @-@ 7b 's composition than there is for Kepler @-@ 10b . This is due to the much larger uncertainty in CoRoT @-@ 7b 's mass ( and , to a lesser extent , its radius ) which is illustrated in the plot to the left . Consequently , CoRoT @-@ 7b may be revealed to be a lava @-@ ocean planet , whereas Kepler @-@ 10b must be predominantly made of rock or iron . In addition to showing the range of masses and radii consistent with the observations of each planet , the plot includes curves of compositions implied by certain masses and radii . 
 Kepler @-@ 10b is tidally locked to its parent star and has extreme variations in temperature between day and night sides . It also reflects about half of the starlight it receives . 
 = Taxonomy of Narcissus = 
 The taxonomy of Narcissus is complex , and still not fully resolved . Known to the ancients , the genus name appears in Graeco @-@ Roman literature , although their interest was as much medicinal as botanical . It is unclear which species the ancients were familiar with . Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and <unk> texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753 . By 1789 it had been grouped into a family ( Narcissi ) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae , from which comes the modern placement within Amaryllidaceae , although for a while it was considered part of Liliaceae . 
 Many of the species now considered to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century , and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties . By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled . By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established , nested within a series of subfamilies ( Amaryllidoideae ) and tribes ( Narcisseae ) . It shares its position in the latter tribe with Sternbergia . 
 The infrageneric classification has been even more complex and many schemes of subgenera , sections , subsections and series have been proposed , although all had certain similarities . Most authorities now consider there to be 10 – 11 sections based on phylogenetic evidence . The problems have largely arisen from the diversity of the wild species , frequent natural hybridisation and extensive cultivation with escape and subsequent naturalisation . The number of species has varied anywhere from 16 to nearly 160 , but is probably around 50 – 60 . 
 The genus appeared some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras , around 24 million years ago , in the Iberian peninsula . While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic , and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection . In the English language the common name Daffodil appears to be derived from the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared .

 A genus that is very complex and burdened with numerous uncertainties 
 = = = Early = = = 
 Narcissus was first described by Theophrastus ( <unk> , c 371 - c 287 BC ) in his Historia Plantarum ( Greek : Περὶ φυτῶν <unk> ) as νάρκισσος , referring to N. poeticus , but comparing it to <unk> ( <unk> ) . Theophrastus ' description was frequently referred to at length by later authors writing in Latin such as Pliny the Elder ( Gaius <unk> Secundus , 23 AD – 79 AD ) from whom came the Latin form narcissus ( see also Culture ) . Pliny 's account comes to us in his Natural History ( Latin : Naturalis Historia ) . Like his contemporaries , his interests were as much therapeutic as botanical . Another much cited Greek authority was Dioscorides ( <unk> , 40 AD – 90 AD ) in his De Materia Medica ( Greek : Περὶ <unk> <unk> ) . Both authors were to remain influential till at least the <unk> , given that their descriptions went beyond the merely botanical , to the therapeutic ( see also Antiquity ) . 
 An early European reference is found in the work of Albert Magnus ( c . 1200 – 1280 ) , who noted in his De <unk> et plantis the similarity to the leek . William Turner in his A New Herball ( 1551 ) cites all three extensively in his description of the plant and its properties . It was to remain to Linnaeus in 1753 to formally describe and name Narcissus as a genus in his Species Plantarum , at which time there were six known species ( N. poeticus , N. pseudonarcissus , N. bulbocodium , N. serotinus , N. <unk> and N. tazetta ) . At that time , Linnaeus loosely grouped it together with 50 other genera into his <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Modern = = = 
 It was de Jussieu in 1789 who first formally created a ' family ' ( Narcissi ) , as the seventh ' Ordo ' ( Order ) of the third class ( Stamina <unk> ) of <unk> in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed . The use of the term Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family , rather than Order . The family has undergone much reorganisation since then , but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family , Amaryllis , as ' Amaryllideae ' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since . Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus , omitting N. serotinus . 
 De Candolle brought together Linnaeus ' genera and <unk> 's families into a systematic taxonomy for the first time , but included Narcissus ( together with Amaryllis ) in the Liliaceae in his Flore française ( 1805 @-@ 1815 ) rather than Amaryllidaceae , a family he had not yet recognised . Shortly thereafter he separated the ' <unk> ' from ' <unk> ' ( 1813 ) , though attributing the term to Brown 's ' Amaryllideae ' in the latter 's Prodromus ( 1810 ) rather than St.-Hilaire 's ' <unk> ' . He also provided the text to the first four volumes of <unk> illustrations in the latter 's Les <unk> between 1805 and 1808 ( see illustration here of N. <unk> ) . 
 Historically both wide and narrow interpretations of the genus have been proposed . In the nineteenth century genus splitting was common , favouring the narrow view . Haworth ( 1831 ) using a narrow view treated many species as separate genera , as did Salisbury ( 1866 ) . These authors listed various species in related genera such as <unk> ( hybrids ) , Ajax ( = Pseudonarcissus ) and Hermione ( = Tazettae ) , sixteen in all in Haworth 's classification . In contrast , Herbert ( 1837 ) took a very wide view reducing Harworth 's sixteen genera to six . Herbert , treating the <unk> as an ' order ' as was common then , considered the narcissi to be a suborder , the Narcisseae , the six genera being <unk> , Ajax , Ganymedes , <unk> , Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species . Later Spach ( 1846 ) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth 's genera into the genus Narcissus , but as separate subgenera . By the time that Baker ( 1875 ) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus . The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude ( e.g. Cullen 1986 ) or include ( e.g. Webb 1978 , 1980 ) . Today it is nearly always included . 
 The eventual position of Narcissus within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in the twenty @-@ first century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system . The genus Narcissus belongs to the Narcisseae tribe , one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae . It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae , being distinguished from Sternbergia by the presence of a paraperigonium , and is monophyletic . 
 = = Subdivision = = 
 The infrageneric phylogeny of Narcissus still remains relatively unsettled . The taxonomy has proved very complex and difficult to resolve , particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group . This is due to a number of factors , including the diversity of the wild species , the ease with which natural hybridisation occurs , and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation . 
 De Candolle , in the first systematic taxonomy of Narcissus , arranged the species into named groups , and those names ( Faux @-@ Narcisse or Pseudonarcissus , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name . The evolution of classification was confused by including many unknown or garden varieties , until Baker ( 1875 ) made the important distinction of excluding all specimens except the wild species from his system . He then grouped all of the earlier related genera as sections under one genus , Narcissus , the exception being the monotypic Tapeinanthus . Consequently , the number of accepted species has varied widely . 
 A common modern classification system has been that of Fernandes ( 1951 , 1968 , 1975 ) based on cytology , as modified by Blanchard ( 1990 ) and Mathew ( 2002 ) , although in some countries such as Germany , the system of Meyer ( 1966 ) was preferred . Fernandes described two subgenera based on basal chromosome number , Hermione , n 
 = 5 ( 11 ) and Narcissus , n = 
 7 ( 13 ) . He further subdivided these into ten sections ( Apodanthi , Aurelia , <unk> , Ganymedes , Jonquillae , Narcissus , <unk> , <unk> , Tapeinanthus , Tazettae ) , as did Blanchard later . 
 In contrast to Fernandes , Webb 's treatment of the genus for the Flora Europaea ( 1978 , 1980 ) prioritised morphology over genetics , and abandoned the subgenera ranks . He also restored De Candolle 's original nomenclature , and made a number of changes to section Jonquilla , merging the existing subsections , reducing Apodanthi to a subsection of Jonquilla , and moving N. viridiflorus from Jonquilla to a new monotypic section of its own ( <unk> ) . Finally , he divided Pseudonarcissus into two subsections . Blanchard ( 1990 ) , whose Narcissus : a guide to wild daffodils has been very influential , adopted a simple approach , restoring <unk> , and based largely on ten sections alone . 
 The Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) currently lists ten sections , based on Fernandes ( 1968 ) , three of which are monotypic ( contain only one species ) , while two others only containing two species . Most species are placed in Pseudonarcissus While infrageneric groupings within Narcissus have been relatively constant , their status ( genera , subgenera , sections , subsections , series , species ) has not . Some authors treat some sections as being further subdivided into subsections , e.g. Tazettae ( 3 subsections ) . These subdivisions correspond roughly to the popular names for narcissi types , e.g. Trumpet Daffodils , <unk> , Pheasant 's Eyes , Hoop Petticoats , Jonquils . 
 While Webb had simply divided the genus into sections , Mathew found this unsatisfactory , implying every section had equal status . He adapted both Fernandes and Webb to devise a more hierarchical scheme he believed better reflected the <unk> within the genus . Mathew 's scheme consists of three subgenera ( Narcissus , Hermione and <unk> ) . The first two subgenera were then divided into five and two sections respectively . He then further subdivided two of the sections ( subgenus Narcissus section <unk> , and subgenus Hermione section Hermione ) into three subsections each . Finally , he divided section Hermione subsection Hermione further into two series , Hermione and <unk> . While lacking a phylogenetic basis , the system is still in use in horticulture . For instance the Pacific Bulb Society uses his numbering system ( see Table II ) for classifying species . 
 = = = Phylogenetics = = = 
 The phylogenetic analysis of Graham and Barrett ( 2004 ) supported the infrageneric division of Narcissus into two clades corresponding to the subgenera Hermione and Narcissus , but does not support monophyly of all sections , with only Apodanthi demonstrating clear monophyly , corresponding to Clade III of Graham and Barrett ( see Cladogram ) , although some other clades corresponded approximately to known sections . These authors examined 36 taxa of the 65 listed then , and a later extended analysis by Rønsted et al . ( 2008 ) with five additional taxa confirmed this pattern . 
 A very large ( 375 accessions ) molecular analysis by Zonneveld ( 2008 ) utilising nuclear DNA content sought to reduce some of the paraphyly identified by Graham and Barrett . This led to a revision of the sectional structure , shifting some species between sections , eliminating one section and creating two new ones . In subgenus Hermione , Aurelia was merged with Tazettae . In subgenus Narcissus section Jonquillae subsection <unk> was elevated to sectional rank , thus resolving the paraphyly in this section observed by Graham and Barrett in Clade II due to this anomalous subsection , the remaining species being in subsection Jonquillae , which was monophyletic . The relatively large section <unk> was divided by splitting off a new section , <unk> ( species from southern Spain ) leaving species from France , northern Spain and Portugal in the parent section . At the same time Fernández @-@ Casas ( 2008 ) proposed a new monotypic section <unk> to accommodate Narcissus <unk> , placing it within subgenus Hermione . 
 While Graham and Barrett ( 2004 ) had determined that subgenus Hermione was monophyletic , using a much larger accession Santos @-@ Gally et al . ( 2011 ) did not . However the former had excluded species of hybrid origins , while the latter included both N. dubius and N. <unk> . If these two species are excluded ( forming a clade with subgenus Narcissus ) then Hermione can be considered monophyletic , although as a section of Hermione , Tazettae is not monophyletic . They also confirmed the monophyly of Apodanthi . 
 Some so @-@ called <unk> have been proposed , predominantly by Fernández @-@ Casas , to accommodate natural ( ' ancient ' ) hybrids ( <unk> ) .

 Estimates of the number of species in Narcissus have varied widely , from anywhere between 16 to nearly 160 , even in the modern era . Linnaeus originally included six species in 1753 . By the time of the 14th edition of the Systema Naturae in 1784 , there were fourteen . The 1819 Encyclopaedia Londinensis lists sixteen ( see illustration here of three species ) and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species . 
 Much of the variation lies in the definition of species , and whether closely related taxa are considered separate species or subspecies . Thus , a very wide view of each species , such as Webb 's results in few species , while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes results in a larger number . Another factor is the status of hybrids , given natural hybridisation , with a distinction between ' ancient hybrids ' and ' recent hybrids ' . The term ' ancient hybrid ' refers to hybrids found growing over a large area , and therefore now considered as separate species , while ' recent hybrid ' refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents , with a more restricted range . 
 In the twentieth century Fernandes ( 1951 ) accepted 22 species , on which were based the 27 species listed by Webb in the 1980 Flora Europaea . By 1968 , Fernandes had accepted 63 species , and by 1990 Blanchard listed 65 species , and Erhardt 66 in 1993 . In 2006 the Royal Horticultural Society 's ( RHS ) International Daffodil Register and Classified List listed 87 species , while Zonneveld 's genetic study ( 2008 ) resulted in only 36 . As of September 2014 , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts 52 species , along with at least 60 hybrids , while the RHS has 81 accepted names in its October 2014 list .

 Within the Narcisseae , Narcissus ( western Mediterranean ) diverged from Sternbergia ( Eurasia ) some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras , around 29 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 1 Ma , with a best estimate of 23 @.@ 6 Ma . Later the genus divided into the two subgenera ( Hermione and Narcissus ) between 27 @.@ 4 – 16 @.@ 1 Ma ( 21 @.@ 4 Ma ) . The divisions between the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19 @.@ 9 – 7 @.@ 8 Ma . 
 Narcissus appears to have arisen in the area of the Iberian peninsula , southern France and north @-@ western Italy , and within this area most sections of the genus appeared , with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together . Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa . However , these are reconstructions , the Amaryllidaceae lacking a fossil record . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 = = = Narcissus = = = 
 The derivation of the Latin narcissus ( Greek : νάρκισσος ) is unknown . It may be a loanword from another language , for instance it is said to be related to the Sanskrit word <unk> , meaning ' hell ' . It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses , who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as he knelt and gazed into a pool of water , he fell into the water and drowned . In some variations , he died of starvation and thirst . In both versions , the narcissus plant sprang from where he died . Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation , and the person 's name may have come from the flower 's name . The Poet 's Narcissus ( N. poeticus ) , which grows in Greece , has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating . Again , this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited . Pliny wrote that the plant ‘ <unk> <unk> dictum , non a <unk> <unk> ’ ( named narcissus from <unk> , not from the legendary youth ) , i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( <unk> <unk> , " I grow numb " in Greek ) , not from the legend . Furthermore , there were accounts of narcissi growing , such as in the legend of Persephone , long before the story of Narcissus appeared ( see Greek culture ) . It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water . 
 Linnaeus used the Latin name for the plant in formally describing the genus , although Matthias de l 'Obel had previously used the name in describing various species of Narcissi in his Icones stirpium of 1591 , and other publications , as had Clusius in Rariorum stirpium ( 1576 ) . 
 The plural form of the common name narcissus has caused some confusion . British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms , narcissi and <unk> . In contrast , in American English the Merriam @-@ Webster Dictionary provides for a third form , narcissus , used for both singular and plural . The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English , although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order . However , Garner 's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form , narcissus being excessively sibilant . For similar reasons , Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage . Neither support narcissus as a plural form . Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter in contrast to the person of that name and the Latin genus name . 
 The name Narcissus ( feminine Narcissa ) was not uncommon in Roman times , such as Tiberius Claudius Narcissus , a Roman official in Claudius ' time , an early New Testament Christian in Rome and later bishops and saints . 
 = = = Daffodil = = = 
 The word daffodil was unknown in the English language before the sixteenth century . The name is derived from an earlier <unk> , a variant of asphodel . In classical Greek literature the narcissus is frequently , referred to as the asphodel , such as the meadows of the Elysian fields in Homer ( see Antiquity ) . Asphodel in turn appears to be a loanword coming from French via Mediaeval Latin <unk> from Classical Latin <unk> and ultimately the Greek <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) . The reason for the introduction of the initial d is not known , although a probable source is an etymological merging from the Dutch article de , as in de <unk> , or English the , as th <unk> or t <unk> , hence daffodil , and in French de and <unk> to form fleur d <unk> and <unk> . 
 From at least the 16th century , <unk> <unk> and <unk> have appeared as playful synonyms of the name . In common parlance and in historical documents , the term daffodil may refer specifically to populations or specimens of the wild daffodil , N. pseudonarcissus . Ellacombe suggests this may be from <unk> Lilly , citing Prior in support , though admittedly conjectural . 
 Lady Wilkinson ( 1858 ) , who provides an extensive discussion of the etymology of the various names for this plant , suggests a very different origin , namely the Old English word <unk> ( that which cometh early ) , citing a 14th @-@ century ( but likely originally much earlier ) manuscript in support of this theory , and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil . Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it .

 A profusion of names have attached themselves in the English language , either to the genus as a whole or to individual species or groups of species such as sections .

 = John Francis Jackson = 
 John Francis Jackson , DFC ( 23 February 1908 – 28 April 1942 ) was an Australian fighter ace and squadron commander of World War II . He was credited with eight aerial victories , and led No. 75 Squadron during the Battle of Port Moresby in 1942 . Born in Brisbane , he was a grazier and businessman , who also operated his own private plane , when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) Reserve in 1936 . Called up for active service following the outbreak of war in 1939 , Jackson served with No. 23 Squadron in Australia before he was posted to the Middle East in November 1940 . As a fighter pilot with No. 3 Squadron he flew Gloster Gladiators , Hawker Hurricanes and P @-@ 40 Tomahawks during the North African and Syria – Lebanon campaigns . 
 Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Mentioned in Despatches for his actions in the Middle East . Subsequently posted to the South West Pacific theatre , he was promoted to squadron leader in March 1942 and given command of No. 75 Squadron at Port Moresby in Papua , operating P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks . Described as " rugged , simple " and " true as steel " , Jackson was nicknamed " Old John " in affectionate tribute to his thirty @-@ four years . He earned praise for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby before his death in combat on 28 April . His younger brother Les took over No. 75 Squadron , and also became a fighter ace . Jacksons International Airport , Port Moresby , is named in John Jackson 's honour . 
 = = Early career = = 
 John Jackson was born on 23 February 1908 in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm , Queensland , the eldest son of businessman William Jackson and his wife Edith . Educated at Brisbane Grammar School and The Scots College , Warwick , Jackson joined the Young Australia League , with which he visited Europe . After leaving school he ran a grazing property in St George . By the early 1930s , he was in business as a stock and station agent , and had interests in engineering and financial concerns . He was inspired by the 1934 London to Melbourne Air Race to take up flying , and purchased a Klemm Swallow monoplane . In 1936 , he took part in the South Australian centenary air race , flying from Brisbane to Adelaide . That August , he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) Reserve , or Citizen Air Force . In 1937 , he upgraded his aircraft to a Beechcraft <unk> , a type that was faster than many in the RAAF 's inventory . 
 On 17 February 1938 , Jackson married Elisabeth Thompson at Christ Church , North Adelaide ; the couple had a son and a daughter . Following the outbreak of World War II , Jackson was called up for active duty and commissioned as a pilot officer in the RAAF on 2 October 1939 . His twenty @-@ year @-@ old brother Arthur , also a pilot and keen to join the Air Force , was killed in a flying accident later that month . Two other brothers , Edward and Leslie , joined the RAAF in November . John Jackson served initially with No. 23 Squadron , which operated CAC Wirraways at Archerfield , Queensland . He was promoted to flying officer in April 1940 . That October , he was posted to join No. 3 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron , which had been based in Egypt since August . He arrived in the Middle East in November 1940 .

 = = = Middle East = = = 
 Jackson first saw action with No. 3 Squadron in the North African campaign at the controls of a Gloster Gladiator . Soon after he arrived , he had an accident taking off that finished with the biplane on its nose . Though he considered himself a " full @-@ blown operational pilot " , his experience in air @-@ to @-@ air gunnery was " practically nil " , and he essentially learned the skills of being a fighter pilot as he went along . Once the unit had converted to Hawker Hurricanes , he began to score victories in quick succession . He shot down three Junkers Ju 87s in a single sortie near Mersa Matruh on 18 February 1941 , the same action in which Gordon Steege claimed three . 
 On 5 April 1941 , Jackson fired several bursts at a Ju 87 before his guns jammed ; he then made two dummy attacks and forced the German plane to crash land in a wadi , thus claiming his fourth victory . After converting to P @-@ 40 Tomahawks , No. 3 Squadron took part in the Syria – Lebanon campaign . Jackson became an ace on 25 June , when he destroyed a Potez 630 light bomber ( possibly a misidentified LeO 451 ) of the Vichy French air force . He claimed a Dewoitine D.520 fighter on 10 July . The next day Jackson shared in the destruction of another D.520 with Bobby Gibbes ; the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it ; Gibbes won to claim his first " kill " . 
 Jackson was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1941 . By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No. 3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine . With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid @-@ July , the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month . The rural @-@ bred Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria , but his stay at a first @-@ class hotel left him bewildered as to the purpose of the room 's <unk> , which he eventually determined was " some feminine arrangement " . Peter Ewer , in Storm Over Kokoda , observed : " There was something of the patrician about John Jackson , but his well @-@ to @-@ do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it . He liked a game of cards , with a bet on the outcome . " In Whispering Death , Mark Johnston noted that although " tall and blue @-@ eyed " , he " did not have the air of a ' boy 's own ' or movie star pilot " , but rather was " balding , ambling and no extrovert " . Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941 . He was mentioned in despatches , and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) for his " marked keenness and determination " during operations with No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East . The former award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1 January 1942 and the latter , which listed him as " John Henry Jackson " , on 7 April . The DFC was presented to Jackson 's widow Elisabeth , after his death . 
 = = = South West Pacific = = = 
 Following his return from the Middle East , Jackson was briefly an instructor at No. 1 Service Flying Training School , based at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria . He wrote to his wife , " I just loathe this joint . This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who have been doing it since war broke out ... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas , but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there — they are so valuable here . " In January 1942 , he was posted to No. 4 Squadron , which operated Wirraways in Canberra . 
 As the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea in early 1942 , the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia 's northern defence , Nos. 75 , 76 and 77 Squadrons . Jackson was promoted to acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer ( CO ) of No. 75 Squadron on 19 March , barely two weeks after the unit was formed at Townsville , Queensland . He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey , who had led No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No. 75 for operations at Port Moresby , where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers . Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war , to which the latter replied , " What are you fighting for ? King and country ? Well , I 'm fighting for my wife and kids and no Jap bastard 's going to get them ! " On 21 March , Jackson led the squadron 's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome to take part in the defence of Port Moresby , a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign , and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called " one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF " . The unit was equipped with P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks , whose long @-@ awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " <unk> " by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby . Jackson 's age of thirty @-@ four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot , and he was affectionately known as " Old John " to his men , one of whom was his younger brother Les , now a flight lieutenant . As CO , Jackson 's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots , many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics , and fired their guns just once . 
 On 22 March , the day after he arrived in New Guinea , Jackson took No. 75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese airfield at Lae . Rather than attacking directly from the south , he led the Kittyhawks in from the east , where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach . Achieving the surprise he had hoped for , Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield , ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti @-@ aircraft fire . The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged . They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air , and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae , along with one that had crash @-@ landed on takeoff from Moresby . The Japanese struck back the next day , destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome . With his losses mounting , Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to Horn Island in Far North Queensland , but refused . On 4 April , Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae , after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield , claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves ; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed , but seventeen others damaged . Two days later , Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef , but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that John dropped to him , not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother . 
 Jackson himself had to ditch into the sea on 10 April , when he was shot down after being surprised by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae . After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine @-@ gunning him , he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau , with the help of two New Guinea natives . When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23 April , a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger . Having survived his trek through the jungle , he dismissed the wound as " a mere scratch " . On 27 April , Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No. 75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros . Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero 's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat . The senior officers ' comments had evidently stung him , however , as he declared to his pilots : " Tomorrow I 'm going to show you how " . According to journalist <unk> White , who saw him on the night of the 27th , Jackson 's " hands and eyes were still and rock steady " but he appeared " weary in soul " and " too long in the shadows " . White concluded : " He had done more than conquer fear — he had killed it " . The next day , Jackson led No. 75 Squadron 's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort . He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed . His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet ; Jackson was identified only by his size @-@ ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore . His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight .

 Les Jackson took over command of No. 75 Squadron the day after his brother was killed . Although the squadron was no longer an effective fighting unit , it had checked Japan 's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack , and the town continued to function as an important Allied base . John Jackson was survived by his wife and children , and interred in Moresby 's Bomana War Cemetery . His estate was sworn for probate at a value of £ 29 @,@ 780 ( $ 1 @,@ 870 @,@ 800 in 2011 ) . His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial ( AWM ) , Canberra . Jackson was a keen amateur film maker , and a four @-@ minute reel of 16 mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM . Moresby 's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson 's Strip in his honour ; it later became Jacksons International Airport . In a 1989 interview , fellow No. 75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented , " I would say that had John F. Jackson not existed , the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role for as long as it was ... So the whole spirit of John F 's leadership , and I suppose his final sacrifice , was the thing that made 75 Squadron . " In March 2003 , the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity , Aboriginal fighter pilot Len Waters . 
 = New York 's 20th congressional district special election , 2009 = 
 The 2009 special election for the 20th congressional district of New York was held on March 31 , 2009 , to fill the vacancy created in January 2009 when the district 's representative , Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand , was appointed US senator from New York , replacing Hillary Clinton , who had been appointed Secretary of State in the Obama administration . The two major @-@ party candidates were Democrat Scott Murphy , a private businessman , and Republican Jim Tedisco , the minority leader of the New York State Assembly . A third @-@ party candidate , Libertarian Eric Sundwall , was initially included in the race , but later removed from the ballot . 
 The 20th district has historically been conservative , and early polls favored Tedisco , but by February 2009 the race was considered a toss @-@ up . The Republican Party considered the election to be a referendum on President Obama 's economic policy and as such , injected significant funding into Tedisco 's campaign , using well @-@ known Republicans such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , Congressional Minority Leader John Boehner , and former New York Governor George Pataki for support . Democrats used Senator Gillibrand , Vice President Joe Biden , and an endorsement from President Barack Obama to support the Murphy campaign . 
 Major issues brought up during the campaign were the candidates ' positions on President Obama 's stimulus plan , which Tedisco did not take a stance on until late in the race . Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it . Tedisco portrayed Murphy 's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal . Tedisco 's campaign also brought up Murphy 's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s . A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco 's primary residence was not in the Congressional district . 
 The race was so close that one early vote count had the candidates tied at 77 @,@ 225 votes each . Absentee ballots decided the election ; ballots were accepted until April 13 . While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts , by April 10 Murphy was leading , and by April 23 Murphy had a 401 @-@ vote advantage . Tedisco conceded the race the following day , and Murphy was sworn in on April 29 . Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy 's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success .

 New York 's 20th district in 2009 encompassed all or part of Columbia , Dutchess , Delaware , Essex , Greene , Otsego , Rensselaer , Saratoga , Warren , and Washington counties . Traditionally conservative , it had been considered a safe seat for Republicans until Blue Dog Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand defeated incumbent John E. Sweeney in the 2006 election . In November 2008 , the Republican Party held an enrollment advantage of 70 @,@ 632 registered voters across the district , down from a 93 @,@ 337 @-@ voter advantage when the district lines were drawn by the New York State Legislature in 2002 . Although Republican George W. Bush carried the district by an eight @-@ point margin in the 2004 presidential election , Democrat Barack Obama won the district in 2008 by a three @-@ point margin , or approximately 10 @,@ 000 votes of over 330 @,@ 000 cast . Gillibrand was reelected in 2008 by 24 points , a fourfold increase over her 2006 margin . 
 One of Barack Obama 's first decisions as president @-@ elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton , US Senator from New York and former Democratic presidential primary opponent , as Secretary of State ; Clinton resigned her Senate seat to take the position . The district 's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton . On February 23 , 2009 , Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31 , 2009 . Under state law , Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010 . Both the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report listed the race as a toss @-@ up .

 State Senator Betty Little and former state Assembly minority leader and 2006 Republican gubernatorial candidate John Faso had been in the running for the Republican nomination . Richard Wager , a former aide to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and State Senator Stephen <unk> had also been mentioned . Alexander " Sandy " Treadwell , the former New York Secretary of State and 2008 U.S. House challenger , had announced he would not run . On January 24 , State Assembly Minority Leader Jim Tedisco received the endorsement of Saratoga County 's Republican chairman , while the Greene County GOP endorsed Faso . 
 Jim Tedisco was the eventual Republican nominee , winning the GOP nomination on January 27 , 2009 . Tedisco represented the 110th Assembly District , which includes a significant portion of Saratoga County . Tedisco 's primary residence was not in the congressional district , although he did own a house in Saratoga Springs and much of his assembly district overlapped the congressional district . This issue would become a major talking point during the campaign .

 On January 31 , The Post @-@ Star reported that the Democrats had narrowed the field of potential candidates from over two dozen applicants down to six . The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a diner in Albany on February 1 , and selected Scott Murphy of Glens Falls , president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York , as their candidate . Other confirmed candidates included Saratoga County Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman , former New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter , Coxsackie Town Supervisor Alex <unk> , and Tracey Brooks , failed candidate for the nomination for the 21st district election in 2008 .

 New York allows electoral fusion , an arrangement allowing two or more qualified parties to list the same candidate on a ballot . The Conservative Party chose to cross @-@ endorse Tedisco on February 9 , while the Working Families Party gave its endorsement to Murphy on February 17 . On March 1 , the Independence Party , the largest third party in the 20th district , gave its endorsement to Murphy . This was the first time the Independence Party had endorsed a Democrat in the district . 
 Eric Sundwall , Chair of the New York Libertarian Party , was the Libertarian candidate for the seat . However , he was removed from the ballot on March 25 , after 3 @,@ 786 of the 6 @,@ 730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid . Under state election law , independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3 @,@ 500 valid signatures to be on the ballot . Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6 @,@ 000 of Sundwall 's signatures ; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot . The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived . Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots , which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot , were voided . On March 27 , Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him .

 The campaigns agreed to hold four debates . The first debate took place on March 2 , between Tedisco and Murphy . The second debate , sponsored by <unk> and the Times Union , took place on March 19 between Murphy and Libertarian candidate Eric Sundwall . Jim Tedisco held a town hall meeting rather than attend , claiming the debate was not one of the four originally agreed upon . The third debate took place on March 23 and the final debate was on March 26 . 
 Strategists from both parties viewed the outcome of the race as a " referendum on President Obama 's handling of the economy " . Chairman Michael Steele of the Republican National Committee said the special election was the first of three elections that were " incredibly important " for the Republicans to win . The Republican leadership made this race a top priority , and Chairman Steele , former Governor George Pataki , House Minority Leader John Boehner , and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich helped Tedisco with fundraising . Steele visited the district twice . On the Democratic side , Senator Gillibrand appeared in commercials and <unk> for Murphy , and Senator Chuck Schumer helped Murphy 's campaign with fundraising . Less than a week before the election , President Obama formally endorsed Murphy in a mass email to supporters and urged supporters to organize and vote for Murphy . A radio ad Vice President Joe Biden recorded for Murphy was released on March 25 . That same day , Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) Chairman Tim Kaine emailed 500 of the party 's top donors asking them to contribute to Murphy 's campaign . 
 The RNC spent $ 100 @,@ 000 on Tedisco 's behalf . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $ 150 @,@ 000 and the Service Employees International Union spent $ 315 @,@ 000 for Murphy . The New York State United Teachers made an effort to call its members on Murphy 's behalf , while the National Right to Life , National Republican Trust and New York State Rifle and Pistol Association organizations paid for ads and mailings supporting Tedisco . 
 Each candidate aimed to discredit the other by pointing out his opponent 's flaws or mistakes . Republicans called attention to Murphy 's failure to pay taxes on a start @-@ up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s , drawing comparison to three high @-@ profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes . Tedisco also called attention to Murphy 's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee ( NRCC ) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election , along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003 . Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls , Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC . 
 Murphy spent the first months of the campaign criticizing Tedisco 's early refusal to disclose his position on President Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act . When Tedisco came out in opposition to the legislation on March 16 , Murphy responded by writing " it 's just shameful it took well over a month for Assemblyman Tedisco to finally admit that he 'd vote ' No ' " . Murphy 's campaign described Tedisco as a career Albany politician . 
 By mid @-@ March , a provision in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue . Tedisco , who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package , used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate . On March 19 , Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy . Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation .

 With 100 percent of precincts reporting , initial counts from the election had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150 @,@ 000 cast . Columbia County 's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day , reducing Murphy 's lead to 25 votes . The lead alternated between the two candidates throughout early <unk> ; at one point the New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero @-@ vote margin , with each candidate having exactly 77 @,@ 225 votes . By April 2 , Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes . He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress , and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day . On April 7 , Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes . The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race . 
 All ballots , absentee ballot envelopes , and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans . Under the court order , absentee ballots were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts . Of the 10 @,@ 000 absentee ballots sent out to voters , 6 @,@ 000 were returned . Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted . The deadline for overseas ( including military ) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure they would have a reasonable chance of being counted . Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy 's campaign . 
 The legality of about 600 absentee ballots were contested during the count , including Senator Gillibrand 's ballot . By April 23 , Murphy was ahead by 401 votes , and Tedisco conceded the following day . Murphy was sworn in on April 29 .

 Murphy 's victory was credited to a coattail effect from Barack Obama 's election in 2008 . His support of the stimulus package and Tedisco 's failed attempt at clearly explaining his ( Tedisco 's ) opposition to the package also had an impact . Further explanations for the Republican defeat ranged from accusations that Tedisco " dither [ ed ] on the stimulus bill " , to intimations that Tedisco only became his party 's nominee by manipulating the selection process . In an editorial , the Wall Street Journal contended that being an " Albany careerist " and running confusing campaign ads had hurt Tedisco . Tedisco 's loss immediately made him appear vulnerable to Democrats hoping to capture his seat in the Assembly . 
 The day after being sworn in , Murphy hired Todd Schulte , his campaign manager , as his new chief of staff . He also hired one of Governor Paterson 's aides , Maggie McKeon , as his communications director . For his district director , Murphy turned to Rob Scholz , a Republican . Scholz had worked on Murphy 's campaign and had received praise from Larry Bulman , the chairman of the Saratoga County Democratic Committee . Within a month of being elected , Murphy opened offices in Saratoga Springs and Hudson . Murphy served the remainder of his term , but lost a reelection bid on November 2 , 2010 , to challenger Chris Gibson , a retired Army colonel . 
 = Donald Wilson ( general ) = 
 Donald Wilson ( 25 September 1892 – 21 June 1978 ) was a United States Army Air Forces general during World War II . 
 Wilson enlisted in the Maryland National Guard as a private in 1916 and served with it on the Mexican border and the Western Front during World War I before transferring to the United States Army Air Service . After the war , he obtained a regular commission . Already qualified as an aerial observer , he became a pilot in 1922 . For many years he was an influential instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School . Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing was the most important aspect of air power . He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities , whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all of the factories . The doctrine which Wilson expounded later became the basis for AWPD @-@ 1 , the Army Air Forces ' strategic war plan developed in 1941 . 
 During World War II , Wilson served as Chief of the Personnel Division ( G @-@ l ) of the War Department General Staff . He became Chief of Staff of the Fifth Air Force in September 1942 , before returning to the United States in 1944 to become Assistant Chief of Staff , United States Army Air Forces for Organization , Commitments and Requirements . For a time he was acting Chief of Staff of Army Air Forces . In February 1945 , Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer . In June 1945 , he assumed command of the Air Force Proving Ground Command . 
 After the war , Wilson served as a member of the Gerow Board , which examined the military educational system and instituted a series of long @-@ lasting reforms . In 1947 , he was diagnosed with neurasthenia , and retired with the rank of major general . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Donald Wilson was born at Hiner 's Mill in Pendleton County , West Virginia on 25 September 1892 , the third of seven children of John Hamilton Wilson and his wife Martha Jane , née <unk> . John Wilson worked a number of odd jobs before becoming a mail carrier with the Baltimore Post Office in 1899 . Donald was educated at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute . In 1910 , he went to work as a surveyor for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . 
 = = World War I = = 
 In February 1916 , Wilson enlisted as a private in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H , 5th Maryland Infantry . This unit was called to active duty at Laurel , Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border . It was based at Eagle Pass , Texas , and , like most National Guard units , supported but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition , although it did occasionally cross the border into Mexico . Wilson was soon promoted to corporal , and later sergeant . The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917 . 
 The 5th Maryland Infantry was again called up in April 1917 following the declaration of war by the United States on the German Empire . Wilson was promoted to second lieutenant , effective 9 April 1917 . He was posted to Company C , 5th Maryland Infantry . This time , the regiment moved to Camp McClellan , Alabama , where the 5th Maryland Infantry was absorbed into the 115th Infantry of the 29th Division on 1 October 1917 . While at Camp McClellan , Wilson applied for training as an aerial observer but his request was not accepted . He was promoted to first lieutenant on 23 April 1918 . 
 In June 1918 , the 29th Division sailed from Hoboken , New Jersey to Brest , France . It travelled across France , entering the front line trenches in the <unk> @-@ le @-@ Bas sector . In France , Wilson once again applied for training as an aerial observer , in response to an appeal from American Expeditionary Forces ( AEF ) headquarters . This time , he was successful and in September 1918 he reported to the Air Service Concentration Barracks at Saint @-@ Maixent . After training there , at Camp de <unk> , and at Tours in November 1918 , he was posted to the 2nd Corps Aeronautical School at Châtillon @-@ sur @-@ Seine . He was assigned to the 186th Aero Squadron at <unk> ( <unk> ) in May 1919 , returned to the United States in July , and was discharged from the Army on 15 August 1919 . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Wilson married Edna <unk> , the older sister of the wife of his best friend in Anniston , in a ceremony in her home in Pittsburgh . After a honeymoon in Miami , Florida , they settled in Baltimore . The couple eventually had two children : Teresa Jane , born in 1921 , and Donald , born in 1923 . 
 In 1920 , Wilson applied for and received a Regular Army commission in the Air Service , into which he was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 1 July 1920 . He was immediately advanced to captain and posted to the Observation School at Post Field , Oklahoma as a senior instructor . In 1922 , he was sent to <unk> Field , Florida for primary pilot training and then to Kelly Field , Texas for advanced training . He also served there as an instructor in observation . From 1924 to 1927 , he served in Washington , DC , in the Office of the Chief of the Air Service . This was followed by a two @-@ year tour of duty in the Philippines as commander of the 2nd Observation Squadron . 
 On return to the United States in 1929 , Wilson was posted to the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field , Virginia as an instructor . In 1931 the school moved to Maxwell Field , Alabama , where he was promoted to major on 1 February 1932 . At the Air Corps Tactical School , Wilson became " one of the leading theorists ... during the thirties " . Like Giulio Douhet , the school embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing was the most important aspect of air power . However , Wilson rejected those parts of Douhet 's doctrine that called for mass bombing of cities to break the morale of the enemy . 
 Instead , in preparing the training course , Wilson drew on his knowledge that critical breaks in railroad systems could disrupt the entire system . He theorized that this was equally true of other industries , that by attacking vulnerabilities , whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all the factories . The school identified transportation , steel , iron ore , and electric power as key economic industries . Wilson termed this doctrine " industrial web theory " . 
 The <unk> of industrial web theory were relatively young junior officers , nearly all of them former reservists commissioned during or immediately after World War I. They viewed war in the abstract and admitted that they had no conclusive proof of their theories , but firmly believed that air power would dominate future warfare , after certain technological limitations had been overcome . Wilson was one of the nine key advocates , all instructors at the Tactical School , who became known as the " Bomber Mafia " : Wilson , Walker , Major Odas Moon ( who died in 1937 ) , and future generals Haywood S. Hansell , Laurence Kuter , Muir Fairchild , Robert Olds , Robert M. Webster , and Harold L. George . They espoused the doctrine in testimony to the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation in 1934 , where it was used as an argument supporting the creation of an independent air force . 
 Once adopted as doctrine , industrial web theory had a host of effects . To obtain the required accuracy to hit pinpoint targets , bombing had to be done by daylight . An improved bombsight was required : the Norden bombsight Mark XV , appearing in 1931 . Since a pursuit plane did not have the range to accompany the bombers , they had to be able to defend themselves , and new tactics called for formation flying to maximize the defense against hostile pursuit aircraft . The requirement for a better bomber led to the development of the Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress . Wilson accepted the argument , most forcibly advanced by fellow instructor Kenneth Walker , that fighter aircraft did not have the range or speed to accompany bombers and probably could not shoot them down . 
 Wilson attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , graduating in June 1934 . He considered the course to be a waste of time , " devoted in large part to the minutiae of ground officers ' duties " and " devoid of serious recognition of the airplane as an instrument of war . " After graduation he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as Director of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy , and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 16 June 1936 . From November 1938 to March 1939 , he was also assistant commandant of the school .

 Wilson was promoted to colonel on 16 October 1940 . He returned to Washington , DC , where he served in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps under Brigadier General Carl A. Spaatz , the chief of its Plans Division . In May 1940 , he was transferred to the Plans Division of the War Department General Staff , which was headed by Brigadier General Leonard T. Gerow . Wilson was briefly chief of staff of Major General Walter H. Frank 's Third Air Force in Tampa , Florida but after only two months he was recalled to Washington to again serve on the War Department General Staff , this time in the G @-@ 1 ( Personnel ) Division , which was headed by Major General John H. <unk> , a Command and General Staff School classmate . Wilson was promoted to brigadier general on 22 June 1942 . In July 1942 , <unk> left to take over command of the 84th Infantry Division and Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 1 . 
 In September 1942 , Wilson became chief of staff of Major General George Kenney 's Allied Air Forces , Southwest Pacific Area and Fifth Air Force . Kenney had specifically requested General Henry Arnold to send Wilson to replace his chief of staff , Air Vice Marshal William Bostock , an RAAF officer . Wilson had known Kenney for many years and was on a first name basis with him ; but while serving as his chief of staff , Wilson always addressed Kenney respectfully as " general " . The loss of Brigadier General Kenneth N. Walker over Rabaul in January 1943 and then his successor , Brigadier General Howard K. Ramey on a reconnaissance mission in March did not dampen Wilson 's desire to accompany a mission , and he tagged along as a passenger on a B @-@ 24 on a bombing raid on Rabaul . For his service in the Southwest Pacific , Wilson was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal . 
 In March 1944 , Arnold asked for Kenney to return Wilson to work on his own staff . Wilson took the long way back , visiting the other war theatres in India , China , the Middle East , Italy and England . Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff , Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson 's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres . Wilson therefore found himself acting chief of staff . On Giles ' return , Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff , Organization , Commitments and Requirements . In February 1945 , Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer . He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945 . 
 On 25 June 1945 , Wilson was replaced as assistant chief of staff by Major General Hoyt Vandenberg . For his service in the post , Wilson was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal . He was appointed to command the Air Force Proving Ground Command . At the time , some 22 @,@ 000 airmen were assigned to this command .

 Wilson served as a member of the Gerow Board , under his former chief , Lieutenant General Leonard T. Gerow , which examined the military educational system . The board met in Washington , DC , between 3 and 12 January 1946 . Its final report to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army , General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , recommended a system of five joint colleges , which would collectively form a National Security University under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . In addition to the existing Industrial College and National War College , the board recommended the establishment of a joint administrative college , a joint intelligence college , and a Department of State college . Wilson went further and argued for the establishment of an air university , under the control of the Army Air Forces . Wilson 's proposal was accepted , and the Gerow Board 's recommendations resulted in a multi @-@ tiered educational system still in effect today , with a Squadron Officer School for junior officers ; an Air Command and Staff College for middle level officers ; and an Air University for senior officers . All were created from the old Air Corps Tactical School . Beyond that , air officers would have to participate in joint training with their Army and Navy colleagues at the Industrial College , National War College and Joint Forces Staff College , the last two being creations of the Gerow Board . The first classes began at these two new institutions in September 1946 and January 1947 respectively . 
 In October 1946 , Wilson was diagnosed with neurasthenia . Discharged on the grounds of disability with the rank of major general , he retired to Carmel , California , where he wrote and published his memoirs , entitled Wooing <unk> , in 1973 . He died on 21 June 1978 . His papers are in the The George C. Marshall Foundation . 
 = Admiral Spiridov @-@ class monitor = 
 The Admiral Spiridov class were a pair of monitors built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s . The sister ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers . Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding , their careers were uneventful . They were reclassified as coast @-@ defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900 . The Admiral <unk> were stricken from the Navy List in 1907 ; one ship became a stationary target and the other a coal @-@ storage barge . Their ultimate fates are unknown . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 By late 1863 , the Russian Admiralty Board had begun planning for the second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction . They ordered eight ships , two fully rigged seagoing types and six coastal defense ships , in March 1864 . The British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell submitted four different designs for the coastal defense vessels , two broadside ironclads and two turret ships . The Shipbuilding Technical Committee decided in August that the broadside designs would be based on the hull shape of the earlier Pervenets @-@ class ironclad for better seaworthiness , but they would be armed with fewer , but more powerful guns , than the numerous smoothbore guns of the older ships . Two variants were worked out that differed in the fineness of the hull and draft . 
 In November the committee decided to revise the designs to use three gun turrets , each armed with a pair of massive American @-@ designed 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Rodman guns , although the armament was changed to 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns two months later . On 4 June 1865 , Admiral Spiridov and Admiral Chichagov were ordered to the shallower @-@ draft version of the two designs . Construction of the ships was repeatedly delayed by design changes and delayed deliveries of components . Both of the most significant design changes were related to the armor protection . Shortly after they were ordered the Admiralty Board realized that the specified 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) armor would be outclassed by the latest rifled gun and decided that the existing armor would be reinforced by an additional 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) armor plate and additional wooden backing inside the existing armor . The additional weight was offset by increasing the height of the hull by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) which also deepened the ships ' draft . The second change occurred after new 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled guns were able to penetrate a replica of the armor scheme in June 1866 . The Admiralty Board decided to significantly thicken the armor of the two ships and removed one gun turret to compensate for the weight of the extra armor in November . Numerous other changes flowed from this decision as the engine and boilers had to be moved forward about 8 @-@ foot ( 2 m ) to maintain the ships ' trim and two transverse bulkheads also had to be moved . This major change added over 270 @,@ 000 rubles to the cost of the ships and added more delays as Russian ironworks had problems rolling the thicker armor plates . 
 The Admiral Spiridov @-@ class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors , the Charodeika class , and were 254 feet ( 77 @.@ 4 m ) long at the waterline . They had a beam of 43 feet ( 13 @.@ 1 m ) and a maximum draft of 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) . The ships were designed to displace 3 @,@ 196 long tons ( 3 @,@ 247 t ) , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced 3 @,@ 505 to 3 @,@ 587 long tons ( 3 @,@ 561 to 3 @,@ 645 t ) . They were fitted with a plough @-@ shaped ram . The Admiral <unk> had a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by six main watertight bulkheads . Their crew consisted of 280 officers and crewmen . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Admiral Spiridov class had a single two @-@ cylinder horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine . It had a bore of 68 inches ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) and a stroke of 36 inches ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) and drove a single three @-@ bladed 14 @-@ foot @-@ 9 @-@ inch ( 4 @.@ 50 m ) propeller . Steam was provided by four rectangular fire @-@ tube boilers at a pressure of 1 @.@ 76 atm ( 178 kPa ; 26 psi ) . The engine was designed to produce a total of 2 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) which gave the ships speeds between 9 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 5 knots ( 16 @.@ 9 – 17 @.@ 6 km / h ; 10 @.@ 5 – 10 @.@ 9 mph ) when they ran their initial sea trials in 1869 . The monitors also had a donkey boiler for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans and pumps . The Admiral Spiridov class carried 280 long tons ( 284 t ) of coal which gave them a range of about 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ; 1 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots . They were fitted with a light fore @-@ and @-@ aft sailing rig with three pole masts and a bowsprit . It had an area of 2 @,@ 850 square feet ( 265 m2 ) and its primary purpose was to steady the ships and assist in turning . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The monitors were ultimately designed to be armed with four Obukhov 9 @-@ inch rifled guns , a pair in each Coles @-@ type turret . An armored bulkhead separated the guns inside each turret . In 1874 – 75 the guns were replaced by a single 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) gun in each turret , based on a Krupp design . During the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 a 9 @-@ inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships , but accuracy was poor and they were later removed , probably in the early 1880s . An improved , more powerful , 11 @-@ inch gun was installed aboard Admiral Chichagov during the 1880s , although Admiral Spiridov retained her original guns until 1902 , if not for the rest of her career . 
 Light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to the Admiral Spiridov @-@ class ships during the Russo @-@ Turkish War when a pair of 4 @-@ pounder 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) guns were mounted on the roofs of each gun turret . Other guns known have been fitted included 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 64 mm ) Baranov quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) QF Hotchkiss guns , and 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) QF Hotchkiss five @-@ barreled revolving cannon . The ships could also carry 12 @-@ 15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The hull of the Admiral Spiridov @-@ class monitors was completely covered by three strakes of wrought iron armor , the upper two were about 3 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 12 m ) high and the lower one , below the waterline , was 3 feet 2 inches ( 0 @.@ 97 m ) high . The middle strake was 6 @.@ 5 inches ( 165 mm ) thick for a length of 150 feet ( 45 @.@ 7 m ) amidships and the other strakes were generally 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 mm ) thick ( the upper strake was 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick abreast the turrets ) . The armor thinned to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) aft and 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) forward of the main belt . This outermost layer of armor was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced with angle irons and then came the 1 @-@ inch inner armor plates , backed in its turn by another 9 inches of teak . 
 The turrets had 6 inches of armor , except around the gun ports , where it thickened to 6 @.@ 5 inches , reinforced by 12 inches of teak . The conning tower was 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick . The deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch that were separated by a layer of cloth or felt to better deflect the glancing hits expected . The upper layer was 0 @.@ 625 inches ( 16 mm ) thick and the lower was 0 @.@ 375 inches ( 10 mm ) . 
 = = Ships = = 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 After launching , the sisters were transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep @-@ draft ships from being completed . This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships . Both ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion . They were not fully equipped until around 1872 and their trials continued until 1873 . Admiral Spiridov accidentally rammed the monitor Admiral Lazarev in Kronstadt harbor in 1871 , and her sister collided with the monitor Veschun four years later ; neither ship was seriously damaged . Several days after the collision , Admiral Chichagov struck a sandbank at full speed . While not damaged in the incident , she was very firmly stuck and early attempts to pull her off failed , during which one seaman was killed and an officer badly wounded . The monitor had to be unloaded as much as possible and her forward guns were removed before she was freed from the sandbank , five days after running aground . 
 The ships received electric dynamos and searchlights were installed in the late 1870s . Admiral Chichagov served as the flagship for Captain 1st Rank Stepan Makarov during the 1885 naval maneuvers in the approaches to the Gulf of Riga and her boilers were replaced in two years later . Steam @-@ powered steering gear was installed in the sisters in 1887 and they were reclassified as coast @-@ defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 . By this time , their role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious landing . In 1900 they were transferred to the Kronstadt Engineering School as training ships before they were transferred to the Port of Kronstadt on 31 March 1907 for disposal . The sisters were stricken on 14 August and Admiral Spiridov became a stationary coal @-@ storage barge while Admiral Chichagov was grounded near Reval and used as a target . Their subsequent fates are unknown . 
 = Gliese 876 d = 
 Gliese 876 d is an exoplanet approximately 15 light @-@ years away in the constellation of Aquarius . The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876 . At the time of its discovery , the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257 + 12 . Due to this low mass , it can be categorized as a super @-@ Earth . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Gliese 876 d was discovered by analysing changes in its star 's radial velocity as a result of the planet 's gravity . The radial velocity measurements were made by observing the Doppler shift in the star 's spectral lines . At the time of discovery , Gliese 876 was known to host two extrasolar planets , designated Gliese 876 b and c , in a 2 : 1 orbital resonance . After the two planets were taken into account , the radial velocity still showed another period , at around two days . The planet , designated Gliese 876 d , was announced on June 13 , 2005 by a team led by Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7 @.@ 5 times that of Earth . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 Gliese 876 d is located in an orbit with a semimajor axis of only 0 @.@ 0208 AU ( 3 @.@ 11 million km ) . At this distance from the star , tidal interactions should in theory circularize the orbit ; however , measurements reveal that it has a high eccentricity of 0 @.@ 207 , comparable to that of Mercury in the Solar System . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 d is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained . This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination , which in general is unknown . However , models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined . This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59 ° with respect to the plane of the sky . Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets , the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6 @.@ 83 times the mass of Earth . 
 Models predict that , if its non @-@ Keplerian orbit could be averaged to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0 @.@ 28 , then tidal heating would play a significant role in the planet 's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten . Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104 – 5 W / m2 at the planet 's surface ; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W / m2 . This is similar to the energy it receives from its parent star of about 40 @,@ 000 W / m2 . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Since Gliese 876 d has only been detected indirectly by its gravitational effects on its star , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . On the assumption of a <unk> distribution of temperature and a maximum albedo of 0 @.@ 8 , the temperature was estimated at 430 – 650 K. 
 The low mass of the planet has led to suggestions that it may be a terrestrial planet . This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants . 
 Alternatively the planet could have formed further from Gliese 876 , as a gas giant , and migrated inwards with the other gas giants . This would result in a composition richer in volatile substances , such as water . As it arrived in range , the star would have blown off the planet 's hydrogen layer via coronal mass ejection . In this model , the planet would have a pressurised ocean of water ( in the form of a supercritical fluid ) separated from the silicate core by a layer of ice kept frozen by the high pressures in the planetary interior . Such a planet would have an atmosphere containing water vapor and free oxygen produced by the breakdown of water by ultraviolet radiation . 
 Distinguishing between these two models would require more information about the planet 's radius or composition . The planet does not appear to transit its star , which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities . 
 = Alan Keyes = 
 Alan Lee Keyes ( born August 7 , 1950 ) is an American conservative political activist , author , former diplomat , and perennial candidate for public office . A doctoral graduate of Harvard University , Keyes began his diplomatic career in the U.S. Foreign Service in 1979 at the United States consulate in Bombay , India , and later in the American embassy in Zimbabwe . 
 He ran for President of the United States in 1996 , 2000 , and 2008 ( founding and serving as the presidential nominee of the America 's Independent Party in 2008 ) , and was a Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1988 , 1992 , and 2004 . Keyes was appointed Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations by President Ronald Reagan , and served as Reagan 's Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs from 1985 to 1987 ; in his capacities as a UN ambassador , among Keyes 's accomplishments was contributing to the Mexico City Policy . 
 Keyes also hosted a radio talk show , The Alan Keyes Show : America 's Wake @-@ Up Call , and a television commentary show on the MSNBC cable network , Alan Keyes Is Making Sense . 
 = = Personal life and family = = 
 Born in a naval hospital on Long Island , New York , Keyes was the fifth child of mother <unk> ( Quick ) and father Allison L. Keyes , a U.S. Army sergeant and a teacher . Due to his father 's tours of duty , the Keyes family traveled frequently . Keyes lived in Georgia , Maryland , New Jersey , New York , Texas , Virginia and overseas in Italy . 
 After high school , Keyes attended Cornell University , where he was a member of the Cornell University Glee Club and The <unk> . He studied political philosophy with American philosopher and essayist Allan Bloom and has said that Bloom was the professor who influenced him most in his undergraduate studies . Keyes has stated that he received death threats for opposing Vietnam war protesters who seized a campus building . Keyes has stated that a passage of Bloom 's book , The Closing of the American Mind , refers to this incident , speaking of an African @-@ American student " whose life had been threatened by a black faculty member when the student refused to participate in a demonstration " at Cornell . Shortly thereafter , he left the school and spent a year in Paris under a Cornell study abroad program connected with Bloom . 
 Keyes continued his studies at Harvard University , where he resided in Winthrop House , and completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in government affairs in 1972 . During his first year of graduate school , Keyes 's roommate was William Kristol . In 1988 , Kristol ran Keyes 's unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in Maryland . 
 Keyes earned his Ph.D. in government affairs from Harvard University in 1979 , having written a dissertation on Alexander Hamilton and constitutional theory , under Harvey C. Mansfield . Due to student deferments and a high draft number , Keyes was not drafted to serve in the Vietnam War . Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war , in which his father served two tours of duty . Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam , but he says he was supporting his father and his brothers , who were also fighting in the war . 
 Keyes is married to Jocelyn Marcel Keyes , of East Indian descent , from Calcutta . The couple has three children , Francis , Maya , and Andrew . Keyes is a traditional Catholic and a third @-@ degree Knight of Columbus . He 's also a close friend of Brazilian conservative philosopher and journalist Olavo de Carvalho . 
 In 2005 , when Maya Keyes was 20 years old , she came out as a lesbian . There were reports her family threw her out of the house and stopped talking to her . In an interview with Metro Weekly , a Washington , D.C. , LGBT newspaper , Maya confirmed that her father " cut off all financial support . " In the same report Maya said , " It doesn 't make much sense for him to be [ financially ] supporting someone who is working against what he believes in . " Alan Keyes contradicted reports about his having disowned his daughter in October 2007 . Keyes said that he loves his daughter and that she knows she has a home with him . He asserted that he never cut her off and never would , because it would be " wrong in the eyes of God . " He also said he would not be coerced into " approving of that which destroys the soul " of his daughter . He contended that he must " stand for the truth [ Jesus Christ ] represents " even if it breaks his heart . 
 = = Diplomat = = 
 A year before completing his doctoral studies , Keyes joined the United States Department of State as a protégé of Jeane Kirkpatrick . In 1979 , he was assigned to the consulate in Mumbai , India . The following year , Keyes was sent to serve at the embassy in Zimbabwe . 
 In 1983 , President Ronald Reagan appointed Keyes as Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council . In 1985 , he was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations , a position he held until 1987 . His stay at the UN provoked some controversy , leading Newsday to say " he has propounded the more unpopular aspects of US policy with all the diplomatic subtlety of the cannon burst in Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture . " He also served on the staff of the National Security Council . 
 At a fundraiser for Keyes 's senate campaign , President Reagan spoke of Keyes 's time as an ambassador , saying that he " did such an extraordinary job ... defending our country against the forces of anti @-@ Americanism . " Reagan continued , " I 've never known a more stout @-@ hearted defender of a strong America than Alan Keyes . " In 1987 Keyes was appointed a resident scholar for the American Enterprise Institute . His principal research for AEI was diplomacy , international relations , and self @-@ government . 
 Following government service , Ambassador Keyes was President of Citizens Against Government Waste ( <unk> ) from 1989 to 1991 , and founded <unk> 's National Taxpayers ' Action Day . In 1991 , he served as Interim President of Alabama A & M University , in Huntsville , Alabama . 
 = = Role in the Reagan Administration = = 
 Among the U.S. delegation to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City , Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman . In that capacity , Keyes negotiated the language of the Mexico City Policy to withhold federal funds from international organizations that support abortion . Additionally , Keyes fought against an Arab @-@ backed UN resolution calling for investigation of Israeli settlements . The measure passed , 83 – 2 , with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. voting against it . Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the U.S. at the 1985 Women 's Conference in Nairobi . 
 During his time at the United States Department of State , Keyes defended the Reagan policy of not imposing economic sanctions on South Africa as punishment for apartheid . Stated Keyes , " I see the black people in South Africa as the most critical positive factor for eliminating apartheid and building the future of that country ... And that is not something you do with rhetoric , slogans and noninvolvement . It 's not something you will achieve through disinvestment . "

 Four years later , he ran again for the Senate from Maryland , coming in first in a field of 13 candidates in the Republican primary . Against Democrat Barbara Mikulski , he received 29 percent in the general election .

 = = = 1996 Presidential election = = = 
 Keyes sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 , and asked other candidates about abortion in those debates in which he participated . Many Republican leaders saw this as unnecessary and divisive . Keyes was particularly critical of Clinton during his campaign , saying , " This guy lies , but he lies with passion . " He questioned whether a Republican candidate who is truthful , yet cold and heartless , had a chance to win against the incumbent . Keyes was also especially critical of Pat Buchanan , once saying during an interview on the Talk from the Heart program with Al Kresta ( simulcast on <unk> St. Louis and <unk> @-@ FM Detroit ) that Buchanan had a " black heart . " Keyes 's entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party , since Buchanan had been a well @-@ known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and " cultural war " to the center of the public policy debate . Later during the primaries , Keyes was briefly detained by Atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited , and then uninvited . He was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20 minutes later by Atlanta 's mayor at the time , Bill Campbell .

 Keyes again campaigned for the Republican nomination in the 2000 primaries on a pro @-@ life , family values , tax reform plank . In Iowa , he finished 3rd , drawing 14 percent in a crowded field . He stayed in the race after the early rounds and debated the two remaining candidates , John McCain and George W. Bush , in a number of nationally televised debates . He finished second in 8 primaries . His best showing in the presidential primaries was in Utah , where he received 20 percent of the vote . He was also noted for jumping into a mosh pit during a Rage Against the Machine song during the Iowa caucus as part of a segment on Michael Moore 's TV series The Awful Truth . 
 = = = 2004 Senate election = = = 
 On August 8 , 2004 — with 86 days to go before the general election — the Illinois Republican Party drafted Alan Keyes to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate , after the Republican nominee , Jack Ryan , withdrew due to a sex scandal , and other potential draftees ( most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka ) declined to run . The Washington Post called Keyes a " carpetbagger " since he " had never lived in Illinois . " When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton , he called her campaign " pure and planned selfish ambition " , but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party . " You are doing what you believe to be required by your respect for God 's will , and I think that that 's what I 'm doing in Illinois " . 
 Keyes , who opposes abortion in all cases " except as an inadvertent result of efforts to save the mother 's life " , said in a September 7 , 2004 news conference that Jesus Christ would not vote for Obama because of votes that Obama — then a member of the Illinois Senate Judiciary committee and a lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School — cast in 2001 against a package of three anti @-@ abortion bills that Obama argued were too broad and unconstitutional . The legislation , which provided " that a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person , " passed the Republican @-@ controlled Illinois Senate , but failed to pass out of the Democratic @-@ controlled Illinois House Judiciary committee . After the election , Keyes declined to congratulate Obama , explaining that his refusal to congratulate Obama was " not anything personal " , but was meant to make a statement against " extend [ ing ] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line " of reasonable propriety . He said that Obama 's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line . " I 'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for ... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country ? I cannot do this . And I will not make a false gesture , " Keyes said . 
 Keyes was also criticized for his views on homosexuality . In an interview with Michelangelo <unk> , a gay radio host , Keyes defined homosexuality as centering in the pursuit of pleasure , literally " selfish hedonism " . When <unk> asked if Mary Cheney , Vice President Dick Cheney 's lesbian daughter , fit the description and was therefore a " selfish hedonist " , Keyes replied , " Of course she is . That goes by definition . " Media sources picked up on the exchange , reporting that Keyes had " trashed " , " attacked , " and " lashed out at " Mary Cheney , and had called her a " sinner " — provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders . Keyes noted that it was an interviewer , not he , who brought up Mary Cheney 's name in the above incident , and he told reporters , " You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize . The people asking me the question did so , and if that 's inappropriate , blame the media . Do not blame me . " 
 During the campaign , Keyes outlined an alternative to reparations for slavery . His specific suggestion was that , for a period of one or two generations , African @-@ Americans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax ( though not from the FICA tax that supports Social Security ) . Keyes said the experiment " would become a demonstration project for what I believe needs to be done for the whole country , which is to get rid of the income tax . " He also called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment in order to require that U.S. Senators be appointed by state legislatures , rather than being directly elected . 
 Keyes finished with 27 % of the vote despite winning a small number of southern Illinois counties . 
 = = = 2008 Presidential election = = = 
 On June 5 , 2007 , We Need Alan Keyes for President was formed as a political action committee to encourage Keyes to enter the 2008 presidential election . On September 14 , 2007 , Keyes officially announced his candidacy in an interview with radio show host Janet Parshall . On September 17 , 2007 , Keyes participated in the Values Voter Debate streamed live on Sky Angel , the Values Voter website , and radio . In a straw poll of the attending audience , Keyes placed third among the invited candidates , after Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul . Keyes was excluded from the Republican CNN / YouTube debate on November 28 , 2007 . Keyes 's campaign called the exclusion " arbitrary , unfair , and presumptuous , " arguing that CNN was playing the role of " gatekeeper " for the presidential election . 
 On December 12 , 2007 , Keyes participated in the Des Moines Register 's Republican presidential debate , televised nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks . This was the first major presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses . Although Keyes wasn 't listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate , he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate . During the debate , after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul , Keyes insisted he wasn 't getting fair treatment . He interrupted the debate moderator at one point , saying that she hadn 't called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it . He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate , criticizing Rudy Giuliani 's pro @-@ choice position , as well as Mitt Romney 's recent change in position on the same subject . In answering a question about global warming , he continued his criticisms of other candidates , saying , " I 'm in favor of reducing global warming , because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don 't deliver " . He also advocated ending the income tax , establishing state @-@ sanctioned prayer in public schools , and abolishing abortion . Toward the end of the debate , Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor 's position on abortion . 
 In the Iowa caucuses , Keyes did not appear on any of the election totals . Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice . His campaign CEO , Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes 's decision to enter the race late . Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes 's candidacy , making it difficult to run an effective campaign . 
 Keyes supports an amendment to the Constitution barring same @-@ sex marriage . He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq , but also said that the war was justified and defended President George W. Bush 's decision in one of his 2004 debates . Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq , but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations . However , Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations . 
 After the early states , Keyes exclusively campaigned in Texas , where he finished with 0 @.@ 60 percent of all votes cast . 
 Following Texas , the Keyes campaign moved to seeking the Constitution Party presidential nomination , but he continued to appear on several Republican ballots . On May 6 , Keyes scored his best showing of the campaign by winning 2 @.@ 7 % for fourth place in North Carolina , earning him two delegates to the Republican National Convention . 
 = = = = Departure from Republican Party = = = = 
 Keyes first stated that he was considering leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly <unk> radio show . He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1 @,@ 191 delegates to the Republican National Convention , even though he was no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination . On March 27 , 2008 , Keyes 's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party 's logo , along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo in the form of a dead elephant . This appeared to be an indication of Keyes 's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party 's presidential nomination . 
 On April 15 , Keyes confirmed his split from the Republican Party and his intention to explore the candidacy of the Constitution Party . He lost his bid for the party 's nomination , however , coming in second to 2004 CP vice presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin at the party 's national convention in Kansas City , Missouri , on April 26 , 2008 . During the convention , the party 's founder , Howard Phillips , gave a controversial speech in which he referred to Keyes as " the <unk> candidate " who " lingered in the Republican Party until a week ago . " Following the defeat , Keyes held an interview with Mike Ferguson in which he compared his defeat to an abortion . Later , Keyes told a group of his supporters that he was " prayerfully considering " making a continued bid for the presidency as an independent candidate , and asserted his refusal to endorse Baldwin 's candidacy . 
 Instead , Keyes ' supporters formed a new third party , America 's Independent Party , for his presidential candidacy . America 's Independent Party gained the affiliation of a faction of California 's American Independent Party . However , the AIP ticket , which had Brian <unk> , father of a victim of the Columbine High School massacre , of Colorado as its vice presidential candidate , was only on the ballot in California , Colorado , and Florida . 
 In the federal election held on November 4 , 2008 , Keyes received 47 @,@ 694 votes nationally to finish seventh . About 86 % ( 40 @,@ 673 ) of the votes he received were cast in California . 
 = = Obama citizenship lawsuit = = 
 On November 14 , 2008 , Keyes filed a lawsuit — naming as defendants California Secretary of State Deborah Bowen , President @-@ elect Barack Obama , Vice President @-@ elect Joe Biden , and California 's 55 Democratic electors — challenging Obama 's eligibility for the U.S. Presidency . The suit requested that Obama provide documentation that he is a natural born citizen of the United States . 
 Following the inauguration , Keyes alleged that President Obama had not been constitutionally inaugurated , refused to call him president , and called him a " usurper " and a " radical communist " . Keyes also claimed that President Obama 's birth certificate had been forged and he was not qualified to be president . 
 = = Media and advocacy = = 
 Keyes has worked as a media commentator and talk show personality . In 1994 , he began hosting a syndicated radio show called The Alan Keyes Show : America 's Wake @-@ Up Call from Arlington , Virginia . The show became simulcast on cable 's National Empowerment Television in 1997 . Keyes also launched various web @-@ based organizations — notably Renew America and the Declaration Foundation , both headquartered in Washington , D.C. 
 Keyes has served on the board of advisors for the Catholic League , a non @-@ profit , Catholic advocacy group headed by William A. Donohue . In 1997 , he was quoted as calling in that capacity the ABC television show Nothing Sacred " propaganda dressed up as entertainment , the way the Nazis used to make movies . The entertainment elite 's belief that there are no moral absolutes deeply contradicts the religious view of Christianity . " 
 In 2002 , he hosted a live television commentary show , Alan Keyes Is Making Sense , on the MSNBC cable news channel . The network canceled the show in July , citing poor ratings . The cancellation triggered a currently ongoing boycott led by Jewish education website <unk> whose reach numbers more than 72 @,@ 000 email subscribers . The show was unsympathetic to supporters of the al @-@ Aqsa <unk> — whom Keyes frequently debated on the program — and supported the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians . The show also featured critical discussion of homosexuality and of priests accused in the Catholic Church sex abuse scandals . The last episode was broadcast on June 27 , 2002 . As a result of Keyes 's strong advocacy of Israel on his MSNBC show , in July 2002 the state of Israel awarded him a special honor " in appreciation of his journalistic endeavors and his integrity in reporting " and flew him in to meet Prime Minister Ariel Sharon . 
 In August 2003 , Keyes came out in defense of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , citing both the U.S. Constitution and the Alabama constitution as sanctioning Moore 's ( and Alabama 's ) authority to publicly display the Ten Commandments in the state 's judicial building , in defiance of a court order from U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson . Although the monument was ultimately removed by state authorities , the issue impelled Keyes to spend the next year advocating his understanding of the Constitution 's protection of the right of states to display monuments that reflect the religious sentiments of the people in their states . As a result , he published an essay describing his rationale titled " On the establishment of religion : What the Constitution really says . " 
 In early 2005 , Keyes sought to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case , arguing that Schiavo 's life was protected by the Florida constitution , and that Governor Jeb Bush had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions . He attempted to meet with Bush to discuss the provisions of Florida law that authorized the governor to order Schiavo 's feeding tubes reinserted — something Bush claimed he wished to do , but for which he said he lacked authority — but the governor declined to meet with Keyes . Keyes subsequently wrote an essay directed openly at Governor Bush titled " Judicial review and executive responsibility " , days after Schiavo 's feeding tube had been removed . 
 In November 2006 , Keyes criticized Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for instituting gay marriage entirely on his own — according to Keyes — with no requirement or authority to do so under Massachusetts law . Keyes said Romney 's actions , which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and of the limitations of the judicial branch of government , were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same @-@ sex marriage . The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same @-@ sex marriage was not constitutional . The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law ; after it failed to do so , Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17 , 2004 , in compliance with the court ruling . 
 Commenting on the issue , Keyes asked rhetorically , " Since the legislature has not acted on the subject , you might be wondering how it is that homosexuals are being married in Massachusetts . It 's because Mitt Romney , who is telling people he 's an opponent of same @-@ sex marriage , forced the justices of the peace and others to perform same @-@ sex marriage , all on his own , with no authorization or requirement from the court . Tells you how twisted our politicians have become . " 
 Keyes , Olavo de Carvalho , author of a dozen books on philosophical and political matters , and Alejandro Peña Esclusa , president of <unk> , met on 3 March 2009 in Washington D.C. for an informal and friendly talk . In July 2010 , Olavo de Carvalho denounces plot against Alejandro Peña Esclusa , was arrested on terrorism @-@ related charges . According to the website of the Venezuelan Ministry of Communications & Information , Alejandro Peña Esclusa was the head of a plan to murder Pope John Paul II during a visit to Venezuela on 13 November 1984 . 
 On May 8 , 2009 , Keyes and 21 others were arrested while protesting President Barack Obama 's commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame . Keyes was charged with trespassing and released on $ 250 bond . He was arrested a second time on May 16 . 
 In December 2009 , Keyes authored a column for the World Net Daily critical of evolution and in support of Intelligent Design . 
 Keyes also made a widely discussed appearance in the 2006 film Borat . In 2010 , About.com , owned by The New York Times Company , named Keyes one of the top 20 conservatives to follow on Twitter . 
 Keyes has criticised the papal encyclical <unk> si ' , stating that its demands amount to " ... global penal colony under the totalitarian control of a government with unprecedented global powers " . In the same article Keyes likened Pope Francis to " Marx , Stalin or Mao Zedong . " 
 = 2016 Tour of Flanders = 
 The 2016 Tour of Flanders was a one @-@ day classic cycling race that took place in Belgium on Sunday 3 April 2016 . It was the 100th edition of the Tour of Flanders ; it was the eighth event of the UCI World Tour and the third of the cobbled one @-@ day classics . It was the second Monument race of the 2016 cycling season . 
 The race started in Bruges and finished in Oudenaarde . The total distance was 255 kilometres ( 158 mi ) , covering 18 categorized climbs and seven flat <unk> sectors . The principal favourites for the overall victory were Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) . 
 After several riders had abandoned the race due to crashes and injuries , the decisive break was formed with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) to go by Sagan , Michał Kwiatkowski ( Team Sky ) and Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) . On the last climb of the Oude Kwaremont , Kwiatkowski was dropped ; on the Paterberg , which followed shortly afterwards and was final climb of the race , Sagan dropped Vanmarcke and set off alone towards the finish . Vanmarcke and Cancellara collaborated in an effort to chase him down , but Sagan was able to ride to the finish alone . Cancellara finished second with Vanmarcke third , both more than 20 seconds behind Sagan .

 The route of the 100th edition was presented on 29 November 2015 at Brussels Airport . It contained small changes from previous editions : the Tiegemberg in West Flanders was omitted , while in the Flemish Ardennes the flat cobbled sector of the <unk> was cut from the race and replaced with the <unk> cobbled road . The change was needed to keep the iconic Molenberg climb in the route due to roadworks . The recent tradition of announcing a Dorp van de Ronde ( " Village of the Tour " ) was also abandoned , although the route passed through <unk> and <unk> in tribute to <unk> <unk> and Roger <unk> ( the oldest living winner of the Tour of Flanders ) respectively . 
 The race started in the Market Square in Bruges with a neutralised zone , leaving the town to the south . The racing started outside the city and took the riders southwest through <unk> to <unk> , then east through Ardooie and <unk> , then south @-@ east to Oudenaarde , passing across the first cobbled sector of the day , the flat <unk> . After Oudenaarde , the route continued into a series of circuits through the hilly area to the south and east . After 103 kilometres ( 64 mi ) came the first climb , the Oude Kwaremont , a 2 @,@ 200 @-@ metre ( 2 @,@ 400 yd ) , partially cobbled climb that would feature twice more later in the race . The route turned north and , following the climb of the non @-@ cobbled Kortekeer , the riders entered a 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) section with several cobbled roads . These included the cobbled climbs of the Eikenberg and the <unk> , then the flat <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the climb of the Molenberg , then finally the 2 @,@ 300 metres ( 2 @,@ 500 yd ) of the flat Paddestraat . The route then turned back to the south @-@ west , across the flat Haaghoek cobbles and then the non @-@ cobbled climbs of the Leberg , Berendries , Valkenberg , <unk> and <unk> . This brought the route back to take on the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont , followed immediately by the steep cobbled climb of the Paterberg , 360 metres ( 390 yd ) long with an average gradient of 12 @.@ 9 % and sections at over 20 % . At the summit of the Paterberg , there were 51 kilometres ( 32 mi ) left to the finish . 
 There were six more climbs in the next 40 @-@ kilometre ( 25 mi ) loop . The first of these was the Koppenberg , which includes the steepest roads of the race , with gradients of 22 % . This was followed by the flat cobbles of the <unk> and the climbs of the <unk> and the Taaienberg . The roads took the riders south into Ronse for the climb of the Kruisberg , then north @-@ west to the foot of the Oude Kwaremont . The Oude Kwaremont – Paterberg combination was used for a second time ; at the top of the Paterberg there were 11 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) to the finish . These took place over mainly flat roads , with a long finishing straight on the outskirts of Oudenaarde .

 The 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to participate in the race . An additional seven UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard entries : two Belgian teams ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert and Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , a Dutch team ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) , a German team ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , a French team ( Direct Énergie ) , an Italian team ( Wilier Triestina – Southeast ) and a Polish team ( CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice ) . With eight on each team , the peloton at the start of the race included 200 riders . Of these , 118 reached the finish line . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The principal favourites for the race were Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Fabian Cancellara ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , both of whom had won the race on three previous occasions . Cancellara was in strong form , having won the Strade Bianche and having come fourth in E3 Harelbeke and Gent – Wevelgem the previous week . Boonen , however , was not in strong form : he had not won a major classic since 2012 and had not performed strongly in the previous week 's races . Nevertheless , Cycling Weekly wrote " you can never write the three @-@ time Flanders winner off in a race like this . " The other former winners present at the start were Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , the defending champion , and Cancellara 's teammate Stijn Devolder . Kristoff 's strong sprint gave him an advantage if he was in a group that finished together ; he had , however , been ill in the previous week . Devolder , meanwhile , was expected to work for Cancellara . 
 The other major favourite for the race was Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) , the reigning world road race champion . Sagan had come second in E3 Harelbeke and first in Gent – Wevelgem . He had the advantage of being able to follow attacks and also to wait to use his strong sprint if he came to the finish with other riders . 
 Other riders with a chance of victory included Michał Kwiatkowski ( Team Sky ) , who had won E3 Harelbeke ahead of Sagan and who had a strong team with Geraint Thomas , Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe ; Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) ; Boonen 's teammates Niki Terpstra and Zdeněk Štybar ; Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) ; and Tiesj Benoot ( Lotto – Soudal ) .

 Before the race began , there was a minute 's silence in memory of Antoine Demoitié , a Wanty – Groupe Gobert rider who had been killed in a crash with a motorbike during Gent – Wevelgem . After 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) , the riders arrived in <unk> , the birthplace of Daan <unk> , a rider for Roubaix – Lille Métropole who had died following a heart attack in the Critérium International ; the peloton rode slowly through the town in memory of him . 
 The day 's breakaway took a long time to form : over an hour into the day 's racing , with more than 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) covered , a six @-@ man move broke free . The riders were Hugo Houle ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Federico <unk> ( Lampre – Merida ) , Imanol Erviti ( Movistar ) , Lukas <unk> ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , Gijs Van Hoecke ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) and Wesley Kreder ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) . They earned a lead of over four minutes , but broke apart as the day 's climbs began . 
 During the middle part of the race several riders were forced to withdraw after crashes . Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) , the winner of Milan – San Remo , crashed after 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) , while Marcus Burghardt ( BMC ) and Tiesj Benoot crashed on the <unk> shortly afterwards . Less than 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) later , several BMC riders crashed together and four were forced to withdraw . These included Greg Van Avermaet , who broke his collarbone . 
 On the Molenberg , with more than 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) remaining , a hard effort by Tony Martin ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) caused a split in the main peloton , with 25 riders in the front group , but the groups came back together shortly afterwards . André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Nils <unk> ( Katusha ) then attacked on the Leberg and were allowed to go ; they were followed by Dmitriy Gruzdev ( Astana ) and Dimitri <unk> ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . These four riders joined up with Houle , Erviti and Van Hoecke from the original break ; Houle was dropped soon afterwards to form a six @-@ man leading group , which had a two @-@ minute lead at the foot of the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont . On the climb , Stijn Vandenbergh ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Dylan van Baarle ( Cannondale – Drapac ) attacked from the peloton . Another group , including Sep Vanmarcke and Ian Stannard , attacked before the Koppenberg . Stannard then went solo over the top of the climb . Meanwhile , Vandenbergh and Van Baarle caught up with the group of leaders . 
 There were several more attacks before the climb of the Taaienberg , where a small group of favourites formed and quickly caught Stannard . Shortly afterwards , with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) remaining , Michał Kwiatkowski and Peter Sagan attacked together and were joined by Sep Vanmarcke . They crossed the Kruisberg together and caught the remainder of the breakaway with 23 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 6 mi ) remaining , 40 seconds ahead of the peloton . On the final climb of the Oude Kwaremont , Kwiatkowski was unable to follow Sagan and Vanmarcke , while Cancellara rode clear of the peloton . Sagan was first to the summit with Vanmarcke ; Cancellara was twelve seconds behind . Cancellara was then caught by Niki Terpstra , Erviti and <unk> . 
 On the final climb , the Paterberg , Sagan rode away from Vanmarcke , who was caught by Cancellara at the top of the climb . They rode in pursuit of Sagan , who had a 15 @-@ second lead at the summit . The chasing pair were unable to bring Sagan back and he rode to the finish to win his first Monument . Cancellara finished second , 25 seconds back , with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place . Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place , ahead of Luke Rowe ( Sky ) , 49 seconds behind Sagan .

 Sagan celebrated his victory by doing a wheelie after the finishing line . He said afterwards that it was the hardest Tour of Flanders he had ever raced , having been " full gas " throughout and suggested that Cancellara had made a mistake by not following the attack he had made with Kwiatkowski and Vanmarcke . Cancellara was emotional after finishing his final Tour of Flanders . He said that he had " missed this one second " , referring to the attack by Sagan . He said that he and Vanmarcke had done all they could in the chase , but that Sagan was too strong . Vanmarcke , meanwhile , said that he had struggled due to crashes in the middle part of the race and then had suffered cramp when Sagan attacked on the Paterberg . He described the move by Sagan and Kwiatkowski as the " decisive moment in the race " . 
 Boonen , who finished fifteenth , described Sagan as " really strong " and as the " deserved winner " ; he said " The way [ Sagan ] rode up the Paterberg was a good showcase on how to ride a bike " . Boonen , meanwhile , turned his attention to Paris – Roubaix the following week . Van Avermaet described himself as " really disappointed " following his crash , which ruled him out of Paris – Roubaix . Luke Rowe 's fifth place was Team Sky 's best ever performance in the Tour of Flanders ; he praised Kwiatkowski 's move , but said " there ’ s not much you can do when someone has better legs " ; he described Sagan , Cancellara and Vanmarcke as " the three strongest guys in the race " . Imanol Erviti , who had been in the breakaway for 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) , finished seventh . Cycling Weekly described this as " phenomenal " ; it was Movistar 's best ever result .

 Sagan remained at the top of the 2016 UCI World Tour standings following his victory ; his total of 329 points was more than 100 ahead of the next rider , his teammate Alberto Contador . Cancellara moved up from thirteenth to fourth and Vanmarcke from sixteenth to sixth . Sagan 's total put Slovakia in third place in the nations ' rankings , ahead of Great Britain and Spain , even though he was the only Slovakian to have scored World Tour points . 
 = Lynn ( MBTA station ) = 
 Lynn ( signed as Central Square - Lynn ) is a passenger rail station on the MBTA Commuter Rail Newburyport / Rockport Line in downtown Lynn , Massachusetts , located 11 @.@ 5 route miles from North Station . The station consists of a single center island platform serving the two station tracks on an elevated grade that runs through the downtown area of Lynn . A large parking garage is integrated into the station structure . The present station , built in 1992 , is the latest in a series of depots built on approximately the same Central Square site since 1838 . A number of other stations have also been located on several different rail lines in Lynn . 
 Lynn is also a major bus transfer point serving 12 MBTA Bus routes in the North Shore region , including routes leading to Salem , Marblehead , Wonderland , and the Liberty Tree Mall as well as downtown Boston .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 After the railroads from Boston to Lowell , Worcester , and Providence were chartered in 1830 and 1831 , railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed . The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14 , 1836 . Work began at East Boston in late 1836 ; it reached Lynn in the spring of 1837 , but <unk> was slowed by the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838 . Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27 , 1838 , with fares half that of competing stagecoaches . 
 The line through Lynn was built at surface level . A number of stations have served Lynn , including a series of stations near the current location at Central Square as well as a number of other stations around the city . The first depot at the Central Square location , built in 1838 , was a small wooden building . 
 On June 16 , 1846 , the stockholders authorized the sale of $ 450 @,@ 000 of new stock to fund various branch lines plus new depots at Salem and Lynn . The 1838 @-@ built station was replaced in 1848 by a brick building with a 2 @-@ track train shed , modeled after the 1847 @-@ built station at Salem but smaller and lacking towers . 
 In 1845 and 1846 , a line from Malden to Salem via Saugus and <unk> was proposed but did not pass the legislature due to bitter objections from the Eastern . Instead , the Saugus Branch Railroad opened from Malden to Lynn Common on February 1 , 1853 . Affiliated with the Eastern 's primary rival , the Boston and Maine Railroad ( B & M ) , it did not initially have a connection with the Eastern . In 1855 , the Eastern acquired the majority stock of the Saugus Branch Railroad to keep it away from the B & M. The connection to the B & M at Malden was severed , and it was connected to the Eastern at South Malden ( Everett ) and West Lynn . Lynn became the primary turnback point for the Saugus Branch after 1855 , though a limited number of trains continued to Salem until World War I. 
 The first horsecars ran to Lynn in 1854 under the Lynn and Boston Street Railway . Its line ran between its namesake cities ; running through Charlestown on Chelsea Street , Chelsea and Revere on Broadway , then along the Salem Turnpike to Lynn . On July 2 , 1888 , the Lynn & Boston became the first electrified trolley line in the Boston area . 
 = = = Great Lynn Depot War = = = 
 When the Eastern Railroad prepared to build a new depot in 1865 , a great deal of controversy erupted – an event later known as the " Great Lynn Depot War " . One faction wanted the replacement station built at the same Central Square location , while another wanted it built at Knight 's Crossing , a block southwest at Market Street . The Central Square faction was aided by a bill passed in the Massachusetts legislature on April 29 , 1865 , which disallowed a railroad from abandoning a station that had been in service more than five years , as well as an 1868 bill that specifically directed the Eastern Railroad to build the replacement station at Central Square . 
 After a case which reached the Supreme Court in 1871 and a subsequent appeal to the United States Court , a decision was ultimately made to construct stations at both locations . Both the Central Square and Market Street stations were in service by mid @-@ 1872 , but it was untenable for the railroad to serve two stations just several hundred feet apart . The Market Street station was demolished in 1873 and replaced with a wooden shelter that served only a handful of trains . 
 The depot controversy was a setback for the Eastern Railroad in a city where residents were already dissatisfied with poor service . In 1872 , the Boston , Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad was charted as a direct competitor to the Eastern ; service began from Market Street in 1875 and lasted until 1940 . Service to East Boston had been replaced with direct service to Boston via the Grand Junction Railroad in 1854 , but Lynn - East Boston service was run from 1872 to 1880 to compete with the <unk> & L. In 1880 the service was cut to a Revere - East Boston shuttle which lasted until 1905 . 
 From approximately the 1850s to the 1930s , Lynn was the terminus for some short turn Boston commuter trains . From 1881 to 1892 , some of these trains ran via the Chelsea Beach Branch during the summer . 
 = = = Track elevation = = = 
 The 1872 Central Square station burned in 1889 and was replaced with a temporary station until a new depot with a 75 @-@ foot clock tower was built in 1895 on the north side of the tracks off Union Street . This station had two side platforms to serve the line 's two tracks . As early as 1901 , the city began planning to eliminate the numerous grade crossings in downtown Lynn . With 150 trains per day on the main line and 40 on the Saugus Branch , some streets were blocked for as long as half of daylight hours . After legal issues , construction of an elevated viaduct began in September 1909 . However , the New Haven Railroad briefly gained control of the Boston and Maine at this time , and intended to fully four @-@ track the line through Lynn in conjunction with plans including a possible railroad tunnel under the harbor . The municipality initially intended to force the railroad to depress the four @-@ track line below grade , but later reached an agreement with the railroad to modify the two @-@ track viaduct for four tracks . 
 The New Haven 's plan to four @-@ track the line as far as the branch line splits in Salem and Beverly was stymied by the costs to modify the grade crossings in Chelsea and the single @-@ track tunnel at Salem . The only quadruple track to become operational was at Lynn station itself , with two island platforms to serve trains on all tracks . The depot was modified " not for the better " in conjunction with the elevation project . Many of the four @-@ track bridge spans in Lynn , never used operationally , are still extant . 
 = = = B & M and MBTA eras = = = 
 Streetcars service to Lynn continued under the Lynn & Boston until 1901 when it became part of the Boston & Northern Street Railway . By the early 20th century , a number of lines crisscrossed Lynn , with a number of them serving the station . The Bay State Street Railway took over operations in 1911 and joined the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1919 . Trolley service in Lynn lasted until 1938 . 
 The Boston and Maine Railroad built a new , more modern station in 1952 but reused the 1914 @-@ built platforms . This single @-@ story building , located on the south side of the tracks at Mt . Vernon and Exchange streets , was in the same flat @-@ roofed brick style as Winchester Center and <unk> built five years later . The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have radiant heat , and also included a restaurant and newsstand . The 1895 @-@ built station was demolished to make room for a parking lot . Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958 , leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn . Around this time , the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic , leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks . 
 By the late 1980s , the nearly @-@ 40 @-@ year @-@ old station and the older platforms were crumbling . Since the Newburyport / Rockport line was no longer a freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn , a full @-@ length high @-@ level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms . The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot , with the line 's two current tracks on each side . The 800 @-@ foot @-@ long platform is located west of the older low platforms , which are still extant on the viaduct . A 930 @-@ space parking garage with a drop @-@ off lane was built off Market Street ; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square . Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square . The new facility opened on January 21 , 1992 . 
 In 2003 , the MBTA spent slightly less than $ 100 @,@ 000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop @-@ off lane into a full busway with shelters , benches , and signage . The busway opened on September 9 , 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square . In late 2005 , the MBTA spent $ 168 @,@ 000 for repairs to the garage roof , which frequently leaked during rain . The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station , which proved less durable than expected . In September 2008 , the MBTA board authorized a $ 1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station . 
 An elevator is available to access the elevated platform from the ground level of the parking garage . This is one of a small number of elevators on the MBTA Commuter Rail system , and along with the pair at Framingham is one of the few on the system maintained by the MBTA rather than Amtrak , Massport , or local Regional Transportation Agencies . As of 2015 , the Lynn garage has the lowest utilization rate of MBTA garages , partially due to safety concerns and partially because it was built to support future Blue Line demand . In 2011 , 20 security cameras were added to the station as a reaction to several assaults in the garage . 
 = = = Future = = = 
 Lynn is intended to be the terminus of a future extension of the MBTA Blue Line , which would bring the line 4 @.@ 5 additional miles from Wonderland in Revere to Lynn . This extension has been proposed in various forms for over 80 years . The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945 – 47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line , which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924 , be extended to Lynn via the Boston , Revere Beach & Lynn right @-@ of @-@ way . Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland , a further extension to Lynn has been planned . Following on the 1926 and 1945 @-@ 47 studies , the 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn , while the 1969 Recommended Highway and Transit Plan proposed that the extension run as far as Salem . An extension was not present in the 1972 Final Report of the Boston Transportation Planning Review , but the 1974 Transportation Plan revived the project with possible termini of Lynn , Salem , or even Route 128 in Peabody . The 1978 Program for Mass Transportation report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn . Despite the continued recommendations , however , other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line . 
 Despite numerous studies on the project and previous bond bills , there is currently no identified funding source ; due to the MBTA 's constrained finances , construction is not likely to begin soon . The 1992 @-@ built Lynn parking garage , designed for the capacity needed for the Blue Line extension , does not fill fully from commuter rail ridership .

 Lynn has also been home to eight other stations on different sites - none of which lasted into the MBTA era - plus a ninth that opened in 1965 . Besides its downtown stops , the Eastern Railroad also served East Lynn from 1880 until Marblehead Branch service ended in June 1959 . Stairways from the Chatham Street to the station site still exist , although no station building remains . The 1896 depot was disassembled in 1912 in preparation for the downtown grade separation . It was moved to Durham , New Hampshire , where it now serves as the University of New Hampshire Dairy Bar and a station stop on Amtrak 's <unk> service . A West Lynn station was located at Commercial Street at the junction with the Saugus Branch Railroad , and Green Street was briefly located just east of Central Square . Neither the West Lynn nor Green Street buildings survive . 
 The Boston , Revere Beach & Lynn also served its own Lynn depot ( a block away from the Eastern Railroad station ) at Market Street near Broad Street , as well its own West Lynn station adjacent to the Eastern Railroad station just east of Commercial Street . Neither station is still extant . 
 Service on the Saugus Branch Railroad began from Boston to Lynn ( via Malden ) in 1853 , serving Central Square and West Lynn plus three new stations in northwest Lynn . These included Lynn Common station at Western Avenue , <unk> 's Station at Summer Street and <unk> Grove Avenue , and East Saugus at Lincoln Avenue on the Saugus / Lynn border . Passenger service on the branch ended in May 1958 ; the branch is now abandoned and being turned into a rail trail . None of the station buildings survive , though the surviving Cliftondale station in Saugus was identical to the East Saugus station . 
 River Works station is located in West Lynn on the Newburyport / Rockport Line . Opened on September 9 , 1965 as G.E. Works , it is for the sole use of GE Aviation employees . Swampscott , located just outside Lynn in Swampscott , Massachusetts , also serves passengers from East Lynn .

 Lynn serves as a major hub and transfer point for MBTA Bus routes serving the North Shore area . All routes pull into the station busway off Route 1A , though some can be caught at Central Square via the station 's Exchange Street / Central Square entrance as well .

 Martin Ødegaard ( Norwegian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 17 December 1998 ) is a Norwegian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Spanish club Real Madrid Castilla and the Norway national team . 
 He made his debut for Strømsgodset Toppfotball on 13 April 2014 , becoming the youngest player to feature in Tippeligaen , and became its youngest goalscorer on 16 May . After being a regular part of the team in his first season and training with several foreign clubs , Ødegaard was signed by Real Madrid in January 2015 . He is currently playing for their reserve team , Real Madrid Castilla , but trains mainly with the first team . On 23 May 2015 , he became the youngest player to represent Real Madrid . 
 Ødegaard made his international debut against the United Arab Emirates on 27 August 2014 , becoming the youngest debutant for the senior team at the age of 15 years and 253 days . On 13 October 2014 , he became the youngest player to feature in a qualifying match for the UEFA European Championship .

 = = = Youth = = = 
 Ødegaard spent his first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong . His father , Hans Erik Ødegaard , a former footballer , co @-@ founded a football section in the club , and became the coach of his son 's team . In 2005 , when Ødegaard was six , his parents and others each invested 50 @,@ 000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field , <unk> , with artificial turf . This has been cited as crucial for his development , as Ødegaard spent countless hours on the field . 
 Drammen Strong was twice selected by Ødegaard to receive a prize of 50 @,@ 000 kroner ( € 5 @,@ 800 ) , when the young player was given the Statoil talent award for April 2014 and for the 2014 season . Later , in 2015 , Drammen Strong received 250 @,@ 000 kroner , equivalent to approximately € 29 @,@ 000 , as a gift from Strømsgodset Toppfotball when Ødegaard was sold to Real Madrid . 
 In 2009 , Ødegaard joined the youth division of Strømsgodset . He trained and played with older boys . 
 The Norwegian FA also organizes young talents in local district teams . Ødegaard played his first matches for the Buskerud team in January 2010 , when he had just turned 11 . The other players on the team , and opponents , were 2 – 3 years older . The coach noted : " <unk> things brilliantly . Good choices . Good touch , smart in position game " . Ødegaard trained with this team weekly for the next three years . He mostly played left back , as the coaches felt this would give him a positive experience with many ball touches while still playing against physically much stronger players . In attack , he was given free rein due to his ability to " see solutions and spaces that we as coaches were not even close to thinking about . " 
 In 2011 , at age 12 , he impressed former football manager Lars <unk> during a nationwide tournament for under @-@ 16s : 
 The best 15 @-@ year @-@ olds in the country were gathered for a tournament between the top clubs ... It was definitely not the first time he had astonished his opponents or the spectators . He was three or four years younger than the others . It was impossible not to realize that we were witnessing something out of the ordinary . 
 = = = Strømsgodset = = = 
 Ødegaard began training with the Strømsgodset first team in 2012 , aged 13 . He made his first team debut the same year , in a mid @-@ season friendly against local rivals Mjøndalen IF . He also had short training visits to Bayern Munich and Manchester United . In 2013 , at age 14 , Ødegaard played for both Strømsgodset 's junior team ( normally aged 17 – 19 ) , and the club 's third team at the fifth tier of Norwegian senior football . 
 In January 2014 , it was agreed that 15 @-@ year @-@ old Ødegaard would be part of Strømsgodset 's first team for the year , but no professional contract was signed . The competition rules state that to play in Tippeligaen , players must have a professional contract to be eligible . However , the club included Ødegaard on the " B @-@ list " for amateur players , which made him eligible for up to three matches per season . Ødegaard was unable to train with Strømsgodset in the daytime since he was still in compulsory education . Thus , as part of the agreement , he trained two evenings a week with Mjøndalen IF , a semi @-@ professional First Division team at the time , where his father was one of the coaches . 
 He made his league debut for Strømsgodset in a match against <unk> FK at Marienlyst Stadion on 13 April 2014 . Aged 15 years and 118 days , he became the youngest footballer ever to play in Tippeligaen . On 5 May , he signed a professional contract with Strømsgodset , lasting until the end of 2015 . This removed the restriction of three matches per season . Eleven days later , he scored his first professional goal and became the youngest goalscorer in Tippeligaen when he scored the fourth goal for Strømsgodset in a 4 – 1 home victory against Sarpsborg 08 FF . He made his European debut on 16 July , replacing Lars Christopher <unk> for the final five minutes of the club 's 1 – 0 home defeat to Steaua Bucureşti in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round . 
 In late July , an away match at Sandnes Ulf prompted serious discussion in national newspapers VG , Dagbladet and Aftenposten , on his possible call @-@ up to the Norwegian national team . Ødegaard was involved in all three goals for his team , including a goal and an assist . He was also fouled for a penalty which was missed by a teammate . John Arne Riise , the most @-@ capped player on the Norwegian national team , was impressed , and " demanded " Ødegaard should be called up to play against the big nations of Europe . Former manager for Norway , Nils Johan <unk> , said after the match that " Martin is one of the best 15 @-@ year @-@ olds in Europe , " but added that he should not be rushed into the national team . Ødegaard himself stated to the press that if he would be asked to play for Norway , he would say yes . 
 In the away match against IK Start on 15 August the same year , Ødegaard was placed on the right wing , and made all three assists for Strømsgodset , who won 3 – 2 . He scored two goals in a match for the first time in his career in the 2 – 1 win against Lillestrøm SK on 19 October . Strømsgodset finished fourth in the league , qualifying for the first qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League , with Ødegaard having scored 5 goals in 23 league games in addition to 7 assists . 
 In December 2014 , during the Norwegian close season , he trained with the first teams at Liverpool , Bayern Munich , Manchester United and Manchester City . He also visited Arsenal . In January 2015 , he trained with Real Madrid . 
 = = = Real Madrid = = = 
 On 21 January 2015 , Real Madrid reached an agreement to sign Ødegaard from Strømsgodset , for a fee reported by Spanish media as around € 3 million . Norwegian media reported , however , that the fee was 35 million kroner ( approximately € 4 million ) , which could rise to 70 – 75 million kroner ( approximately € 8 – 8 @.@ 5 million ) on certain conditions . In a press conference after the signing , Real Madrid announced that Ødegaard would train with both the club 's first team and the reserves , Real Madrid Castilla . He would play for the latter team , which was managed by Zinedine Zidane at the time . 
 He made his unofficial debut for the reserves on 4 February , in a 3 – 3 friendly draw with Beijing <unk> . He was subsequently named in the first team 's UEFA Champions League squad . Ødegaard was assigned the number 21 . His official debut for Castilla came on 8 February , coming on in the last 20 minutes as a substitute in the 2 – 2 draw against Athletic Bilbao B in Segunda División B. On 21 February , he scored his first goal for the club in a 4 – 0 win over <unk> CF at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano , opening the scoring after seven minutes . 
 In April , Ødegaard was dropped from Castilla after a run of four defeats , with staff finding problems with him training with the first team while playing for the reserves , in addition to a language barrier . First team manager Carlo Ancelotti called for fans to be patient while Ødegaard settles in a new country . On 29 April , he was included in Real Madrid 's matchday squad for the first time for a home La Liga fixture against UD Almería , as Ancelotti was without Gareth Bale , Luka Modrić and Karim Benzema through injury . However , he did not feature in the 3 – 0 victory . 
 On 23 May , in the final fixture of the season , he made his debut for Real Madrid , coming @-@ on as a 58th @-@ minute substitute for hat @-@ trick scorer and then @-@ reigning FIFA Ballon d 'Or Cristiano Ronaldo in an eventual 7 – 3 home win over Getafe CF . He became the youngest debutant in the history of the club at 16 years and 157 days old . 
 Ødegaard was a regular starter for Castilla during the 2015 – 16 season . On 17 April 2016 , he was praised in Diario AS for his performance in a 3 – 0 home win over SD <unk> Club , winning a penalty kick which Mariano scored . The result put the team top of the table . The team won the group ahead of <unk> CF on the last day , with Ødegaard scoring his first of the season in a 6 – 1 thrashing of La Roda CF .

 Martin Ødegaard featured in the starting line @-@ ups for the two home matches of the Norway national under @-@ 15 football team versus Sweden on 17 and 19 September 2013 . Both matches were won by Norway , 2 – 1 and 2 – 0 . 
 Ødegaard played for the Norway national under @-@ 16 football team in a tournament with Scotland , the United States and France in Turkey in January 2014 . He played the full 90 minutes in all three matches , which resulted in a win versus Scotland and two losses . 
 He was promoted to the Norway national under @-@ 17 football team for the away match against Iceland on 28 February 2014 . Ødegaard came on as a substitute in the 62nd minute , and helped secure a 2 – 1 win for his country . Subsequently , he was in the starting line @-@ up for the next three away matches ; in the 3 – 0 win against Iceland on 2 March , in the 2 – 3 loss against Turkey on 25 March and finally in the 0 – 3 loss against Greece on 30 March 2014 . 
 In September 2014 , he was selected for the Norway national under @-@ 21 football team for the final match of the 2015 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Championship qualification . He played the full match against Portugal , as a forward , but was unable to prevent the opponents from winning 2 – 1 , despite being named Man of the Match . 
 An unused substitute for the senior team on 6 September 2015 against Croatia , he joined the under @-@ 21 team again the following day in the 2017 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Championship qualifying match against England . He played the full 90 minutes in the match , which Norway lost 0 – 1 at home after a penalty goal by James Ward @-@ Prowse .

 On 19 August 2014 , Ødegaard was called up for a senior international against the United Arab Emirates in Stavanger and played the entire goalless draw on 27 August , becoming the youngest player to play for Norway at senior level , at 15 years and 253 days . The record was previously held by Tormod <unk> , who was 15 years and 351 days on his debut in 1910 . 
 On 30 September 2014 , he was called up to Norway 's UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria . He made his competitive debut in the latter , replacing Mats Møller <unk> in the 64th minute of a 2 – 1 home win . At the age of 15 years and 300 days , this made him the youngest player to ever play in a European Championship qualifier , breaking a record held since 1983 by Icelander Sigurður Jónsson . 
 On 29 March 2015 , Ødegaard became the youngest player to start a European Championship qualifier at the age of 16 years and 101 days in a 5 – 1 loss to Croatia . On 8 June , he was man of the match in Norway 's 0 – 0 friendly draw with Scandinavian rivals Sweden in Oslo . After Norway came third in their qualification group , Ødegaard was named in their squad for a play @-@ off against Hungary . Unused in the first leg , he was substituted at half time in the second on 15 November , as Norway lost 2 – 1 on the night and 3 – 1 on aggregate .

 An article in the Liverpool Echo described Ødegaard as " an attack @-@ minded midfielder very much in the modern mould . Diminutive , quick @-@ footed , with natural balance , pace and , perhaps surprisingly for one so young , excellent shooting power " . David Nielsen , his manager at Strømsgodset , likened him to David Silva and Lionel Messi . Amidst transfer speculation in December 2014 , he opined that the player would develop better with a second season in Norway . 
 In September 2014 , international teammate and Rosenborg winger Morten Gamst Pedersen dubbed Ødegaard the most talented player he had ever seen , saying " For his age he is unbelievable – his knowledge of the game is unbelievable and his technical skills are fantastic " . Pedersen also stated that Ødegaard needed time to improve at the physical aspects of the sport . 
 When describing his son , Hans Erik Ødegaard said , " It 's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels . We 've used so many hours in working with his first and second touch to take off the pressure . We have worked a lot on bringing the ball closely to his feet , so he can change direction quickly , so even if he 's physically weaker than the others he doesn 't get caught because he 's able to get away . " 
 After Ødegaard signed for Real Madrid , Norwegian former football scout Tor @-@ Kristian Karlsen praised his mentality , stating that he had " overcome every challenge in front of him " . Karlsen called him " so level @-@ headed and mature " and noted his intelligence and performance at school , while also saying that this could be a disadvantage as " The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle , a bit of fire " . While former Norway international Jan Åge <unk> was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane , he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop : " Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media . Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same , but any comparisons should not be taken seriously " . Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying " If you get carried away now , you won ’ t get far in 10 years . I 'm supposed to be at my best then , not now . That I know " .

 Ødegaard is the son of former footballer Hans Erik Ødegaard , who played as a midfielder for Strømsgodset and Sandefjord Fotball and was assistant manager of Mjøndalen IF from 2009 to 2015 . He was still attending a local lower secondary school when he made his professional debut , but has since completed his compulsory education in Norway . He is a supporter of English team Liverpool , whom he has described as his " dream club " . Ødegaard looked up to Barcelona 's Lionel Messi , although on joining their rivals Real Madrid he was reported to have deleted tweets in which he had praised Messi . Due to his age , Ødegaard was absent from the computer game Football Manager 2015 until his father gave permission to use his son 's likeness . 
 Ødegaard has grown up in a Christian family and has expressed that religious faith is an important part of his life . He was named in Time 's 30 most influential teenagers of 2015 .

 = The Boat Race 1947 = 
 The 93rd Boat Race took place on 29 March 1947 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames in London . In a race umpired by former Oxford rower D. T. Raikes , Cambridge won by ten lengths in a time of 23 minutes 1 second , taking the overall record in the event to 49 – 43 in their favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1946 race by three lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 48 victories to Oxford 's 43 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were R. E. Eason ( who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1924 race ) , P. C. Mallam ( four @-@ time Blue between 1921 and 1924 ) and Guy Oliver Nickalls ( who rowed three times for Oxford between 1921 and 1923 ) . Cambridge were coached by John Houghton Gibbon ( who rowed for the Light Blues in the 1899 and 1900 races ) , Hugh Mason ( who represented Cambridge in the 1936 and 1937 races ) and Peter Haig @-@ Thomas ( four @-@ time Blue between 1902 and 1905 ) . The umpire for the race was former Oxford rower D. T. Raikes who had represented the Dark Blues in the 1920 , 1921 and 1922 races . Among the spectators were Geoffrey Fisher , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and American actress Paulette Goddard . It was the first year that souvenir programmes were sold , the proceeds of which would help to fund the two boat clubs . 
 The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that Oxford could win , claiming they had an " <unk> de <unk> " while Cambridge " started this year with a grievous shortage of material " . In a practice row , the rowing correspondent for The Manchester Guardian stated that " Cambridge showed much better form " while Oxford " did rather more hard work " , including practicing their start from a stakeboat . Oxford were reported as being favourites in the Dundee Courier , with the prediction that the win could be determined by who won the toss . That view was echoed in the Dundee Evening Telegraph , who also suggested that Oxford were favourites yet " abnormal flooding " would favour the crew who won the toss . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 5 lb ( 78 @.@ 3 kg ) , 5 @.@ 5 pounds ( 2 @.@ 49 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxford saw four rowers with Boat Race experience return to the crew , including J. R. W. Gleave , R. M. A. Bourne , P. N. Brodie and stroke A. J. R. <unk> . Cambridge 's boat contained just one crew member who had taken part in the event before , in cox G. H. C. Fisher . The Cambridge University Boat Club president , M. A. Nicholson was declared unfit to row following a series of bouts of asthma . All participants in the race were registered as British . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . The race was started by umpire Raikes at 6 : 15 p.m , in " rain and dismal weather " . Out @-@ rating Oxford by two strokes per minute , the Light Blues took an immediate lead and by Craven Steps they were pulling away from their opponents . As both crews passed the Mile Post , Cambridge were almost clear by two lengths , and despite a spurt from the Dark Blues at the Harrods Furniture Depository , the Light Blues maintained their lead . Oxford trailed Cambridge by three and a half lengths as the Light Blues passed below Hammersmith Bridge and moved into Oxford 's water , effectively ending the race as a contest . 
 Cambridge continued to build their lead , ahead by six lengths at Chiswick Steps and eight by Barnes Bridge . They passed the finishing post ten lengths ahead in a time of 23 minutes 1 second , their first win since the 1939 race . It was the slowest winning time since the 1877 race and the winning margin was the largest since the 1928 race . The victory took the overall record in the event to 49 – 43 in Cambridge 's favour . The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested the " Boat Race was as disappointing as the weather in which it was rowed " . 
 = Walter de Coutances = 
 Walter de Coutances or Walter of Coutances ( died 16 November 1207 ) , also called Walter of Rouen , was a medieval Anglo @-@ Norman bishop of Lincoln and archbishop of Rouen . He began his royal service in the government of Henry II , serving as a vice @-@ chancellor . He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices , becoming successively canon of Rouen Cathedral , treasurer of Rouen , and archdeacon of Oxford . King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183 . He did not remain there long , for he was translated to Rouen in late 1184 . 
 When Richard I , King Henry 's son , became king in 1189 , Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy . He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the Third Crusade , but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between William Longchamp , the justiciar whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom , and Prince John , Richard 's younger brother . Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John , but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar 's expulsion from England , replaced in his role by Coutances , even though he never formally used the title . He remained in the office until late 1193 , when he was summoned to Germany by the king , who was being held in captivity there . Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard 's ransom on the king 's release in February 1194 . 
 Coutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany . Instead he became involved in Norman affairs , including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andely manor , an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress . Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe . Richard went on to build the castle of Gaillard on the former archiepiscopal manor . After Richard 's death , Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy , but was forced to pay 2 @,@ 100 Angevin pounds to secure contested rights from the new king . After John lost control of Normandy in 1204 , the archbishop did not resist the new government of King Philip II of France . Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Coutances was born in Cornwall , to <unk> and <unk> . His brother was Roger <unk> , a layman and royal justice during the reign of King Henry II of England . Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy and ended up in Cornwall , that was a flattering invention on Gerald 's part . Coutances ' family was of the knightly class , and probably from Normandy originally . 
 Coutances was usually given the title of magister , which signified that he had received an education in a school ; most likely he attended the schools of Paris . Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning , and considered him to be a talented courtier . 
 = = Service to King Henry = = 
 Coutances started his career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber . He probably owed the position to his brother , who was already in royal service . Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king , but this is not certain . 
 By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral . During the 1170s a group of royal clerks rose to prominence , among them Coutances , Walter Map , Ralph Diceto , John of Oxford , Richard of Ilchester , and Geoffrey Ridel . Coutances was the chaplain to Henry the Young King , eldest living son of King Henry , but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173 , Coutances returned to King Henry 's service . He became Archdeacon of Oxford , perhaps by 1173 , certainly by 14 March 1176 . He was named vice @-@ chancellor when Ralph de <unk> became Chancellor of England , which occurred in 1173 . In 1176 and 1177 , King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court . Arnulf , the Bishop of Lisieux , alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese , so that Coutances might become bishop there . This happened in early 1178 , but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances ' part comes from Arnulf 's correspondence , and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178 , it does not appear that the attempt was a sustained one . 
 On his return to England , Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of Wilton and Ramsey , which were being held by King Henry pending the election of new abbots . He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys ' revenues in the name of the king , who had the <unk> rights to that income . In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission . In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II 's will , made before the king travelled to Normandy . 
 = = Bishop of Lincoln and Archbishop of Rouen = = 
 Coutances was elected to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183 , selected by King Henry over three other candidates . He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover , the Archbishop of Canterbury . He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183 . While at Lincoln , Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury , which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184 . Writing about Coutances ' time at Lincoln , Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources . Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln , acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell . 
 On 17 November 1184 Coutances was translated to the diocese of Rouen , becoming Archbishop of Rouen . The original election to Rouen had taken place in the summer . King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter 's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates . The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected , a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November . Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen , as the see there was poorer than Lincoln , but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status . The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances ' ambition overcame his greed , and he agreed to the translation . He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185 . Coutances remained in Henry 's service however , and continued attend the royal court frequently . During the final 10 years of Henry 's reign , only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters , and only William de Humez , the constable , equalled the 16 charters that Coutances witnessed . 
 In the later part of 1186 , after the death of King Henry 's son Geoffrey – who was Duke of Brittany – King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey 's daughters be placed in the French king 's custody , and that the duchy of Brittany , which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife , be surrendered into French royal custody . Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement , but they had to settle for a temporary truce . In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France . 
 At Whitsun in 1189 , Coutances was a member of a commission appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son , Richard , who was supported by King Philip II of France . Henry and Richard 's conflict stemmed from Richard 's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England , which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother , John . The commission met near Le Mans . Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip 's sister Alice , that Henry name Richard as Henry 's heir , and that Richard 's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard . Henry rejected those terms , and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate , even under the legate 's threat of an interdict on France . 
 = = Service to King Richard = = 
 Shortly after Richard took the throne he sought absolution for his sins in rebelling against his father , from Baldwin of Forde and Coutances . The two archbishops absolved Richard in a ceremony in Sees . Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy in a ceremony held in Rouen , before accompanying Richard to England , where he participated in the new king 's coronation , on 3 September 1189 . 
 In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated , among other things , that the clergy should not hold secular offices , even though Coutances himself had held and continued to hold such offices . On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Forde and the monks of his cathedral chapter over Baldwin 's plan to create a church dedicated to Thomas Becket , the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury , and to staff this church not with monks , but with canons . The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin 's plan , fearing that it was part of a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church 's canons . Sitting on the commission with Coutances were Hugh de Puiset , the Bishop of Durham , Godfrey de Lucy , the Bishop of Winchester , Hubert Walter , the Bishop of Salisbury , Peter de Leia , the Bishop of St David 's , Richard <unk> , the Bishop @-@ elect of London , William Longchamp , the Bishop @-@ elect of Ely , and some abbots . The commission travelled to Canterbury , and on 29 November 1189 , managed to secure a compromise between the parties , which lasted until Hubert Walter , by then Archbishop of Canterbury , revived the plan . In the compromise , Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop 's authority . 
 When Richard left England in late 1189 , the archbishop accompanied him to Normandy and then to Sicily , where Richard began the Third Crusade . In October 1190 , Coutances was one of the negotiators between the city of Messina and the crusaders , and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between King Richard and Tancred , the King of Sicily . The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army . 
 While Richard was still in Sicily , word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp , whom Richard had left in England , and John , Richard 's younger brother . On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England . The archbishop landed in England on 27 June , after a short detour to Rome . Coutances received a release from his crusading vow , and returned to England in the company of Richard 's mother , Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine . He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes , and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control , although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp 's grip on the government somewhat insecure . In September , however , Longchamp imprisoned Richard 's bastard half @-@ brother , Geoffrey , Archbishop of York , who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king . The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20 years earlier , and Geoffrey was quickly released . Longchamp was brought to a council , headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England , which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames . Longchamp was deposed and exiled , largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances ' if the archbishop 's advice was resisted by Longchamp , which it had been . Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity , and of trying to play both sides against the other , the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king 's interest . Longchamp fled to Normandy , and he was excommunicated by Coutances . 
 = = Acting Justiciar = = 
 After Longchamp 's exile Coutances was named head of a council of regency , which is sometimes equated to the post of Chief Justiciar , although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document . Most modern historians , however , name him as justiciar . He held that power until about 25 December 1193 , when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar . 
 Coutances had long experience in the chancery , but little experience with judicial matters . Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard 's ransom . As evidence of this emphasis on raising money , Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power . Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192 , but in 1193 none were sent out , and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions . Of those justices appointed , like his predecessor in the justiciarship , Coutances used justices from a wide range of backgrounds , and many of those sent out on <unk> rounds were local to the area , rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances ' successor Hubert Walter . The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer , or treasury of England , and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer . 
 A new note in Coutances ' administration was his custom of issuing writs not in his own name , as had previously been the practice , but in the king 's name . The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent of many of the leading nobles of the realm , as well as the barons of the Exchequer . This was a reaction against Longchamp 's authoritarian method of government . 
 The archbishop supervised the election of a new Archbishop of Canterbury , as Baldwin of Forde had died while on Crusade in 1190 . Although both Longchamp and Coutances were considered as possible candidates and rivals for the see , the cathedral chapter of Canterbury elected the Bishop of Bath , Reginald fitzJocelin , in November 1191 . Reginald died a month later and the see remained vacant until March 1193 , when the king 's candidate , Hubert Walter , was elected . 
 During 1191 the citizens of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self @-@ governing , something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years . This however , was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties , which did not occur until 1199 . In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford , to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard 's captivity in Germany . The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard . Prince John , however , hearing that Richard was in captivity , immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard 's lands , and then returned to England and raised a rebellion . Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle , which was held by Prince John 's men . When John heard that Richard was going to be freed , he left England and went to France . 
 In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany , at the court of the German emperor , along with Longchamp , who brought letters to Richard , still in captivity . On 4 February , Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the outstanding portion of Richard 's ransom , and the king was released . The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom , and the archbishop had to pay 10 @,@ 000 marks for his own release . From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government , and spent the rest of his career on Norman affairs . His record of charter witnessing bears this out ; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king 's English charters , but not after 1194 . 
 = = Return to Normandy = = 
 Coutances returned to Normandy , and in December 1195 attempted to secure compensation for the losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip . He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction , and felt so ill @-@ treated by the kings that he abandoned his see . The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves , with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety , or guarantor that the conditions of the treaty would be fulfilled . Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen , then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop 's punishment was valid . 
 When Coutances returned to his diocese in July 1196 , he found that the king had seized the manor of Andely independently of the treaty provisions , and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king , Richard began to fortify the manor . He also built a castle there , now Château Gaillard . On 7 November 1196 , Coutances set off for Rome , to protest the seizure to the pope . Richard sent a royal embassy , and eventually a settlement was reached . The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy , and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of Dieppe . The various lands that Coutances ' received in exchange for Andely were worth £ 1 @,@ 405 a year . This episode marked the end of Coutances ' service to the Angevin kings ; for the rest of his life the archbishop focused on protecting and guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights . 
 = = Service to King John = = 
 When Richard died on 6 April 1199 , the archbishop invested Richard 's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199 . At the ceremony , John pledged to protect the Norman church , and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese . John contested the right of the archbishop to some jurisdictional rights however , as well as forest rights , forcing Coutances to pay 2 @,@ 100 Angevin pounds to secure most of the contested rights . In May 1200 , Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France , but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy . 
 In September 1201 one of Coutances ' suffragan bishops , <unk> , the Bishop of Sées died . King John objected when the cathedral chapter attempted to elect one of their own members as his successor . Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election , and the chapter divided into two parties , one favouring the elected chapter member , the other party another choice . Both parties appealed to the papacy , who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of Sées , Silvester . Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however , and he refused to do so , arguing that the king 's choice had been disregarded . Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester , but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see . This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict , but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees . 
 In May 1202 Pope Innocent III wrote to Coutances , urging him to impose religious punishments on any rebels against King John 's rule in the duchy of Normandy . When John lost the duchy in 1204 , Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II , although he did not make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207 . In 1206 – 1207 , Coutances , along with his suffragan bishops , petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage , which Philip granted . 
 = = As archbishop = = 
 Although Coutances was absent from Rouen for most of the period between 1190 and 1194 , he remained an active archbishop . He secured the continued immunity of clergy from secular jurisdiction , and supervised the administration of the archdiocese . He began the custom of keeping records in registers of episcopal judgements from about 1200 , and he appointed the first officials of Rouen . He also oversaw the rebuilding of Rouen Cathedral , which had begun in 1155 , and restarted the work after a fire in 1200 . His relations with his cathedral chapter were evidently excellent , as they remembered him as " a magnificent benefactor of the church of Rouen " . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and was buried at Rouen Cathedral , in the chapel of Saints Peter and Paul . The inventory of his personal possessions made after his death included a large number of jewels and vestments . He also owned a large library , which contained not only religious works but also legal texts on canon law and works of classical authors such as Juvenal and Ovid . 
 Coutances ' nephew , John of Coutances , became Archdeacon of Oxford and Dean of Rouen under Walter 's influence , and later Bishop of Worcester . Other nephews were William , successively a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen , and Richard , also an archdeacon at Rouen . 
 The historian John Gillingham called Coutances " one of the great <unk> " of his time . Two other historians have argued that it was probably Coutances ' judgement and stability that persuaded the king to trust him . The medieval poet John of <unk> dedicated a satirical poem in 1184 to Coutances called <unk> . It was on the tribulations of a poor scholar . 
 = Tawang Monastery = 
 Tawang Monastery , in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh , is the largest monastery in India and second largest in the world after the Potala Palace in Lhasa , Tibet . It is situated in the valley of the Tawang River , near the small town of the same name in the northwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh , in close proximity to the Tibetan and Bhutanese border . 
 Tawang Monastery is known in Tibetan as <unk> <unk> Lhatse , which translates to " celestial paradise in a clear night . " It was founded by Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso in 1680 @-@ 1681 in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama , Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso . It belongs to the Gelug school of Mahayana Buddhism and had a religious association with Drepung Monastery of Lhasa , which continued during the period of British rule . 
 The monastery is three stories high . It is enclosed by a 925 feet ( 282 m ) long compound wall . Within the complex there are 65 residential buildings . The library of the monastery has valuable old scriptures , mainly Kangyur and Tengyur . Of all the festivals celebrated in the monastery , Torgya is the most elaborate and colorful . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The full name of the monastery is Tawang Galdan Namgye Lhatse . ' Ta ' means " horse " , ' wang ' means " chosen " , which together forms the word ' Tawang ' , meaning " the location selected by horse " . Further , ' Galdan ' means " paradise " , ' Namgye ' means " celestial " and ' Lhatse ' means " divine " . Thus , the full meaning of the ' Tawang Galdan Namgye Lhatse ' is the " site chosen by the horse is the celestial divine paradise " . 
 = = Location = = 
 The monastery is situated near the top of a mountain , at an elevation of about 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , with a commanding view of the Tawang River valley , which comprises snow @-@ capped mountains and coniferous forest . It is bounded on its southern and western flanks by steep ravines formed by streams , a narrow spur on the north and a gently sloping ground on the east . The monastery is entered from the northern direction along a sloping spur , which has alpine vegetation . Nearby Tawang Town , named after the monastery , is well connected by road , rail and air services . <unk> , which is the nearest rail head , is 280 kilometres ( 170 mi ) away by road . Tezpur Airport is the nearest airport at a road distance of 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) . 
 = = Legends = = 
 Three legends are narrated to the establishment of the monastery . In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to <unk> Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery . After an intense search , when he failed to locate a suitable place , he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site . When he came out of the cave , he found his horse missing . He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana <unk> , which in the past was the palace of King Kala <unk> . He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location . Seeking the help of the local people , Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681 . 
 The second legend of the derivation of the name Tawang is linked to <unk> <unk> , diviner of treasures . At this location , he is stated to have given " initiations " of Tamdin and <unk> , which resulted in the name " Tawang " . ‘ Ta ’ is an abbreviated form for " Tamdin " and ‘ Wang ’ means " initiation " . 
 According to the third legend , a white horse of the Prince of Lhasa had wandered into Monpa region . People , who went in search of the horse , found the horse grazing at the present location of the monastery . The people of the area then worshipped the horse and the location where it was found and venerated it every year . Eventually , to honour the sacred site , the Tawang Monastery was built at the site . 
 One more legend narrated is about the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo . This female deity is compared to the Hindu Goddess Kali . Like Kali , Palden Lhamo 's thangka is drawn in black colour , with flaming eyes , dressed in skirt made of tiger skin , and a garland of skulls around her neck . A moon disc adorns her hair , similar to the one seen on Shiva . She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara . Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice . As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom . As she was running away , the king shot her shot with an arrow , which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding . When she drew out the arrow , it left a gaping hole in the mule 's back , and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha . 
 = = History = = 
 The monastery was founded by Merek Lama Lodre <unk> in 1680 @-@ 81 at the behest of the 5th Dalai Lama , who was his contemporary . When Merek Lama was experiencing difficulties in building the monastery at the chosen location of <unk> , the ancient name for Tawang , the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives to the people of the area to provide him all help . To fix the perimeter of the Dzong , the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn , the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery . 
 Prior to the dominance of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang , the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder , Merek Lama . This problem was compounded by the <unk> of Bhutan , who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect , who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang . Hence , when the Tawang monastery was built like a fort structure , a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view . 
 In 1844 , Tawang Monastery had entered into two agreements with the East India Company . One agreement , signed on 24 February , pertained to surrender by the Monpas of their right to the <unk> Duar in return for an annual fee ( posa ) of Rs 5 @,@ 000 , and another , dated 28 May , related to the <unk> to abide by any order of the British administration in India in return for an annual fee of Rs 2 @,@ 526 and seven annas . Tawang officials used to travel almost to the plains of Assam to collect monastic contributions . According to Pandit Nain Singh of the <unk> Survey of India , who visited the monastery in 1874 @-@ 75 , the monastery had a parliamentary form of administration , known as the Kato , with the Chief Lamas of the monastery as its members . It was not dependent on the <unk> ( head of Tsona Monastery ) and Government of Lhasa , and this aspect was supported by G.A. Nevill who had visited the monastery in 1924 . 
 Until 1914 , this region of India was under the control of Tibet . However , under the Simla Agreement of 1913 @-@ 14 , the area came under the control of the British Raj . Tibet gave up several hundred square miles of its territory , including the whole of the Tawang region and the monastery , to the British . This disputed territory was the bone of contention for the 1962 India China war , when China invaded India on 20 October 1962 from the northeastern border , forcing the Indian army to retreat . They occupied Tawang , including the monastery , for six months , but did not desecrate it . China claimed that Tawang belonged to Tibet . Before this war , in 1959 , the 14th Dalai Lama had fled from Tibet , and after an arduous journey , crossed into India on 30 March 1959 , and had reached Tawang and taken shelter in the monastery for a few days before moving to Tezpur . 50 years later , in spite of strong protests by China , the Dalai Lama 's visit on 8 November 2009 to Tawang Monastery was a monumental event to the people of the region , and the abbot of the monastery greeted him with much fanfare and adulation . 
 As of 2006 the monastery had 400 monks , and the number was reported to be 450 in 2010 . Tawang Manuscript Conservation Centre was established in the monastery in August 2006 , which has curated 200 manuscripts , and 31 manuscripts have been treated for preservation . In November 2010 , it was reported that the monastery is threatened by possible landslide risk , with the The Times of India reporting " massive landslides around it " . Professor Dave Petley of Durham University in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , an acknowledged landslide expert , wrote : " the northern flank of the site appears to consist of a landslide scarp ... The reasons for this are clear – the river , which flows towards the south , is eroding the toe of the slope due to the site being on the outside of the bend . In the long term , erosion at the toe will need to be prevented if the site is to be preserved . " 
 The monastery currently has control over 17 <unk> in West Kameng district . The monastery has administrative control over two dzongs , each headed by a monk ; the <unk> Dzong built in 1831 and the <unk> Dzong , also known as <unk> Gompa , in the south west part of Kameng district . These dzongs not only collect taxes but also preach Buddhism to the Monpas and <unk> of Kameng . The monastery owns cultivable lands in the villages of Soma and <unk> and a few patches in some other villages which are tilled and cultivated by farmers , who share the produce with the monastery . The present resident head of the monastery is the incarnate <unk> <unk> .

 = = = Entrance and outer walls = = = 
 At the entrance to the monastery there is colourful gate structure , known as the Kakaling , which is built in the shape of a " hut @-@ like structure " , with side walls built of stone masonry . The roof of the Kakaling features mandalas , while the interior walls have murals of divinities and saints painted on them . A distinctive mural , the ninth mural from the southwest west corner of the southern wall , is of <unk> , the protector deity of the Bon religion , who is considered the guardian deity of the Tawang region . Ahead of the main gate of the Kakaling , to its south , is another entry , an open gate . 
 The main entrance to the monastery , to the south of the open gate , has massive doors fitted on the northern wall . This outer wall is 925 feet ( 282 m ) in length , with heights varying from about 10 – 20 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 – 6 @.@ 1 m ) . Apart from the main gate , the southern side of the monastery has another entry gate , which also has a massive door . Nearer to the gate , there are two small openings in the wall which provide complete view of the exterior part of the eastern wall that connects to the Kakaling . According to a legend , the 5th Dalai Lama had given a roll of thread to be bound around the walls of the monastery to denote the extent to which the monastery should be built . 
 = = = Main buildings = = = 
 The monastery , built like a large mansion , is triple storied with a large assembly hall , ten other functional structures and with 65 residential quarters for students , Lamas and monks . The monastery has a school and its own water supply facility , and a centre for Buddhist cultural studies . 
 The ground floor of the monastery is where ritual dances are performed . The walls of the monastery also have a profusion of thangkas of Buddhist deities and saints . Curtains are suspended over the balcony and these are painted with Buddhist symbols . Within the precincts of the monastery there are residential buildings to accommodate about 700 monks , which now houses 450 monks . The abbot of the monastery resides in a house located near the gate at the southeastern corner of the monastery . 
 A notable feature on the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab . It is said that this foot print belonged to a resident of the monastery , who was a water carrier , known as <unk> . He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step . This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery . 
 = = = = Main temple ( Dukhang ) = = = = 
 The main temple in the monastery , to the west of the entry gate , is known as the Dukhang ( ' Du ' means " assembly " and ' Khang ' means " building " ) . It was built in 1860 @-@ 61 . A large image of Buddha of 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) height is deified ; it is gilded and decorated , and is in a lotus position . This image is on the northern face of the assembly hall and is installed over a platform and its head extends up to the first floor . Next to the Buddha image there is a silver casket that holds a special thangka of the goddess <unk> Devi ( Palden Lhamo ) , which is the guardian deity of the monastery . It is said that it was painted with the blood drawn from the nose of the 5th Dalai Lama , which renders an ethereal " living quality " to the <unk> . This thangka image , also known as Dri Devi , was donated to the monastery by the 5th Dalai Lama . The main temple fell into a dilapidated condition and was renovated in 2002 in the traditional Buddhist architectural style . It has been exquisitely decorated with paintings , murals , carvings , sculptures and so forth . 
 = = = Library and texts = = = 
 The monastery has a printing press for printing religious books using paper made locally . Wooden blocks are used for printing . The books are used usually by the literate Monpa Lamas who refer to it for conducting religious rituals . The entire second floor houses the library . It contains the scriptures of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Kangyur , Tengyur and <unk> , which have been affected due to insect attacks . The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur ( in 25 volumes ) , which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings ; three sets of Kangyur , the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings ; and <unk> <unk> in five volumes . Of the three sets of Kangyur , two are handwritten and one is printed . The printed sets are in 101 volumes . One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes ; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold . The religious text , <unk> , has letters washed in gold in all its pages . At some stage , some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time . In the past , these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them . This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part with some of the sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them . They again took away more books in 1951 . 
 = = Customs and festivals = = 
 Monpas , who belong to the Gelug sect , are the dominant sect of the Kameng region . Many Monpa boys join the monastery and become Lamas . When young boys join the monastery to train , it is on the condition that it is a lifetime commitment . If a monk wishes to leave the monastery , a heavy penalty is levied . According to a past custom , in a family of three sons , the middle son was conscripted to the monastery and in a family of two sons the youngest son was inducted into the monastery . 
 The main Monpa festivals held in the monastery are the <unk> , Losar , <unk> , and Torgya . <unk> is the festival when the Lamas recite religious scriptures in the monasteries . Following the religious recitations , the villagers carry the scriptures on their back and <unk> their agricultural land seeking blessings for good yield of crops without any infestations by pests and to protect against attack by wild animals . In the Losar festival , which marks the beginning of the Tibetan New Year , people visit the monastery and offer prayers . Torgya , also known as Tawang @-@ Torgya , is an annual festival that is exclusively held in the monastery . It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of <unk> , which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar , and is a Monpa celebration . The objective of the festival is to ward off evil spirits and ushering all round prosperity and happiness to the people in the ensuing year . During the three @-@ day festival , dances performed by artists in colorful costumes and masks are held in the courtyard , including the Pha Chan and the <unk> <unk> , the latter of which is performed by the monks of the monastery . Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows , tigers , sheep , monkeys and so forth . 
 = Emmeline Pankhurst = 
 Emmeline Pankhurst ( née Goulden ; 15 July 1858 – 14 June 1928 ) was a British political activist and leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote . In 1999 Time named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century , stating : " she shaped an idea of women for our time ; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back . " She was widely criticised for her militant tactics , and historians disagree about their effectiveness , but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women 's suffrage in Britain . 
 Born in Moss Side , Manchester to politically active parents , Pankhurst was introduced at the age of 14 to the women 's suffrage movement . On 18 December 1879 , she married Richard Pankhurst , a barrister 24 years her senior known for supporting women 's right to vote ; they had five children over the next ten years . He supported her activities outside the home , and she founded and became involved with the Women 's Franchise League , which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women . When that organisation broke apart , she tried to join the left @-@ leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her sex . While working as a Poor Law Guardian , she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester 's workhouses . 
 In 1903 , five years after her husband died , Pankhurst founded the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , an all @-@ women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to " deeds , not words . " The group identified as independent from – and often in opposition to – political parties . It became known for physical confrontations : its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers . Pankhurst , her daughters , and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences , where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions . As Pankhurst 's eldest daughter Christabel took leadership of the WSPU , antagonism between the group and the government grew . Eventually the group adopted arson as a tactic , and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family . In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU , among them Pankhurst 's daughters Adela and Sylvia . Emmeline was so furious that she " gave [ Adela ] a ticket , £ 20 , and a letter of introduction to a suffragette in Australia , and firmly insisted that she emigrate . " Adela complied and the family rift was never healed . Sylvia became a socialist . 
 With the advent of the First World War , Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British government 's stand against the " German Peril . " They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight , becoming prominent figures in the white feather movement . In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30 . This discrepancy was intended to ensure that men did not become minority voters as a consequence of the huge number of deaths suffered during the First World War . Pankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women 's Party , which was dedicated to promoting women 's equality in public life . In her later years , she became concerned with what she perceived as the menace posed by Bolshevism and joined the Conservative Party and was selected as a Conservative Party candidate for Stepney in 1927 . She died on 14 June 1928 , only weeks before the Conservative government 's Representation of the People Act ( 1928 ) extended the vote to all women over 21 years of age on 2 July 1928 . She was commemorated two years later with a statue in London 's Victoria Tower Gardens . 
 = = Family and birth = = 
 Emmeline Pankhurst was born on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side . Although her birth certificate states otherwise , she believed that her birthday was a day earlier , on Bastille Day . Most biographies , including those written by her daughters , repeat this claim . Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille , she said in 1908 : " I have always thought that the fact that I was born on that day had some kind of influence over my life . " The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear . 
 The family into which she was born had been steeped in political agitation for generations . Her mother , Sophia Jane <unk> , was descended from the Manx people of the Isle of Man and counted among her ancestors men charged with social unrest and slander . In 1881 the Isle of Man was the first country to grant women the right to vote in national elections . Her father , Robert Goulden , came from a modest Manchester merchant family with its own background of political activity . His mother worked with the Anti @-@ Corn Law League , and his father was present at the Peterloo massacre , when cavalry charged and broke up a crowd demanding parliamentary reform . 
 Their first son died at the age of two , but the Gouldens had ten other children ; Emmeline was the eldest of five daughters . Soon after her birth the family moved to Seedley in Pendleton on the outskirts of Salford , where her father had co @-@ founded a small business . Goulden was active in local politics , serving for several years on the Salford Town Council . He was also an enthusiastic supporter of dramatic organisations including the Manchester Athenaeum and the Dramatic Reading Society . He owned a theatre in Salford for several years , where he played the leads in several plays by William Shakespeare . Pankhurst absorbed an appreciation of drama and theatrics from her father , which she used later in social activism . 
 = = Childhood = = 
 The Gouldens included their children in social activism . As part of the movement to end slavery in the US , Goulden welcomed American abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher when he visited Manchester . Sophia Jane Goulden used the novel Uncle Tom 's Cabin – written by Beecher 's sister Harriet Beecher Stowe – as a regular source of bedtime stories for their sons and daughters . In her 1914 autobiography My Own Story , Pankhurst recalls visiting a bazaar at a young age to collect money for newly freed slaves in the United States . 
 Pankhurst began to read books when she was very young – according to one source , at the age of three . She read the Odyssey at the age of nine and enjoyed the works of John Bunyan , especially his 1678 story The Pilgrim 's Progress . Another of her favourite books was Thomas Carlyle 's three @-@ volume treatise The French Revolution : A History ; she later said the work " remained all my life a source of inspiration . " 
 Despite her avid consumption of books , however , Emmeline was not given the educational advantages enjoyed by her brothers . Their parents believed that the girls needed most to learn the art of " making home attractive " and other skills desired by potential husbands . The Gouldens deliberated carefully about future plans for their sons ' education , but they expected their daughters to marry young and avoid paid work . Although they supported women 's suffrage and the general advancement of women in society , the Gouldens believed their daughters incapable of the goals of their male peers . Feigning sleep one evening as her father came into her bedroom , Emmeline Goulden heard him pause and say to himself : " What a pity she wasn 't born a lad . " 
 It was through her parents ' interest in women 's suffrage that Pankhurst was first introduced to the subject . Her mother received and read the Women 's Suffrage Journal , and Pankhurst grew fond of its editor , Lydia Becker . At the age of 14 , she returned home from school one day to find her mother on her way to a public meeting about women 's voting rights . After learning that Becker would be speaking , she insisted on attending . Pankhurst was enthralled by Becker 's address and wrote later : " I left the meeting a conscious and confirmed suffragist . " 
 A year later she arrived in Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly . The school provided its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping , in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery . Her roommate was Noémie , the daughter of Henri Rochefort , who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune . The girls shared tales of their parents ' political exploits , and remained good friends for years . Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder . Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend . When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter , the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned , miserable , to Manchester . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 In the autumn of 1878 , at the age of 20 , Emmeline Goulden met and began a courtship with Richard Pankhurst , a barrister who had advocated women 's suffrage – and other causes , including freedom of speech and education reform – for years . Richard , 44 years old when they met , had earlier resolved to remain a bachelor to better serve the public . Their mutual affection was powerful , but the couple 's happiness was diminished by the death of his mother the following year . Sophia Jane Goulden chastised her daughter for " throwing herself " at Richard and urged her without success to exhibit more aloofness . Emmeline suggested to Richard that they avoid the legal formalities of marriage by entering into a free union ; he objected on the grounds that she would be excluded from political life as an unmarried woman . He noted that his colleague Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy had faced social condemnation before she formalised her marriage to Ben Elmy . Emmeline Goulden agreed , and they were wed in St Luke 's Church , Pendleton on 18 December 1879 . 
 During the 1880s , living at the Goulden cottage with her parents in Seedley , Emmeline Pankhurst tended to her husband and children , but still devoted time to political activities . Although she gave birth to five children in ten years , both she and Richard believed that she should not be " a household machine . " Thus a servant was hired to help with the children as Pankhurst involved herself with the Women 's Suffrage Society . Their daughter Christabel was born on 22 September 1880 , less than a year after the wedding . Pankhurst gave birth to another daughter , Estelle Sylvia , in 1882 and their son Francis Henry , nicknamed Frank , in 1884 . Soon afterwards Richard Pankhurst left the Liberal Party . He began expressing more radical socialist views and argued a case in court against several wealthy businessmen . These actions roused Robert Goulden 's ire and the mood in the house became tense . In 1885 the Pankhursts moved to Chorlton @-@ on @-@ Medlock , and their daughter Adela was born . They moved to London the following year , where Richard ran unsuccessfully for election as a Member of Parliament and Pankhurst opened a small fabric shop called Emerson and Company . 
 In 1888 Francis developed diphtheria and died on 11 September . Overwhelmed with grief , Pankhurst commissioned two portraits of the dead boy but was unable to look at them and hid them in a bedroom cupboard . The family concluded that a faulty drainage system at the back of their house had caused their son 's illness . Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood , and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square . She was soon pregnant once more and declared that the child was " Frank coming again . " She gave birth to a son on 7 July 1889 and named him Henry Francis in honour of his deceased brother . 
 Pankhurst made their Russell Square home into a centre for grieving sisters , attracting activists of many types . She took pleasure in decorating the house – especially with furnishings from Asia – and clothing the family in tasteful apparel . Her daughter Sylvia later wrote : " Beauty and appropriateness in her dress and household appointments seemed to her at all times an indispensable setting to public work . " The Pankhursts hosted a variety of guests including US abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison , Indian MP Dadabhai Naoroji , socialist activists Herbert Burrows and Annie Besant , and French anarchist Louise Michel .

 In 1888 Britain 's first nationwide coalition of groups advocating women 's right to vote , the National Society for Women 's Suffrage ( <unk> ) , split after a majority of members decided to accept organisations affiliated with political parties . Angry at this decision , some of the group 's leaders , including Lydia Becker and Millicent Fawcett , stormed out of the meeting and created an alternative organisation committed to the " old rules , " called the Great College Street Society after the location of its headquarters . Pankhurst aligned herself with the " new rules " group , which became known as the Parliament Street Society ( PSS ) . Some members of the PSS favoured a piecemeal approach to gaining the vote . Because it was often assumed that married women did not need the vote since their husbands " voted for them , " some PSS members felt that the vote for single women and widows was a practical step along the path to full suffrage . When the reluctance within the PSS to advocate on behalf of married women became clear , Pankhurst and her husband helped organise another new group dedicated to voting rights for all women – married and unmarried . 
 The inaugural meeting of the Women 's Franchise League ( WFL ) was held on 25 July 1889 , at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square . William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting , warning the audience that the US abolition movement had been hampered by individuals advocating moderation and patience . Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler , leader of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts ; the Pankhursts ' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy ; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch , daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton . 
 The WFL was considered a radical organisation , since in addition to women 's suffrage it supported equal rights for women in the areas of divorce and inheritance . It also advocated trade unionism and sought alliances with socialist organisations . The more conservative group that emerged from the <unk> split spoke out against what they called the " extreme left " wing of the movement . The WFL reacted by ridiculing the " Spinster Suffrage party " and insisting that a wider assault on social inequity was required . The group 's radicalism caused some members to leave ; both Blatch and Elmy resigned from the WFL . The group fell apart one year later .
