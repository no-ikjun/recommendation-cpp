 = HMS Illustrious ( 1896 ) = 
 The third HMS Illustrious of the British Royal Navy was a Majestic @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship . The ship was built at the Chatham Dockyard ; her keel was laid down in March 1895 , her completed hull was launched in September 1896 , and she was commissioned into the fleet in April 1898 . She was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and a secondary battery of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) guns . The ship had a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 Illustrious was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until 1904 . Transferred to the Channel Fleet ( which was subsequently reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet ) she underwent a refit which was duly completed in early 1906 . Rendered obsolete by the emergence of the new dreadnoughts , she served with the Home Fleet from 1908 . One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when World War I broke out , she served as a guard ship at various regions around Northern England until late 1915 . Her main armament was removed and she then served as a store ship for the remainder of the war . She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped the following year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Illustrious was 421 feet ( 128 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 ft ( 23 m ) and a draft of 27 ft ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She displaced up to 16 @,@ 060 t ( 15 @,@ 810 long tons ; 17 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . By 1907 – 1908 , she was re @-@ boilered with oil @-@ fired models . Her engines provided a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers , although they suffered from high fuel consumption . She had a crew of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk VIII guns in twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The turrets were placed on circular barbettes , unlike six of her sisters , which retained earlier pear @-@ shaped barbettes . Illustrious also carried twelve QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 guns . They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships . She also carried sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder guns and twelve QF 2 @-@ pounder guns . She was also equipped with five 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged in the ship 's hull , with the last in a deck @-@ mounted launcher . Illustrious and the other ships of her class had 9 inches ( 229 mm ) of Harvey armour , which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour . This allowed Illustrious and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection . The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armour , and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides . The ship 's armoured deck was 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 64 to 114 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for HMS Illustrious was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 11 March 1895 and the ship was launched on 17 September 1896 . She commissioned at Chatham for service in the Fleet Reserve on 15 April 1898 , Captain Sir Richard Poore in command . She went into full commission there on 10 May 1898 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet . While in the Mediterranean , she participated between September and December 1898 in operations at Crete during the Greco @-@ Turkish uprising there , and in 1901 underwent a refit at Malta . Captain Francis John Foley was appointed in command on 24 March 1902 , and the following June she was the lead ship in a coronation fête at Gibraltar . In July 1904 , Illustrious transferred to the Channel Fleet . As a result of a reorganization on 1 January 1905 , the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet , and she became an Atlantic Fleet unit . Illustrious ended her Atlantic Fleet service in September 1905 and began a refit at Chatham . 
 Emerging from the refit , she commissioned into the Reserve at Chatham on 14 March 1906 , then went into full commission for service in the new Channel Fleet ( formerly the Home Fleet ) on 3 April 1906 , serving as Flagship , Rear Admiral . She collided with schooner Christa in the English Channel in fog on 13 June 1906 . She was relieved as flagship and ended her Channel Fleet service on 1 June 1908 , paying off at Chatham . Illustrious recommissioned at Chatham on 2 June 1908 for service with the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet . On 22 March 1909 she collided with third @-@ class cruiser HMS Amethyst in Portsmouth Harbour , but suffered no damage . She suffered another mishap on 21 August 1909 when she damaged her bottom by striking a reef in Babbacombe Bay . She underwent a refit in 1912 , and later that year was transferred to the 3rd Fleet and participated in maneuvers as Flagship , Vice Admiral , 7th Battle Squadron . 
 In late July 1914 , the Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilization , as war seemed imminent . The Majestic @-@ class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy . At first , it was planned that Illustrious would pay off to provide crewmen for the new dreadnought battleship HMS Erin , but instead she was placed in full commission to serve as a guard ship for the Grand Fleet once World War I began in August 1914 . She began guard ship duty at Loch Ewe on 23 August 1914 , transferring to Loch Na Keal on 17 October 1914 , to the Tyne in November 1914 , and to Grimsby on the Humber in December 1914 . She remained on guard ship duty on the Humber until November 1915 . 
 Illustrious paid off at Grimsby on 26 November 1915 to be converted to a disarmed harbour ship ; two of her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns were re @-@ used in the Tyne Turrets . Her conversion was completed in March 1916 . She served at Grimsby in her new role until August 1916 , when she transferred to Chatham . Illustrious commissioned there on 20 November 1916 for use as a munitions storeship , and on 24 November 1916 she transferred to the Tyne to serve in this role . In November 1917 , she transferred to Portsmouth to continue service as a munitions storeship there . Illustrious paid off on 21 April 1919 and was placed on the sale list at Portsmouth on 24 March 1920 . She was sold for scrapping on 18 June 1920 , and was broken up at Barrow .

 = Guillaume de Dole = 
 Guillaume de Dole ( also known as ( Le ) Roman ( s ) de la Rose , or Guillaume de Dole ) is an Old French narrative romance by Jean Renart . Composed in the early 13th century , the poem is <unk> lines long and is especially notable for the large number of chansons it contains , and for its active female protagonist . The romance incorporates forty @-@ six chansons ( or parts thereof ) ; it is the first extant example in French literature of a text that combines narrative and lyric . Its form was quickly imitated , by authors such as Gerbert de Montreuil , and by the end of the 13th century had become canonical . 
 The poem tells of the adventures of the title character and his sister Liénor . Guillaume is accepted at the court of Emperor Conrad who has fallen in love with Liénor despite his earlier aversion to love and marriage . Guillaume becomes one of the emperor 's favorites and marriage negotiations proceed in a positive manner . The emperor 's seneschal , however , discovers an intimate detail about Liénor 's body and uses it to insinuate to the emperor and his court that she is no longer a virgin ; the clever Liénor , with a ruse , proves his accusation false and marries the emperor .

 Guillaume de Dole is extant in a single manuscript in the Vatican library , MS Regina 1725 . Todd dates it in the 14th century , others in the late 13th century . The manuscript contains : 
 Lancelot , the Knight of the Cart , by Chrétien de Troyes ( first part missing ) , 1 @-@ <unk> ; 
 Yvain , the Knight of the Lion , also by Chrétien , <unk> @-@ <unk> ; 
 Guillaume de Dole , <unk> @-@ <unk> ; 
 <unk> de <unk> , by Raoul de <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 The manuscript 's first known owner was 16th @-@ century French historian Claude Fauchet ; it was part of his extensive collection , and it is due to " Fauchet 's zeal as a collector " that the manuscript and therefore the poem are preserved . During the French Wars of Religion , Fauchet fled Paris and his collection was dispersed . The next mention of the manuscript is as part of the library of Paul <unk> , and in 1650 it was acquired by Christina , Queen of Sweden . The Vatican library acquired the manuscript after 1689 . 
 = = = Date and title = = = 
 The opening lines of the poem contain a dedication to Miles de Nanteuil , an early 13th @-@ century churchman who was elected ( but not confirmed ) in 1201 as archbishop of Reims , and later became bishop of Beauvais , in northern France ; he died circa 1235 . According to Todd , the nobleman de Nanteuil may have been too young and wild to be elevated to the archbishopric , but this would have made him a good candidate for Renart 's dedication . This , plus evidence based on other names found in the poem , led Todd to conclude that the poem was composed around the year 1200 . Later critics and researchers , however , date the poem between 1204 and 1228 , and tend toward the earlier date . 
 In the manuscript , the poem is called Romans de la Rose ( l . 11 ) , and hence Le Roman de la Rose , but it is often referred to as Roman de la Rose , or Guillaume de Dole in order to avoid confusion with Guillaume de <unk> and Jean de <unk> 's Roman de la Rose ; Guillaume de Dole is a subtitle added by Fauchet .

 It wasn 't until the late 19th century that scholars ( including Paul Meyer ) began entertaining the notion that Jean Renart , until then only known as the presumptive author of the Lai de l 'Ombre , might also be responsible for either or both of the two contemporary romances L <unk> and Guillaume de Dole . F. M. Warren of Yale University , in a 1908 article , is one of the early proponents of identifying Renart as the author of all three , based on versification , phrasing , and vocabulary , and places the development of his poetic talent between 1195 and 1205 . The next @-@ to @-@ last line of the poem contains an anagram on Renart 's name : " ... qu 'il <unk> EN Religion . "

 = = = Plot = = = 
 The story begins at the court of Emperor Conrad , who for all of his good qualities has one defect : he refuses to get married , especially since , as he says , people no longer are as valiant and as noble as they used to be . His minstrel , <unk> , tells him of Guillaume de Dole and his sister Liénor , and quickly the emperor falls in love with her , although he does not actually see her until the story 's denouement . Guillaume is summoned to the court where he excels in chivalric exploits ; the emperor tells him he wishes to marry his sister . Conrad 's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume 's family , where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence ; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark in the shape of a rose on her thigh . This knowledge is presented as proof that the seneschal has taken her virginity . 
 As a result of the accusation , both Guillaume and Conrad are distraught , to the point of misogyny . The clever Liénor , however , her reputation slandered , unmasks the seneschal with a ruse . She has a belt and other gifts sent to the seneschal , supposedly from the Chatelaine of Dijon , whom he had courted , with promises that the Chatelaine is ready to grant him his wishes . The messenger convinces the seneschal to wear the belt under his clothes . Liénor then goes to Conrad 's court , where everyone is struck by her beauty , and pretends to be a maiden who was raped by the seneschal and has thus acquired intimate knowledge of his body and his clothing ; she reveals he has a belt under his clothes . The belt is discovered under his clothes and a trial by ordeal is proposed . The seneschal 's innocence is proven in an ordeal by water : he has never had sex with the maiden . When Liénor reveals that she is in fact Guillaume 's sister , the seneschal 's earlier claim of having deflowered her is proven a lie . The seneschal is shackled and incarcerated , and the wedding is celebrated with great pomp . On the wedding night , Conrad 's happiness is greater than that of Tristan or Lanval ; the next morning , " no one who asked [ Conrad ] for a costly gift was refused . " As for the seneschal , Liénor implores Conrad to be merciful , and he is sent away as a Templar to join a crusade . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 The plot of Guillaume revolves around the common theme of the <unk> , a young man who , because of a wager ( in the case of Guillaume , because of jealousy ) needs to find a young woman 's favor . He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded , causing the ruin of a husband ( if the <unk> had claimed to have succeeded with another man 's wife ) or , in this case , the despair of a brother . Usually the young man 's story is believed at first because he reveals an intimate detail about a young woman , who then has to prove her innocence . 
 Beginning with Michel Zink , whose influential 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge : Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole ushered in a new era of criticism , critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole as a work of literature about literature , a self @-@ referential poem that comments on the improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status , encouraging a trend in studies of Renart and his work . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 The romance contains some 46 chansons , which can be separated into two groups , according to <unk> and Bloch . The first group contains sixteen " aristocratic " chansons <unk> on the topic of courtly love , attributed to specific <unk> or troubadours ( including <unk> Brulé , Le <unk> de <unk> , <unk> de Chartres , <unk> Rudel , and <unk> de Ventadorn ) . A second group consists of thirty mostly anonymous songs of a more popular nature , such as three chansons de <unk> and three other ballads , two <unk> , and twenty chansons à <unk> ( dance songs ) . Incorporated also is a <unk> of the chanson de geste Gerbert de Metz . Different scholars have slightly different counts ; where Holier and Block count three ballads and three chanson de <unk> , Maureen Barry McCann Boulton counts six chansons de <unk> ; in her detailed investigation of the chansons she claims the poem contains forty @-@ six chansons in eight different genres . 
 In its hybrid form , Guillaume de Dole is " the first extant example of the combined use of narrative and lyric in French . " The mixed form proved to be popular and was soon found in other works , including <unk> and Nicolette ( early 13th century ) ; Gautier de <unk> 's Les Miracles de <unk> @-@ Dame ( c . 1218 – 1233 ) ; Gerbert de Montreuil 's Le Roman de la Violette ( c . 1230 ) , which incorporates some forty songs ; and <unk> 's Roman de la <unk> ( c . 1250 ) , which incorporates a series of refrains . By the end of the century the form had become canonical .

 The female protagonist , Liénor , is notable because of her active nature : she herself unmasks the seneschal . She found a quick successor in the active female protagonist of <unk> 's Roman de la <unk> . At least one recent publication states that Liénor might make a justifiable claim to being the romance 's true hero .

 The first mention of <unk> de Dole after the Middle Ages is found in the work of Claude Fauchet , who is generally considered to have studied the Vatican Regina manuscript ( instead of another , now lost , manuscript ) . In 1844 , Adelbert Keller published extracts of the poem including some of the chansons ; the chansons acquired some fame , and in 1850 <unk> and Renan traveled to Rome to study the manuscript , publishing a larger number of the chansons in 1855 . It wasn 't until 1870 that all of the chansons had been published . A lengthy analysis , partial edition , and summary in English was published by Henry Alfred Todd of Johns Hopkins University , in 1886 . The poem was finally published in its entirety in 1893 by Gustave Servois for the Société des anciens <unk> français . 
 The first comprehensive study of the work of Jean Renart was published in 1935 by Rita Lejeune @-@ <unk> , who published an edition of the poem in 1935 . Since then , it has been republished regularly . Translations have been published in modern French ( 1979 ) , German ( 1982 ) , and English ( 1993 , 1995 ) . 
 Between 2001 and 2007 , Joshua Tyra adapted the text into a musical . An early version was read at the University of Chicago .

 The music video for " Candyman " was filmed on January 28 , 2007 , in an airport hangar in Southern California . It was directed by Matthew Rolston and co @-@ directed by Aguilera . The video is based on the 1940s World War II theme . In most of the music video , she dances and sings in three different hair colors : red , blonde and brown , as if she were in a singing trio , a tribute to The Andrews Sisters . In other shots she appears as the famous biceps @-@ flexing factory worker from Westinghouse 's " We Can Do It ! " poster and as pin @-@ up girls Judy Garland , Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth . The video also features product placement for Campari . Benji Schwimmer , 2006 winner of the American dancing competition So You Think You Can Dance , makes a cameo appearance as Aguilera 's GI dance partner . Benji 's sister Lacey Schwimmer also appears in the video as a <unk> . Aguilera asked Rolston to co @-@ direct the video with her after he worked with her for a photo shoot for the cover of Rolling Stone . Shooting the sequences of Aguilera as a singing trio took the longest since they had to be shot for each hair color and camera angle , which was computer @-@ controlled for precision . Choreography was carefully arranged so that none of the versions overlapped and the takes could be spliced together . The clip 's color scheme is based on Technicolor films , focusing on primary colors and bright secondary colors . 
 Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine praised it as the best video for a song from Back to Basics . John Montgomery for MTV News commented on Aguilera 's " bad girl " image , writing " though Aguilera 's mostly going for glam here , she 's also plenty bad , too , swinging her way into some servicemen 's heart , coyly sipping on a milkshake and shaking it so hard your even your grandpa had to notice . " The video brought Aguilera and Rolston an MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Direction at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards , but lost to Justin Timberlake 's " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " .

 Boredoms ( <unk> ( <unk> ) ) ( later known as V ∞ redoms ) is a rock band from Osaka , Japan . The band was officially formed in 1986 . The band 's output is usually referred to as noise rock or sometimes Japanoise , though their more recent records have mostly featured repetitive minimalism , ambient music , and tribal drumming . 
 The band has a vast and sometimes confusing discography . Many band members have rotated through the group over the years , often using a number of various stage names . Singer Yamantaka Eye is the closest the band has to a frontman ; his style includes a range of baffling screams , babbling , electronic effects , and very heavy post @-@ production . Drummer / keyboard player / vocalist Yoshimi P @-@ We is featured on most Boredoms recordings .

 = = = Formation and early years = = = 
 Boredoms were formed in early 1986 by Yamantaka Eye , who at the time acted as front man for the infamous and highly controversial noise / performance art act Hanatarash , locally notorious for its extremely dangerous live shows consisting entirely of on @-@ stage destruction and complete disregard for the audience 's safety . The antics of Hanatarash would later be highly influential on the earliest incarnation of Boredoms , which was formed by the remaining members of a band Eye started with Hanatarash drummer Ikuo Taketani , as well as guitarist Tabata Mitsuru ( known as Tabata Mara ) , bassist Hosoi <unk> , and vocalist Makki <unk> , called " Acid Makki & Combi and Zombie " . The band 's sound was characterized by violent , noisy punk rock / No Wave thrashings . They recorded a single track , " U.S.A. " , for a compilation tape . Shortly after the release of their first song , Taketani was replaced on drums by Yoshikawa <unk> , a friend of Eye 's . The band officially changed their name to Boredoms after Hira replaced Hosoi on bass , and <unk> left the band due to creative differences . The band 's name comes from the Buzzcocks song " Boredom " . 
 With the band finally reaching a level of stability , Eye and Tabata recorded their first official EP , Anal by Anal , in mid @-@ 1986 . In early 1987 , Tabata left the group to later join <unk> Geva and was replaced by Seiichi Yamamoto as guitar player . In March 1988 , the band released its first full @-@ length , <unk> no Stooges Kyo . Due to unhappiness over Yoshikawa 's drumming , Yoshimi P @-@ We from Eye 's Hanatarash @-@ related project UFO or Die was asked to serve as drummer , becoming the first female member of the band , with Yoshikawa switching to general percussion . Shortly after the change Yoshikawa left the group , to be replaced by Chew Hasegawa ( now of Japanese funeral doom band Corrupted ) and then by Kazuya Nishimura , known by his stage name Atari . The band 's sound from this period was marked by harsh , dissonant punk edited extensively by Eye in the studio , citing Sonic Youth and Funkadelic as influences , among others . This style was seen by some as " pointlessly abrasive " without any underlying motive , making Boredoms <unk> absolute music , according to some critics ; however , the strangeness of the record increased the band 's popularity in the musical underground . 
 = = = Growing popularity = = = 
 In 1988 and 1989 , Eye found himself making friends with Sonic Youth and also worked extensively with John Zorn 's <unk> Naked City project , serving as guest vocalist . After the release of Boredoms ' album Soul Discharge in the United States , the band was able to parlay their growing popularity into long term record deals with Warner Bros. Records in Japan and its United States imprint Reprise Records . With the release of the band 's critically acclaimed Pop Tatari , generally seen as one of the strangest albums ever released by a major label , Boredoms took to the road and toured with Sonic Youth in 1992 , Nirvana for eight consecutive shows in late October and early November 1993 , and Brutal Truth in 1993 . During this period , the band was asked by Steve Albini to record a track for a compilation he was recording . Shortly after Eye again collaborated with John Zorn on an EP under the name Mystic <unk> Orchestra , which was notably the first album released on Zorn 's <unk> Records . 
 The following year , at the height of its popularity in the United States , the band was asked to perform on the main stage of the 1994 Lollapalooza tour in support of the album Chocolate Synthesizer , which had just been released in the United States . The album proved largely successful for such an experimental band and was later considered one of the best albums of the 1990s by Alternative Press magazine . Yoshikawa had later joined the band in the early months of 1994 for a second time to play on Pop Tatari , often sharing vocal duties with Eye , but left again in 1994 and was replaced on percussion by EDA , who had been introduced to the band by Pavement bassist Mark Ibold . The band was dropped from the Reprise roster , with Birdman Records distributing the band 's Super Roots EPs during this period . 
 By the time of 1998 's Super Go ! ! ! ! ! EP and full @-@ length Super æ , the band started to break sharply from their earlier atonal noise rock / Japanoise sound by introducing many elements of sweeping electronica effects and thoroughly constructed psychedelic rock jams into their music . Perceived analogies with the music of Can became common during this period . Described as " tumultuous space @-@ sludge " , Super æ has most often been compared to the defining elements of 1970s krautrock . Soon after its initial release in Japan , Super æ was met with a considerable amount of acclaim from the international music press , recognized as a modern @-@ day avant @-@ garde artifact and progressive " masterpiece " . Notably , Super æ was considered one of the best albums of the 1990s by Pitchfork Media . 
 In 1999 , the band released Vision Creation Newsun in Japan . This album saw an evolution in their sound , combining the evolving space rock themes explored in their Super Roots EPs and preceding album Super æ with " a much more earthly , primal , primitively worshipful inspiration " . It features psychedelic <unk> and " cosmic synths " , complex tribal drumming , " cathartic celebrations of noise " , and Eye 's unique power electronic and <unk> stylings . The album is often considered the band 's greatest achievement thus far , and has been described by critics as blending the " manic , high @-@ speed , cut @-@ up form punk rock " of their earlier albums with a new sound that is " just as intense and exhilarating , but more beautiful and more expansive " . 
 After its release , Eye oversaw a series of remix albums of the Boredoms catalogue by guest DJs . After the final remix album , Eye 's own <unk> , vol . 0 , was released in 2000 , Boredoms seemed to disappear for a few years with no releases or tour dates , while the members participated in various side projects and other bands .

 Rumors that the band had broken up began to circulate , but a smaller ensemble who called themselves V ∞ redoms resurfaced in 2003 . The group 's line @-@ up had changed considerably upon its return , stripping down to a much smaller ensemble with Yamantaka Eye on vocals , Izumi Kiyoshi ( who had performed on Vision Creation Newsun and Super æ ) on synthesizer , and Yoshimi P @-@ We , Nishimura , and EDA playing drums and percussion . 
 Despite the changes , the group 's music still revolves around the tribal drumming patterns heard on Vision Creation Newsun . The band was signed by Vice Records for its releases in the United States since it had been dropped by Reprise . All Super Roots releases were then reissued on Vice in early 2007 ( with the exclusion of Super Roots 2 ) . In late 2004 , Boredoms released its first album as a group in four years , Seadrum / House of Sun , most of which had been previously recorded before the band 's brief hiatus . This release also saw the band move from their label WEA Japan to the smaller Japanese label <unk> . The album was not celebrated to the extent of their previous albums , yet it still garnered mostly positive reviews , culminating with an exemplary score of 73 % on Metacritic . Following its release , EDA left the band and was replaced by Yojiro Tatekawa . 
 In early 2007 , the group released Super Roots 9 , the first addition to the Super Roots series since 1999 and their first major release since Seadrum / House of Sun . It was recorded during a Christmas Eve 2004 concert , making it only the band 's third official live release since 1998 's Super <unk> ! ! ! ! ! ! video ( discounting disc two of the Vision Creation Newsun boxset , which included a 35 @-@ minute excerpt of a live concert ) . Super Roots 9 also saw the band move from Warner International to the smaller Japanese label <unk> for domestic releases and American label Thrill Jockey for overseas . Later , in April , the group ( as V ∞ redoms ) played three dates with Sonic Youth in Japan . The band also planned to attempt using newly developed contact microphones to record the sounds made by the human body while dancing . 
 The band released a live DVD / CD combination called Live at <unk> in December 2007 followed by the remix single <unk> / <unk> in August 2008 , while Eye and Yoshimi have come out with new records of their own this year . During a 2008 United States tour with Iron & Wine , Eye used a new seven @-@ necked guitar called the " <unk> " or " <unk> " . 
 The band released another addition to the Super Roots EP series , titled Super Roots 10 , on January 28 , 2009 . 
 = = = = Boadrum concerts = = = = 
 On July 7 , 2007 , Boredoms performed a concert entitled 77 Boadrum in Brooklyn Bridge Park , New York City , with drummer <unk> Senju replacing Nishimura . The " 77 " denoted not only the date ( 7 / 7 / 2007 ) but also the number of drummers in the ensemble . Eye has said that the number 77 became significant to him when he climbed the Sun Temple and counted 77 steps . 
 The band continued the concept on August 8 , 2008 , with two concerts called 88 Boadrum held in Los Angeles and Brooklyn . Boredoms headlined the Los Angeles show while Gang Gang Dance conducted the Brooklyn show . 
 A third concert , Boadrum 9 , took place on September 9 , 2009 at Terminal 5 in New York City . It featured 9 drummers in total , two from Boredoms ( Yoshimi and Yojiro ) and seven others from prominent experimental music acts , namely Zach Hill ( Hella ) , Hisham Bharoocha ( Soft Circle , ex : Black Dice , Lightning Bolt ) , <unk> Fuego ( Pit er Pat ) , Kid Millions ( Oneida ) , Jeremy Hyman ( Ponytail ) , Dave Nuss ( No @-@ Neck Blues Band ) and Aaron Moore ( Volcano The Bear ) 
 In 2010 , Boredoms toured internationally including two Boadrum performances at All Tomorrow 's Parties curated by Matt Groening at Butlins Minehead , England , in addition to shows in London , Japan , Mexico and as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival on October 10 , 2010 . 
 In 2011 , Boredoms premiered new material at the All <unk> Parties " I 'll Be Your Mirror " festival in Tokyo . Six drummers were arranged in a circle around Eye , who used motion sensors to trigger ambient drone soundscapes created by Shinji Masuko that corresponded to each drummer . The music featured highly repetitive motorik rhythms that grew in complexity over the course of the hour long set . The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow 's Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead , England . That gig ( performed twice during the festival ) featured 14 guitarists and 6 drummers . 
 In June , 2015 , Boredoms performed another development of the <unk> series at the Barbican Centre in London , UK as part of Doug Aitken 's Station to Station : A 30 @-@ Day Happening . The performance featured Eye , Yoshimi , Tatekawa , Masuko , and an expanded lineup of drummers and guitarists surrounded by 88 percussionists all playing cymbals .

 = Ivy Valentine = 
 Isabella Valentine ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , commonly called Ivy ( <unk> , <unk> ) , is a fictional character in the Soul series of video games . Created by Namco 's Project Soul division , she first appeared in the original Soulcalibur and its subsequent sequels , later appearing in various merchandise related to the series . She was voiced in Japanese by Yumi <unk> between Soulcalibur and Soulcalibur III , Kanako Tōjo between Soulcalibur Legends and Soulcalibur : Broken Destiny , and Miyuki Sawashiro in Soulcalibur V ; in English , she was voiced by Renee Hewitt in Soulcalibur II and Lani Minella for the remainder of the series . 
 The illegitimate daughter of undead pirate Cervantes de Leon , Ivy was raised by a noble family until her father became obsessed with the cursed sword , Soul Edge , leading to his death and later her mother 's . Desiring to destroy the sword , she creates a segmented , animated blade , only to become Soul Edge 's pawn and learn that it intends to use her as its next host . After an attack by Cervantes results in the loss of her soul , Ivy uses a temporary artificial one to keep herself alive , and continues after the blade . 
 Since her introduction , Ivy has been well received , considered both an attractive and strong female character by various sources . She has also been included on various countdown lists regarding sexy video game characters . Scholastic studies have examined the character in the context of the series and video games in general , as well as when compared to other video game related sex symbols such as Lara Croft . Her role as a sex symbol has also been discussed by said sources and the media . Some argue that her appearance goes " too far " , while others feel it helps to define her character . 
 = = Conception and history = = 
 As a character introduced in Soulcalibur , Ivy 's weapon , a " snake sword " designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game , was selected before other elements of the character . Her design and concept were then built to revolve around it , starting with gender , then physical measurements , and lastly background details . After her appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist , her character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on her , and then animated mostly by <unk> Hirata using motion capture to create her in @-@ game movements , with Yasushi <unk> designing the animations for her throws , and several animations created without the use of motion capture for positions difficult for the actors . During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soulcalibur story creators , refining the character 's own role in the plot as needed throughout development . 
 During development many alternatives for Ivy 's design were considered , including a male ninja , a mummy , and a little girl , while the weapon remained constant , varying only in size . With Soulcalibur II , the development team chose her as their favorite character from the previous title . Producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama felt that her fighting style was not perfectly expressed in Soulcalibur , and focused on Ivy from the start of the project to make her more " uniquely lethal " . Namco has called Ivy one of the three most popular characters in the series in North American markets , alongside Taki and Nightmare . Soulcalibur V producer <unk> Tago emphasized this as a reason for the character 's inclusion for the game , additionally citing her fighting style and role in the game 's storyline . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Ivy appears as a tall , large busted woman with short , white hair . A bluish @-@ purple leotard covers her torso and arms , with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage and various parts of her abdomen . Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs , connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak . A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand , while armor covers her left arm , hand , and shoulder . A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder , while high heels cover her feet , and a white glove covers her right hand . The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose , a traditional heraldic symbol of England , while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword . A mask covering the right side of her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept . While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed , the concept has remained consistent throughout the series , with the exception of the removal of the glove in later designs . Ivy stands 1 @.@ 79 m ( 5 ft 10 in ) tall , making her the series ' tallest female character , and with a bust measurement of 100 cm ( 39 in ) also the <unk> , though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV . 
 Ivy 's alternate character designs in the games are a contrast to her primary designs , with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants , vest , and jacket , with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back . In Soulcalibur II , a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming , with red stockings on her legs ; in addition , a fourth design resembling her appearance at the conclusion of Soulcalibur was considered , incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts , but was unused . In Soulcalibur III , a long , rose @-@ themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate , one of several considered designs . For Soulcalibur IV , a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game . 
 Some versions of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy 's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit . With Soulcalibur IV , Ivy 's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her <unk> , leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game . When asked about the censoring , director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of nothing of the sort having taken place . When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game .

 As introduced in Soulcalibur , Ivy was raised by the Valentines , a noble family in London , England . Ivy 's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge , and worked himself to death . Her mother died shortly afterward , and revealed to Ivy that she was not their biological daughter . Becoming an alchemist , Ivy learned of her father 's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge . She created an animated , segmented sword , bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge 's current host , Nightmare , and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought . After learning the truth , and that her real father was the sword 's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next , she departed . Continuing her quest to destroy the sword in later games , Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV . Using an artificial soul to keep herself alive , she acts as a teacher to younger warriors when the sword re @-@ appears years later . 
 Ivy also appears in the prequel Soulcalibur Legends , allying herself with the protagonist Siegfried , and shares an understanding with another of his allies , Lloyd Irving . In Soulcalibur : Broken Destiny 's " Gauntlet " storyline , a side story set after the events of Soulcalibur IV , Ivy assists the character Hilde and her party develop a cure for her father 's ailment . When told that Cervantes ' soul would be required as payment , they attempt to renegotiate , only for Ivy to use the protagonist 's back as a chair while repeating her terms . 
 Designed as a weapon with the longest reach in Soulcalibur , Ivy 's sword Valentine consists of several smaller blades linked together by a chain , able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms . These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series , altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon , with some , such as Spiral Lust , a component of an existing attack . In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart , in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword 's chain . Due to her variety , Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range , however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at . However , attacks such as Ivy <unk> allow her greater variety in range , and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike . Other attacks , such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony , involve grappling with the opponent to damage them , though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves . With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur , due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement . 
 = = = Promotion and merchandising = = = 
 Ivy was featured amongst other characters for Soulcalibur II 's arcade flyer , and has been featured in other printed advertisements for games in the series . She has also appeared on the cover on every Sony @-@ based console game in the series , as well as Soulcalibur Legends for the Nintendo Wii . She is also visible on the white Xbox 360 Soulcalibur IV arcade joystick alongside Hilde and Siegfried , and the box art for Korean distributions of the lilac @-@ colored PSP . In addition , the character has been used to demonstrate the graphical features of both Soulcalibur IV and its follow @-@ up title , Broken Destiny in a tech demo and promotional flyer respectively . Ivy was also featured alongside Siegfried in a manga adaptation of Soulcalibur Legends printed in the Japanese shōnen <unk> Ace ; the manga , written in a humorous tone , used a running gag of Siegfried 's annoyance that Ivy was significantly taller than he was . 
 Several action figures and figurines have been made bearing Ivy 's likeness . Following the release of Soulcalibur , a resin kit by Kurushima was released , alongside a figurine by <unk> . Epoch C @-@ Works released a 1 / 12 scale Ivy action figure of in a set of three for the title as well , featuring equipable weapons . In August 2003 , Todd McFarlane Productions released an Ivy sculpture amongst a set of five based on Soulcalibur II . The immobile figure was modeled after her primary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base and retracted sword . Yujin released a four inch tall figurine based upon her Soulcalibur II artwork as part of their " Namco Girls Series # 5 " line of gashapon figurines . A twelve inch tall immobile PVC figurine modeled after her Soulcalibur III appearance was released by Enterbrain in September 2008 , using a white version of her outfit and extended sword ; a dark blue outfit for an " international color " version of the sculpture was also produced .

 Although commonly cited as one of the most difficult characters to play as in the Soul series , Ivy has received a great deal of positive reception and has been described as one of the series ' most " staple " and " stalwart " characters . From her Soulcalibur II appearance , Ivy was nominated in G4 's 2004 G @-@ Phoria awards show under " Hottest Character " , alongside Vanessa Z. Schneider and Rikku ; she was also a character in their 2005 " Video Game Vixens " awards show , winning in the category of " <unk> Accessory " . Several other " Top Ten " lists have also featured Ivy in similar context , including those by Team Xbox , Machinima.com , and Spike TV . In 2009 , she was featured on the cover of French magazine Ig alongside other female video game characters as one of the top heroines of gaming . 
 Ivy was cited in the book " Disconnected America " as an example of Soulcalibur II 's contrast to titles including Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter in terms of a comparable real @-@ world experience . Play magazine called her one of the " finest females in all of 3D fighting " , adding of the characters in the series she was the one they enjoyed playing as the most . She placed second in IGN 's " Soulcalibur : The Top Ten Fighters " article , which stated " Few , if any , Soul fighters so aptly sum up what the series is about as Ivy Valentine . " IGN also included her in their list of guest characters they would have liked to have seen for Super Smash Bros. Brawl , and in their " Top 50 Chicks Behaving Badly " list , describing her as " a pain in the ass , but she 's got a tight one , so she 's okay by us " . Gamespy named her one of the " 25 Extremely Rough <unk> " in video gaming , praising the brutality of her fighting style and weapon . Tom 's Games named her one of the fifty greatest female characters in video game history , stating that as " an anti @-@ hero who frequently clashes with other Souls , Ivy is a fascinating character for a fighting game " . UGO.com placed her sixteenth on their list of the " Top 50 Evil Women " , noting her role as an antagonist in the first Soulcalibur while adding that it could be " difficult to truly appreciate [ her ] villainy " due to her attractiveness , and adding that her appearance and attitude made her " a feared competitor " . In 2013 , Complex enlisted the 20 best characters from the series , ranking her the seventh best character . 
 Ivy appeared several times in GameDaily 's " Babe of the Week " series of articles , including as a stand @-@ alone article and at eleventh place in their " Top 50 Hottest Game Babes " article . They later named her amongst other female characters in the Soul series as an example of a strong and iconic female character in video gaming .

UGO.com ranked her eighteenth in their " Top 50 Videogame Hotties " article , stating " However much she instills fear in our hearts , we revel in the opportunity to stare at her from the safety of our television sets . " In later articles , they named her one of the top eleven girls of gaming at number ten and one of the top eleven video game heroines at number eight , stating " What can you say about a chick that carries a whip ?

 = = = As a sex symbol = = = 
 Ivy 's appearance and demeanor have been a focus of discussions , with her commonly compared to or described as a dominatrix , and has been noted both as the series ' sexiest female and one of the " most beautiful women in gaming " . She has been displayed in various third @-@ party media , her likeness appearing in material including magazine swimsuit issue pin @-@ ups , periodicals such as Play 's annual " Girls of Gaming " series , and pornographic dōjinshi . Advertisements have also focused on her visual appeal , such as Sega 's television commercial for Soulcalibur 's Dreamcast port . Other media facets have made comparisons between her and Lara Croft in terms of attractiveness , or depicted them as rivals alongside other female characters in a similar context . Other sources have used her as a standard for a character archetype , comparing later created female characters to her design and appearance . Studies on video games have noted Ivy in the subject of games " growing up " , discussing the increasing popularity of " video game babes " and the reactions of men and women towards them . 
 The book Game On : The History and Culture of Videogames cited Ivy as an example of realistic character design affected by " the Japanese ' deformed ' aesthetic and the global influence of cartoon animation " , noting she made characters such as Lara Croft look " positively monastic " by comparison . Race , Gender , Media : Considering Diversity Across Audiences , Content , and Producers used her as an example of most female characters in video games , describing her body and clothing as being created solely for the viewing pleasure of players , often males . Rachael Hutchinson , Assistant Professor of Japanese Studies at the University of Delaware , described her sexualized appearance and behavior as devices used by the developers to emphasize her above @-@ average height compared to other female characters in the title as " deviant " , justifying " social and cultural expectation regarding the female form " in the process . In an article on Kotaku , Gamasutra 's Leigh Alexander used Ivy as a primary example of video game representations of the ideal male and female versus the real world and the concept that " sex sells " , noting the unconscious appeal of such a character to represent oneself as in a game . 
 Reception of the character 's sex appeal has been mostly positive , though with a share of criticism as well as her design evolved through the series . Joystiq bemoaned her appearance in Soulcalibur IV , describing it as an extreme in lieu of games such as Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball and noting that while a full redesign was unnecessary , " At least [ Dead or Alive ] keeps its breasts in context . " MSNBC described her attire as " the pinnacle of preposterous " , noting that while it revolved around her femme fatale design , it appeared physically painful and made little sense to wear into combat . Former GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann described the alterations to her appearance for Soulcalibur IV as unnecessary , stating " boobs are awesome , but there 's a line . Ivy is over this line . " GamesRadar content editor David Houghton described her alongside similar characters as " festering adolescent wank @-@ fantasies " , adding directly regarding Ivy " [ t ] his is not female empowerment " . The subject was later brought up again at the 2011 PAX East convention , in which an all @-@ female journal panel led by The Escapist 's Susan Arendt agreed that while the character was strong and difficult but rewarding to master in the original Soulcalibur , she was reduced to " a nice ass bouncing around the room " in later games . 
 In contrast , British magazine CVG cited her appearance in Soulcalibur IV as appealing , stating " Ivy ... we like because she barely wears anything . Yes , we like videogame girls . " IGN in their " Babes of Soulcalibur " article noted that while her outfit pushed the line even by game standards , they had no actual complaint towards that aspect of the character . Team Xbox emphasized that while her appearance played a factor in her allure , her fighting skills and unique weapon were significant as well , adding that " Ivy never disappoints in a swordfight " . Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as " bastions of dignity " , characters such as Ivy filled an important role in video games too , stating " [ i ] t looks like Ivy ’ s back is set to snap – but she ’ s a game character ; she ’ ll be fine . Why not just enjoy it ? " The Escapist noted that the character 's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect , stating " Ivy 's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident , punishing move set . " UGO.com repeated the sentiment , noting in their " Top 11 Girls of Gaming " article " Soul Calibur 's mega @-@ bombastic whip @-@ wielding hottie isn 't the only babe in the game , or even the best @-@ endowed ... but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts . " In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming , comedian and writer Liana <unk> cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character , noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being " empowered " despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds . She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having " to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone " , and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character : " aggressive , intimidating , combative , and scrabbling through life by sheer will , armed with homemade weapons " . 
 = Rudd Concession = 
 The Rudd Concession , a written concession for exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland , Mashonaland and other adjoining territories , was granted by King Lobengula of Matabeleland to Charles Rudd , James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson , three agents acting on behalf of the South African @-@ based politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes , on 30 October 1888 . Despite Lobengula 's retrospective attempts to disavow it , it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes 's British South Africa Company in October 1889 , and thereafter for the Pioneer Column 's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890 , which marked the beginning of white settlement , administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia , named after Rhodes , in 1895 . 
 Rhodes 's pursuit of the exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland , Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire as part of his personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway — winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company , empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi – Limpopo watershed on Britain 's behalf . He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd 's team from South Africa to obtain the rights . Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund , a bidding rival employed by a London @-@ based syndicate , and long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna ( tribal leaders ) . 
 The concession conferred on the grantees the sole rights to mine throughout Lobengula 's country , as well as the power to defend this exclusivity by force , in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend . Starting in early 1889 , the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms ; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees ' activities had been agreed orally , and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it . He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid , among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle , but these efforts were unsuccessful . 
 After Rhodes and the London consortium agreed to pool their interests , Rhodes travelled to London , arriving in March 1889 . His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the next few months , prompting the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to approve the royal charter , which was formally granted in October 1889 . The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later . Attempting to create a rival for the Rudd Concession , Lobengula granted similar rights to the German businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891 , but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well . Company troops conquered Matabeleland during the First Matabele War of 1893 – 94 , and Lobengula died from smallpox in exile soon after . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the 1810s , the Zulu Kingdom was established in southern Africa by the warrior king Shaka , who united a number of rival clans into a centralised monarchy . Among the Zulu Kingdom 's main leaders and military commanders was Mzilikazi , who enjoyed high royal favour for a time , but ultimately provoked the king 's wrath by repeatedly offending him . When Shaka forced Mzilikazi and his followers to leave the country in 1823 , they moved north @-@ west to the Transvaal , where they became known as the Ndebele or " Matabele " — both names mean " men of the long shields " . Amid the period of war and chaos locally called <unk> ( " the crushing " ) , the Matabele quickly became the region 's dominant tribe . In 1836 , they negotiated a peace treaty with Sir Benjamin d 'Urban , Governor of the British Cape Colony , but the same year Boer Voortrekkers moved to the area , during their Great Trek away from British rule in the Cape . These new arrivals soon toppled Mzilikazi 's domination of the Transvaal , compelling him to lead another migration north in 1838 . Crossing the Limpopo River , the Matabele settled in the Zambezi – Limpopo watershed 's south @-@ west ; this area has since been called Matabeleland . 
 Matabele culture mirrored that of the Zulus in many aspects . The Matabele language , Sindebele , was largely based on Zulu — and just like Zululand , Matabeleland had a strong martial tradition . Matabele men went through a Spartan upbringing , designed to produce disciplined warriors , and military organisation largely dictated the distribution of administrative responsibilities . The <unk> ( king ) appointed a number of izinDuna ( or <unk> ) , who acted as tribal leaders in both military and civilian matters . Like the Zulus , the Matabele referred to a regiment of warriors as an impi . The Mashona people , who had inhabited the north @-@ east of the region for centuries , greatly outnumbered the Matabele , but were weaker militarily , and so to a large degree entered a state of tributary submission to them . Mzilikazi agreed to two treaties with the Transvaal Boers in 1853 , first with Hendrik Potgieter ( who died shortly before negotiations ended ) , then with Andries Pretorius ; the first of these , which did not bear Mzilikazi 's own mark , purported to make Matabeleland a virtual Transvaal protectorate , while the second , which was more properly enacted , comprised a more equal peace agreement . 
 After Mzilikazi died in 1868 , his son Lobengula replaced him in 1870 , following a brief succession struggle . Tall and well built , Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible , even by contemporary Western accounts ; according to the South African big @-@ game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber , who met him in 1875 , he was witty , mentally sharp and authoritative — " every inch a king " . Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo , Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country , adopting Western @-@ style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling , weapons and ammunition . Because of the king 's illiteracy , these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal ; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said , Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed by one of the whites , then later translated back by another . Once the king was satisfied of the written translation 's veracity , he would sign his mark , affix the royal seal ( which depicted an elephant ) , and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men , at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation . 
 For unclear reasons , Lobengula 's attitude towards foreigners reversed sharply during the late 1870s . He discarded his Western clothes in favour of more traditional animal @-@ skin garments , stopped supporting trading enterprises , and began to restrict the movement of whites into and around his country . However , the whites kept coming , particularly after the discovery in 1886 of gold deposits in the South African Republic ( or Transvaal ) , which prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg . After rumours spread among the Witwatersrand ( or Rand ) prospectors of even richer tracts , " a second Rand " , north of the Limpopo , the miners began to trek north to seek concessions from Lobengula that would allow them to search for gold in Matabeleland and Mashonaland . These efforts were mostly in vain . Apart from the Tati Concession , which covered a small strip of land on the border with the Bechuanaland Protectorate where miners had operated since 1868 , mining operations in the watershed remained few and far between . 
 The foremost business and political figure in southern Africa at this time was Cecil Rhodes , a vicar 's son who had arrived from England in 1870 , aged 17 . Since entering the diamond trade at Kimberley in 1871 , Rhodes had gained near @-@ complete domination of the world diamond market with the help of Charles Rudd , Alfred Beit and other business associates , as well as the generous financial backing of Nathan Mayer Rothschild . Rhodes was also a member of the Cape Parliament , having been elected in 1881 . Amid the European Scramble for Africa , he envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of territories that would connect the Cape , at Africa 's southern tip , with Cairo , the Egyptian city at the northern end of the continent , and allow for the construction of a railway linking the two . This ambition was directly challenged in the south by the presence of the Boer republics and , just to the north of them , Lobengula 's domains . The fact that the Zambezi – Limpopo region did not fall into any of the " spheres of influence " defined at the 1884 – 85 Berlin Conference further complicated matters ; the Transvaalers , Germans and Portuguese were all also showing interest in the area , much to the annoyance of both Lobengula and Rhodes . 
 = = Prelude : the Moffat treaty = = 
 Rhodes began advocating the annexation by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure to a number of senior colonial officials , most prominently the High Commissioner for Southern Africa , Sir Hercules Robinson , and Sidney Shippard , Britain 's administrator in the Bechuanaland Crown colony ( comprising that country 's southern part ) . Shippard , an old friend of Rhodes , was soon won over to the idea , and in May 1887 the administrator wrote to Robinson strongly endorsing annexation of the territories , particularly Mashonaland , which he described as " beyond comparison the most valuable country south of the Zambezi " . It was the Boers , however , who were first to achieve diplomatic successes with Lobengula . Pieter Grobler secured a treaty of " renewal of friendship " between Matabeleland and the South African Republic in July 1887 . The same month , Robinson organised the appointment of John Smith Moffat , a locally born missionary , as assistant commissioner in Bechuanaland . Moffat , well @-@ known to Lobengula , was given this position in the hope that he might make the king less cordial with the Boers and more pro @-@ British . 
 In September 1887 , Robinson wrote to Lobengula , through Moffat , urging the king not to grant concessions of any kind to Transvaal , German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary . Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there . Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly , it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July ; in the uncertainty , newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic . Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo . Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula 's country , while the king said that an agreement did exist , but that it was a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more . 
 In Pretoria , in early December , another British agent met Paul Kruger , the President of the South African Republic , who reportedly said that his government now regarded Matabeleland as under Transvaal " protection and sovereignty " , and that one of the clauses of the Grobler treaty had been that Lobengula could not " grant any concessions or make any contact with anybody whatsoever " without Pretoria 's approval . Meeting at Grahamstown on Christmas Day , Rhodes , Shippard and Robinson agreed to instruct Moffat to investigate the matter with Lobengula and to secure a copy of the Grobler treaty for further clarification , as well as to arrange a formal Anglo @-@ Matabele treaty , which would have provisions included to prevent Lobengula from making any more agreements with foreign powers other than Britain . 
 Lobengula was alarmed by how some were perceiving his dealings with Grobler , and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners . Despite his familiarity with Moffat , the king did not consider him above suspicion , and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp ; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general , " they may like us better , but they fear the Boers more " . Moffat 's negotiations with the king and izinDuna were therefore very long and uneasy . The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d 'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836 . He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them , that Pretoria 's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own , and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case . On 11 February 1888 , Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal at the foot of the agreement . The document proclaimed that the Matabele and British were now at peace , that Lobengula would not enter any kind of diplomatic correspondence with any country apart from Britain , and that the king would not " sell , alienate or cede " any part of Matabeleland or Mashonaland to anybody . 
 The document was unilateral in form , describing only what Lobengula would do to prevent any of these conditions being broken . Shippard was dubious about this and the fact that none of the izinDuna had signed the proclamation , and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty . Robinson replied in the negative , reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so soon would only make him suspicious . Britain 's ministers at Whitehall perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain , as it did not commit Her Majesty 's Government to any particular course of action . Lord Salisbury , the British Prime Minister , ruled that Moffat 's treaty trumped Grobler 's , despite being signed at a later date , because the London Convention of 1884 precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the Orange Free State ; treaties with " native tribes " north of the Limpopo were permitted , but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe , and should instead be considered a nation . He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was ultra vires and legally meaningless . Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement , which was announced to the public in Cape Town on 25 April 1888 . 
 For Rhodes , the agreement Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time that allowed him to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests . A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi , but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion . In March 1888 , Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor , the circus showman turned diamond millionaire Barney Barnato , to form De Beers Consolidated Mines , a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90 % of world diamond production . Barnato wanted to limit De Beers to mining diamonds , but Rhodes insisted that he was going to use the company to " win the north " : to this end , he ensured that the De Beers trust deed enabled activities far removed from mining , including banking and railway @-@ building , the ability to annex and govern land , and the raising of armed forces . All this gave the immensely wealthy company powers not unlike those of the East India Company , which had governed India on Britain 's behalf from 1757 to 1857 . Through De Beers and Gold Fields of South Africa , the gold @-@ mining firm he had recently started with Charles Rudd , Rhodes had both the capacity and the financial means to make his dream of an African empire a reality , but to make such ambitions practicable , he would first have to acquire a royal charter empowering him to take personal control of the relevant territories on Britain 's behalf . To secure this royal charter , he would need to present Whitehall with a concession , signed by a native ruler , granting to Rhodes the exclusive mining rights in the lands he hoped to annex . 
 = = Concession = = 
 = = = Race to Bulawayo = = = 
 Rhodes faced competition for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford , two London financiers . They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund , who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885 , towards the end of this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy . Cawston and Gifford 's base in England gave them the advantage of being better connected with Whitehall , while Rhodes 's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes . He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators . In May 1888 , Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford , the British Colonial Secretary , seeking his approval for their designs . 
 The urgency of negotiating a concession was made clear to Rhodes during a visit to London in June 1888 , when he learned of the London syndicate 's letter to Knutsford , and of their appointment of Maund . Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly . " Someone has to get the country , and I think we should have the best chance , " Rhodes told Rothschild ; " I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king . He is the only block to central Africa , as , once we have his territory , the rest is easy ... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen ... I have faith in the country , and Africa is on the move . I think it is a second Cinderella . " 
 Rhodes and Beit put Rudd at the head of their new negotiating team because of his extensive experience negotiating the purchase of Boers ' farms for gold prospecting . Because Rudd knew little of indigenous African customs and languages , Rhodes added Francis " Matabele " Thompson , an employee of his who had for years run the reserves and compounds that housed the black labourers at the diamond fields . Thompson was fluent in Setswana , the language of the Tswana people to Lobengula 's south @-@ west , and therefore could communicate directly and articulately with the king , who also knew the language . James Rochfort Maguire , an Irish barrister whom Rhodes had known at Oxford , was recruited as a third member . 
 Many analysts find the inclusion of the cultured , metropolitan Maguire puzzling — it is often suggested that he was brought along so he could couch the document in the elaborate legal language of the English bar , and thus make it unchallengeable , but as the historian John Galbraith comments , the kind of agreement that was required was hardly complicated enough to merit the considerable expense and inconvenience of bringing Maguire along . In his biography of Rhodes , Robert I Rotberg suggests that he may have intended Maguire to lend Rudd 's expedition " a touch of culture and class " , in the hope that this might impress Lobengula and rival would @-@ be concessionaires . One of the advantages held by the London syndicate was the societal prestige of Gifford in particular , and Rhodes hoped to counter this through Maguire . Rudd 's party ultimately comprised himself , Thompson , Maguire , J G Dreyer ( their Dutch wagon driver ) , a fifth white man , a Cape Coloured , an African American and two black servants . 
 Maund arrived in Cape Town in late June 1888 and attempted to gain Robinson 's approval for the Cawston – Gifford bid . Robinson was reserved in his answers , saying that he supported the development of Matabeleland by a company with this kind of backing , but did not feel he could commit to endorsing Cawston and Gifford exclusively while there remained other potential concessionaires , most prominently Rhodes — certainly not without unequivocal instructions from Whitehall . While Rudd 's party gathered and prepared in Kimberley , Maund travelled north , and reached the diamond mines at the start of July . On 14 July , in Bulawayo , agents representing a consortium headed by the South African @-@ based entrepreneur Thomas Leask received a mining concession from Lobengula , covering all of his country , and pledging half of the proceeds to the king . When he learned of this latter condition Leask was distraught , saying the concession was " commercially valueless " . Moffat pointed out to Leask that his group did not have the resources to act on the concession anyway , and that both Rhodes and the London syndicate did ; at Moffat 's suggestion , Leask decided to wait and sell his concession to whichever big business group gained a new agreement from Lobengula . Neither Rhodes 's group , the Cawston – Gifford consortium nor the British colonial officials immediately learned of the Leask concession . 
 In early July 1888 , Rhodes returned from London and met with Robinson , proposing the establishment of a chartered company to govern and develop south @-@ central Africa , with himself at its head , and similar powers to the British North Borneo , Imperial British East Africa and Royal Niger Companies . Rhodes said that this company would take control of those parts of Matabeleland and Mashonaland " not in use " by the local people , demarcate reserved areas for the indigenous population , and thereafter defend both , while developing the lands not reserved for natives . In this way , he concluded , Matabele and Mashona interests would be protected , and south @-@ central Africa would be developed , all without a penny from Her Majesty 's Treasury . Robinson wrote to Knutsford on 21 July that he thought Whitehall should back this idea ; he surmised that the Boers would receive British expansion into the Zambezi – Limpopo watershed better if it came in the form of a chartered company than if it occurred with the creation of a new Crown colony . He furthermore wrote a letter for Rudd 's party to carry to Bulawayo , recommending Rudd and his companions to Lobengula . 
 Maund left Kimberley in July , well ahead of the Rudd party . Rudd 's negotiating team , armed with Robinson 's endorsement , was still far from ready — they left Kimberley only on 15 August — but Moffat , travelling from <unk> in Bechuanaland , was ahead of both expeditions . He reached Bulawayo in late August to find the kraal filled with white concession @-@ hunters . The various bidders attempted to woo the king with a series of gifts and favours , but won little to show for it . 
 Between Kimberley and Mafeking , Maund learned from Shippard that Grobler had been killed by a group of Ngwato warriors while returning to the Transvaal , and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British @-@ protected Ngwato chief , Khama III , in response . Maund volunteered to help defend Khama , writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed . Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay , but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required , and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd . After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati , barring entry to white big @-@ game hunters and concession @-@ seekers , the Rudd party arrived at the king 's kraal on 21 September 1888 , three weeks ahead of Maund . 
 = = = Negotiations = = = 
 Rudd , Thompson and Maguire immediately went to present themselves to Lobengula , who came out from his private quarters without hesitation and politely greeted the visitors . Through a Sindebele interpreter , Rudd introduced himself and the others , explained on whose behalf they acted , said they had come for an amiable sojourn , and presented the king with a gift of £ 100 . 
 After the subject of business was eschewed for a few days , Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about . He said that his backers , unlike the Transvaalers , were not seeking land , but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi – Limpopo watershed . During the following weeks , talks took place sporadically . Moffat , who had remained in Bulawayo , was occasionally called upon by the king for advice , prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd 's team through his counsel . He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns , telling him that this would make the issue easier for him to manage . He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October , and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over . 
 Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold @-@ Adams and 16 policemen , Shippard arrived in mid @-@ October 1888 . The king suspended concession negotiations in favour of meetings with him . The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long ; he also championed Rudd 's cause , telling Lobengula that Rudd 's team acted on behalf of a powerful , financially formidable organisation supported by Queen Victoria . Meanwhile , Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd , warning him that Maund was his main rival , and that because the London syndicate 's goals overlapped so closely with their own , it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp . Regarding Lobengula , Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him . " Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [ Henry Morton ] Stanley put on the Upper Congo ... Stick to Home Rule and Matabeleland for the Matabele [ , ] I am sure it is the ticket . " 
 As October passed without major headway , Rudd grew anxious to return to the <unk> gold mines , but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession . " You must not leave a vacuum , " Rhodes instructed . " Leave Thompson and Maguire if necessary or wait until I can join ... if we get anything we must always have someone resident " . Thus prevented from leaving , Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession , but was repeatedly rebuffed . The king only agreed to look at the draft document , mostly written by Rudd , just before Shippard was due to leave in late October . At this meeting , Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour . Charles Helm , a missionary based in the vicinity , was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter . According to Helm , Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document , including " that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country , that they would not dig anywhere near towns , etc . , and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people . " 
 After these talks with Rudd , Lobengula called an indaba ( conference ) of over 100 izinDuna to present the proposed concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies . It soon became clear that opinion was split : most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever , while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd 's bid . The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd 's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways , as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small @-@ time prospectors , but there was also a case for allowing competition to continue , so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula 's favour . 
 For many at the indaba , the most pressing motivator was Matabeleland 's security . While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British , he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage , and while the Boers wanted land , Rudd 's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading . Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd 's proposals , he would keep his land , and the British would be obliged to protect him from incursions by the Boers . 
 Rudd was offering generous terms that few competitors could hope to even come close to . If Lobengula agreed , Rudd 's backers would furnish the king with 1 @,@ 000 Martini – Henry breech @-@ loading rifles , 100 @,@ 000 rounds of matching ammunition , a steamboat on the Zambezi ( or , if Lobengula preferred , a lump sum of £ 500 ) , and £ 100 a month in perpetuity . More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons : he had at the time between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines , but almost no ammunition for them . The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets , which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic . The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own <unk> . Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times , in great detail , to ensure that he properly understood what was written . None of Rudd 's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document , making them legally unenforceable ( presuming they indeed existed ) , but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless . 
 The final round of negotiations started at the royal kraal on the morning of 30 October . The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd 's party ; the king himself did not attend , but was nearby . The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine , to which they replied that they wanted rights covering " the whole country " . When the izinDuna demurred , Thompson insisted , " No , we must have Mashonaland , and right up to the Zambezi as well — in fact , the whole country " . According to Thompson 's account , this provoked confusion among the izinDuna , who did not seem to know where these places were . " The Zambezi must be there " , said one , incorrectly pointing south ( rather than north ) . The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through " procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance " , in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel @-@ Jones , until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave . The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue , which they did . It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day 's progress to the king . 
 = = = Agreement = = = 
 After speaking with Lotshe and Thompson , the king was still hesitant to make a decision . Thompson appealed to Lobengula with a rhetorical question : " Who gives a man an assegai [ spear ] if he expects to be attacked by him afterwards ? " Seeing the allusion to the offered Martini – Henry rifles , Lobengula was swayed by this logic , and made up his mind to grant the concession . " Bring me the fly @-@ blown paper and I will sign it , " he said . Thompson briefly left the room to call Rudd , Maguire , Helm and Dreyer in , and they sat in a semi @-@ circle around the king . Lobengula then put his mark to the concession , which read : 
 Know all men by these presents , that whereas Charles <unk> Rudd , of Kimberley ; Rochfort Maguire , of London ; and Francis Robert Thompson , of Kimberley , hereinafter called the grantees , have covenanted and agreed , and do hereby covenant and agree , to pay to me , my heirs and successors , the sum of one hundred pounds sterling , British currency , on the first day of every lunar month ; and further , to deliver at my royal kraal one thousand Martini – Henry breech @-@ loading rifles , together with one hundred thousand rounds of suitable ball cartridge , five hundred of the said rifles and fifty thousand of the said cartridges to be ordered from England forthwith and delivered with reasonable despatch , and the remainder of the said rifles and cartridges to be delivered as soon as the said grantees shall have commenced to work mining machinery within my territory ; and further , to deliver on the Zambesi River a steamboat with guns suitable for defensive purposes upon the said river , or in lieu of the said steamboat , should I so elect , to pay to me the sum of five hundred pounds sterling , British currency . On the execution of these presents , I , Lobengula , King of Matabeleland , Mashonaland , and other adjoining territories , in exercise of my sovereign powers , and in the presence and with the consent of my council of <unk> , do hereby grant and assign unto the said grantees , their heirs , representatives , and assigns , jointly and <unk> , the complete and exclusive charge over all metals and minerals situated and contained in my kingdoms , principalities , and dominions , together with full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure the same , and to hold , collect , and enjoy the profits and revenues , if any , derivable from the said metals and minerals , subject to the aforesaid payment ; and whereas I have been much molested of late by divers persons seeking and desiring to obtain grants and concessions of land and mining rights in my territories , I do hereby authorise the said grantees , their heirs , representatives and assigns , to take all necessary and lawful steps to exclude from my kingdom , principalities , and dominions all persons seeking land , metals , minerals , or mining rights therein , and I do hereby undertake to render them all such needful assistance as they may from time to time require for the exclusion of such persons , and to grant no concessions of land or mining rights from and after this date without their consent and concurrence ; provided that , if at any time the said monthly payment of one hundred pounds shall be in <unk> for a period of three months , then this grant shall cease and determine from the date of the last @-@ made payment ; and further provided that nothing contained in these presents shall extend to or affect a grant made by me of certain mining rights in a portion of my territory south of the <unk> River , which grant is commonly known as the Tati Concession . 
 As Lobengula inscribed his mark at the foot of the paper , Maguire turned to Thompson and said " Thompson , this is the epoch of our lives . " Once Rudd , Maguire and Thompson had signed the concession , Helm and Dreyer added their signatures as witnesses , and Helm wrote an endorsement beside the terms : 
 Lobengula refused to allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document . Exactly why he did this is not clear . Rudd 's interpretation was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day 's indaba , and so did not think it necessary for them to also sign . Keppel @-@ Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own .

 = = = Announcement and reception = = = 
 Within hours , Rudd and Dreyer were hurrying south to present the document to Rhodes , travelling by mule cart , the fastest mode of transport available . Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges . Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888 , a mere 20 days after the document 's signing , and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would surely not be broken until the railway was laid into the interior . Rhodes was elated by Rudd 's results , describing the concession as " so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia " . Both in high spirits , the pair travelled to Cape Town by train , and presented themselves to Robinson on 21 November . 
 Robinson was pleased to learn of Rudd 's success . The High Commissioner wanted to gazette the concession immediately , but Rhodes knew that the promise to arm Lobengula with 1 @,@ 000 Martini – Henrys would be received with apprehension elsewhere in South Africa , especially among Boers ; he suggested that this aspect of the concession should be kept quiet until the guns were already in Bechuanaland . Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini – Henrys , which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson , and published in the Cape Times and Cape Argus newspapers on 24 November 1888 . The altered version described the agreed price for the Zambezi – Limpopo mining monopoly as " the valuable consideration of a large monthly payment in cash , a gunboat for defensive purposes on the Zambesi , and other services . " Two days later , the Cape Times printed a notice from Lobengula : 
 But the king was already beginning to receive reports telling him that he had been hoodwinked into " selling his country " . Word abounded in Bulawayo that with the Rudd Concession ( as the document became called ) , Lobengula had signed away far more impressive rights than he had thought . Some of the Matabele began to question the king 's judgement . While the izinDuna looked on anxiously , Moffat questioned whether Lobengula would be able to keep control . Thompson was summoned by the izinDuna and interrogated for over 10 hours before being released ; according to Thompson , they were " prepared to suspect even the king himself " . Rumours spread among the kraal 's white residents of a freebooter force in the South African Republic that allegedly intended to invade and support <unk> , a prominent inDuna , in overthrowing and killing Lobengula . Horrified by these developments , Lobengula attempted to secure his position by deflecting blame . <unk> Lotshe , who had supported granting the concession , was condemned for having misled his king and executed , along with his extended family and followers — over 300 men , women and children in all . Meanwhile , Rhodes and Rudd returned to Kimberley , and Robinson wrote to the Colonial Office at Whitehall on 5 December 1888 to inform them of Rudd 's concession . 
 = = = Lobengula 's embassy = = = 
 While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he was only repudiating the idea that he had given his country away , and not the concession itself ( which he told them would be respected ) , Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna , Babayane and Mshete , to England , so they could meet Queen Victoria herself , officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland , but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo . The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen , whose name the British swore by , really existed . The king 's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo . Maund , who saw a second chance to secure his own concession , perhaps even at Rudd 's expense , said he was more than happy to assist , but Lobengula remained cautious with him : when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the <unk> valley , the king replied " Take my men to England for me ; and when you return , then I will talk about that . " Johannes Colenbrander , a frontiersman from Natal , was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter . They left in mid @-@ December 1888 . 
 Around this time , a group of Austral Africa Company prospectors , led by Alfred Haggard , approached Lobengula 's south @-@ western border , hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession ; on learning of this , the king honoured one of the terms of the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go at the head of a Matabele impi to turn Haggard away . While Robinson 's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea , the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford . Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1 @,@ 000 Martini – Henrys : " If rifles part of consideration , as reported , do you think there will be danger of complications arising from this ? " Robinson replied , again in writing ; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about , and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with assegais , so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous . He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula , and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference . 
 Surprised by the news of a Matabele mission to London , Rhodes attempted to publicly downplay the credentials of the izinDuna and to stop them from leaving Africa . When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend , associate and housemate Dr Leander Starr Jameson — who himself held the rank of inDuna , having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment — to invite Maund to their cottage . Maund was suspicious , but came anyway . At the cottage , Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate . Maund refused , prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town . The izinDuna reached Cape Town in mid @-@ January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said ; to delay their departure , Robinson discredited them , Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London , saying that Shippard had described Maund as " mendacious " and " dangerous " , Colenbrander as " hopelessly unreliable " , and Babayane and Mshete as not actually izinDuna or even headmen . Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was pointless to try to go on while Robinson continued in this vein . 
 = = = Rhodes and the London syndicate join forces = = = 
 Rhodes then arrived in Cape Town to talk again with Maund . His mood was markedly different : after looking over Lobengula 's message to Queen Victoria , he said that he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him . He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers . Maund presumed that Rhodes 's shift in attitude had come about because of his own influence , coupled with the threat to Rhodes 's concession posed by the Matabele mission , but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford , who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south @-@ central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes . They had wired Rhodes , who had in turn come back to Maund . The unification , which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long @-@ standing stalemate , was happily received by both sides ; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes 's considerable financial and political resources , and Rhodes 's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it . 
 There still remained the question of Leask 's concession , the existence of which Rudd 's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo towards the end of October . Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired : " I quite see that worthless as [ Leask 's ] concession is , it logically destroys yours , " he told Rudd . This loose end was tied up in late January 1889 , when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates , James Fairbairn and George Phillips , in Johannesburg . Leask was given £ 2 @,@ 000 in cash and a 10 % interest in the Rudd Concession , and allowed to retain a 10 % share in his own agreement with Lobengula . Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of £ 300 each . In Cape Town , with Rhodes 's opposition removed , Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission , cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all , so they should be allowed to board ship for England . 
 = = = Lobengula 's enquiry = = = 
 Meanwhile , in Bulawayo , South African newspaper reports of the concession started to arrive in the middle of January 1889 . William Tainton , one of the local white residents , translated a press cutting for Lobengula , adding a few embellishments of his own : he told the king that he had sold his country , that the grantees could dig for minerals anywhere they liked , including in and around kraals , and that they could bring an army into Matabeleland to depose Lobengula in favour of a new chief . The king told Helm to read back and translate the copy of the concession that had remained in Bulawayo ; Helm did so , and pointed out that none of the allegations Tainton had made were actually reflected in the text . Lobengula then said he wished to dictate an announcement . After Helm refused , Tainton translated and transcribed the king 's words : 
 This notice was published in the Bechuanaland News and <unk> Chronicle on 2 February 1889 . A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened , but because Helm and Thompson were not present , the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March . As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October , Lobengula did not himself attend , remaining close by but not interfering . The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length , and various white men gave their opinions on the concession . A group of missionaries acted as mediators . Condemnation of the concession was led not by the izinDuna , but by the other whites , particularly Tainton . 
 Tainton and the other white opponents of the concession contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed 's minerals , lands , wood and water , and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country . Thompson , backed by the missionaries , insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals , and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession 's granting of " full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure " the mining yield . William <unk> , a <unk> from the Cape , who had been to the diamond fields at Kimberley , pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined , and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it : " You say you do not want any land , how can you dig for gold without it , is it not in the land ? " Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine ; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country . 
 Helm was painted as a suspicious figure by some of the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king . This feeling was compounded by the fact that Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula 's postmaster , and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo . He was accused of having hidden the concession 's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle , but neither of these charges could be proven either way . On the fourth day of the enquiry , Elliot and Rees , two missionaries based at Inyati , were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums , as Helm was claiming ; they replied in the negative . The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying . Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions , but had little success . 
 Amid the enquiry , Thompson and Maguire received a number of threats and had to tolerate other more minor <unk> . Maguire , unaccustomed to the African bush as he was , brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits . One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it ; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring . They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena . 
 Rhodes sent the first shipments of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889 , sending 250 each month , and instructed Jameson , Dr Frederick <unk> Harris and a <unk> trader , George Musson , to convey them to Bulawayo . Lobengula had so far accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession ( and continued to do so for years afterwards ) , but when the guns arrived in early April , he refused to take them . Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire 's camp , stayed at the kraal for ten days , and then went back south with Maguire in tow , leaving the rifles behind . A few weeks later , Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen — he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document . 
 = = = Babayane and Mshete in England = = = 
 Following their long delay , Babayane , Mshete , Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor . They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889 , and travelled by train to London , where they checked into the Berners Hotel on Oxford Street . They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital . The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter — Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject — but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him ; the Colonial Secretary said that it would be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality . The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula , as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on . 
 The izinDuna stayed in London throughout the month of March , attending a number of dinners in their honour , including one hosted by the Aborigines ' Protection Society . The Society sent a letter to Lobengula , advising him to be " wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good to you and your people " . The diplomats saw many of the British capital 's sights , including London Zoo , the Alhambra Theatre and the Bank of England . Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king Cetshwayo , which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle , and took them to Aldershot to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major @-@ General Evelyn Wood , the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in 1879 . Knutsford held two more meetings with the izinDuna , and during the second of these gave them the Queen 's reply to Lobengula 's letter , which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill . Satisfied with this , the emissaries sailed for home . 
 = = = Rhodes wins the royal charter = = = 
 In late March 1889 , just as the izinDuna were about to leave London , Rhodes arrived to make the amalgamation with Cawston and Gifford official . To the <unk> ' dismay , the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession from a number of London businessmen and humanitarian societies , and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature , as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension . Rhodes was originally angry with Maund , accusing him of responsibility for this , but eventually accepted that it was not Maund 's fault . Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo , to pose as an impartial adviser , and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession ; as an added contingency , he told Maund to secure as many new <unk> as he could . 
 In London , as the amalgamation was formalised , Rhodes and Cawston sought public members to sit on the board of their prospective chartered company . They recruited the Duke of Abercorn , an affluent Irish peer and landowner with estates in Donegal and Scotland , to chair the firm , and the Earl of Fife — soon to become the Duke of Fife , following his marriage to the daughter of the Prince of Wales — to act as his deputy . The third and final public member added to the board was the nephew and heir apparent of the erstwhile Cabinet minister Earl Grey , Albert Grey , who was a staunch imperialist , already associated with southern Africa . Attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Salisbury , Rhodes then gave the position of standing counsel in the proposed company to the Prime Minister 's son , Lord Robert Cecil . Horace Farquhar , a prominent London financier and friend of the Prince of Wales , was added to the board at Fife 's suggestion later in the year . 
 Rhodes spent the next few months in London , seeking out supporters for his cause in the West End , the City and , occasionally , the rural estates of the landed gentry . These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist Harry Johnston , Alexander Livingstone Bruce ( who sat on the board of the East Africa Company ) , and Lord Balfour of Burleigh , among others . Along with Grey 's active involvement and Lord Salisbury 's continuing favour , the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889 . The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete , and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession 's validity . Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced , and , with the help of Rhodes 's press contacts , prominently William Thomas Stead , editor of the Pall Mall Gazette , opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south @-@ central Africa . But in June 1889 , just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter , Lobengula 's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession , written two months previously , arrived in London . 
 Maguire , in London , promptly wrote to the Colonial Office , casting doubt on the letter 's character on the grounds that it lacked the witnessing signature of an unbiased missionary . He concurrently wrote to Thompson , who was still in Bulawayo , to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter 's drafting . Around the same time , Robinson 's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with Sir Henry Brougham Loch . Rhodes claimed not to be worried , telling Shippard in a letter that " the policy will not be altered " . Indeed , by the end of June 1889 , despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula 's letter rejecting the concession , Rhodes had got his way : Lord Salisbury 's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa , coupled with Rhodes 's personal exertions in London , prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter . Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889 , while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company 's establishment . 
 " My part is done , " Rhodes wrote to Maund , soon after reaching Cape Town ; " the charter is granted supporting Rudd Concession and granting us the interior ... We have the whole thing recognised by the Queen and even if eventually we had any difficulty with king [ Lobengula ] the Home people would now always recognise us in possession of the minerals [ ; ] they quite understand that savage potentates frequently repudiate . " A few weeks later , he wrote to Maund again : with the royal charter in place , " whatever [ Lobengula ] does now will not affect the fact that when there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country " . On 29 October 1889 , nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession , Rhodes 's chartered company , the British South Africa Company , was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria . The concession 's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and , by extension , the British Crown , making it practically unassailable . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Occupation of Mashonaland = = = 
 Babayane and Mshete had arrived back in Bulawayo in August , accompanied by Maund , and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall , reaffirming that " If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country , it is not so . " But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October , too late to make a difference . Meanwhile , the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo , as Lobengula had requested ; much to the king 's indignation , it was Moffat . Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that he would just have to accept it . Lobengula rued the situation to Helm : " Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly ? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time , then he advances very slowly and gently , first putting forward one leg and then another . At last , when well within reach , he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears . England is the chameleon and I am that fly . " 
 The charter incorporating the British South Africa Company committed it to remaining " British in character and domicile " , and defined its area of operations extremely vaguely , mentioning only that it was empowered to operate north of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal , and west of Mozambique . Northern and western bounds were not indicated . This was done deliberately to allow Rhodes to acquire as much land as he could without interference . The Company was made responsible for the safeguarding of peace and law in its territory , and licensed to do so " in such ways and manners as it shall consider necessary " . It was vested with the power to raise its own police force , and charged with , among other things , abolishing slavery in all of its territories and restricting the sale of liquor to indigenous Africans . Local traditions were to be respected . The Company 's charter was otherwise made extremely equivocal with the intention that this would allow it to operate freely and independently , and to govern and develop its acquired territories while also turning a profit . 
 Rhodes capitalised the Company at £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , split into £ 1 shares , and used his other business interests to pump capital into it . Rhodes 's diamond concern , De Beers , invested more than £ 200 @,@ 000 , while his gold firm , Gold Fields , put in nearly £ 100 @,@ 000 . He himself put in £ 45 @,@ 000 , along with another £ 11 @,@ 000 jointly with Beit . Overall , about half of the Chartered Company 's capital was held by its main actors , particularly Rhodes , Beit , Rudd and their confederates . During the Company 's early days , Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions over the coming years through what Robert Blake describes as a " <unk> <unk> ... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes 's least creditable actions " . Contrary to what Whitehall and the public had been allowed to think , the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company , but in a short @-@ lived ancillary concern of Rhodes , Rudd and others called the Central Search Association , which was quietly formed in London in 1889 . This entity renamed itself the United Concessions Company in 1890 , and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 shares . When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891 , they advised Knutsford to consider revoking the concession , but no action was taken . 
 Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890 on the back of widespread support among Cape Afrikaners . He announced that his first objective as premier was the occupation of the Zambezi – Limpopo watershed . His Chartered Company had by this time raised the Pioneer Column , a few hundred volunteers referred to as " pioneers " whose lot was to both occupy Mashonaland and begin its development . To this end its ranks were filled with men from all corners of southern African society , including , at Rhodes 's insistence , several sons of the Cape 's leading families . Each pioneer was promised 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 km2 ) of land and 15 mining claims in return for his service . 
 Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the expedition at the behest of his friend Jameson , much to the fury of many of the izinDuna , who saw the column 's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory . Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter Frederick Courteney Selous , and escorted by 500 British South Africa Company 's Police under Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Edward Pennefather , the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula 's heartlands , heading north @-@ east from Bechuanaland and then north , and founded Fort Tuli , Fort Victoria and Fort Charter along the way . They stopped at the site of the future capital , Fort Salisbury ( named after the Prime Minister ) , on 12 September 1890 , and ceremonially raised the Union Jack the next morning . 
 The administration of Mashonaland did not immediately prove profitable for the Company or its investors , partly because of the costly police force , which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money . There also existed the problem of land ownership ; Britain recognised the Company 's subsoil rights in Mashonaland , but not its possession of the land itself , and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers . 
 = = = Lippert concession = = = 
 Edward Renny @-@ Tailyour , representing the Hamburg businessman Eduard Lippert — an estranged cousin of Beit — had been attempting to gain a concession from Lobengula since early 1888 . Rhodes saw Lippert 's activities as unwelcome meddling and so repeatedly tried ( and failed ) to settle with him . In April 1891 , Renny @-@ Tailyour grandly announced that he and Lobengula had made an agreement : in return for £ 1 @,@ 000 up front and £ 500 annually , the king would bestow on Lippert the exclusive rights to manage lands , establish banks , mint money , and conduct trade in the territory of the Chartered Company . The authenticity of this document was disputed , largely because the only witnesses to have signed it , apart from inDuna Mshete , were Renny @-@ Tailyour 's associates , one of whom soon attested that Lobengula had believed himself to be granting a concession to Theophilus Shepstone 's son , " <unk> " Shepstone , with Lippert merely acting as an agent . The Lippert concession therefore had a number of potential defects , but Lippert was still confident he could extract a princely fee for it from the Chartered Company ; he named his price as £ 250 @,@ 000 in cash or shares at par . 
 Rhodes , backed by Loch , initially condemned the Lippert concession as a fraud and branded Lippert 's locally based agents enemies of the peace . Loch assured Rhodes that if Lippert tried to gazette his agreement , he would issue a proclamation warning of its infringement on the Rudd Concession and the Company 's charter , and threaten Lippert 's associates with legal action . The Colonial Office agreed with Loch . Rhodes initially said that he would not pay Lippert 's price , which he described as blackmail , but after conferring with Beit decided that refusing to buy out Lippert might lead to drawn @-@ out and similarly expensive court proceedings , which they could not be sure of winning . Rhodes told Beit to start bargaining . Lippert 's agreement turned out to be an unexpected blessing for Rhodes in that it included a concession on land rights from Lobengula , which the Chartered Company itself lacked , and needed if it were to be recognised by Whitehall as legally owning the occupied territory in Mashonaland . After two months and a number of breakdowns in talks , Rudd took over the negotiations . He and Lippert agreed on 12 September 1891 that the Company would take over the concession from Lippert on the condition that he returned to Bulawayo and had it more properly formalised by Lobengula ; in return the Company would grant the German 75 square miles ( 190 km2 ) of his choice in Matabeleland ( with full land and mineral rights ) , 30 @,@ 000 shares in the Chartered Company and other financial incentives . 
 The success of this plan hinged on Lobengula continuing to believe that Lippert was acting against Rhodes rather than on his behalf . The religious Moffat was deeply troubled by what he called the " palpable immorality " of this deceit , but agreed not to interfere , deciding that Lobengula was just as untrustworthy as Lippert . With Moffat looking on as a witness , Lippert delivered his side of the deal in November 1891 , extracting from the Matabele king the exclusive land rights for a century in the Chartered Company 's operative territories , including permission to lay out farms and towns and to levy rents , in place of what had been agreed in April . As arranged , Lippert sold these rights to the Company , whereupon Loch approved the concession , expressing contentment at the solving of the Company 's land rights problem ; in an internal Whitehall memorandum , the Colonial Office <unk> remarked how expediently that administrative obstacle had been removed . The Matabele remained unaware of this subterfuge until May 1892 . 
 = = = Conquest of Matabeleland : the end of Lobengula = = = 
 Lobengula 's weakened Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes 's Company settlements in Mashonaland and north of the Zambezi for about another year . The king was angered by the lack of respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority , their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the <unk> and <unk> Rivers , and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele <unk> . After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893 , Jameson , whom Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland , unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an indaba . Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had " come not only to dig the gold but to rob me of my people and country as well " . Monitoring events from Cape Town , Rhodes gauged Jameson 's readiness for war by telegraph : " Read Luke 14 : 31 " . Jameson wired back : " All right . Have read Luke 14 : 31 " . 
 On 13 August 1893 , Lobengula refused to accept the stipend due him under the terms of the Rudd Concession , saying " it is the price of my blood " . The next day , Jameson signed a secret agreement with local settlers at Fort Victoria , promising each man 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 km2 ) of farm land , 20 gold claims and a share of Lobengula 's cattle in return for service in a war against Matabeleland . Lobengula wrote again to Queen Victoria , and tried to send Mshete to England again at the head of another embassy , but Loch detained the izinDuna at Cape Town for a few days , then sent them home . Following a few minor skirmishes , the First Matabele War started in earnest in October : Company troops moved on Lobengula , using the inexorable firepower of their Maxim machine guns to crush attacks by the far larger Matabele army . On 3 November , with the whites nearing Bulawayo , Lobengula torched the town and fled ; the settlers began rebuilding atop the ruins the next day . Jameson sent troops north from Bulawayo to bring the king back , but this column ceased its pursuit in early December after the remnants of Lobengula 's army ambushed and annihilated 34 troopers who were sent across the Shangani River ahead of the main force . Lobengula had escaped the Company , but he lived only another two months before dying from smallpox in the north of the country on 22 or 23 January 1894 . 
 Matabeleland was conquered . The Matabele izinDuna unanimously accepted peace with the Company at an indaba in late February 1894 . Rhodes subsequently funded education for three of Lobengula 's sons . The name applied to the Company 's domain by many of its early settlers , " Rhodesia " , was made official by the Company in May 1895 , and by Britain in 1898 . The lands south of the Zambezi were designated " Southern Rhodesia " , while those to the north were divided into North @-@ Western and North @-@ Eastern Rhodesia , which merged to form Northern Rhodesia in 1911 . During three decades under Company rule , railways , telegraph wires and roads were laid across the territories ' previously bare landscape with great vigour , and , with the immigration of tens of thousands of white colonists , prominent mining and tobacco farming industries were created , albeit partly at the expense of the black population 's traditional ways of life , which were varyingly disrupted by the introduction of Western @-@ style infrastructure , government , religion and economics . Southern Rhodesia , which attracted most of the settlers and investment , was turning a profit by 1912 ; Northern Rhodesia , by contrast , annually lost the Company millions right up to the 1920s . Following the results of the government referendum of 1922 , Southern Rhodesia received responsible government from Britain at the termination of the Company 's charter in 1923 , and became a self @-@ governing colony . Northern Rhodesia became a directly administered British protectorate the following year . 
 = 1920 Buffalo All @-@ Americans season = 
 The 1920 Buffalo All @-@ Americans season was the franchise 's inaugural season with the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) , an American football league , and fifth total as a team . The All @-@ Americans entered 1920 coming off a 9 – 1 – 1 record in 1919 as the Buffalo Prospects in the New York Pro Football League ( NYPFL ) . Several representatives from another professional football league , the Ohio League , wanted to form a new national league , and thus the APFA was created . 
 Buffalo reshaped itself for the 1920 season . Only two players from the 1919 season stayed , and the team went into new management . Tommy Hughitt ( one of the returning players ) became the new coach , and Frank McNeil became the new owner . The All @-@ Americans opened the season with a 32 – 6 victory over the local semi @-@ pro team West Buffalo , en route to a 9 @-@ win , 1 – loss , 1 @-@ tie ( 9 – 1 – 1 ) record . Its only loss of the season was a 3 – 0 game against the Canton Bulldogs . A meeting was held by the officials of the APFA to determine a winner , with each coach having a vote . The All @-@ Americans stated their cases ; they believed they should deserve the championship trophy because they had the most wins and were undefeated against the Akron Pros and the Decatur Staleys . The officials , however , awarded the Brunswick @-@ Balke Collender Cup to the Akron Pros because they had a 1 @.@ 000 winning percentage . Had standings been counted as they are as of today , the All @-@ Americans would be co @-@ champions . 
 The sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the 1920 All @-@ Pro list , but no players from the All @-@ Americans were on it . That is because Copeland wrote for the Rock Island Argus and did not see any players from the easternmost teams in the league . As of 2012 , no player from the 1920 All @-@ Americans has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame .

 In the 1919 season , the franchise was named the Buffalo Prospects , and finished with a 9 – 1 – 1 in the NYPFL . As a result , they won the New York Championship . After the 1919 season , the Prospects went under new management , and the name was changed to the All @-@ Americans . Tommy Hughitt became the coach , and several players from the 1919 squad left . Of the 33 players on the 1919 team , only Barney <unk> and Tommy Hughitt remained on the team for the 1920 season . 
 After the 1919 season , representatives of four Ohio League teams — the Canton Bulldogs , the Cleveland Tigers , the Dayton Triangles , and the Akron Pros — called a meeting on August 20 , 1920 to discuss the formation of a new league . At the meeting , they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams . They also agreed on a name for the circuit : the American Professional Football Conference . They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17 . 
 At that meeting , held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay 's Hupmobile showroom in Canton , representatives of the Rock Island Independents , the Muncie Flyers , the Decatur Staleys , the Racine Cardinals , the Massillon Tigers , the Chicago Cardinals , and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league . Representatives of the All @-@ Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting , but sent letters to Hay asking to be included in the league . Team representatives changed the league 's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers , installing Jim Thorpe as president . Under the new league structure , teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed , so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played . Also , representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy .

 = The Man with the Golden Gun ( novel ) = 
 The Man with the Golden Gun is the twelfth novel ( and thirteenth book ) of Ian Fleming 's James Bond series . It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the UK on 1 April 1965 , eight months after the author 's death . The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series , leading to poor but polite reviews . Despite that , the book was a best @-@ seller . 
 The story centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond , who had been posted missing , presumed dead , after his last mission in Japan . Bond returns to England via the Soviet Union , where he had been brainwashed to attempt to assassinate his superior , M. After being " cured " by the MI6 doctors , Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find and kill Francisco Scaramanga , the titular " Man with the Golden Gun " . 
 The first draft and part of the editing process was completed before Fleming 's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor , William Plomer , but it was not as polished as other Bond stories . Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing , as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft . Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story , although his suggestions were not subsequently used . 
 The novel was serialised in 1965 , firstly in the Daily Express and then in Playboy ; in 1966 a daily comic strip adaptation was also published in the Daily Express . In 1974 the book was loosely adapted as the ninth film in the Eon Productions James Bond series , with Roger Moore playing Bond and Fleming 's cousin , Christopher Lee , as Scaramanga . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A year after James Bond 's final confrontation with Ernst Stavro Blofeld , while on a mission in Japan , a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet the head of the Secret Service , M. Bond 's identity is confirmed , but during his debriefing interview with M , Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol ; the attempt fails . The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld 's castle in Japan , Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia . Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months , Bond travelled into the Soviet Union to learn his true identity . While there , he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon returning to England . 
 Now de @-@ programmed , Bond is given a chance to re @-@ prove his worth as a member of the 00 section following the assassination attempt . M sends Bond to Jamaica and gives him the seemingly impossible mission of killing Francisco " Pistols " Scaramanga , a Cuban assassin who is believed to have killed several British secret agents . Scaramanga is known as " The Man with the Golden Gun " because his weapon of choice is a gold @-@ plated Colt .45 revolver , which fires silver @-@ jacketed solid @-@ gold bullets . 
 Bond locates Scaramanga in a Jamaican bordello and manages to become his temporary personal assistant under the name " Mark Hazard " . He learns that Scaramanga is involved in a hotel development on the island with a group of investors that consists of a syndicate of American gangsters and the KGB . Scaramanga and the other investors are also engaged in a scheme to destabilise Western interests in the Caribbean 's sugar industry and increase the value of the Cuban sugar crop , running drugs into America , smuggling prostitutes from Mexico into America and operating casinos in Jamaica that will cause friction between tourists and the local people . 
 Bond discovers that he has an ally who is also working undercover at the half @-@ built resort , Felix Leiter , who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga 's meeting room . However , they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over . Bond 's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight @-@ seeing train to a marina . However , Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and , with the help of Leiter , kill most of the conspirators . Wounded , Scaramanga escapes into the swamps , where Bond pursues him . Scaramanga lulls Bond off @-@ guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm . Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times , killing him at last . 
 As Bond recuperates in hospital , he receives word from M that he is being considered for a knighthood . Bond turns down the offer , reflecting that any sort of public recognition would interfere with his duties in the Secret Service . 
 = = Characters and themes = = 
 The central character of the novel is James Bond . In The Man with the Golden Gun , he appears with a different personality from the previous stories and is robot @-@ like , according to author of the " continuation " Bond novels , Raymond Benson . Benson also noted that Bond 's character had not been developed any further than in the previous books . Academic Jeremy Black noted that when given two opportunities to kill Scaramanga in cold blood , he cannot bring himself to do it . The first time this happens , is when Bond sits in a car behind Scaramanga ; the method of killing would be to shoot him in the back of the head and this is compared to the technique used by both the KGB and Nazis . According to Black , Bond has to rise above the actions and act more suitably for a British fictional hero . Once the mission is completed , Bond is offered the KCMG , but he refuses the honour and reflects on his own name , " a quiet , dull , anonymous name " , which had been Fleming 's aim when he first named the character . Benson also points out that the touches of humour displayed by Bond in the previous novels disappeared and he appeared in the book as cold and emotionless . 
 For the first time in the Bond canon , M 's full name of " Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG " was finally revealed . Despite being the target of the failed assassination attempt , not only does M not press charges against Bond , he sends him out on further missions . 
 According to Benson , main adversary of the novel , Francisco Scaramanga , is more a henchman than a major adversary and " a second @-@ rate , <unk> crook who happens to have gotten lucky with his shooting . " Comentale , Watt and Willman note that Scaramanga had the same character profile as Herr von Hammerstein , the former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service in " For Your Eyes Only " . 
 There are two main themes of note that appear in the novel . The first is that with Scaramanga providing the Rastafarians with drugs in return for fires in the sugar plantations , there is the return of the theme used in " Risico " , of drugs being used for political purposes to undermine the West . This was part of a wider conspiracy by Scaramanga and his KGB connection , Hendricks , to destabilise the region by a campaign of industrial sabotage against companies based in Jamaica , including Reynolds Metal , Kaiser Bauxite and <unk> . 
 Jeremy Black notes that the independent inquiry at the end of the novel , conducted in Bond 's hospital bedroom , was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary and the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting " under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID " ; Bond and Leiter are also awarded the Jamaican Police Medal for " Services to the Independent State of Jamaica . " Black notes that this was the new world of a non @-@ colonial , independent Jamaica , underlining the collapse of the British Empire . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ian Fleming wrote The Man with the Golden Gun at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January and February 1964 , completing it by the beginning of March . His health affected him badly during the writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words a morning to a little over an hour 's worth of work a day . 
 As with his previous novels , Fleming used events from his past as elements in his novel . Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s , Fleming 's car , a Standard Tourer , had been struck by a train at a level crossing and he had been dragged fifty yards down the track . From that time on he had associated trains with death , which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun , but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia , with Love . 
 As well as using events from his past , Fleming also used names of individuals he knew for some of his characters . The editor of The London Magazine , Alan Ross , had provided Fleming with details about the effects of the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and , by way of thanks , the novel 's SIS station chief in Jamaica , Commander Ross , was named after him . Similarly , Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George 's Golf Club , Mark Nicholson , for the CIA representative at the hotel . Tony Hugill , the sugar planter mentioned in the novel , was named after a member of Fleming 's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after the war and the book 's main villain , Francisco Scaramanga , was named after George Scaramanga , an Etonian contemporary of Fleming 's : the pair are said to have fought at school . 
 The effects of the two Eon Productions Bond films released prior to the writing of the novel ( Dr. No and From Russia with Love ) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used . One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan <unk> , who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961 . <unk> was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev <unk> and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison @-@ spray gun to do it . 
 Fleming returned to Britain with a completed first draft of the manuscript in March 1964 and wrote to the copy editor of all his novels , William Plomer , saying it needed a lot of re @-@ writing . As time went on Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and thought about re @-@ working it in the spring of 1965 , but was persuaded against it by Plomer , who considered the novel viable for publication . Five months after returning from Jamaica , on the morning of 12 August 1964 , Fleming died of a heart attack . His obituary in The Times noted that he " had completed and was revising a new novel , The Man with the Golden Gun . " 
 Despite William Plomer 's original thought about the state of the manuscript , editors Jonathan Cape were concerned enough about the story to pass the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday , paying him £ 35 / 15 shillings for his thoughts and advice , although Amis ' subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape . Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel was thin and " feeble " . Raymond Benson has noted that the thinness comes from a lack of the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming 's work , but which are missing from The Man with the Golden Gun ; Benson suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming , but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion . The Man with the Golden Gun was published posthumously , eight months after its author 's death .

 Critics did not praise The Man with the Golden Gun , although much of the criticism was muted . Fleming biographer Henry Chandler noted that the novel " received polite and rather sad reviews , recognizing that the book had effectively been left half @-@ finished , and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game . " Kingsley Amis wrote in the New Statesman that the book was " a sadly empty tale , empty of the interests and effects that for better or worse , Ian Fleming made his own . " Meanwhile , the critic for The Times wrote that the novel would " doubtless be followed with close attention by the keen @-@ eyed admirers of the many @-@ <unk> Bond . " 
 Maurice Richardson , writing in The Observer , lamented that " perhaps Ian Fleming was very tired when he wrote it . Perhaps ... he left it unrevised . The fact remains that this posthumous Bond is a sadly sub @-@ standard job . " His praise for the novel was muted , admitting " it isn 't of course by any means totally unreadable but it 's depressingly far from the best Bond . " Writing in The Observer 's sister paper , The Guardian , Christopher Wordsworth noted that " since Goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly in the wake of the Zeitgeist . " Prior to this novel , Wordsworth writes , " the distance between Live and let Die , Ian Fleming 's second and best , and You Only Live Twice , his last and worst , is a long iron down the Sandwich fairway . " The Man with the Golden Gun , however , sinks to the level of a " farrago " . 
 William Trevor , writing in The Listener , was dismissive of the work , thinking that " Bond continues to behave with so little originality that neither Templar nor Drummond , Marlowe nor Nick Charles , would have paused to waste a pellet on him " ; he continued , saying that " this present work is once again a fantasy for grown @-@ up children , neither as clever nor exciting as the early thrillers of Edgar Wallace or the boys adventure stories of fifty years ago . " Trevor did admit that " for those who like to escape to <unk> , the old boom @-@ town hasn 't changed a scrap . " 
 The critic for Time was damning , saying that " It may have been just as well that Fleming died when everybody still thought he could do no wrong " . Meanwhile , the critic for Newsweek said that " James Bond should have had a better exit . Sadly [ it ] ... ends not with a bang but a whimper . The world will be a vastly more lacklustre and complicated place with 007 gone . " 
 Associated Press wrote that " Bond and Fleming were fun . They entertained , sometimes mildly , often grandly – but always consistently . Life will be less interesting without them . " In his review for The New York Times , Charles Poore wrote that The Man with the Golden Gun was " a gory , glittering saga " . Poore noted that " The Gee @-@ <unk> ... starts early and never flags " and that , despite the passing of Fleming , " the James Bond spirit soars on " . The critic for Books and Bookmen lamented the fact that " Bond has gone out like a lamb ; even the girls are below par , while the villain seems like a refuge from a seedy Western . But we 'll miss our James " . 
 <unk> Jones , writing in The New York Review of Books thought The Man with the Golden Gun was " an innocuous run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill adventure story of 1911 vintage " , Anthony Lejeune , writing in the National Review , thought that it " is undeniably slight , but , like everything Fleming wrote , intensely readable ... In a sense Fleming 's job was finished . He had irrevocably transformed the genre in which he worked " . Lejeune went on to say that " in highbrow novels sex and violence are treated gloomily : in Fleming 's stories they are presented cheerfully with full enjoyment . "

 Martha Wise ( 1884 – June 28 , 1971 ) , born Martha Hasel , was an American poisoner . After her husband died and her family forced her to end a relationship with a new lover , Wise retaliated by poisoning seventeen family members , of whom three died , in 1924 . She was convicted of one of the murders , despite defense claims that she was mentally ill and that her lover had ordered her to poison her family . The case is considered one of the most sensational of the era in Ohio , where it occurred .

 Wise was born in 1884 to Sophie Hasel and her husband , farmers in Hardscrabble , a town in Medina County , Ohio . Three brothers and a sister were also born to the family , although contemporary sources name only one , a brother named Fred . In 1906 , Martha Hasel met the substantially older Albert Wise at a box social ; the two were married , though Wise neglected to give her a wedding ring . 
 The marriage was not happy . Martha moved onto Albert 's 50 @-@ acre ( 20 ha ) farm , but quickly discovered that he expected a farmhand more than a wife , and life was no less poor as a married woman than it had been when she lived with her parents . Even when pregnant , she was forced to do farm work that was generally male @-@ oriented ( such as plowing fields and slopping hogs ) as well as the usual household chores of baking and cleaning . The couple 's first child , Albert , did not survive infancy ; four others , Everett , Gertrude , Kenneth , and Lester , did . 
 Wise 's main source of diversion during this period was funerals ; she seldom missed a visit to any funeral held in or near the town , whether she had known the deceased or not . When questioned , she simply said that she liked funerals . Albert Wise died suddenly in 1923 , leaving his wife a 40 @-@ year @-@ old widow with four children . Her odd behavior and fixation on funerals became more noticeable , and she began not only attending funerals , but openly crying and lamenting at them , no matter who had died . 
 = = Deaths = = 
 Within a year of Albert Wise 's death , Martha Wise , though not considered a particularly good or attractive catch , found new male companionship in the form of Walter Johns , who worked as a farmhand on property adjacent to her farm . The relationship was frowned upon by Wise 's family , and both Wise 's mother , Sophie Hasel , and her aunt , Lily Gienke , made no secret of their desire for Wise to end the relationship . By the end of 1924 , Wise had acquiesced , and the relationship ended . Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact . 
 On Thanksgiving evening , 1924 , several members of the family , including Sophie Hasel , fell ill with a severe stomach ailment . The others recovered shortly , but Hasel 's illness worsened , and she died on December 13 , 1924 . 
 New Year 's Eve of 1925 brought more illness . Wise 's uncle Fred Gienke , his wife , Lily , and several of their children all began suffering stomach pains similar to those Hasel had experienced before her death . Several family members were hospitalized , and Lily and Fred were both dead by February 1925 . In total , seventeen relatives were taken ill with similar symptoms in the fall and winter of 1924 / 1925 . Four of the Gienke children were left partially paralyzed from the mysterious illness .

 After the deaths of the <unk> , authorities began to investigate the cluster of deaths . The county sheriff , Fred <unk> , soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic . An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract . Brought in for questioning by the sheriff , Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats , but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of . 
 = = Trial = = 
 Despite her confession , Wise pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23 , 1925 . She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly attracted to attending funerals , and that when there were not enough funerals in the community , she was driven to create them by killing . Wise was indicted on a charge of first @-@ degree murder on April 7 , 1925 . 
 Wise 's trial for murder began on May 4 , 1925 . She was represented by Joseph Pritchard and prosecuted by Joseph Seymour . Defense claims included that Wise was criminally insane and that she was ordered to commit the murders by her former lover , Walter Johns . A number of setbacks plagued the defense , including the May 6 suicide of Wise 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , Edith Hasel , and the subsequent collapse of her husband Fred Hasel , both of whom had been prepared to testify for the defense ; the recantation of testimony by a man named Frank Metzger , who told the prosecution on cross @-@ examination that the defense had asked him to <unk> himself to support claims that Wise was insane ; and Wise 's choice to take the stand on her own behalf . Family members including Wise 's son , Lester , and three of the <unk> ' children testified against her . 
 After one hour of jury deliberation , Wise was found guilty of first @-@ degree murder . The jury urged mercy in sentencing , and the judge sentenced Wise to a life sentence in prison , under the terms of which she could only be freed by executive clemency . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1962 , as a result of Wise 's good behavior in prison , Ohio governor Michael <unk> commuted Wise 's sentence to second @-@ degree murder and she was paroled at age 79 . Wise 's remaining family refused to take her in , and a number of rest homes for the elderly similarly declined her residency ; within three days Wise returned to prison , lacking anywhere else to go . Her parole and the commutation of her sentence were revoked . Wise died in prison on June 28 , 1971 .

 Wise was featured in a 1930 Toledo News @-@ Bee article series profiling " [ w ] omen who are paying the price for folly , women who gambled against society and lost " . A 1962 issue of the St. Joseph Gazette called the Wise case " one of Ohio 's most publicized crimes of the era " , and she has been labeled the " poison widow of Hardscrabble " and a " poison fiend " . 
 Wise 's case was covered in a 2008 episode of the Investigation Discovery network series Deadly Women . 
 = Typhoon Wipha ( 2007 ) = 
 Typhoon Wipha , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Goring , was the strongest typhoon to threaten the Chinese coastline since Typhoon Saomai in August 2006 . Forming out of a tropical disturbance on September 15 , 2007 , it quickly developed into a tropical storm , and intensified into a typhoon the following day with the appearance of an eye feature . After a period of rapid intensification , Wipha attained its peak intensity on September 18 , with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 925 mbar ( hPa ) , according to the Japan Meteorological Agency . Later that day , the storm began to weaken as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan before brushing the northern edge of the island . Wipha subsequently made landfall near Fuding along the Fujian @-@ Zhejiang provincial border with winds estimated at 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) by the JTWC . Shortly thereafter , the typhoon weakened as it moved inland , weakening to a tropical storm within 18 hours of moving over land . 
 Nearly 2 million residents along the Chinese coastline evacuated ahead of Typhoon Wipha 's arrival . Nearly 20 @,@ 000 Chinese soldiers were deployed to the area to assist residents in reinforcing flood barriers and speeding up evacuations . The typhoon triggered severe flooding with rainfall in excess of 353 mm ( 13 @.@ 9 in ) . Roughly 13 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , 57 @,@ 000 more were damaged and 100 @,@ 000 hectares of farmland was inundated . Throughout China , 14 people were killed and damage amounted to ¥ 7 @.@ 45 billion ( $ 1 billion USD ) . 
 Although the center of the storm did not pass near the Philippines , its outer rainbands brought severe flooding to Negros Occidental . Two people died and three others were listed as missing . Damage amounted to PHP 15 @.@ 3 million ( $ 314 @,@ 000 USD ) . In Taiwan , high winds killed one person and injured another . Up to 495 mm ( 19 @.@ 5 in ) of precipitation caused landslides and flooding across the island . Agricultural losses in Taiwan amounted to NT $ 7 @.@ 8 million ( US $ 236 @,@ 300 ) . In Okinawa , high winds and rainfall up to 335 mm ( 13 @.@ 2 in ) caused significant damage and resulted in two fatalities . Seven homes across the islands were destroyed and damage totaled ¥ 28 @.@ 3 billion ( $ 285 million USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Wipha originated from a tropical disturbance that was first identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) on September 13 , 2007 roughly 1 @,@ 435 km ( 892 mi ) east of Guam . Deep convection had developed around an area of low pressure that formed within the disturbance . Low wind shear allowed the system to steadily develop as it moved northward . Late on September 14 , convective banding features had formed around the center of circulation , prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert . Several hours later , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression . At the same time , the JTWC declared that the disturbance had become Tropical Depression 13W . Shortly thereafter , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also began issuing advisories on the developing depression , assigning it the local name Goring . Initially , a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough situated to the north of the depression suppressed convective development and outflow . However , late on September 15 , this system weakened , leading to both the JTWC and JMA upgrading the depression to a tropical storm early on September 16 . Upon being declared a tropical storm , the JMA assigned the name Wipha to the storm . 
 Throughout September 16 , Wipha underwent a brief period of rapid intensification , with the JTWC upgrading it to a Category 1 hurricane , on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale , within 12 hours . The intensifying system maintained a northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge over the northwest Pacific . Early on September 17 , Wipha was upgraded to a typhoon as 10 @-@ minute sustained winds reached 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . A second round of rapid intensification took place through most of the day , leading to the typhoon attaining its peak intensity late on September 17 with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) and a barometric pressure of 925 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 31 inHg ) . At the same time , the JTWC assessed Wipha to have nearly attained Category 5 status , peaking as a high @-@ end Category 4 super typhoon with winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . Upon reaching this intensity , Wipha became the second strongest storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season . 
 Not long after reaching its peak intensity , Wipha began to weaken as it started to interact with the high terrain of Taiwan . Early on September 18 , PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon Goring as it left their area of responsibility . Later that day , the center of the typhoon passed roughly 130 km / h ( 80 mi ) north of Taipei , Taiwan . Continued weakening took place as the storm neared landfall in Mainland China . Around 1800 UTC , the eye of Wipha crossed the Chinese coastline near Wenzhou with sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) . The JTWC assessed Wipha to have made landfall as a low @-@ end Category 3 typhoon with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved further inland . The JTWC issued their final advisory on Wipha during the afternoon of September 19 as they classified the system as an extratropical cyclone . However , the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression until September 20 . At this time , the remnants of Wipha had entered the Yellow Sea and accelerated northeastward towards the Korean Peninsula . The extratropical remnants of Wipha persisted for several more hours before dissipating off the coast of North Korea that afternoon .

Phillies starter Cole Hamels was hit by a line drive in the fourth inning and exited the game ; before departing , he had retired nine out of the ten batters he faced . Hitting the road for a series against the division @-@ leading Florida Marlins , the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in the first game of the series , only to score seven runs in the top of the ninth against power @-@ throwing closer Matt Lindstrom , winning the game , 7 – 3 , thanks to Shane Victorino 's first career regular season grand slam . The following night 's game offered another come @-@ from @-@ behind win for the Phillies , as they trailed in the ninth again to win in extra innings , 6 – 4 , and the 13 – 2 victory on April 26 capped the team 's first series sweep . Hosting Washington for their second series against the Nationals , the Phillies fell behind in the seventh inning before a grand slam by Ibáñez capped their 13 – 11 victory ; combined with Ryan Howard 's game @-@ tying grand slam in the fifth inning , this was only the fourth time in Phillies history that teammates hit grand slams in the same game . The Phillies split the remaining two games of the series with Washington , finishing with an April record of 11 – 9 , their second consecutive winning April . 
 = = = May = = = 
 The Phillies opened May against the division @-@ rival New York Mets , losing the opening game of the month , 7 – 4 . Back @-@ to @-@ back walks in the tenth inning of the Saturday afternoon game gave the Phillies their first win of the season over the Mets . After a rainout , the Phillies opened their first series in St. Louis with the Cardinals . They won the first game of the series on Howard 's second grand slam in as many weeks after a pitchers ' duel between starters Kyle Lohse and Joe Blanton and completed the two @-@ game series sweep with a 10 – 7 victory on May 5 , capped by a Jayson Werth three @-@ run home run and a 4 @-@ for @-@ 5 performance from Victorino . The Phillies ' brief stop in New York was marred by a two @-@ game series sweep ; Phillies hitters were shut down by Mets starters Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey , and closer Francisco Rodríguez recorded saves in both games of the series . The following series was barely better , as the Phillies dropped two games to the Braves . 
 On May 12 , Werth stole four bases , including home plate , tying a Phillies record and leading to a 5 – 3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers ; however , the series result was the same as the previous one , as the Phillies dropped two games in the set to Los Angeles . Carrying a .500 winning percentage south from Philadelphia to Washington , the team visited the White House and was congratulated by President Barack Obama for their championship the previous season . The visit had been postponed from April 14 due to Kalas ' death . After meeting the President , the Phillies opened the series with a second consecutive extra @-@ inning game , defeating the Nationals in 12 innings . Because pitcher J. A. Happ had to enter Friday night 's game in relief , the Phillies called up right @-@ handed starting pitcher Andrew Carpenter from Reading to start the second game of Saturday 's doubleheader ( a make @-@ up of the postponement from April 15 ) . Carpenter earned his first major league win in the rain @-@ shortened second game after Myers earned the win in the afternoon game . Though Sunday 's starter Park only pitched 11 ⁄ 3 innings , the Phillies swept the series with the Nationals with an 8 – 6 come @-@ from @-@ behind win , with new call @-@ up Sergio Escalona earning his first major league win . This marked the first time since the 2007 season that rookies had won back @-@ to @-@ back starts for the Phillies ( Hamels and Kyle Kendrick ) . The Phillies took two of three games in each of their next two series with the Cincinnati Reds and the New York Yankees to finish their road trip with an 8 – 2 record . Though they lost two games against Florida , the final series of the month against Washington resulted in a second straight series sweep , as the Phillies defeated the Nationals in three consecutive games to finish the month with a 17 – 11 record ; the last game of the series was Moyer 's 250th career victory . With strong offensive performances in May , Howard and Ibáñez became the first pair of Phillies to hit 10 home runs in the same month . 
 = = = June = = = 
 The month of June saw the continuation of the Phillies ' hot streak ; from May 15 to June 4 , the team compiled a 16 – 4 record , culminating with a three @-@ game sweep of the Padres on the Phillies ' first trip to the West Coast . In that series , rookie Antonio Bastardo made his major league debut , striking out five batters and allowing one earned run in six innings of work to earn his first career victory . Traveling north to Los Angeles for a rematch of the previous year 's playoff series , the Phillies managed a split despite the bullpen 's struggles . Lidge blew two saves in consecutive nights , taking the loss in the first game and allowing the game @-@ tying home run in the other . The series was bookended by the team 's first shutout of the season , a complete game by Hamels , and a second consecutive strong performance from Bastardo , who pitched five innings and allowed only two runs in a game that ended with a final score of 7 – 2 . The final stop on the road trip was Citi Field , where the Phillies faced off against the Mets . All three games were close , with two one @-@ run wins in the series and two extra @-@ inning victories for the Phillies , won by home runs from Utley and Ibáñez on June 10 and 11 . 
 The team 's strong stretch did not continue , however , as the Phillies entered the second period of interleague play with five consecutive series against the American League East . While they managed a single win against the Boston Red Sox , it was followed by a six @-@ game losing streak wherein the Phillies were swept by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles ; Philadelphia was outscored 38 – 19 over the two series . The team showed promise in the first game of their World Series rematch series with the Tampa Bay Rays , winning 10 – 1 , but were defeated in the last two games of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26 . However , the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning the last two games . Happ played the role of stopper by pitching his first career complete game shutout , and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game . To close the month , the Phillies lost the opener of their next series with the Braves to finish the month with a 10 – 16 record . 
 = = = July = = = 
 Struggles continued for the Phillies to open July , as the Braves completed a three @-@ game series sweep in the first two days of the month ; however , a face @-@ off with the Mets over the Independence Day weekend revitalized the team 's fortunes . The Phillies swept their northern rivals as the Mets managed only three runs in three games . During the series , the team 's 2009 All @-@ Stars were announced : Utley and Ibáñez were elected as starters , and Howard was named as a reserve , one of four first basemen selected to the National League squad . It was also announced that Victorino was one of the five " Final Vote " candidates . Though the Phillies had played much better on the road to this point in the season , home @-@ field advantage paid off the next night , as the offense chased Reds starter Johnny Cueto after 2 ⁄ 3 of an inning by scoring nine runs ; the team went on to score 10 in the first inning and 22 in the entire game . Every Phillies starter had at least one hit , Werth hit an eighth @-@ inning grand slam off of Reds infielder Paul <unk> , and Rollins and Victorino , at the top of the order , combined to go 7 @-@ for @-@ 9 with three doubles , a home run , nine runs scored , and five RBIs between them . Though closer Lidge suffered a tough loss on July 7 , sacrificing a run in the ninth inning to earn his fourth of the season , the Phillies bounced back with a dramatic ninth @-@ inning win the following night . Victorino hit a walk @-@ off single to drive in Pedro Feliz and solidify his victory in the All @-@ Star Final Vote , which was announced the next day . Werth was named to replace the New York Mets ' Carlos Beltrán on the All @-@ Star roster due to injury ; Victorino replaced Beltrán as the starter in center field . 
 After the All @-@ Star break — during which the American League defeated the National League , 4 – 3 — Moyer , Ryan Madson , and J. C. Romero combined for a one @-@ hit , complete @-@ game shutout of the Marlins in the first game back , extending the Phillies ' winning streak to six games , and their record to 10 – 3 in the month of July . The streak was extended to eight straight games as the Phillies swept Florida in three games of the series ( one game was postponed due to weather ) . Happ raised his record to 7 – 0 on the season with another seven @-@ inning shutout performance . The streak continued as the Phillies opened a series at home against the Chicago Cubs ; Chad Durbin earned his first save in 11 months by pitching three scoreless innings of relief . Werth 's three @-@ run home run in the 13th inning the next night gave the Phillies a walk @-@ off win for their tenth consecutive , but Chicago ended the season @-@ high streak with a 10 – 5 defeat on July 22 . The Phillies won three of their next four , and bolstered their rotation by trading for Cliff Lee . The 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner came from the Cleveland Indians along with outfielder Ben Francisco on July 29 ; the Phillies gave up four minor leaguers — catcher Lou Marson , infielders Jason Donald and pitchers Carlos Carrasco and Jason Knapp . Lee and Francisco joined the Phillies in San Francisco after the Phillies ' series victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks , and both started the final game in July . Lee pitched a complete @-@ game four @-@ hitter on July 31 , allowing one run over nine innings of work . The Phillies finished July with a 20 – 7 record , their first 20 @-@ win month since May 2001 . 
 = = = August = = = 
 The Phillies opened the month of August with three straight losses , but the stopper 's role again fell to the rookie Happ , who pitched his second shutout of the season — and the second of his career — against the Rockies on August 5 . He earned the team 's 60th win of the season while allowing four hits and striking out ten batters for the first time in his career . In accordance with his 8 – 2 record and strong performances , Amaro announced that Happ would remain in the Phillies ' starting rotation despite the team 's acquisitions of Lee and Pedro Martínez ; rumors regarding Happ 's status had been rampant since Martínez ' signing and during the trade season when Happ was rumored to be the centerpiece of a potential trade for the Blue Jays ' Roy Halladay . New pitcher Lee stifled the Rockies the following day to win the series for the Phillies with a second consecutive strong performance , allowing one run over seven innings and allowing only six hits . In the following series with Florida , however , the Phillies struggled . The Marlins swept all three games of the series , which included Victorino 's first career ejection on several close calls by umpire Ed Rapuano , and a crucial error by Victorino 's center field replacement , Werth , in the final game of the series . Moyer pitched against the Marlins in that game , a team against which he had prior success in his career ( 13 – 3 , 2 @.@ 87 ERA in 1001 ⁄ 3 innings pitched ) , and allowed two earned runs on eleven singles through five innings ; however , with a rotation @-@ high 5 @.@ 47 ERA , the Phillies demoted Moyer to the bullpen to allow Martínez to start . Francisco hit his second Phillies home run against the Cubs on August 11 ; it came in the 12th inning and scored the game @-@ winning run for the Phillies . It became the first win of a three @-@ game series sweep , which Lee closed out with a third straight dominant performance ( eight innings pitched , one run allowed , eight strikeouts ) . The Phillies took two of three games from the Braves in their next series , and completed a three @-@ game homestand against the Diamondbacks with a complete game from Lee , who carried a no @-@ hitter into the sixth inning , and eight innings of three @-@ run baseball from Blanton . 
 Martínez faced off against his former club on August 23 , with the series tied 1 – 1 . Mets starter Óliver Pérez allowed six runs in the first inning and was pulled in the middle of Martínez ' first at @-@ bat , down in the count 3 – 0 . Ángel Pagán led off the Mets ' first with an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run after the ball became lodged underneath the outfield wall . Martínez pitched six innings , allowing four runs , but the score was 9 – 6 by the end of the eighth inning . Lidge allowed another run to score and had runners on first and second , thanks in part to a booted base hit and an error by Eric Bruntlett . The Mets had no outs and Jeff Francoeur was at the plate representing the go @-@ ahead run . Francoeur hit a line drive over the second base bag , where Bruntlett caught it , stepped on second base , and tagged Daniel Murphy coming from first , completing the 15th unassisted triple play in baseball 's modern era and the second in Phillies history ( Mickey Morandini ) in a game called " the league 's quirkiest of the season " . The Phillies closed the series with a 6 – 2 win behind Lee 's eighth straight victory ( seven innings pitched , no earned runs ) . With a win on August 26 , the Phillies claimed victory in the year 's series over the Pirates ; however , the Bucs won two games in a three @-@ night set wherein the game @-@ winning run was scored in the eighth inning or later each night . Andrew McCutchen hit a game @-@ winning two @-@ run home run off of Lidge in the ninth inning of the opener ; Howard hit a game @-@ winning three @-@ run shot for the Phillies in the top of the tenth on August 26 after the Pirates tied it in the ninth on a Brandon Moss home run . Garrett Jones set a Pirates rookie record with his 15th home run off of Happ in the eighth inning of the series finale . The Phillies closed the month by taking two of three games from the Braves . For his 11 home run performance in August , Howard won the National League Player of the Month award . 
 = = = September = = = 
 The Phillies opened the month by taking two of a three @-@ game series against the Giants , besting Jonathan Sánchez , who threw a no @-@ hitter earlier in the 2009 season , and Tim Lincecum , who won the 2008 NL Cy Young Award . This was followed by a trip to Texas for a four @-@ game series against the Houston Astros ; the Phillies were unable to muster much offense during the series and were swept . On September 8 , in the first game of the series against the Washington Nationals , Ibañez and Utley each hit their 30th home runs of the season , making them members of the 12th quartet of teammates in major league history to each reach 30 in a single season , joining Howard and Werth . The Phillies offense backed Lee to his sixth win the following night , with Madson earning his second consecutive save after assuming the de facto closer 's role from Lidge . However , the Phillies could not overcome a pair of three @-@ run home runs by Adam Dunn and Ian Desmond to secure the sweep in the last game of the series , despite Stairs ' grand slam ; it was their third loss of the season to Washington in fifteen games . The Mets came to Philadelphia for their last series of the season , which began on September 11 . The Phillies won game one , 4 – 2 , but the Mets came from behind in the second game of the series , scoring five runs in the final two innings to win 10 – 9 . Making up a postponed game from earlier in the season , the Phillies won the first game of a day @-@ night doubleheader behind Kyle Kendrick 's first major league victory in 13 months . Eight shutout innings from Martínez in the nightcap gave the Phillies a 1 – 0 win , a 3 – 1 win in the 4 @-@ game set , and a 12 – 6 win in the season series . Martínez ' eight innings also began a streak of 26 consecutive scoreless innings by Phillies pitchers : Madson followed with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season ; Cliff Lee pitched a complete game shutout against the Nationals the following night ; and Blanton , Park , and Madson combined for eight scoreless innings against Washington on September 16 until Tyler Walker allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning , an RBI single by Willie Harris which scored Justin Maxwell . Hamels closed out the series with a strong performance , perfect through his first five innings and finishing with one run allowed in eight ; with their 15th win over the Nationals , the Phillies matched their best season record against the franchise , set against the 1976 Montréal Expos . 
 The Phillies continued to Atlanta , where they took two of three from the Braves , with Kendrick 's second win and Lidge 's 30th save in the first game of the series . Martínez was outdueled by Javier Vázquez in the second game of the series , but the Phillies avoided a loss by defeating the Braves , 4 – 2 , on September 20 . A doubleheader followed against the Marlins ; the Phillies won game one , while the Marlins won game two . In the rubber game , Lidge blew his 11th save after a rain delay to give the Marlins a series victory , keeping the team 's number to clinch the division at five . The Phillies and the Brewers split the next series at two games each , with Philadelphia winning the first and last game of the series . The Phillies returned to Citizens Bank Park for their final homestand to close out the season , opening with a fifth consecutive loss to the Astros . However , the Phillies broke the streak with a 7 – 4 win on September 29 , thanks to a Feliz grand slam . The following night , the Phillies clinched their third consecutive division title with a 10 – 3 win over Houston , guaranteeing a split in the series and a playoff berth , and tying the franchise record for consecutive division titles set by Danny Ozark 's teams from 1976 to 1978 . After the clinching game , the Phillies rested most of their regular starters , six of whom had started over 150 games during the season ; they lost four straight games while the regulars regained their strength , but won the final game of the season in extra innings as Paul Hoover hit a walk @-@ off single in the bottom of the 10th inning . The Phillies finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses , one game better than their record in the previous season .

 The Phillies , as the No. 2 seed in the National League , faced off against the wild card Colorado Rockies in the first round of the playoffs . Cliff Lee pitched a complete game in the opener of the series , shutting out the Rockies through 8 2 ⁄ 3 innings before allowing a single run in the ninth . He threw 113 pitches in the game , in addition to getting a hit and a stolen base in his first postseason start . The Rockies evened the series in the second game , as Cole Hamels left the stadium early to be with his wife , who went into labor with their first child . The Phillies staged comebacks twice to bring them within a run of tying the game , but could not close the door as Huston Street saved the game for Aaron Cook . 
 After Charlie Manuel named Pedro Martínez his Game 3 starter , the game was postponed a day due to the weather forecast of snow and record @-@ low temperatures . The postponement prompted Manuel to change his plans , naming rookie left @-@ hander J. A. Happ the new starter for the game . Happ pitched three innings , allowing three runs , but Manuel brought Joe Blanton out of the bullpen , who pitched 2 2 ⁄ 3 innings and allowed only one run . Brad Lidge , after 11 blown saves during the regular season , preserved the win for the Phillies , a 6 – 5 victory . In a back @-@ and @-@ forth affair , the Phillies and Rockies traded leads through Game 4 at Coors Field , but the Phillies scored three runs in the top of the ninth to win by one run . Combined with the sweeps in the other three Division Series , 2009 became the first year since the implementation of the wild card in 1995 that all four Championship Series berths were clinched on the road .

 = American Idiot ( musical ) = 
 American Idiot is a sung @-@ through stage adaptation of punk rock band Green Day 's rock opera , American Idiot . After a run at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009 , the show moved to the St. James Theatre on Broadway . Previews began on March 24 , 2010 and the play officially opened on April 20 , 2010 . The show closed on April 24 , 2011 after 422 performances . While Green Day did not appear in the production , vocalist / guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong performed the role of " St. Jimmy " occasionally throughout the run . 
 The story , expanded from that of the concept album , centers on three disaffected young men , Johnny , Will , and Tunny . Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban lifestyle and parental restrictions , while Will stays home to work out his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend , Heather . The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and excitement of the city . Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city , joins the military , and is shipped off to war . Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows to dislike , has a relationship and experiences lost love . 
 The book was written by Armstrong and director Michael Mayer . The music was composed by Green Day and the lyrics were by Armstrong . The score included all the songs from the original American Idiot album , as well as additional Green Day songs from other sources , such as the album 21st Century Breakdown , and unreleased songs originally recorded for the American Idiot musical . 
 The musical won two 2010 Tony Awards : Best Scenic Design of a Musical for Christine Jones , and Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Kevin Adams . It also received a nomination for Best Musical . In 2011 , its Broadway cast recording won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Set in the recent past , the musical opens on a group of suburban youths living unhappily in " Jingletown , USA " and saturated with TV . Fed up with the state of the union , the company explodes in frustration ( " American Idiot " ) . One of the youths , Johnny ( " Jesus of Suburbia " ) , goes to commiserate with his friend Will . A third friend , Tunny , joins the two and they party until they run out of beer , prompting them to pick up more at the local 7 @-@ Eleven . Tunny soon exposes the do @-@ nothing go @-@ nowhere quicksand of their lives ( " City of the Damned " ) . They get riled up , and Johnny challenges his friends to engage ( " I Don 't Care " ) . Will 's girlfriend , Heather , soon makes an appearance . She is pregnant and doesn 't know what to do ( " Dearly Beloved " ) . Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the three young men , eager to escape suburbia . Before the boys are able to leave , Heather tells Will of her pregnancy . With no other choice , he stays home ( " Tales of Another Broken Home " ) . Johnny and Tunny depart for the city with a group of other jaded youths ( " Holiday " ) . 
 While Johnny wanders the city and pines for a woman he sees in an apartment window ( " Boulevard of Broken Dreams " ) , Tunny finds it hard to adjust to urban life and is seduced by a television ad for the army ( " Favorite Son " ) . Tunny realizes that his generation has been so numbed and apathetic that nothing , not even the bright lights of the city , will excite him ( " Are We the Waiting " ) . He enlists in the army . 
 A frustrated Johnny manifests a rebellious drug @-@ dealing alter ego called St. Jimmy , and injects heroin for the first time ( " St. Jimmy " ) . His newfound courage thanks to St. Jimmy and the drugs allow Johnny to make a successful move on the girl in the window . Back in Jingletown , Will sits on the couch as his girlfriend 's pregnancy progresses . He drinks beer and begs for a release . Meanwhile , Tunny is deployed to a war zone , and is soon shot and wounded ( " Give Me <unk> " ) . 
 Johnny spends the night with the girl he saw in the window , whom he calls " Whatsername " . Johnny is smitten with Whatsername and wants to celebrate , but St. Jimmy has other plans for them ( " Last of the American Girls / She 's a Rebel " ) . Johnny and Whatsername go to a club , take drugs together , and have passionate sex . By this time , Will and Heather 's baby girl has been born , and Will is increasingly oblivious as Heather tenderly commits herself to her baby 's future ( " Last Night on Earth " ) . 
 Heather has had enough of Will 's pot @-@ and @-@ alcohol @-@ fueled apathy . Despite Will 's protestations , she takes the baby and walks out ( " Too Much , Too Soon " ) . Around the same time , lying in a bed in an army hospital ( " Before the Lobotomy " ) , Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates . He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ( " Extraordinary Girl " ) . He quickly falls in love with her . His hallucination disappears , and he 's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ( " Before the Lobotomy ( Reprise ) " ) . 
 Back in the city , Johnny reveals the depth of his love for Whatsername as she sleeps ( " When It 's Time " ) . The temptation of drugs , however , is too great ; Jimmy forces Johnny to become increasingly erratic , and he eventually threatens Whatsername ( and then himself ) with a knife ( " Know Your Enemy " ) . Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny 's behavior , while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny 's wounds and Will sits on the couch , once again alone ( " 21 Guns " ) . Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername , saying he has chosen Jimmy and drugs over her . Frightened and fed up , Whatsername tells Johnny that he is not the " Jesus of Suburbia " and reveals that St. Jimmy is nothing more than " a figment of [ his ] father 's rage and [ his ] mother 's love " ( " <unk> " ) . She leaves him . 
 Hurt by Whatsername 's departure , Johnny longs for better days ahead , Tunny longs for home , and Will longs for all the things he 's lost ( " Wake Me Up When September Ends " ) . St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny 's attention , but that part of Johnny has died , resulting in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ( " The Death of St. Jimmy " ) . Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes there is no place for him in the city ( " East 12th Street " ) . Will , all alone with his television , bemoans his outcast state ( " Nobody Likes You " ) . As he finally gets up off the couch , Heather appears with her new show @-@ off rockstar boyfriend ( " Rock and Roll Girlfriend " ) . Will heads to the 7 @-@ Eleven to get away from them and , surprisingly , finds Johnny there . Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home . Tunny returns from the war zone ( as an amputee ) with the Extraordinary Girl . As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl , Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group , but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace . Heather and her boyfriend arrive . In an uneasy truce , she gives the baby to Will . Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven 't seen in a year ( " We 're Coming Home Again " ) . One year later , Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life , but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life . With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ( " Whatsername " ) . 
 After the cast takes their bows , the curtain rises to reveal the entire company with guitars , with which they perform the song " Good Riddance ( Time of Your Life ) " . Each performance of this song was recorded and given to the audience as a free digital download .

 In 2000 , Green Day released the album Warning . Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau compared Warning to the band 's previous album ( Nimrod ) , and noted that " [ Billie Joe Armstrong is ] abandoning the first person . He 's assuming fictional personas . And he 's creating for himself the voice of a thinking left @-@ liberal . " Christgau also detected " a faint whiff " of the work of the theatrical composer / lyricist team of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht . The trend of writing in the third person came to fruition with Green Day 's next studio album , American Idiot in 2004 . The first new song Green Day wrote was the single " American Idiot " . 
 One day , bassist Mike Dirnt was in the studio recording a 30 @-@ second song by himself . Armstrong decided that he wanted to do the same , and drummer Tré Cool followed suit . Armstrong recalled , " It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another . We kept connecting these little half @-@ minute bits until we had something . " This musical suite became " Homecoming " , and the group subsequently wrote another suite , " Jesus of Suburbia " . 
 Green Day made the record an album @-@ long conceptual piece which was a response to the realities of the post @-@ 9 / 11 era . The band took inspiration from the concept records by The Who , sources in the musical theater repertoire like The Rocky Horror Show and West Side Story , and the concept album @-@ cum @-@ stage musical Jesus Christ , Superstar . Armstrong also said the band intended " that it would be staged or we 'd create a film or something ... we were thinking in terms that it kind of felt like scoring a movie . " 
 Director Michael Mayer heard the album and expressed an interest in adapting it for the stage . When he approached the band regarding a collaboration , they agreed to work with him . The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening . Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog , Mayer added very little dialogue to the show . He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own , and even removed some of the dialogue that was part of the Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway .

 Reviews for the Berkeley Repertory Theatre production were mixed . Charles McNulty of Los Angeles Times called the show " kinetically entertaining in a way that intentionally reflects the shallow , media @-@ saturated culture the album rails against " . Karen D 'Souza of San Jose Mercury News called the production " a thrashing collage of songs fused together with hypnotic movement and eye @-@ popping visuals " and thought the show " as compelling as it is abstract [ and ] channels the grungy spirit of punk while also plucking at the heartstrings . " However , Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune compared the show unfavorably to the original album , writing : " [ what ] once was a fine Gouda , has been prepackaged as <unk> " , and continued sarcastically , " In other words , it should do big business on Broadway . " Charles Isherwood of The New York Times commented that the show contained " characters who lack much in the way of emotional depth or specificity , and plotlines that are simple to the point of crudity " but also felt that " the show possesses a stimulating energy and a vision of wasted youth that holds us in its grip . " 
 Isherwood 's review for the Broadway production was enthusiastic . He called the show " a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution , the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I ’ ve seen on Broadway this season . Or maybe for a few seasons past . " Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that " the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely , soberly seated " . Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press found the show to be " visually striking [ and ] musically adventurous " , but noted that " the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development " . Paul <unk> in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day 's " massively popular , starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel @-@ good musical of the season " . Time magazine 's Richard Zoglin opined that the score " is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [ yet ] there 's enough variety .... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative . " He concluded that " American Idiot , despite its earnest huffing and puffing , remains little more than an annotated rock concert .... Still , [ it ] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple , rock and Broadway . " Peter Travers from Rolling Stone wrote , " Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy , Hair , Rent and Spring Awakening , it cuts its own path to the heart . You won ’ t know what hit you . American Idiot knows no limits — it 's a global knockout . " 
 Reviews of the West End production were generally positive . Rachel Ward of The Telegraph gave it four out of five stars , calling " 90 minutes of uninterrupted chaos " . Kate <unk> from Official London Theatre summarized , " Chaotic , intense and pulsating with legendary Green Day hits , a trip to this Tony Award @-@ winning musical may just give you the time of your life . " Paul Taylor of The Independent also gave four out of five stars , praising director and choreographer <unk> Plews for making " a sharp @-@ witted version that throbs with some of the energy of a rock gig ( if minus the feeling of unpredictability ) while being shrewdly calibrated to suit the intimacy of the 350 @-@ seater Arts Theatre .

Armstrong later posted on his Twitter account that he hadn 't " totally committed " to the role but was interested in it . 
 In 2013 , at a screening of Broadway Idiot , Mayer confirmed that the film adaptation was still happening , but production was unknown due to " Hollywood bullshit " . In March 2014 , playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film . Comparing it to the musical , Jones said , " The idea is to get it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms . There 's not going to be a lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter , too . After that , it just takes its ' movie time ' in getting done " .

 Marge and Homer 's plans for a romantic date night fall through when Homer is forced to stay longer than expected at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to fix a leak in one of the plant 's nuclear processing pipes . Looking for a romantic activity after walking out of a movie starring Ben Affleck , they find an ice rink and decide to do some skating . However , they are unable to rent skates because it is curling night . They decide to try it and discover their innate talent for the sport — particularly Marge , who has years of experience sweeping floors . Agnes and Seymour Skinner notice and invite Marge and Homer to join their mixed @-@ doubles team . It is announced that mixed @-@ doubles has been added to the Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport , and the Skinner @-@ Simpson team qualifies for the United States curling trials . Agnes cautions Marge not to let emotions get in the way of winning , relating how a fetal kick by an unborn Seymour foiled her chances at winning gold in pole vault at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . At the trials , Marge 's talented sweeping earns the team a win and a trip to the Winter Olympics in Vancouver . 
 Meanwhile , at the trials , Lisa is given an Olympic mascot pin . Lisa puts it on her shirt and decides it " looks lonely " and buys another , but her interest in them quickly spirals out of control . The Simpsons arrive in Vancouver , where Agnes insists that Homer be cut from the team . Marge insists she can compensate for his weak throws , but she injures her right shoulder while sweeping to secure a win in the semifinals . She is told that she will never curl again and that the American team must forfeit the gold @-@ medal match to Sweden . Lisa 's pin collection grows , and when she runs out of money , she trades her pearl necklace to a vendor in exchange for a pin from the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix , France . Bart discovers Lisa busking on a street corner , having relinquished her dress in favour of wearing her pins at all times , and offers to help her kick her pin @-@ collecting addiction . Cutting the lower portion of Homer 's face from his driver 's license and making it into a pin , Bart creates " <unk> " , a phony mascot for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia . He trades the pin to the vendor in exchange for Lisa 's necklace . 
 As Marge prepares to leave Vancouver , she reveals to Homer that she is left @-@ handed , but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual ( due to years of using her right hand , it renders her cross @-@ dominant ) . She has enough dexterity to change Maggie 's diaper and dress her one @-@ handed . They return to the rink just in time to stop Seymour from forfeiting the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold .

They also consulted with four @-@ time American mixed curling champions Brady and Cristin Clark , as well as Rick Patzke , the chief operating officer of the United States Curling Association , who felt that the writers took a " genuine interest " in the sport . 
 On the issue of whether competitive curlers would be offended by the episode , LaZebnik said " When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport , you naturally get a little alarmed , But we ended up being respectful I would say , even , surprisingly respectful . Both Homer and Marge take it seriously . " Some curlers , including the Clarks and Patzke , felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial . Cristin Clark said " Although Homer Simpson probably isn 't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport , I just think it 's great exposure . " Canadian curler Randy Ferbey , a four @-@ time world champion , said " I 'm sure they 're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing , but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt . It brings attention to our sport and I think it 's wonderful . The more curling on TV , whether it 's in an animated form or real form , the better . " 
 Sportscaster Bob Costas guest @-@ starred in the episode as a caricature of himself .

The Medicine Woman who appeared in The Simpsons Movie appears in the streets of Vancouver , and Homer refers to her as his former therapist .

Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A , the best grade of the night , saying " Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time , and it continues a season that 's had some pretty good episodes overall . I wouldn 't put this on The Simpsons ' top tier , but I think it 's definitely on that next tier down , episodes that maybe don 't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout . Even the Bart and Lisa B @-@ plot , involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting , starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa 's <unk> grows . " Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying " All in all , it was a weird time out of Springfield this week , with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout " . Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote " Sure , the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers ( and maybe Harry Potter fans ) than anyone else , but it did prove Homer has got a bit of meteorological , psychic in him : ' Pack your winter coat , we 're going to Canada 's warmest city ! ' " 
 Bob Costas received praise for his appearance , particularly for his line " This is the sort of bittersweet melodrama Olympic coverage feeds on . I admit , we 're vampires who suck on shattered dreams . " Jason Hughes of TV Squad called the line " about as accurate a description [ of Olympic broadcasters ] as I 've ever seen . " 
 CTV Olympics reported that Olympic curlers largely enjoyed the episode . American men 's team coach Phill <unk> said " The team watched it together and we gave it two thumbs up , they did a great job and it was reaching out to a new audience for our sport , so that 's always great for us too . " American team alternate Chris <unk> said " They didn 't make a mockery of the sport , which is nice . Curling catches a lot of abuse . "
