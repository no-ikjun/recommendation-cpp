 Tyrone Anthony Wheatley , Sr. ( born January 19 , 1972 ) is the running backs coach of Michigan and a former professional American football player who played 10 seasons in the National Football League ( NFL ) and was one of the most successful high school and collegiate athletes in Metropolitan Detroit history . In high school , he was a member of state @-@ champion teams in both track and field and football , and he was named Michigan 's track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same academic year . He earned All @-@ America track honors in both high school and college . Following his graduation as one of Michigan 's best high school athletes , he attended the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship and earned first @-@ team All @-@ Big Ten Conference honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams . 
 At the University of Michigan , Wheatley earned the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year Award during the 1992 football season . In the Michigan Wolverines ' post @-@ season bowl game , he was named the Most Valuable Player for his performance in the team 's Rose Bowl victory . Wheatley continued his track success as well , earning first @-@ team All @-@ Big Ten Conference and All @-@ American honors . He ranks among the Wolverines ' all @-@ time rushing leaders in numerous categories , and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book . He was named to All @-@ Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times , and he earned portions of seven Big Ten championships ( two team awards for football , one team award for indoor track , one award for 110 meter hurdles , and three awards for individual football statistical performances ) . 
 Following his graduation from the University of Michigan , Wheatley was selected by the New York Giants of the NFL in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft . As a running back for the Giants , he was the team 's all @-@ purpose yards leader in 1996 and their leading ballcarrier in 1997 . Despite his success on the field , he developed a reputation for indolence . He was traded to the Miami Dolphins , but cut before the 1999 season began . He signed with the Oakland Raiders and flourished , leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL 's top ten players in rushing touchdowns . With Wheatley , the Raiders went to the playoffs three years in a row , including one Super Bowl appearance . During his NFL career ( 1995 – 2004 ) , he totaled over 6 @,@ 500 all @-@ purpose yards as a running back and kickoff returner . 
 After retiring from the NFL , Wheatley returned to his hometown to coach his high school alma mater , Dearborn Heights ' Hamilton J. Robichaud High School , where he had previously made a name for himself as a nine @-@ time Michigan High School Athletic Association ( MHSAA ) state champion athlete . As a player , he had led the school to its only state football championship . In 2007 , during his first year as head football coach , his team rebounded from an 0 – 9 record to compile a 9 – 2 record , reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1994 . He coached at Ohio Northern University in 2008 , and in 2009 he became an assistant coach for Eastern Michigan University . He served as the running backs coach for the Syracuse Orange football team from 2010 to 2012 . He was hired by the Buffalo Bills to coach the running backs in 2013 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wheatley was born in Inkster , Michigan . Inkster is located in Metropolitan Detroit , east of both Ann Arbor and University of Michigan . Wheatley 's father ( also named Tyrone ) suffered a mortal gunshot wound to the head in 1974 when Wheatley was two years old . Wheatley 's stepfather died of a heart attack when he was 13 , leaving behind Wheatley , his sister , and half @-@ brother , two @-@ year @-@ old Leslie Mongo . Shortly afterward , Wheatley 's mother , Patricia , was laid off and became an alcoholic . With the effective loss of his two parents , Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt , where he lived through the rest of his childhood . Due to family difficulties , Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother . Mongo was ten years younger than Wheatley , and graduated from high school in New Jersey in 2004 — thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated from high school . 
 Wheatley was involved in competitive athletics from an early age : In his youth , he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team , where , as an eight @-@ year @-@ old , he stood out for his discipline and promptness . Because of his family trouble , he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age . Wheatley made it clear to his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives , they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall . When he was in high school , he would take his younger siblings to basketball games , mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls . Wheatley 's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete . While playing in the NFL , he realized that leaving Mongo — the youngest of his siblings — in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to gang shootings . As Mongo 's guardian , Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school . Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the Bergen County , New Jersey outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley , who was playing for the Giants at the time . In 2004 , with his graduation from high school imminent , Mongo signed a letter of intent with Utah State as a defensive back .

 Wheatley attended Hamilton J. Robichaud High School in Dearborn Heights , Michigan , a neighboring municipality of Inkster . During his time at Robichaud High School , he became a nine @-@ time MHSAA state champion ( seven @-@ time individual in track and field , one @-@ time team each in track and field and football ) . He is among the highest @-@ scoring football players in Michigan high school history , and he led his high school to the state football championships while playing eight different positions and being named the Michigan Football Player of the year . In the 1990 MHSAA Championship game against upper peninsula powerhouse Kingsford High School at the Pontiac Silverdome , Wheatley ran for 165 yards and a touchdown in a 21 – 7 victory . That season he led the Bulldogs to a 12 – 1 record . He has been described as the greatest football player in Michigan High School history . 
 In track and field , he won the Michigan High School Track and Cross Country Athlete of the Year award in 1991 . However , at one point Wheatley had quit the track team because the coach refused to let him run four individual events as a sprinter , jumper and hurdler . The coach relented , and Wheatley became a seven @-@ time MHSAA Class B individual state champion by winning the long jump , 100 meters , 110 @-@ meter hurdles both his junior and senior seasons and winning the 200 meters as junior . In his junior year , he led his school to the state Class B track championships , and he became the first individual four @-@ time track and field state champion in the same year in MHSAA history . Through the 2007 MHSAA season he was the MHSAA All class long jump record holder with a 1991 leap of 24 ft 7 in ( 7 @.@ 49 m ) , his high school 100 meters time ( 10 @.@ 59 seconds , 1990 ) continues to rank third in MHSAA history , and his 110 meter hurdles time ( 13 @.@ 87 sec . , 1991 ) ranked seventh in MHSAA history . In addition , through the 2007 track season his hurdle time continued to be a MHSAA lower peninsula Class B state record . His long jump record has been retired . Wheatley became a high school All @-@ American in track , and he was also a member of successful relay teams in high school . His athleticism and jumping abilities were further exhibited in basketball ; Wheatley played for his high school basketball team and was able to slam dunk . He claims that against his high school rival , Inkster High School , he performed a dunk from the foul line , which is a difficult dunk made famous in slam dunk competitions by Julius Erving ( Dr. J. ) and later revived by Michael Jordan . Yet , despite his versatility and promise , Wheatley considered turning down athletic scholarships in hopes of obtaining an academic scholarship . 
 = = = College = = = 
 Wheatley chose to remain in metropolitan Detroit and attend the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship . He played running back for the football team for four years and ran on the track team for three years . As both a football player and track athlete he was highly decorated ; he earned first @-@ team All @-@ Big Ten honors on teams that won Big Ten Championships in both sports and All @-@ American Honors in track . In football , he set and retains numerous school records and in track he achieved some of the fastest times in school history . Offensive coordinator Fred Jackson recalled that Wheatley was always prompt , never overweight , played while injured , and even babysat for Jackson 's children . Wheatley was described in the press as a football player who put his team ahead of himself . 
 Wheatley wore # 6 for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1991 to 1994 . At the end of the 2007 season , he ranked third in Michigan football history in career points and second in career touchdowns ( behind Anthony Thomas ) with forty @-@ seven rushing touchdowns , six receiving touchdowns and one kickoff return for a touchdown . His 47 rushing touchdowns , which ranked third in Big Ten history at the end of his career , ranked fifth behind Ron Dayne ( 71 ) , Anthony Thompson ( 68 ) , Pete Johnson ( 56 ) and Thomas through the 2006 season . His 17 touchdowns in 1992 ranks as the fifth most productive offensive season in Michigan history . In 1992 , he was the Big Ten rushing and scoring champion in an offense where Michigan quarterback Elvis Grbac was also a statistical Big Ten champion . He earned Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors that season and capped the season off by earning the MVP of the 1993 Rose Bowl on a 235 @-@ yard , 15 @-@ carry performance against Washington Huskies , which included touchdown runs of 88 , 56 and 24 yards . 
 Through the 2012 season , he ranks fifth on the Michigan career rushing yards list ( behind Mike Hart , Denard Robinson , Anthony Thomas , and Jamie Morris ) with 4 @,@ 178 yards . His 1992 sophomore season 7 @.@ 3 yards per carry is a Michigan single @-@ season record ( minimum 75 attempts ) , and his freshman yards per carry average ranks fourth at Michigan since 1949 ( and it is a Michigan Freshman record ) . He has both the best and second @-@ best single @-@ game ( minimum 15 carries ) yards per carry performances in Michigan history . He was a three @-@ time All Big Ten selection . 
 As a freshman for the 1991 Wolverines , Wheatley set the Michigan freshman yards per attempt record with 555 yards on 86 carries for a 6 @.@ 4 yards per attempt . In his sophomore year , he broke through with his first of three consecutive first team All @-@ Big Ten selections . He rushed for 1 @,@ 357 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns in addition to 3 receiving touchdowns and recording a kickoff return touchdown while subbing for the injured Ricky Powers . Wheatley had amassed the most touchdowns by a running back in Michigan history by the end of his junior year and was a professional prospect . In 1993 at the end of his junior season 1993 Wolverines , he earned the MVP award of the 1994 Hall of Fame Bowl . Wheatley had finished 8th in the 1993 Heisman Trophy race . Before <unk> Johnson 's 306 yard effort in November of that season against Iowa team that Wheatley had rushed for 113 yards against , Wheatley had been mentioned as the best running back in the nation , but Johnson 's effort and Bam Morris ' final three games of 223 , 222 and 223 yards led to Bam Morris winning the Doak Walker Award . Most who finished ahead of him in the Heisman voting either were seniors ( Ward , Glenn Foley , Johnson ) or gave up their amateur eligibility and declared early for the draft ( Heath Shuler , David Palmer , Marshall Faulk ) , which made Wheatley one of the favorites for the award if he stayed in college for one more year . He stayed at Michigan for another year with the stated intent of obtaining his degree , but stayed without receiving the degree . However , the preseason 1994 Heisman Trophy favorite ( along with 7th @-@ place finisher J. J. Stokes ) , missed the beginning of the season with an injury to the same shoulder that had caused him to miss two games in 1993 . His return to the lineup on September 24 , 1994 was overshadowed by The Miracle at Michigan . His senior season return to the 1994 Wolverines had been a surprise , but injuries allowed Tshimanga Biakabutuka and Ed Davis to get some playing time . He only finished 12th in the Heisman balloting as a senior . Nonetheless , he thought that his senior @-@ year experience broadened his horizons . 
 In college , Wheatley also competed in track and earned varsity letters in 1993 – 1995 . In 1994 , he was the Big Ten outdoor 110 metre hurdles champion , was selected first team All @-@ Big Ten , and was a member of the men 's indoor track and field team that won the indoor Big Ten team championship . He placed eighth at the 1995 NCAA outdoor championships in the 110 meter hurdles , which earned him All @-@ American honors . At the end of his Michigan track career , he owned the third fastest indoor 60m time in Michigan history at 6 @.@ 80 seconds as well as the second fastest outdoor 110 metre hurdles time at 13 @.@ 77 seconds and third fastest outdoor 100 meters at 10 @.@ 46 seconds . Gradually , succeeding athletes have surpassed his times , and after the 2007 season the 110 meter hurdle time ranked fourth best and the 100 meter dash time was fifth .

 = = = = Dan Reeves era ( 1995 – 1996 ) = = = = 
 Wheatley was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft with the seventeenth overall selection . He held out for 17 days before signing a five @-@ year contract with the team . The terms included a $ 2 @.@ 3 million signing bonus and escalating base salaries totaling over $ 2 @.@ 9 million . The negotiations were prolonged in part because of extensive family involvement . Wheatley set no goals for himself and lived by his grandmother 's motto on preparing oneself : " You can set your sails , but you can 't set the wind " . The Giants viewed Wheatley as their running back of the future , since Rodney Hampton was in the final year of his contract . Despite the original visions , Wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games over the course of four seasons with the Giants . Off the field , Wheatley moved his half @-@ brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment . 
 In 1995 and 1996 , under Dan Reeves the Giants had losing seasons and relied heavily on Rodney Hampton who received the bulk of the carries on rushing plays . In 1995 , running back Herschel Walker received more passing downs and in 1996 fullback Charles Way was a main weapon . Wheatley returned kickoffs for the 1995 and 1996 , with 10 returns for 18 @.@ 6 yards per return in 1995 and 23 returns for 21 @.@ 9 yards per return in 1996 . While Hampton led the team in rushing with 827 yards to Wheatley 's 400 yards in 1996 , Wheatley 's 503 return yards and 51 yards receiving gave him the team all @-@ purpose yards leadership . However , Wheatley had 6 fumbles on only 147 touches ( 112 rushes , 12 receptions , and 23 kickoff returns ) . 
 The drafting of Wheatley had been hotly contested . Some Giant draft war @-@ room personnel had wanted to select <unk> Stringer and others had an interest in Rashaan Salaam when the Giants ' selection came . After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick , running backs Napoleon Kaufman , James Stewart and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth , nineteenth and twenty @-@ first selections , respectively . Reeves made it no secret that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the draft . Wheatley 's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to training camp on time . Then , in rookie season training camp , he had the misfortune of pulling a hamstring while running sprints on the first day . Speculation had been that the injury had occurred in a stumble in a June track meet . Reeves held the prompt injury against the running back he never wanted . Wheatley later fell asleep in a meeting which drew a fine from Reeves . Although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting , he also had mental concentration issues in practice . He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated . On top of this , Wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings . 
 = = = = Jim Fassel era ( 1997 – 1998 ) = = = = 
 In 1997 , by the end of training camp , Rodney Hampton 's knees had given out , and although Wheatley had a great camp , Tiki Barber was named the starting tailback . That season , Jim Fassel 's first , the Giants went to the playoffs with a 10 – 5 – 1 record . Wheatley led the team in carries that season despite missing two games and shared the <unk> responsibilities with Way and Barber . On October 12 , Wheatley had his first 100 @-@ yard game with 102 yards on 22 carries against the Arizona Cardinals in a 27 – 13 victory on the road . While Wheatley and Way divided the rushing load , Barber and Way divided most of the responsibility for the running backs ' role in the passing attack , while Wheatley had less than half as many receptions and reception yards as either of them . An ankle injury caused Wheatley to miss the final two regular season games and the wild card playoff game . 
 By 1998 , Wheatley was the only four @-@ year veteran in the Giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator , he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma . The Giants fell to 8 – 8 while relying on Barber , Way and Gary Brown . During the season , Wheatley often performed scout team duties and was inactive for some games . Fassel was not sympathetic to Wheatley 's desire for playing time and thought that Wheatley was overweight . Over the course of the season , there was controversy about a season long weight limit of 235 pounds ( 107 kg ; 16 st 11 lb ) that had been placed on Wheatley . Wheatley 's playing weight limit had been set at 230 pounds ( 104 kg ; 16 st 6 lb ) in training camp and had been raised to 235 on Wheatley 's request . He had played at 233 pounds ( 106 kg ; 16 st 9 lb ) in the final game of his college career . By week 11 , Wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played . 
 Wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in New York although two different coaching staffs had issues with him . He points out double standards that gave him bad feelings in retrospect . In situations where he was not the only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic , he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for <unk> were not vilified . Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother , Leslie Mongo , to his school that opened at 8 : 15 and thought he was the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9 : 00 a.m. team meetings . Charles Way , by contrast , Wheatley 's closest friend on the team and roommate on the road , was nicknamed " Teacher 's Pet . " 
 According to The New York Times , there was a misperception of Wheatley as a " cancer " in the locker room by most accounts . Although he had some issues , his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature . The general opinion of Wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent , but as a package he was an enigma . According to Michael Strahan , Wheatley " ... could outrun the wide receivers , <unk> the linemen and <unk> anyone . " Thus , his off @-@ season workout pattern of sloughing the weights for discussion of politics and current affairs was troubling , but not challenged because he could <unk> most . However , in addition to the enigmatic issues , Wheatley had physical problems in New York . He was injured and unable to perform for parts of all four of the training camps . After the 1998 season Wheatley was traded to Jimmy Johnson 's Miami Dolphins . In the February trade , the Giants were satisfied receiving a seventh round draft pick in return . 
 = = = Oakland Raiders = = = 
 The Dolphins hoped that Wheatley would compete for the starting tailback position with Abdul @-@ Karim al @-@ Jabbar , who had rushed for a league @-@ leading 15 touchdowns in 1997 but whose production had fallen off to only 6 in 1998 . However , Wheatley was cut from the Miami Dolphins training camp roster . He had only gone through one week of Dolphins training camp before being released , making him available to the Raiders . The Raiders signed Wheatley on August 4 , 1999 to help make up for the loss of Zack Crockett who suffered a broken foot . Ironically , Wheatley , the seventeenth overall selection in the 1995 NFL Draft , earned his 1999 roster spot in a battle with Rashaan Salaam , the twenty @-@ first overall selection in the 1995 NFL Draft , who had been Dan Reeves ' preferred draft choice in 1995 . Wheatley was paired in the Raiders backfield with Napoleon Kaufman , the eighteenth overall selection in the 1995 NFL Draft . 
 While in Oakland , Wheatley would achieve much greater success than he had in New York . Wheatley rushed for 1 @,@ 000 yards in a season , led the Raiders in rushing three times , appeared in three consecutive playoffs ( including one Super Bowl ) and finished in the top @-@ 10 in the NFL for rushing touchdowns twice . Through the 2007 NFL season , Wheatley was the seventh leading rusher in Oakland Raider history with 3 @,@ 682 yards as a Raider . In his role as a Raider , Wheatley was able to contribute to some of the greatest memories in the history of the franchise . Seven of his eight career 100 @-@ yard rushing games came as a Raider . Five of these games were at the Oakland Coliseum and two were on the road against the Seattle Seahawks . None of these games came in the playoffs where his highest rushing total was 56 yards . 
 = = = = Jon Gruden era ( 1999 – 2001 ) = = = = 
 How well Wheatley complemented Napoleon Kaufman in Oakland was quickly evident to the New York media , and his newfound success was noticed when the Giants had an impotent running game in his absence . In his early years with the Raiders , Wheatley quickly made good on the promise of his potential with a combination of the power to run inside and the speed to run outside . Wheatley was quite popular in Oakland . The players liked him and his coach , Jon Gruden , even joked with him during his interviews . 
 On the field , Wheatley became an important part of a surprisingly efficient West Coast offense run by Jon Gruden . In 1999 , Wheatley was the Raiders ' leading rusher and their only running back to have more than one touchdown reception . For the first time , Wheatley had multiple 100 @-@ yard games in the same season : 100 yards on 20 rushes on October 3 against the Seattle Seahawks and 111 yards on 19 rushes on December 19 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The players gelled as a unit and not only did Wheatley have his best seasons in Oakland , but also long time NFL veterans on the Raiders amassed their best season upon his arrival . For example , Rich Gannon , an NFL veteran quarterback since 1987 , made his first four Pro Bowl appearances with Wheatley as a weapon . The team only compiled an 8 – 8 record , however . 
 Wheatley had the best season of his career in the 2000 as Raiders went 12 – 4 and reached the American Football Conference championship game of the 2000 – 01 NFL playoffs . Wheatley amassed 1 @,@ 046 yards rushing and 9 touchdowns on 232 carries and added 20 receptions for 156 yards . Wheatley combined effectively with Kaufman to form an inside and outside attacking combination in these first two years . Wheatley ’ s 4 @.@ 5 yards per carry ranked ninth in the NFL . Not only did Wheatley amass a career @-@ high three 100 @-@ yard rushing games that season , but he also had his three highest career single @-@ game performances : 156 yards on only 15 carries on October 22 at home against the Seattle Seahawks , 146 yards on December 16 at Seattle and 112 yards on November 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs . The 100 @-@ yard performances against Seattle were his second and third in his first four games against them as a Raider . In the playoffs , Wheatley only posted a total of 63 yards rushing on 31 carries and one reception for four yards in two home playoff games . On January 6 , 2001 , Wheatley posted what would turn out to be his career ( seven career games ) playoff high 56 yards rushing and his only playoff touchdown . In the January 14 conference championship against the Baltimore Ravens he only rushed for 7 yards on 12 carries . 
 In 2001 , with the arrival of Jerry Rice and Charlie Garner , the offense focused on the passing game , running five more pass attempts per game than the year before . The team produced two 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard receivers with Rice amassing 1 @,@ 139 yards and Tim Brown totaling 1 @,@ 165 yards . Garner led the team in rushing and accumulated 72 receptions . Meanwhile , Wheatley only started three games and accumulated only 12 receptions over the course of the season . For the first time as a Raider , Wheatley went an entire season without a 100 @-@ yard rushing game . The team went 10 – 6 and returned to the 2001 – 02 NFL playoffs , but Wheatley only had 88 carries during the regular season despite tying Zack Crockett for the running back leadership with 6 touchdowns . In the first round wild card game , Wheatley posted his second highest playoff total of 37 yards . In Wheatley 's first and only career road playoff game , he only posted five yards rushing on four carries . 
 = = = = Bill Callahan era ( 2002 – 2003 ) = = = = 
 Under new coach Bill Callahan , the 2002 Raiders became more reliant on Garner as the primary running back . Again , Rice and Brown were primary targets for Gannon who , while having his best season with 4 @,@ 689 yards , did not use Wheatley as a receiver as much as other players . Wheatley had more carries than in 2001 , but did not start a single game and did not see the end zone often . Again , Wheatley went an entire season without a 100 @-@ yard rushing game . However , as a role player he was able to play in three 2002 – 03 playoff games including the 2003 Super Bowl against former coach Gruden . As in his previous seasons , Wheatley posted his best playoff numbers in his first game , this time 30 yards on only four carries . A week later on January 19 , 2003 , Wheatley had his final post @-@ season carry , a 5 @-@ yard run on his only carry of the game . In Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26 , Wheatley 's only touch came on a seven @-@ yard reception . Although the Raiders did not win the Super Bowl , Tyrone Wheatley was re @-@ signed . 
 In 2003 , Wheatley reclaimed his role as the Raiders ' leading rusher although Garner , the second leading rusher , continued to be the target of more passes and Crockett made it to the end zone as a rusher as often as Wheatley and Garner combined . Wheatley became the sixth person to lead the Raiders franchise in rushing yards three times ( Clem Daniels , Marv Hubbard , Mark van <unk> , Marcus Allen , Napoleon Kaufman ) . The 2003 Raiders fell to 4 – 12 and had no 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard receivers or runners . Wheatley ’ s only 100 @-@ yard rushing game came on November 16 at home against the Minnesota Vikings . 
 Wheatley 's name and those of several of his teammates were found on the list of clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co @-@ operative ( BALCO ) that had given performance @-@ enhancing drugs to Marion Jones and others . As a result , he , and teammates Chris Hetherington , Dana Stubblefield , and Chris Cooper were called to testify before a 2003 federal grand jury investigating a laboratory that produces nutritional supplements . Johnnie Morton was called before the same jury . Wheatley , Stubblefield , and Morton all declined to comment . This court appearance in the BALCO hearings was notable for Wheatley 's assault of a freelance photographer who attempted to take Wheatley 's photo outside the Philip Burton Federal Building just after Wheatley had informed the KNTV cameraman that he would sue anyone who took his picture . 
 = = = = Norv Turner era ( 2004 ) = = = = 
 Although Wheatley 's 2003 performance had been modest compared with the other seasons that he led the Raiders in rushing ( 1999 , 2000 ) , it was sufficient to convince the Raiders that they did not need to re @-@ sign the pass catching running back Charlie Garner for the 2004 season with the new coach Norv Turner . The 2004 Raiders used a platoon of five runners ( Wheatley , Crockett , Justin Fargas , J. R. Redmond and Amos <unk> ) who all rushed for between 100 and 500 yards and caught between 10 and 40 passes . Wheatley compiled his final 100 @-@ yard rushing game on September 26 in week 3 of the season at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with 102 yards on 18 carries . This was the earliest point in the season Wheatley had rushed for 100 yards in a game as a professional . Wheatley 's career ended in week 12 of the season on November 28 , 2004 in a 25 – 24 win over the Denver Broncos with an injury that was first described as an injured hamstring . The hamstring tear turned out to be acute . Wheatley had been under contract until 2009 with a 2005 base salary of $ 800 @,@ 000 and a 2006 base salary of $ 2 million . 
 = = Coaching = = 
 Unable to adequately rehabilitate his hamstring , Wheatley retired from the NFL and returned to Ann Arbor , Michigan . At the University of Michigan , in 2005 , he volunteered as a track coach while finishing his Bachelor 's degree in sport management . In November 2006 , Wheatley was hired at his alma mater , Robichaud High School , as the track coach . After taking Robichaud to their first conference title he was also hired as the football coach . To prepare for his coaching duties he partook in Jon Gruden 's NFL minority coaching internship by working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a NFL Minority coaching fellow during the 2006 training camp . As football coach in 2007 , Wheatley started with a 6 – 1 record before facing the team 's rival , the undefeated Inkster High School . Despite losing on the field to Inkster , the team was credited with a forfeit victory and compiled an 8 – 1 regular season record . The team achieved its first berth in 13 years in the MHSAA Class B playoffs , one year after going 0 – 9 . The team won its first round playoff match against Dearborn Heights Annapolis High School and lost its second to Milan High School to finish with a 9 – 2 record . The team last won the MHSAA title in 1990 during Wheatley 's senior season with a 12 – 1 record . During Wheatley 's absence the team was a state semifinalist in 1991 with a 10 – 2 record and made a playoff appearance in 1994 . In addition to coaching , Wheatley has worked as an athletic trainer to about 30 clients . 
 In 2008 , he joined John Fontes ' coaching staff as an assistant coach for Team Michigan in the All American Football League . He was to serve as the running backs coach for the team in the league that planned to begin play in April 2008 . However , the league never materialized . Wheatley interned as an NFL Minority coaching fellow with the Pittsburgh Steelers during the summer of 2008 training camp . He also served at the Rising Stars Football Camp as an assistant instructor . In late August 2008 , he became the assistant coach at Ohio Northern University , with responsibility for the team 's running backs . After the end of Wheatley 's coaching internship at the conclusion of the season , he was hired by Ron English as a running backs coach at Eastern Michigan University for the 2009 season . In February 2010 , he was hired to replace Roger Harriott on Doug Marrone 's staff at Syracuse University . In 2013 , he left Syracuse , along with Marrone , to join the Buffalo Bills , Wheatley 's first NFL coaching position . 
 In 2015 , Tyrone decided to return to his alma mater and coach the running backs at the University of Michigan on the staff for the new Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh .

 The Climax Series ( <unk> , <unk> Shirīzu ) is the annual playoff system employed by Japan 's Nippon Professional Baseball ( NPB ) . It determines which two teams from the Central League ( CL ) and the Pacific League ( PL ) will compete in the Japan Series for the national championship . Since the creation of the NPB 's two @-@ league system in 1950 , the leagues have used several different methods to determine entry to the Japan Series . The current system has been used since the 2007 season . 
 Both leagues play a 144 @-@ game regular season , after which the top three teams in each league compete against one another in a two @-@ stage playoff . In Stage 1 , the teams that finish the regular season with the second- and third @-@ best records play one another in a best @-@ of @-@ three series . The winners of these three @-@ game series advance to Stage 2 to face each league 's regular @-@ season champion in a six @-@ game series , which the regular @-@ season champion starts with a one @-@ game advantage . The winners of each league 's Stage 2 series compete against one another in that year 's Japan Series . 
 = = History = = 
 Since the creation of the NPB 's two @-@ league system , the regular @-@ season winner of the CL had always advanced to the Japan Series , where it competed against the PL champion . The PL used the same system until 1973 , when the league created NPB 's only postseason play prior to 2004 ( other than the Japan Series ) . This system matched the team with the best first @-@ half record against the team with the best second @-@ half record . The winner of this best @-@ of @-@ five series advanced to the Japan Series , where they played against the CL champion . This system proved problematic when the Hankyu Braves won both the first and second halves of the 1976 and 1978 seasons , making a playoff series unnecessary . The system was eliminated after the 1982 season . Instead , the PL announced the following season that the first- and second @-@ place teams would compete in a best @-@ of @-@ five playoff series after the 130 @-@ game regular season if five or fewer games separated the two teams . Unpopular with most baseball media and fans , the idea was scrapped after three seasons with a series never needing to be played . The two leagues returned to sending the team with the best regular season record in their respective league to compete against each other in the championship series . 
 = = = Pacific League playoffs = = = 
 In February 2003 , the PL board of directors agreed to reintroduce a playoff system to be used for the 2004 NPB season . If a first @-@ place team had a substantial lead in the standings nearing the end of the regular season , there was no pennant race and little excitement until the Japan Series began . The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league 's popularity . The new postseason plan initiated a two @-@ stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed . In Stage 1 , the teams that finished the newly shortened , 135 @-@ game regular season with the second- and third @-@ best records played each other in a best @-@ of @-@ three series . The winner of this series faced the league 's top finisher in the second and final stage . The Stage 2 winner advanced to the Japan Series , where they competed against the CL 's first @-@ place team . 
 Originally , the top finisher in the league at the end of the season was supposed to receive home @-@ field advantage throughout Stage 2 , but in August 2003 , PL officials announced that if the first @-@ place team led the second @-@ place team by more than five games at the end of the regular season , that team would also receive a one @-@ game winning advantage in Stage 2 's best @-@ of @-@ five series . For the 2006 season , PL officials removed the five @-@ game lead requirement in favor of automatically awarding the first @-@ place team the one @-@ win advantage . In conjunction with this change , the first @-@ place team no longer had home @-@ field advantage for the entirety of Stage 2 ; instead , the remaining four games were to be split evenly between both teams ' stadiums . This rule change became a non @-@ factor after the eventual first @-@ place Hokkaido Nippon @-@ Ham Fighters clinched a Japan Series berth in two straight games . 
 During the three years of the PL 's playoff system , the winner of the PL 's postseason tournament competed against the CL team who finished the regular season with the best record . The disparity between the two leagues ' postseasons provoked some criticism from baseball analysts . During the 2005 Japan Series , The Japan Times ' Stephen <unk> called NPB 's unbalanced postseason a " bad system " and believed that the CL 's decision to not implement a playoff system of their own was " foolish " . Citing the Hanshin Tigers ' poor Japan Series performance , he speculated that the CL 's lack of postseason play was a disadvantage . <unk> believed that the 17 days between their last regular @-@ season game and the first Japan Series game did nothing to prepare the Tigers for the eventual championship series against the Chiba Lotte Marines , who had played continuously . 
 = = = Climax Series creation = = = 
 The CL had situational playoff scenarios written into its bylaws that required either a tie in the standings or a team with more wins finishing with a worse winning percentage than the top team , but a permanent playoff plan had never been created . In March 2006 , encouraged by the success of the PL 's playoff series , CL officials announced their intention to introduce postseason playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance . During meetings held later that year , PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system . Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004 , the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record . The PL disapproved of the CL 's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first @-@ place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete against in the Japan Series , as the PL had been awarding its pennant to its playoff champion . 
 In September 2006 , both leagues agreed on a unified postseason system . The CL implemented a playoff system identical to the PL 's , and the entire playoff series was dubbed the " Climax Series " . The PL agreed to name the regular season first @-@ place finishers league champions rather than the team that won the leagues ' respective playoffs — a reversal from the previous three seasons . It was decided that both leagues would play 144 regular @-@ season games , the first time both leagues would play the same number of games since the PL introduced its playoff system in 2004 . The two leagues agreed that neither regular @-@ season champion should receive a one @-@ game advantage in Stage 2 of the Climax Series , claiming that it was unnecessary from a business point of view . This decision was overturned when each league awarded its champion a one @-@ win advantage in Stage 2 starting with the 2008 Climax Series . At the same time , the series became a best @-@ of @-@ six series , where the first team to win four games advances to the Japan Series . This format has drawn some criticism , with some players describing the rule as " unfair " , " bull " and " messed up " , but it is still in use . 
 = = Current format = = 
 Both leagues employ the same two @-@ series playoff format , with the top three teams from each league participating in their own two @-@ stage playoff . If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records , the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed to advance to the playoffs , unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record . This contrasts with Major League Baseball ( MLB ) , which employs a one @-@ game playoff , or other professional leagues that may use head @-@ to @-@ head season records ( and further tiebreakers such as non @-@ interleague play records , second half records , et al . ) . The first series , Stage 1 , is a best @-@ of @-@ three series involving the regular season 's second- and third @-@ place finishers , with all games played at the second @-@ place team 's home field . The winner of this series goes on to face the league 's pennant @-@ winner in Stage 2 . This series is best @-@ of @-@ six . The league champion is awarded a one @-@ win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series , unlike most professional leagues where a 5 @-@ game playoff series runs 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 or 2 @-@ 3 or a 7 @-@ game playoff series that runs 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game . The winning teams advance to the Japan Series , where they compete against one another . Unlike MLB , NPB games may end in a tie if there is no winner after 12 innings of play . If a Climax Series game results in a tie , the win is credited to neither team . If this causes the series to end in a tie , the team who finished higher in the regular @-@ season standings advances , unless if both teams finished with the same regular @-@ season record . If both teams finished with the same regular season record , the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance .

" He recounts how the Chinese discovered methods of preserving pork bellies around 1500 B.C. By the first century A.D. , Romans had established a practice of breeding hogs for the production of bacon . During the Middle Ages , bacon and beans was considered a staple food for the poor . According to Villas , bacon was eaten aboard the Mayflower , and was a staple food product in the early American colonies . Villas describes how Oscar F.

 " The Uncertainty Principle " was written by Kevin Hopps and directed by Dave Bullock . It originally aired on the Kids WB ! block for The CW on May 10 , 2008 , at 10 : 00 a.m. Eastern / Pacific time . It proceeded a repeat of the episode " Catalysts , " which marked the introduction of Green Goblin into the series . The episode 's title , " The Uncertainty Principle , " expands the series theme " The Education of Peter Parker " chosen by developer Greg Weisman . Episodes in the third season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on chemistry . 
 Hopps , who had previously written for animated series such as Buzz Lightyear of Star Command , Justice League , and Darkwing Duck , researched for the episode by re @-@ reading every available comic book that featured Green Goblin . Hopps notes that " you might consider him [ Green Goblin ] crazed , but he 's truly brilliant and has thought things out far in advance . He 's always several steps ahead of where you think he is . So while I 'm writing Goblin , I 'm always trying to keep in mind where he 's going next . " While penning the fight sequence between Goblin and Spider @-@ Man , Hopps paid close attention to brawls detailed in " Catalysts " in order to better grasp " how we could make it different and really up the stakes . " 
 The episode served as the conclusion of the Green Goblin storyline for the first season that started with " Catalysts . " In the climax , Spider @-@ Man supposedly discovers that Harry has been the Goblin the whole time after stealing the experimental Goblin formula from OsCorp . The second season finale , " Final Curtain , " would disprove this revelation and explain that Norman was in fact the actual Green Goblin and he had pitted the blame on his son after learning he had been taking the formula secretly . The episode also revealed that the Chameleon had been impersonating Norman so he could secretly be the Goblin without raising suspicion . The writers had planned the revelation since the series began . 
 " The Uncertainty Principle " became available on the DVD The Spectacular Spider @-@ Man , Volume 3 , on March 17 , 2009 , alongside the episodes " Catalysts " and " Reaction . " The volume featured episodes that detailed Green Goblin as a prominent character .

 Writing for DVD Talk , reviewer Justin Felix considered setting the episode on Halloween to be " a nice touch . " Tim Janson of Mania named it among the best episodes of the season , describing it as " a Halloween episode complete with a gothic setting .

 On 12 April 2012 , a coup d 'état in Guinea @-@ Bissau was staged by elements of the armed forces about two weeks before the second round of a presidential election between Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá . The coup started in the evening with military personnel and equipment making its way onto the streets , followed by the state @-@ owned media taken off @-@ air . 
 Both second @-@ round candidates and the incumbent president were initially arrested by the junta . Members of the Military Council , which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April , said that one of the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration 's call for Angola help to reform the military . Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta , an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election , Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo , selected as interim president . The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at least two years into the future . An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea @-@ Bissau in the meantime .

 The media and international think @-@ tanks have highlighted the country 's instability and labelled it a <unk> . The country has frequently featured military involvement in civil administration since independence . As such , the events leading up to the 2012 coup include military unrest in 2010 and a failed coup attempt in 2011 . The latter followed infighting between the country 's Navy and the Army . Guinea @-@ Bissau 's instability is also exacerbated as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America to Europe and there are allegations that government ministers and military personnel are bribed to keep silent . 
 Following the death of President Malam <unk> <unk> on 9 January 2012 , a new election was scheduled to be held within 90 days in accordance with the constitution . Despite a peaceful campaign , there were external fears of possible violence or a coup d 'état if the army did not approve of the winner . In this regard , UN Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon called for a " peaceful , orderly and transparent " election . Just before the attack , presidential candidate Kumba Ialá , who claimed to have ties with members of his <unk> ethnic group , who are the largest ethnicity in the military , warned of " consequences " if there was campaigning for the second round of the election due to his allegations of fraud in the first round that were unanswered . The first round result was rejected by five of the nine candidates . Campaigning was due to start on 13 April for the second round , until its disruption as a result of the coup d 'état . 
 Days before the coup , fellow Lusophone country Angola announced its forces would be ending the two @-@ year @-@ old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau ( MISSANG ) that followed a similar failed effort by the European Union as part of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea @-@ Bissau ( <unk> ) . State @-@ owned Angolan news agency <unk> said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea @-@ Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces . On 16 April , Guinea @-@ Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van @-@ <unk> and the Army Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff Geraldo <unk> Nunda . He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School ( ESG ) and the Higher Technical Military Institute ( <unk> ) . The same day as the coup , the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements . Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution .

 According to Portugal 's SIC Notícias , a day before the coup an unidentified military commander claimed Gomes Júnior would allow Angolan troops into the country . He also claimed that soldiers possessed a " secret document " that allowed the Guinea @-@ Bissau government to sanction an Angolan attack on Guinea @-@ Bissau 's military . The leaders of the junta released an unsigned communique that read they " did not have ambitions of power " and that the coup was a reaction to the alleged agreement with Angola because the 200 military trainers would " annihilate Guinea @-@ Bissau 's armed forces . " The spokesman for the junta that took over after the coup , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Daha Bana na Walna later said that Gomes Júnior and Pereira were ousted because of " unease " in the armed forces over the election , a sentiment echoed by diplomats . Gomes Junior was also viewed as the " candidate of Angola " in the election , according to Chatham House 's Africa director Alex Vines . He also said that the months leading up to the events featured media commentary and hostility towards Angola .

 On 12 April , gunfire was heard between 19 : 00 and 21 : 00 , as mutinous troops attempted to overthrow the government by seizing control of the centre of the capital Bissau . Initial reports by diplomats in the country said presidential candidate Carlos Gomes Júnior and interim President Raimundo Pereira were missing . The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde ( PAIGC ) and radio stations . They also fought police officers loyal to the government , forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs . The soldiers blocked the roads into and out of the capital city and the national radio and television was taken off @-@ air at 20 : 00 . 
 The perpetrators of the coup targeted Gomes Júnior 's residence , which was attacked by grenades and surrounded by troops , as gunfire was heard nearby . Journalists were also prevented from approaching the scene . Camilo Lima da Costa , the son of the head of the national election commission <unk> Lima da Costa , told RDP África , one of the radio stations still broadcasting , that the soldiers had looted his father 's house but that both his parents were safe . Soldiers ransacked and looted other houses they raided as well . Soldiers also sealed off the embassies to prevent members of the government from fleeing and hiding with foreign diplomats . Several unnamed politicians were arrested during the night by the army . 
 Peter Thompson , the head of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election , described the situation on the night of the coup as " a very large presence of the military in the streets . It did seem quite coordinated last night in terms of how the roads were shut off ... Today the streets are very calm , the city is much quieter than it normally would be . People are staying home . I do know that the army has taken control of the state media and state television , and they haven 't released anything official . " There was speculation on Senegal 's <unk> radio by reporter Noah <unk> that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same <unk> ethnic group as Ialá Embaló . 
 An unnamed number of government ministers , as well as the Director General of the Judicial Police João <unk> , were in hiding . Interior Minister Fernando Gomes , who may have been in the custody of the mutinous soldiers , said he " feared for his life . " On 14 April , Lusa journalist Antonio Aly Silva told the outlet that he had been arrested for a short while , but was later released at the same time as singer Dulce Neves and many of Gomes Junior 's bodyguards . Senegal closed its land border with Guinea @-@ Bissau on 13 April . 
 People began to venture out of their homes at dawn and there appeared to be little to no presence of soldiers on the streets and no messages over radio or television from either the government or the coup leaders . There was an " unusual " quiet in Bissau , although photographs showed a big hole in Gomes Júnior 's residence as a result of the attack . Soldiers were seen standing guard outside radio and television stations , including the state @-@ run television office , and the presidential offices in Bissau . An overnight curfew was imposed the following day with orders for the members of the civilian government to turn themselves over to the army . Private radio stations were also shut . On 14 April , some businesses started to reopen but they closed early in accordance with the curfew .

 The coup leaders formed the " Military Command " under the leadership of the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces General Mamadu Ture Kuruma . The next day , they put forth conditions for a national unity government after having announced the ousting of Gomes Júnior . Its goals were : the removal of obstacles to reforming the security sector ; fighting against drug trafficking and consumption ; overcoming a culture of immunity ; and the continuation of enhancing the democratic process . 
 The interim President Raimundo Pereira and the Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff of the Armed Forces General Antonio Indjai were " under the control of the army , " however there were rumours circulating that Indjai could be hiding and that soldiers were going to every embassy looking for him . Indjai 's spokesman Daba <unk> said that <unk> and Gomes Júnior were " well and alive " and added that " the [ army chief @-@ of @-@ staff ] thinks , for the sake of the country , that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have [ the military ] play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis . " The Military Command later announced that they were also holding Ialá Embaló . The detained officials were later released . The UN later reported that the head of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission were also in hiding , along with three unnamed cabinet ministers . 
 Senior officers of the army also met the leaders of the political parties and called on them to form the transitional government , but added that the army would control the defence and interior ministries . The meeting was also attended by : Indjai , who was later arrested ; the deputy chief @-@ of @-@ staff General Mamadu Ture Kuruma ; the heads of the army , air force and navy ; the army 's spokesman Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Daha Bana na Walna and four colonels ; however there was no one from the incumbent PAIGC . Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra @-@ parliamentary parties discussed issues such as : a transitional government including , an interim president and head of the National Assembly , as well as a PAIGC @-@ nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties ; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) under interim leadership . 
 The five leading opposition candidates ( Mohamed Ialá Embaló , Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo , Henrique Rosa , <unk> <unk> , and Vicente Fernandes ) announced at a joint news conference that the boycott of the second round of the election would be in the name of " justice . " <unk> <unk> of Union for Change , who also attended the meeting , said that " the military chiefs suggested the idea of new presidential and legislative elections . " The spokesman for the coalition of opposition parties , Fernando Vaz , said that discussion continued for a third day and that the grouping had invited PAIGC to participate . After the meeting the coalition agreed upon a set of proposals to put forward to the Military Command for a transitional unity government . 
 There were some small protests supporting Gomes Junior in downtown Bissau , although , according to Peter Thompson , soldiers arrested several of the protesters and put roadblocks on the streets . PAIGC , commenting on the transitional government , said that it " rejects any anti @-@ constitutional or anti @-@ democratic proposal of a solution to the crisis , " while also calling for the release of those detained . Tensions mounted within PAIGC between factions supporting Gomes Junior and Nhamadjo . On 15 April , a demonstration of about 30 people at the National Assembly , where talks on a transition government were ongoing , was dispersed by soldiers . The National Union of Workers of Guinea @-@ Bissau , which has a membership of about 8 @,@ 000 mostly civil servants , called for a general strike the next day . 
 On 16 April , an agreement , which intentionally excluded PAIGC , was reached with 22 of the 35 opposition parties to set up a National Transitional Council . According to Vaz , the size , composition and mandate period would be determined the following day and then discussed with the Military Command . He also said that existing institutions would be dissolved and that two committees would run the country , one would manage foreign affairs and the other would handle social affairs . The former committee was due to meet the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) the following day . The transitional civilian government will rule up to two years before new elections will be held . National Assembly speaker Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo , who had previously rejected the office of interim president in April 2012 , was again selected as interim president on 11 May 2012 . <unk> Djaló was the speaker of the NTC .

 At an ECOWAS summit in Ivory Coast convened to discuss the Malian crisis , Foreign Minister Mamadu <unk> Djaló Pires , upon learning of the events unfolding in his country , called for international support as " the situation is serious . The soldiers are occupying the streets . I spoke to the interim Prime Minister [ <unk> Djaló <unk> ] and she said she was under fire " and added that the international community should have an " energetic reaction " to the coup . Pires also dismissed claims that Indjai was arrested suggesting that he was , in fact , a part of it ( he was also involved in the 2010 military unrest before being appointed chief @-@ of @-@ staff ) .

 During the early hours of the event , the Foreign Minister of Ivory Coast ( the host country of ECOWAS ) Daniel <unk> Duncan said that the " information indicates to us that there is a coup underway . ECOWAS formally and rigorously condemns such an attempted coup d 'etat , " he added that " it 's sad that after the example of Senegal , where the elections finished so well , that we have , after Mali , a new forceful intervention in Guinea @-@ Bissau . What I can say at this moment is that ... the situation won 't be accepted by ECOWAS . " ECOWAS Commission President <unk> Désiré <unk> issued a statement that read : " The commission firmly denounces this latest incursion by the military into politics and unreservedly condemns the irresponsible act , which has once more demonstrated their penchant to maintain Guinea @-@ Bissau as a failed state . " ECOWAS later decided to send a contingent of military personnel in order to provide security . The delegation , which would also include civilians , would be led by Guinean President Alpha Condé . ECOWAS also said the election runoff should go ahead . ECOWAS constitutes a contact group , chaired by Nigeria and comprising delegations from Benin , Cape Verde , Gambia , Guinea , Senegal and Togo , to coordinate its efforts at resolving the crisis . ECOWAS also had a <unk> force to fill a vacuum that could be left by the departing MISSANG force , as well as considering International Criminal Court recommendations . 
 The United Nations Security Council ( which included fellow Lusophone country Portugal ) unanimously condemned the coup with a resolution that stated " the forcible seizure of power from the legitimate government of Guinea @-@ Bissau by some elements of its armed forces . [ We ] firmly denounce this incursion by the military into politics " . The President of the UNSC , U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice , said " the [ UN ] Secretariat urged the international community to address the cycle of violence and impunity in Guinea @-@ Bissau " and also called for " the immediate restoration of civilian authority ... [ We ] note with profound regret that these events are occurring just prior to the launch of the campaign for the second round of the presidential election " . Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said that he was " extremely concerned " about the arrests of the civilian leadership , while his spokesman Martin <unk> said that Ki @-@ Moon called for the mutineers " to immediately and unconditionally release all detainees and ensure the safety and security of the general population . " The UNSC unanimously voted to " restore constitutional order " in the country and approved Resolution 2048 with sanctions , including issuing travel bans on the diplomatic passports , on five members of the military junta on 18 May . The five members sanctioned were : General Antonio Indjai , Major General Mamadu Ture Kuruma , Inspector @-@ General of the Armed Forces General <unk> na Mena , Chief of Staff of the Air Force Brigadier General <unk> Camara and MC spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Daha Bana na Walna . In December , the UNSC expressed concern over the transition process back towards civilian administration . The UN recommended steps to ensuring a " way forward " entailed : mediation between national actors , targeted sanctions on the perpetrators , the deployment of training and protections forces in accordance with the ECOWAS / CPLP road map or the recommendation of the incumbent prime minister and foreign minister for a peacekeeping force . 
 The Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( CPLP ) called an extraordinary meeting to take place in Lisbon on 14 April . The meeting was to be attended by the foreign ministers of the member countries : Angola 's Georges Rebelo <unk> , Brazil 's Antonio Patriota , Guinea @-@ Bissau 's Mamadou <unk> Pires , Mozambique 's <unk> Julio Marques <unk> and Portugal 's Paulo Portas . The CPLP also condemned the coup and exhorted the UN , African Union ( AU ) and ECOWAS to work towards restoring the " constitutional order " of Guinea @-@ Bissau . They further called for a cessation of military actions that threatened the state or the " legality " of Guinea @-@ Bissau . At the CPLP meet in Lisbon , Pires had said that the " persecution is continuing . " The CPLP later issued a statement of condemnation and also called for a UN @-@ authorised military intervention saying that it had " take [ n ] the initiative of ... forming an interposition force in Guinea @-@ Bissau , with a mandate defined by the United Nations Security Council " that would seek to maintain " constitutional order , protect civilians and the country 's legitimate institutions . " It added that it supported the Angolan presence in the country and the initiate would be carried out according to consultations with ECOWAS , the AU and the EU . Rifts developed between ECOWAS and CPLP over the resolution mechanisms . The former , supported by Nigeria , Senegal , Côte d 'Ivoire and Burkina Faso , advocated a year @-@ long transitional process ; while the later , supported by Portugal and Angola , advocated an immediate resumption of the election . 
 The African Union Commission 's chairperson Jean Ping said that he condemned the " outrageous acts which undermine the efforts to stabilise the situation in Guinea @-@ Bissau and tarnish the image of the country and Africa . " In mid @-@ May , Guinea @-@ Bissau was suspended from the AU . A spokesman for the European Union 's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said that " the EU has already suspended most of its aid to Guinea @-@ Bissau " and called on the Military Command to release the detained leaders and restore the " legitimate government . " Ekmeleddin <unk> , the Secretary @-@ General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , called the coup a " heinous and unacceptable act " , adding that it would hinder security and the democratic process as it had occurred weeks before the runoff . He also called for the detained politicians to be released . Meanwhile , on 24 April the African Union Peace and Security Council ministerial meeting met at its headquarters in Addis Ababa to discuss matters pertaining to resolving the crisis in the country .

 Angolan Defense Minister Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van @-@ <unk> said that Angola will " continue to provide full support [ to Guinea @-@ Bissau because of ] excellent ties , " adding that the withdrawal date for the troops was being discussed . On 1 October , the UN Ambassador Ismael <unk> Gaspar Martins said that it was seeking a solution to " normalisation of constitutional order " through the work of the UNSC , AU , CPLP and ECOWAS . 
 Angola 's Lusa reported that Portugal , the former coloniser , issued advisories to its citizens to stay in their homes It also rejected claims of an " untoward " attitude by Angola . A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that " the Portuguese government is appealing for a halt to the violence and respect for the law . " Portas later called for the detained civilian leadership to be released . Defence Minister José Pedro Aguiar @-@ Branco said that the Portuguese military was ready to evacuate its citizens . " It is our responsibility and our job to ensure adequate preparedness in the event that the evacuation be necessary . " Portugal also issued a travel warning for its citizens . On 15 April , it was announced that two naval vessels and an aircraft were on their way to somewhere in West Africa ready for a possible evacuation of 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 Portuguese citizens . On 1 October , Portugal 's UN Ambassador José Filipe Moraes Cabral echoed the statement of Angola at the same meeting . 
 Fellow Lusophone countries Brazil and Timor Leste also reacted to the events , with Brazil 's Ministry of External Relations expressing their " preoccupation " with the events and saying that it would call for an extraordinary meeting of the UNSC to discuss the issue . Timor Leste 's President José Ramos @-@ Horta said that " the situation in Guinea @-@ Bissau , which I have followed over the years , is extraordinarily complex , dangerous , because it can degrade into more violence , and the country is not in a position to afford that new setback in the peace process and its democratisation . " He also offered to mediate the crisis . His offer was accepted on 16 April . 
 Guinean Foreign Minister Edouard <unk> Lama called for " restoration of peace and stability " and of " all democratic institutions , " when speaking at the General debate of the sixty @-@ seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) . Liberian President Ellen Johnson <unk> also criticised the " unconstitutional unraveling , of democratic governments " at the UNGA . Namibian President <unk> <unk> said at the UNGA General debate that he denounced the " unconstitutional changes " and praised ECOWAS for its work in trying to resolve the issue . Nigeria also condemned the coup and President <unk> Jonathan also told the UNGA General debate : " Guinea @-@ Bissau is another flash point of instability in the sub @-@ region in which Nigeria and ECOWAS are engaged . Indeed , the Contact Group , headed by Nigeria was set up by the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS to help establish a transitional government with a view to returning that country to political and constitutional order . In furtherance of this objective , Nigeria provided the sum of 10 million US dollars to the Interim Government in Guinea @-@ Bissau to assist in the stabilisation of the country . " Russia called for the restoration of the civilian government . 
 Canada condemned the coup ; while the United States ' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said , " We call for the release of all government leaders and urge all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process . " The United States ' embassy issued a statement that read : " It is regrettable that elements of the Bissau @-@ Guinean military have chosen to derail the democratic process in Guinea @-@ Bissau . " At a daily press briefing , the State Department spokesman Mark <unk> called on all sides to the conflict to " put down their weapons , release government leaders immediately and restore legitimate civilian leadership , " adding that it " appeared the junta had taken control of media outlets , as they were off @-@ air and the headquarters of PAIGC and were trying to restrict movement " and that " we regret that they have chosen to disrupt the democratic process , which already was challenged by the opposition 's call to boycott the second round of elections . " The State Department also issued a travel warning to the country and called on its citizens already in the country " to shelter in place and avoid the downtown area of Bissau . "

 On 9 June , the last police and armed forces personnel of the MISSANG mission left the country . In late August , the Commissioner for Natural resources , Environment and Rural Development <unk> <unk> announced the Union had approved a loan of 15 billion CFA francs to the country for security system reforms . However , the spokesman of the transitional government , Fernando Vaz , also announced that an agreement with Angola Bauxite to build a deepwater port so as to export bauxite would need to be renegotiated as " the agreement signed in 2007 by the government of Carlos Gomes Junior is not fair ... As a result , the terms of the agreement must be reviewed . The transitional government will not accept that Bissau receives 10 percent [ of revenues ] while Angola Bauxite takes 90 percent . " The project , which had been inaugurated in July 2011 , had previously stalled prior to the coup as a result of concern over political instability and an environmental impact study that had not yet been published despite passing the deadline . If completed the port at <unk> would have a capacity to host three 70 @-@ tonne vessels at any given time , while the project as a whole would also lead to the creation of a three million tonne @-@ a @-@ year mine in Boe . 
 By the end of the year the New York Times reported an increase in drug trafficking in the country and thus calling the events " cocaine coup ; " it also cited a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration employee as saying the country is " probably the worst narco @-@ state that ’ s out there on the continent . [ Guinea @-@ Bissau is ] a major problem [ for the U.S.A. ] . People at the highest levels of the military are involved in the facilitation [ of trafficking ] .

The head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for West and Central Africa Pierre <unk> also said : " There has clearly been an increase in Guinea @-@ Bissau in the last several months . We are seeing more and more drugs regularly arriving in this country ; " while the EU 's ambassador to the country Joaquin Gonzalez @-@ <unk> added : " As a country it is controlled by those who formed the coup d ’ état .

 On 21 October , soldiers again attacked an army barracks in what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government . It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau . Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions that he was the power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying : " People say I ’ m a drug trafficker . Anybody who has the proof , present it ! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs . " Gonzalez @-@ <unk> then responded : " I can 't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking . " The U.S. State Department 's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea @-@ Bissau Russell Hanks , who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau @-@ Guinean Civil War in 1998 , said : " You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement , not by isolation . These are the people who came in to pick up the pieces after the coup . " His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces . Chief of Guinea @-@ Bissau 's judicial police João <unk> reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai 's farm . He also added that " The traffickers know [ our judicial authority ] can 't do much . The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat .

 A planet is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that 
 is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity , 
 is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and 
 has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals . 
 The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain " planets " under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans @-@ Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such . 
 The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions . Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times , it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei . By careful analysis of the observation data , Johannes Kepler found the planets ' orbits were not circular but elliptical . As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , the planets rotated around tilted axes , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . Since the dawn of the Space Age , close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism , hurricanes , tectonics , and even hydrology . 
 Planets are generally divided into two main types : large low @-@ density giant planets , and smaller rocky terrestrials . Under IAU definitions , there are eight planets in the Solar System . In order of increasing distance from the Sun , they are the four terrestrials , Mercury , Venus , Earth , and Mars , then the four giant planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites . 
 More than two thousand planets around other stars ( " extrasolar planets " or " exoplanets " ) have been discovered in the Milky Way . As of 15 July 2016 , 3 @,@ 472 known extrasolar planets in 2 @,@ 597 planetary systems ( including 589 multiple planetary systems ) , ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered , out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth , nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun , i.e. in the habitable zone . On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth @-@ sized extrasolar planets , Kepler @-@ <unk> and Kepler @-@ <unk> , orbiting a Sun @-@ like star , Kepler @-@ 20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1 @.@ 6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way .

 = = History = = 
 The word " planet " derives from the Ancient Greek ἀστήρ <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ἀστήρ <unk> <unk> , which means " wandering star , " and originally referred to those objects in the night sky that moved relative to one another , as opposed to the " fixed stars " , which maintained a constant relative position in the sky . 
 The idea of planets has evolved over its history , from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age . The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System , but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems . The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy . 
 The five classical planets , being visible to the naked eye , have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology , religious cosmology , and ancient astronomy . In ancient times , astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars . Ancient Greeks called these lights <unk> ἀστέρες ( <unk> asteres , " wandering stars " ) or simply πλανῆται ( <unk> , " wanderers " ) , from which today 's word " planet " was derived . In ancient Greece , China , Babylon , and indeed all pre @-@ modern civilizations , it was almost universally believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all the " planets " circled Earth . The reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around Earth each day and the apparently common @-@ sense perceptions that Earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest . 
 = = = Babylon = = = 
 The first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the Babylonians , who lived in Mesopotamia in the first and second millennia BC . The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of <unk> , a 7th @-@ century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus , that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC . The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun , Moon and planets over the course of the year . The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology . The Enuma anu <unk> , written during the Neo @-@ Assyrian period in the 7th century BC , comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets . Venus , Mercury and the outer planets Mars , Jupiter and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers . These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times . 
 = = = Greco @-@ Roman astronomy = = = 
 The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the Babylonians . The Pythagoreans , in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory , which consisted of the Earth , Sun , Moon , and planets revolving around a " Central Fire " at the center of the Universe . Pythagoras or Parmenides is said to have been the first to identify the evening star ( <unk> ) and morning star ( Phosphoros ) as one and the same ( Aphrodite , Greek corresponding to Latin Venus ) . In the 3rd century BC , Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric system , according to which Earth and the planets revolved around the Sun . The geocentric system remained dominant until the Scientific Revolution . 
 By the 1st century BC , during the Hellenistic period , the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets . These schemes , which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians , would eventually eclipse the Babylonians ' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness , and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye . These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE . So complete was the domination of Ptolemy 's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries . To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets , each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy . They were , in increasing order from Earth ( in Ptolemy 's order ) : the Moon , Mercury , Venus , the Sun , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn . 
 = = = India = = = 
 In 499 CE , the Indian astronomer Aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated Earth 's rotation about its axis , which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars . He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical . Aryabhata 's followers were particularly strong in South India , where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth , among others , were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them . 
 In 1500 , Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics , in his <unk> , revised Aryabhata 's model . In his <unk> , a commentary on Aryabhata 's <unk> , he developed a planetary model where Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun , which in turn orbits Earth , similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century . Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model .

 In the 11th century , the transit of Venus was observed by Avicenna , who established that Venus was , at least sometimes , below the Sun . In the 12th century , Ibn Bajjah observed " two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun " , which was later identified as a transit of Mercury and Venus by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al @-@ Din Shirazi in the 13th century . Ibn Bajjah could not have observed a transit of Venus , because none occurred in his lifetime .

 With the advent of the Scientific Revolution , use of the term " planet " changed from something that moved across the sky ( in relation to the star field ) ; to a body that orbited Earth ( or that were believed to do so at the time ) ; and by the 18th century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the heliocentric model of Copernicus , Galileo and Kepler gained sway . 
 Thus , Earth became included in the list of planets , whereas the Sun and Moon were excluded . At first , when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century , the terms " planet " and " satellite " were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century . Until the mid @-@ 19th century , the number of " planets " rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century ( such as Ceres , Pallas , and Vesta ) were very different from the traditional ones . These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter ( the asteroid belt ) , and had a much smaller mass ; as a result they were reclassified as " asteroids " . In the absence of any formal definition , a " planet " came to be understood as any " large " body that orbited the Sun . Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets , and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846 , there was no apparent need to have a formal definition . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In the 20th century , Pluto was discovered . After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth , the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet . Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller : in 1936 , Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune , and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet . As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population , it kept its status until 2006 . 
 In 1992 , astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar , PSR B1257 + 12 . This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star . Then , on October 6 , 1995 , Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main @-@ sequence star ( 51 Pegasi ) . 
 The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet : the point at which a planet becomes a star . Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter , approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs . Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium , a heavier isotope of hydrogen . Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen , objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium . Deuterium is quite rare , and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery , making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets .

 With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars , disputes arose over what should constitute a planet . There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt , or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium . 
 A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet , because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System ( the Kuiper belt ) during the 1990s and early 2000s . Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands . 
 Some of them , such as Quaoar , Sedna , and Eris , were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet , failing to receive widespread scientific recognition . The announcement of Eris in 2005 , an object then thought of as 27 % more massive than Pluto , created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet . 
 Acknowledging the problem , the IAU set about creating the definition of planet , and produced one in August 2006 . The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit ( Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune ) , and a new class of dwarf planets was created , initially containing three objects ( Ceres , Pluto and Eris ) . 
 = = = = Extrasolar planets = = = = 
 There is no official definition of extrasolar planets . In 2003 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement , but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members . The positions statement incorporates the following guidelines , mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs : 
 Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium ( currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same isotopic abundance as the Sun ) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are " planets " ( no matter how they formed ) . The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System . 
 Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are " brown dwarfs " , no matter how they formed or where they are located . 
 Free @-@ floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not " planets " , but are " sub @-@ brown dwarfs " ( or whatever name is most appropriate ) . 
 This working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals . Although temporary , it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted . It does not address the dispute over the lower mass limit , and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System . This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs , such as <unk> . 
 One definition of a sub @-@ brown dwarf is a planet @-@ mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion . This formation distinction between a sub @-@ brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon ; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification . One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process . For example , a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free @-@ floating , and likewise a sub @-@ brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star . 
 The 13 Jupiter @-@ mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value . Large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little , and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between . In fact , calculations show that an object fuses 50 % of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 MJ . The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object , on the amount of helium and deuterium present . The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses , saying , " The fact that there is no special feature around 13 MJ in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit . " The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory : " The 13 Jupiter @-@ mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores , and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity . " The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass ( or minimum mass ) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses . 
 Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs , rather than deuterium fusion , formation process or location , is whether the core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure . 
 = = = = 2006 IAU definition of planet = = = = 
 The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the IAU 's General Assembly . After much debate and one failed proposal , 232 members of the 10 @,@ 000 member assembly , who nevertheless constituted a large majority of those remaining at the meeting , voted to pass a resolution . The 2006 resolution defines planets within the Solar System as follows : 
 A " planet " [ 1 ] is a celestial body that ( a ) is in orbit around the Sun , ( b ) has sufficient mass for its self @-@ gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium ( nearly round ) shape , and ( c ) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit . 
 [ 1 ] The eight planets are : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . 
 Under this definition , the Solar System is considered to have eight planets . Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third ( such as Ceres , Pluto , and Eris ) are classified as dwarf planets , provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets . Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include ( c ) as a criterion . After much discussion , it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets . 
 This definition is based in theories of planetary formation , in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects . As described by astronomer Steven Soter : 
 " The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies ( planets ) in either non @-@ intersecting or resonant orbits , which prevent collisions between them . Minor planets and comets , including KBOs [ Kuiper belt objects ] , differ from planets in that they can collide with each other and with planets . " 
 The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable . Astronomer Jean @-@ Luc Margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star , based on the mass of the planet , its semimajor axis , and the mass of its host star . This formula produces a value π that is greater than 1 for planets . The eight known planets and all known exoplanets have π values above 100 , while Ceres , Pluto , and Eris have π values of 0 @.@ 1 or less . Objects with π values of 1 or more are also expected to be approximately spherical , so that objects that fulfill the orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill the roundness requirement .

 The table below lists Solar System bodies once considered to be planets . 
 Beyond the scientific community , Pluto still holds cultural significance for many in the general public due to its historical classification as a planet from 1930 to 2006 . A few astronomers , such as Alan Stern , consider dwarf planets and the larger moons to be planets , based on a purely geophysical definition of planet . 
 = = Mythology and naming = = 
 The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming practices of the Romans , which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians . In ancient Greece , the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called Helios and Selene ; the farthest planet ( Saturn ) was called <unk> , the shiner ; followed by Phaethon ( Jupiter ) , " bright " ; the red planet ( Mars ) was known as Pyroeis , the " fiery " ; the brightest ( Venus ) was known as Phosphoros , the light bringer ; and the fleeting final planet ( Mercury ) was called Stilbon , the <unk> . The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods , the Olympians : Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods ; <unk> was sacred to Cronus , the Titan who fathered the Olympians ; Phaethon was sacred to Zeus , Cronus 's son who deposed him as king ; Pyroeis was given to Ares , son of Zeus and god of war ; Phosphoros was ruled by Aphrodite , the goddess of love ; and Hermes , messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit , ruled over Stilbon . 
 The Greek practice of grafting of their gods ' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians . The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love , Ishtar ; Pyroeis after their god of war , Nergal , Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu , and Phaethon after their chief god , Marduk . There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately . The translation was not perfect . For instance , the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war , and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares . Unlike Ares , Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld . 
 Today , most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods . Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets , other European languages , because of the influence of the Roman Empire and , later , the Catholic Church , use the Roman ( Latin ) names rather than the Greek ones . The Romans , who , like the Greeks , were Indo @-@ Europeans , shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given their gods . During the later period of the Roman Republic , Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon , to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable . When the Romans studied Greek astronomy , they gave the planets their own gods ' names : Mercurius ( for Hermes ) , Venus ( Aphrodite ) , Mars ( Ares ) , <unk> ( Zeus ) and Saturnus ( Cronus ) . When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries , the naming practice was retained with <unk> ( Poseidon ) . Uranus is unique in that it is named for a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart . 
 Some Romans , following a belief possibly originating in Mesopotamia but developed in Hellenistic Egypt , believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth . The order of shifts went Saturn , Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury , Moon ( from the farthest to the closest planet ) . Therefore , the first day was started by Saturn ( 1st hour ) , second day by Sun ( 25th hour ) , followed by Moon ( 49th hour ) , Mars , Mercury , Jupiter and Venus . Because each day was named by the god that started it , this is also the order of the days of the week in the Roman calendar after the <unk> cycle was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages . In English , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday are straightforward translations of these Roman names . The other days were renamed after Tiw ( Tuesday ) , <unk> ( Wednesday ) , Thunor ( Thursday ) , and <unk> ( Friday ) , the Anglo @-@ Saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to Mars , Mercury , Jupiter , and Venus , respectively . 
 Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco @-@ Roman mythology . Because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century , there is no tradition of naming it after a god . ( The same is true , in English at least , of the Sun and the Moon , though they are no longer generally considered planets . ) The name originates from the 8th century Anglo @-@ Saxon word <unk> , which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300 . As with its equivalents in the other Germanic languages , it derives ultimately from the Proto @-@ Germanic word <unk> , " ground " , as can be seen in the English earth , the German Erde , the Dutch <unk> , and the Scandinavian <unk> . Many of the Romance languages retain the old Roman word terra ( or some variation of it ) that was used with the meaning of " dry land " as opposed to " sea " . The non @-@ Romance languages use their own native words . The Greeks retain their original name , <unk> ( Ge ) . 
 Non @-@ European cultures use other planetary @-@ naming systems . India uses a system based on the Navagraha , which incorporates the seven traditional planets ( Surya for the Sun , Chandra for the Moon , and Budha , Shukra , Mangala , Bṛhaspati and Shani for Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn ) and the ascending and descending lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu . China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to Chinese cultural influence ( such as Japan , Korea and Vietnam ) use a naming system based on the five Chinese elements : water ( Mercury ) , metal ( Venus ) , fire ( Mars ) , wood ( Jupiter ) and earth ( Saturn ) . In traditional Hebrew astronomy , the seven traditional planets have ( for the most part ) descriptive names - the Sun is <unk> <unk> or " the hot one , " the Moon is <unk> <unk> or " the white one , " Venus is כוכב <unk> Kokhav <unk> or " the bright planet , " Mercury is כוכב Kokhav or " the planet " ( given its lack of distinguishing features ) , Mars is <unk> Ma <unk> or " the red one , " and Saturn is <unk> <unk> or " the resting one " ( in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets ) . The odd one out is Jupiter , called <unk> <unk> or " justice . " <unk> suggests that this may be a euphemism for the original name of כוכב <unk> Kokhav Ba 'al or " Baal 's planet , " seen as idolatrous and <unk> in a similar manner to <unk> from II Samuel 
 = = Formation = = 
 It is not known with certainty how planets are formed . The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust . A protostar forms at the core , surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk . Through accretion ( a process of sticky collision ) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever @-@ larger bodies . Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form , and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction . These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets . After a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than Mars ' mass , it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere , greatly increasing the capture rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag . Depending on the accretion history of solids and gas , a giant planet , an ice giant , or a terrestrial planet may result . 
 When the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star , the surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation , the solar wind , Poynting – Robertson drag and other effects . Thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other , but over time many will collide , either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb . Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets . <unk> that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture , or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies . 
 The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals ( as well as radioactive decay ) will heat up the growing planet , causing it to at least partially melt . The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass , developing a denser core . Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion , but the lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets . ( Smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms . ) 
 With the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than the Sun , it is becoming possible to elaborate , revise or even replace this account . The level of metallicity — an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 ( helium ) — is now thought to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets . Hence , it is thought that a metal @-@ rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal @-@ poor , population II star .

 There are eight planets in the Solar System , which are in increasing distance from the Sun : 
 Mercury 
 Venus 
 Earth 
 Mars 
 Jupiter 
 Saturn 
 Uranus 
 Neptune 
 Jupiter is the largest , at 318 Earth masses , whereas Mercury is the smallest , at 0 @.@ 055 Earth masses . 
 The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition : 
 <unk> : Planets that are similar to Earth , with bodies largely composed of rock : Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars . At 0 @.@ 055 Earth masses , Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet ( and smallest planet ) in the Solar System . Earth is the largest terrestrial planet . 
 Giant planets ( <unk> ) : Massive planets significantly more massive than the terrestrials : Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune . 
 Gas giants , Jupiter and Saturn , are giant planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar System . Jupiter , at 318 Earth masses , is the largest planet in the Solar System , and Saturn is one third as massive , at 95 Earth masses . 
 Ice giants , Uranus and Neptune , are primarily composed of low @-@ boiling @-@ point materials such as water , methane , and ammonia , with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium . They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants ( only 14 and 17 Earth masses ) .

 An exoplanet ( extrasolar planet ) is a planet outside the Solar System . More than 2000 such planets have been discovered ( 3 @,@ 472 planets in 2 @,@ 597 planetary systems including 589 multiple planetary systems as of 15 July 2016 ) . 
 In early 1992 , radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257 + 12 . This discovery was confirmed , and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets . These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar , in a second round of planet formation , or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits . 
 The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main @-@ sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995 , when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi . From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected . The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller , down to smaller than Mercury . 
 There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System : super @-@ Earths and mini @-@ Neptunes , which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune — a radius of 1 @.@ 75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet . There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets , which are the leftover cores . Another possible type of planet is carbon planets , which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System . 
 A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1 @.@ 6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way . 
 On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth @-@ size exoplanets , Kepler @-@ <unk> and Kepler @-@ <unk> , orbiting a Sun @-@ like star , Kepler @-@ 20 . 
 Around 1 in 5 Sun @-@ like stars have an " Earth @-@ sized " planet in the habitable zone , so the nearest would be expected to be within 12 light @-@ years distance from Earth . The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the Drake equation , which estimates the number of intelligent , communicating civilizations that exist in the Milky Way . 
 There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun , and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star . Mercury , the closest planet to the Sun at 0 @.@ 4 AU , takes 88 @-@ days for an orbit , but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours , e.g. Kepler @-@ 70b . The Kepler @-@ 11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury 's , all of them much more massive than Mercury . Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit , but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit , e.g. <unk> b . 
 The next few space telescopes to study exoplanets are expected to be Gaia launched in December 2013 , <unk> in 2017 , <unk> in 2017 , and the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018 . 
 = = Planetary @-@ mass objects = = 
 A planetary @-@ mass object ( PMO ) , <unk> / <unk> / , or planetary body is a celestial object with a mass that falls within the range of the definition of a planet : massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium ( to be rounded under its own gravity ) , but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star . By definition , all planets are planetary @-@ mass objects , but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet . These include dwarf planets , which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit , the larger moons , and free @-@ floating <unk> , which may have been ejected from a system ( rogue planets ) or formed through cloud @-@ collapse rather than accretion ( sometimes called sub @-@ brown dwarfs ) . 
 = = = Rogue planets = = = 
 Several computer simulations of stellar and planetary system formation have suggested that some objects of planetary mass would be ejected into interstellar space . Some scientists have argued that such objects found roaming in deep space should be classed as " planets " , although others have suggested that they should be called low @-@ mass brown dwarfs . 
 = = = Sub @-@ brown dwarfs = = = 
 Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds , but smaller objects can also form via cloud @-@ collapse . Planetary @-@ mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub @-@ brown dwarfs . Sub @-@ brown dwarfs may be free @-@ floating such as Cha 110913 @-@ 773444 and OTS 44 , or orbiting a larger object such as 2MASS <unk> + <unk> . 
 Binary systems of sub @-@ brown dwarfs are theoretically possible ; <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub @-@ brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses , but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses , making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions . 
 = = = Former stars = = = 
 In close binary star systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion . Accretion @-@ powered pulsars may drive mass loss . The shrinking star can then become a planetary @-@ mass object . An example is a Jupiter @-@ mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719 @-@ 1438 . These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet . 
 = = = Satellite planets and belt planets = = = 
 Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet Mercury , e.g. Jupiter 's Galilean moons and Titan . Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet , and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet @-@ sized satellite . Likewise , dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern . 
 = = = Captured planets = = = 
 Free @-@ floating planets in stellar clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured . They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU . The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume , and for a given cluster size it increases with the host / primary mass . It is almost independent of the planetary mass . Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits , non @-@ coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin , or pre @-@ existing planetary system . 
 = = Attributes = = 
 Although each planet has unique physical characteristics , a number of broad commonalities do exist among them . Some of these characteristics , such as rings or natural satellites , have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System , whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets . 
 = = = Dynamic characteristics = = = 
 = = = = Orbit = = = = 
 According to current definitions , all planets must revolve around stars ; thus , any potential " rogue planets " are excluded . In the Solar System , all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates ( counter @-@ clockwise as seen from above the Sun 's north pole ) . At least one extrasolar planet , WASP @-@ 17b , has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star 's rotation . The period of one revolution of a planet 's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year . A planet 's year depends on its distance from its star ; the farther a planet is from its star , not only the longer the distance it must travel , but also the slower its speed , because it is less affected by its star 's gravity . No planet 's orbit is perfectly circular , and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year . The closest approach to its star is called its periastron ( perihelion in the Solar System ) , whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron ( aphelion ) . As a planet approaches periastron , its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy , just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls ; as the planet reaches apastron , its speed decreases , just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory . 
 Each planet 's orbit is delineated by a set of elements : 
 The eccentricity of an orbit describes how elongated a planet 's orbit is . Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits , whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits . The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities , and thus nearly circular orbits . Comets and Kuiper belt objects ( as well as several extrasolar planets ) have very high eccentricities , and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits . 
 The semi @-@ major axis is the distance from a planet to the half @-@ way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit ( see image ) . This distance is not the same as its apastron , because no planet 's orbit has its star at its exact centre . 
 The inclination of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies . In the Solar System , the reference plane is the plane of Earth 's orbit , called the ecliptic . For extrasolar planets , the plane , known as the sky plane or plane of the sky , is the plane perpendicular to the observer 's line of sight from Earth . The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic ; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it . The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes . The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane 's 0 longitude and the planet 's ascending node . The argument of periapsis ( or perihelion in the Solar System ) is the angle between a planet 's ascending node and its closest approach to its star . 
 = = = = Axial tilt = = = = 
 Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt ; they lie at an angle to the plane of their stars ' <unk> . This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year ; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star , the southern hemisphere points towards it , and vice versa . Each planet therefore has seasons , changes to the climate over the course of its year . The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice . Each planet has two in the course of its orbit ; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice , when its day is longest , the other has its winter solstice , when its day is shortest . The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet . Jupiter 's axial tilt is very small , so its seasonal variation is minimal ; Uranus , on the other hand , has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side , which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices . Among extrasolar planets , axial tilts are not known for certain , though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars . 
 = = = = Rotation = = = = 
 The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres . A planet 's rotation period is known as a stellar day . Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun , which is counter @-@ clockwise as seen from above the Sun 's north pole , the exceptions being Venus and Uranus , which rotate clockwise , though Uranus 's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is " north " , and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti @-@ clockwise . Regardless of which convention is used , Uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit . 
 The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation . A net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects . The accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum . Finally , during the last stages of planet building , a stochastic process of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet . There is great variation in the length of day between the planets , with Venus taking 243 days to rotate , and the giant planets only a few hours . The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known . However , for " hot " Jupiters , their proximity to their stars means that they are tidally locked ( i.e. , their orbits are in sync with their rotations ) . This means , they always show one face to their stars , with one side in perpetual day , the other in perpetual night . 
 = = = = Orbital clearing = = = = 
 The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has cleared its neighborhood . A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit . In effect , it orbits its star in isolation , as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar @-@ sized objects . This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU 's official definition of a planet in August , 2006 . This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto , Eris and Ceres from full @-@ fledged planethood , making them instead dwarf planets . Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System , a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs . 
 = = = Physical characteristics = = = 
 = = = = Mass = = = = 
 A planet 's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure , leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium . This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal . Up to a certain mass , an object can be irregular in shape , but beyond that point , which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object , gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere . 
 Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars . The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter 's mass for objects with solar @-@ type isotopic abundance , beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion . Other than the Sun , no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System ; but there are exoplanets of this size . The 13 @-@ Jupiter @-@ mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses , and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses . 
 The smallest known planet is PSR B1257 + 12A , one of the first extrasolar planets discovered , which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar . Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury . The smallest known planet orbiting a main @-@ sequence star other than the Sun is Kepler @-@ <unk> , with a mass ( and radius ) slightly higher than that of the Moon . 
 = = = = Internal differentiation = = = = 
 Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state ; in early formation , the denser , heavier materials sank to the centre , leaving the lighter materials near the surface . Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid . The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts , but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers . The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel , and mantles of silicates . Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen . Uranus and Neptune , which are smaller , have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water , ammonia , methane and other ices . The fluid action within these planets ' cores creates a <unk> that generates a magnetic field . 
 = = = = Atmosphere = = = = 
 All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface . The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium , whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space . The composition of Earth 's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen . 
 Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal energy , leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes , ( on Earth ) , planet @-@ wide dust storms ( on Mars ) , a greater @-@ than @-@ Earth @-@ sized anticyclone on Jupiter ( called the Great Red Spot ) , and holes in the atmosphere ( on Neptune ) . At least one extrasolar planet , HD 189733 b , has been claimed to have such a weather system , similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large . 
 Hot Jupiters , due to their extreme <unk> to their host stars , have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation , much like the tails of comets . These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds , although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures , indicating that that planet 's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star 's energy around the planet . 
 = = = = Magnetosphere = = = = 
 One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments , which in turn give rise to magnetospheres . The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive . In other words , magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors , which generate their magnetic fields . These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind . A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere , which the wind cannot penetrate . The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself . In contrast , non @-@ magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind , which cannot effectively protect the planet . 
 Of the eight planets in the Solar System , only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field . In addition , the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one . Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest , and is barely able to deflect the solar wind . Ganymede 's magnetic field is several times larger , and Jupiter 's is the strongest in the Solar System ( so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons ) . The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth , but their magnetic moments are significantly larger . The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre of the planet . 
 In 2004 , a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star HD <unk> , which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star . The team hypothesized that the planet 's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star 's surface , increasing its already high 7 @,@ 760 ° C temperature by an additional 400 ° C. 
 = = = Secondary characteristics = = = 
 Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System ( such as Neptune and Pluto ) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies ( this is also common in satellite systems ) . All except Mercury and Venus have natural satellites , often called " moons " . Earth has one , Mars has two , and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary @-@ type systems . Many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets , and some have been studied as possible abodes of life ( especially Europa ) . 
 The four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity . The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter , but can host tiny ' moonlets ' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure . Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known , they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet 's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces . 
 No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets . The sub @-@ brown dwarf Cha 110913 @-@ 773444 , which has been described as a rogue planet , is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc and the sub @-@ brown dwarf OTS 44 was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses . 
 = Ragnall ua Ímair = 
 Ragnall ua Ímair ( Old Norse : <unk> , died 921 ) was a Viking leader who ruled Northumbria and the Isle of Man in the early 10th century . He was a grandson of Ímar and a member of the Uí Ímair . Ragnall was most probably among those Vikings expelled from Dublin in 902 , whereafter he may have ruled territory in southern Scotland or the Isle of Man . In 917 , he and his kinsman Sitric Cáech sailed separate fleets to Ireland where they won several battles against local kings . Sitric successfully recaptured Dublin and established himself as king , while Ragnall returned to England . He fought against Constantín mac <unk> , King of Scotland , in the Battle of Corbridge in 918 , and although the battle was not decisive it did allow Ragnall to establish himself as king at York . 
 Ragnall 's rule was immediately challenged by a group of Christian Vikings opposed to his paganism . This group tried to organise an alliance with Æthelflæd , Lady of the Mercians but this attempt was cut short by her death in 918 . His reign saw three issues of coinage , although this was perhaps done on the orders of <unk> , Archbishop of York . In 920 Ragnall and his neighbouring northern kings came to an agreement with Edward the Elder , King of the Anglo @-@ Saxons , though it is a matter of dispute whether Ragnall recognised Edward as his overlord . Ragnall died the following year , whereupon the Annals of Ulster describe him as " king of the fair foreigners and the dark foreigners " . He was succeeded as king by Sitric Cáech . 
 = = Background = = 
 The ruling Vikings of Dublin were expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by Máel <unk> mac Flannacán , overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirecáin , overking of Leinster . Those Vikings that survived the capture of the city split into different groups ; some went to France , some to England , and some to Wales . Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied in the years immediately following this expulsion , perhaps indicating only the ruling elite were forced to leave . However , Viking raids on Irish settlements continued , and in 914 , a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford . The arrival of this fleet marked the re @-@ establishment of Viking rule over parts of Ireland , and was followed by more Vikings settling in Limerick the following year . 
 The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals . Some of the annals , such as the Annals of Ulster , are believed to be contemporary accounts , whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable . A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also complied at later dates , in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas . According to Downham : " apart from these additions [ of saga fragments ] , Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records , albeit partisan in their presentation of events " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Ragnall is presumed to have left Dublin with the rest of the ruling Vikings in 902 . It appears he settled in southern Scotland or the Isle of Man , and is described by some scholars as a King of Mann . He may or may not have ruled territory in western and northern Scotland including the Hebrides and Northern Isles , but contemporary sources are silent on this matter . The earliest mention of him in the Irish Annals is in 914 when he is described as defeating Bárid mac Oitir in a naval battle off the Isle of Man . Bárid may have been a son of <unk> mac <unk> , the man who killed a son of Auisle in 883 , or a son of Jarl <unk> , who later accompanied Ragnall and fought alongside him in England . Ragnall is mentioned in the annals again in 917 when he and Sitric , another grandson of Ímar , are described as leading their fleets to Ireland . Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster , and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford . Niall Glúndub , overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat , and he marched an army south to repel them . The Vikings fought against the men of the Uí Néill at Mag <unk> in County Tipperary and claimed victory , though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army . This was followed by another at the Battle of <unk> ( also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait ) , against Augaire mac Ailella , overking of Leinster , who died in the battle . Augaire 's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings ' return to Ireland , and Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin , where he established himself as king . 
 The Annals of Ulster record Ragnall , with his kinsman Gofraid and two earls , Ottir <unk> and <unk> , leaving Ireland in 918 to fight against Constantín son of Áed , the king of Scotland . According to the northern English historical tract Historia de Sancto <unk> ( completed in the 11th century but probably with access to earlier material ) Constantín was assisting Ealdred son of Eadwulf , ruler of all or some part of Northumbria . The battle , known as the Battle of Corbridge , was indecisive , but this appears to have been enough to allow Ragnall to establish himself as king at York . Ragnall moved quickly and soon imposed his authority on the Vikings there . His position as king of Northumbria was immediately challenged by a group of Christian Vikings ( York was mostly Christian by this time ) who opposed Ragnall 's paganism . This faction approached Æthelflæd , Lady of the Mercians , an Anglo @-@ Saxon and a Christian , with an offer of submission , but negotiations were ended by her premature death in June 918 . 
 Ragnall had three separate issues of coins produced while he ruled York , showing that the machinery of government in Northumbria continued to function , though it is possible that the day @-@ to @-@ day working of mints and collection of taxes rested with the Archbishop of York , <unk> , rather than with Ragnall . The southern Anglo @-@ Saxon king , Edward the Elder , made some manner of agreement with Ragnall and the other northern kings in about 920 , the exact nature of which is unclear . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle states that they " chose him [ Edward ] as father and lord " , perhaps indicating that Ragnall acknowledged Edward 's overlordship , although many scholars have contested this as unlikely . Ragnall died in 921 , and is described as " king of the fair foreigners and the dark foreigners " by the Annals of Ulster . It may be that he was already dying in 920 when the Irish annals note the departure of Sitric from Dublin , replaced there by Gofraid . Sitric succeeded Ragnall as king of the Northumbrians at York . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The historian Alex Woolf has identified Ragnall with Rognvald Eysteinsson , Earl of Møre , a figure closely associated with Harald Fairhair , the first King of Norway . Woolf provides two pieces of evidence in support of this theory . Firstly , both Ragnall and Rognvald are the grandsons of ' Ivars ' – this would equate Ragnall 's grandfather Ímar with Ívarr <unk> , a son of the legendary king Halfdan the Old . Secondly , Rognvald 's son Ivar was killed while in Scotland , as was Ragnall 's kinsman Ímar ua Ímair . Other attempts have also been made in the modern era to link the Kings of Lochlann with historical figures in Norway – Smyth has suggested that Amlaíb Conung can be identified with Olaf <unk> @-@ Alf , King of Vestfold , ( who was the son of Gudrød the Hunter and half @-@ brother of Halfdan the Black ) , though speculation of this nature has not received much support . Ó Corrain states that there is " no good historical or linguistic evidence to link Lothlend / Laithlind with Norway , and none to link the dynasty of Dublin to the shadowy history of the Ynglings of Vestfold " . 
 = = Family = = 
 In the annals Ragnall is identified by the use of " ua Ímair " , meaning " grandson of Ímar " , but never with a patronymic . As such , it is not possible to identify which of the three known sons of Ímar ( Bárid , Sichfrith or Sitriuc ) – if any – was the father of Ragnall . One possible reason for the lack of a patronym might be that Ragnall was the child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin , or who spent most of his time outside Ireland , thus making Ragnall 's legitimacy to rule Dublin dependent the identity of his grandfather , not his father . Another possibility is that Ragnall was a grandson of Ímar through a daughter , again with his right to rule dependent on his grandfather . Sitric 's kinsmen Ímar , Sitric , Amlaíb and Gofraid are the other known grandsons of Ímar identified by the use of " ua Ímair " . All except for Amlaíb ruled as either King of Dublin or King of Northumbria at one time or another . 
 An individual identified as Mac Ragnaill ( son of Ragnall ) by the annals may have been Ragnall 's son , though no name is given . In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick , but within a week he was killed by <unk> , <unk> of Ulster . The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl , but the Annals of Ulster call him a king . The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island .

 = Central Commission for Discipline Inspection = 
 The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection ( CCDI ) is the highest internal @-@ control institution of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , tasked with enforcing internal rules and regulations and combating corruption and malfeasance in the Party . Since the vast majority of officials at all levels of government are also Communist Party members , the commission is in practice the top anti @-@ corruption body in China . 
 The modern commission was established at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in December 1978 . Control systems had existed previously under the name " Central Control Commission " for a brief period in 1927 and again between 1955 and 1968 , and under its present name from 1949 to 1955 . It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution in 1969 . In 1993 , the internal operations of the agency and the government 's Ministry of Supervision ( MOS ) were merged . Although the commission is theoretically independent of the Party 's executive institutions such as the Central Committee and its Politburo , historically the work of the CCDI has been directed by the Party 's top leaders . However , beginning with Hu Jintao 's term as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in November 2002 , and especially following Xi Jinping 's assumption of the party leadership in November 2012 , the CCDI has undergone significant reforms to make it more independent from party operations below the Central Committee . 
 According to the Party 's Constitution , the members of the CCDI are elected by the National Congress and serve for a term of five years . After the national congress in which it is elected , the CCDI convenes to elect its Secretary , deputy secretaries , secretary general and Standing Committee . Elected officials must then be endorsed by the Central Committee to take office . The Secretary of the CCDI has , since 1997 , been a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and , since 2009 , served as the leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work . The current secretary is Wang Qishan , who took office on 15 November 2012 .

 The idea of a control system was inspired by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution . Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party , at all levels , needed a system to supervise party @-@ official elections , dismissals and performance . His writings led to the establishment of the Soviet Central Control Commission ; the control system and the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) structure were imported to China . The importance of discipline and supervision was emphasised since the CPC 's founding . The 2nd National Congress amended the party constitution , devoting a chapter to party discipline . However , no institution was established to safeguard party norms or supervise cadre behaviour . Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission ( CCC ) at the 5th National Congress in 1927 , local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level . 
 The 5th National Congress again amended the party constitution , adding a chapter on control commissions and their aims but devoting little attention to their operations . Partly because of this , the control commissions actively participated in several party rectification campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s . At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles , most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming . 
 The control system was reorganised as the Central Review Committee ( 1928 – 1933 ) , the Central Party Affairs Committee ( 1933 – 1945 ) and the Central Control Commission ( 1945 – 1949 ) . Despite these changes , the duties and responsibilities of the control bodies remained vague until the amendments to the party constitution at the 7th National Congress in 1945 . Although it may be argued that the 1945 amendments did little to clarify the role of a control body , the party leadership expanded on the theoretical reasons for its existence . It was argued in the party constitution that the control system " was born to serve the needs of a Leninist party for its ideological and organisational consolidation . Such a role was reinforced in the Party 's frequent campaigns against its real or perceived enemies in and out of the party organisation . " 
 In 1949 the Central Committee established the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection ( CCDI ) . It differed from its predecessors in several respects . It was responsible to the Politburo and its local organisations were responsible for their corresponding party committees , despite the committees ' authority to restrict their behaviour . In reality , the CCDI was established to check all party organisations except the central leadership . 
 = = = Political history = = = 
 During its early years , the CCDI was not a powerful institution . Although it focused on abuses by party veterans and senior officials , the CCDI rarely appeared on record at that time as investigating ( or solving ) those problems . The few mentions of CCDI inspectors in the press highlighted their failures . Despite the support of Mao Zedong and the central party leadership , it was often unable to fulfill its mandate in the provinces . According to a People 's Daily editorial , party inspectors " gave up the struggle and proved themselves unable to persist in ... upholding the dignity of Party discipline when they encountered great obstacles . " Aware of Yan 'an Rectification Movement successes and CCDI failures , the party leadership used mass mobilisation and ideological campaigns to tackle party corruption during the 1950s . In the wake of the Gao Gang – Rao Shushi affair , the CCDI was replaced by the CCC . 
 Although the CCC became a powerful political force in the following years , at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees . Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward , but the CCC , the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons in the aftermath of the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists . The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution , a socio @-@ political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976 , when it was affected by purges ( partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen , one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution ) . At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished , removed from the party constitution and replaced by special @-@ case organisations ( such as the Central Case Examination Group ) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng . Despite its abolition at the congress , little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution ; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min <unk> was criticised by the Red Guards , a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party ( but inspired by Mao ) during the Cultural Revolution , most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC . Talk of an internal party @-@ control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 . 
 The CCDI was reestablished at the 11th National Congress in 1977 . It had three goals : removing the social influence of the Gang of Four , implementing the leadership 's cadre policy and removing " despotic " local party secretaries , and reversing poor verdicts handed down during the Cultural Revolution . Due to the power struggle between Deng Xiaoping and Hua Guofeng , the control system was not implemented in 1977 – 1978 . The 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in December 1978 formed a new control system under its 1949 – 1955 name , with responsibilities identical to those of the CCC before its abolition . After the 3rd Plenary Session , the CCDI convened its 1st Plenary Session and elected Chen Yun First Secretary , Deng Yingchao Second Secretary , Hu <unk> Third Secretary and Huang Kecheng Permanent Secretary . However , the election of these people ( and others ) was purely symbolic ; the new CCDI consisted generally of people who had never been involved in control affairs , and overwhelmingly of members considered too young to be taken seriously . In its 1st Plenary Session , the CCDI stated three overarching goals : to " protect party members ' rights " , to enforce and safeguard the system of collective leadership " with the division of labor by the individual " and to generally oppose the over @-@ concentration of power in one individual . It would combat corrupt tendencies in the Party and handle individual complaints . 
 Although the press and the CCDI highlighted its fight against corruption , the commission was powerless against many " local despots " : leaders who ruled largely by fiat . During the early 1980s , the 11th Central Committee was forced to enact emergency measures to combat corruption . Instead of fighting corrupt officials , the CCDI 's local branches focused on the rank and file . It was an organisational weapon against the " leftists " ( who advanced during the Cultural Revolution or supported it ) and the " rightists " ( supporters of bourgeois democracy ) . After weakening under Zhao Ziyang , CCDI power increased in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 under the tutelage of Deng and Jiang Zemin . 
 Despite the commission 's position as the Party 's – and China 's – leading anti @-@ corruption agency , its leaders have admitted serious deficiencies in its work . CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing allegedly tendered his resignation " on the eve " of the 5th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee in 2000 to protest the commission 's impotence . His successor Wu Guanzheng found himself in a similar situation , allegedly tendering his resignation in August 2005 . Although neither resigned before the end of his term , they were unable to increase CCDI independence from the committees or end the Central Secretariat 's interference in its activities . 
 In late 2013 , Zhou Yongkang , a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee ( PSC ) and head of China 's security agencies , was placed under investigation by the CCDI for abuse of power and corruption , a decision state media announced in July 2014 . Zhou was the first PSC member – and the most senior @-@ ranked official – since the founding of the People 's Republic of China to be tried and convicted of corruption @-@ related charges . Following his investigation , Zhou was expelled from the CPC . On 11 June 2015 , Zhou was convicted of bribery , abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state secrets by the Intermediate Court in Tianjin . Zhou and his family members were said to have taken 129 million yuan ( over $ 20 million ) in bribes . He was sentenced to life in prison . 
 According to scholar <unk> Guo , " From 1992 to 2009 , China brought disciplinary sanctions against approximately two million personnel " . The CCDI cited similar numbers : " [ B ] etween July 2003 and December 2008 , the CCDI had tried and closed 852 @,@ 000 cases , resulting in 881 @,@ 000 officials receiving disciplinary sanctions . " In 2009 the CCDI imposed disciplinary sanctions on 106 @,@ 626 party members and officials ; 146 @,@ 517 in 2010 ; 142 @,@ 893 in 2011 ; 160 @,@ 718 in 2012 , and 182 @,@ 000 in 2013 . As of 2014 , five of the 31 CDI secretaries are women : Huang Xiaowei , Hong Qiang , Zhang <unk> , Ma <unk> and Song <unk> . Of these Zhang , at age 50 , is currently the youngest serving CDI provincial secretary .

 The Chinese control system was inspired by Soviet control institutions , most notably the Party Control Committee ( PCC ) . Although according to Lenin the Soviet PCC was established to cure the Party 's bureaucratic ills , it evolved into a tool wielded by party secretaries . The CCDI system was not empowered to the same extent as its Soviet counterpart , since Mao favoured mass mobilisation and ideological campaigns over party disciplinary measures to kerb bad behaviour . Even those who shared the Soviet fascination with organisational self @-@ correction , like Liu Shaoqi and Dong <unk> , did not share their obsession with " scientific administration " . 
 The CCDI was cumbersome ; twenty @-@ seven separate procedures had to be completed before an official could be placed under investigation . Other problems were institutional ; for example , the commission had no organisation below the provincial level . In response to the CCDI 's failures , the 1955 National Conference established the CCC . Delegates noted that the CCDI 's problems were its lack of independence from party committees and the lack of meaningful collaboration between a control commission at one level and those at higher levels . The institutional balance favouring party committees led some ( such as Gao Gang and Rao Shushi ) to pack local commissions for discipline inspection ( CDI ) with loyalists who had no interest in carrying out their responsibilities . The control commissions had the power to appeal committee decisions , and were required to report their work to the higher @-@ level control commission . Unlike the CCDI , the CCC had an organisation below the provincial level . It was empowered to " examine , approve , and change decisions by lower control committees " , was required to verify the composition of control committees at the provincial level and below and had the power to investigate unreliable elements at will . Bonds were forged with the Ministry of Supervision ( MOS ) and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate to strengthen the anti @-@ corruption agencies ' control of " the rapidly expanding party organisation and an increasingly elaborate state bureaucracy " . 
 The main goals of these reforms were to strengthen the autonomy of the control commissions from the local ruling committees and safeguard the powers of the centre , which were threatened during the Gao Gang – Rao Shushi affair . However , the Party leadership backtracked ; at the 8th National Congress , the autonomy of the CCC and the control commissions was reduced . The congress was held in a conservative atmosphere , with the leadership calling for collective leadership of all institutions ; the concept of the CCC and the local control commissions having " special rights " to carry out their duties was antithetical to collegial decision @-@ making . The CCC was abolished at the 9th Congress ( during the Cultural Revolution ) , and was reestablished at the 11th National Congress . The 11th National Congress amended the party constitution to state that the " Central Committee of the Party , local Party committees at the county level and above and Party committees in the army units at the regimental level and above should set up commissions for inspecting discipline " . The system was in place by December 1978 , and a corresponding control system in the military was established in 1981 as the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission . The CCDI 's importance was institutionalised by a party regulation that its head must be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee . 
 = = = = " Dual @-@ leadership " system ( 1980 – 2002 ) = = = = 
 According to Lawrence Sullivan , during the 1980s some cadres saw the CCDI 's lack of independence as problematic ; they argued that it should be independent from the Central Committee , not involving itself in the committee 's power struggles . This was opposed by the CCDI leadership , with Huang saying that loyalty to the Central Committee was " more important " than fighting corruption . The chief problem during the early 1980s was CCDI links to local party committees . The local committees elected the commission for discipline inspection ( CDI ) at their level , but the higher @-@ level CDI could endorse – or reject – the proposed committee . This made the local CDI responsible to its party committee , rather than to the CCDI . Although the organisers of the system were aware of the danger , they believed that the CDIs ( through their connection with the central leadership ) would be able to carry out their assigned task despite their election by the committee they were supposed to inspect . This institutional anomaly secured the position of corrupt ( or " despotic " ) committee members . 
 Because of this institutional structure , it was nearly impossible for the CCDI to carry out its mandate . On the few occasions when it attempted to investigate leading officials , it often experienced retaliation . These problems were widespread , leading the Third Secretary to say that " considerable and , in some cases , shocking obstructions in the [ CCDI 's ] work [ occurred often ] . " The party leadership tried to solve these problems at the 12th National Congress , in 1982 , by expanding CCDI jurisdiction and authority . The amended party constitution stated that the CCDI 's responsibility was " to safeguard the Party 's Constitution and other important rules and regulations , to assist Party committees in rectifying Party style , to inspect implementation of the Party 's line , principles , policies and resolutions . " The commission became the defender of party orthodoxy , party organisation , rules and regulations , the Central Committee and democratic centralism ( defined as obeying the Central Committee ) . The amendment allowed local CDIs to " take their case to the next @-@ higher party committee " if they considered the committee decision at their level faulty . The 12th National Congress introduced " dual leadership " in local CDIs ; they were responsible to the party committees at their ( and the higher ) level and to the higher @-@ level CDI . Although each CDI elects a Standing Committee , the 12th National Congress retained a regulation that the Standing Committee must obtain the endorsement of its party committee . That was why the CCDI , elected by the National Congress ( not the Central Committee , as it was previously ) , remained subordinate to the Central Committee . If a Central Committee member was suspected , the CCDI would have to inform ( and obtain a ruling from ) the Central Committee to begin an investigation . 
 Unlike the 12th National Congress , the 13th National Congress in 1987 reduced the CCDI 's power . Reformist general secretary Zhao Ziyang wanted to end CCDI meddling in China 's legal system and reduce its scope to party @-@ discipline issues . Forty @-@ nine CCDI discipline @-@ inspection groups in central ministries and party organisations were abolished at the congress ( 75 percent of all inspection groups ) , and the CCDI 's chief lost his seat on the Politburo Standing Committee . In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations Zhao Ziyang 's reforms were rescinded , and the former CCDI inspection groups were reestablished . Commission power was increased , and the CCDI issued the " five <unk> " ; party members could not " ( 1 ) operate a business , ( 2 ) work in an economic entity , ( 3 ) trade in stocks , ( 4 ) accept gifts , or ( 5 ) use public funds for lavish entertainment . " The 14th National Congress , in 1992 , strengthened CCDI and local CDI investigative powers . According to the amended party constitution , local CDIs could initiate preliminary investigations against members of the local party committee at the CDI 's level before a formal investigation began . If a full investigation was warranted , the local CDI had to obtain approval from its higher @-@ level CDI and the corresponding party committee . In 1995 its powers were increased further , with each CDI given the responsibility to vet officials before their appointment to a post . The <unk> system ( see below ) was established in 1994 by order of the CCDI ; it was first officially mentioned in Article 28 of the Regulation on Dealing with Cases of Party Discipline Violations , which came into effect on 1 May 1994 .

 The CCDI was further reformed at the 16th National Congress in 2002 ; the CCDI Secretary was now the chief coordinator of all anti @-@ corruption efforts on the mainland , a position later known as Leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work . This was further codified in 2004 and 2005 with the " Internal Supervision Regulation " ( ISR ) , <unk> the inner @-@ party supervision system and the Interim Provisions on <unk> ' Role in Assisting the party Committees with the Organisation and Coordination of Anti @-@ Corruption Work . The terminology used in the battle against corruption was changed at the congress ; " fighting corruption " became " fighting and preventing corruption " . The Hu Jintao @-@ led leadership , which lasted from the 16th – 18th National Congress , saw growth in CCDI power and influence , demonstrated most clearly by the increased attendance of PSC members at CCDI plenary sessions . 
 Under Secretary Wu Guanzheng , the CCDI established its first central inspection teams in August 2003 . These teams , led by retired ministerial @-@ level officials and reporting to the CCDI rather than local party committees , were empowered to initiate investigations , conduct interviews and review relevant documents . The opinion of a central inspection team was an important factor in determining whether or not an official was disciplined , and the teams played an important role in the expulsion of Shanghai party chief ( and Politburo member ) Chen <unk> from the party because of corruption . 
 The dual @-@ leadership system was reformed during Hu Jintao 's term . In the aftermath of the Shanghai pension scandal , the central party leadership appointed the CDI leaders of the four direct @-@ controlled municipalities ( Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin and Chongqing ) and suggested a preference for outsiders as CDI leaders in the provinces . Beginning in 2009 , localities below the prefecture level began to abolish the practice of a control body in every party @-@ controlled organisation . Before the reforms , every organisation ( civil , party or government ) with an embedded party committee or party group had a corresponding CDI @-@ style department . The reforms consolidated control and supervision resources ( including finances and personnel ) under the auspices of the <unk> or county @-@ level CDI , which became an " umbrella supervision organ " of all party @-@ controlled bodies in its area of jurisdiction and those below it . The umbrella organisation gave the CDI control of the staffing of party organisations it was tasked with overseeing , allowing more efficient use of CDI resources and reducing potential conflicts of interest arising from CDI staff involvement in the operations of a party committee it was supposed to regulate . 
 The CCDI underwent another round of reforms under general secretary Xi Jinping , elected in the immediate aftermath of the 18th National Congress in 2012 . Xi and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalised CCDI independence from the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the Party , improving its ability to function as a bona fide control body . At the 3rd Plenum of the 18th Central Committee in the fall of 2013 , the Party declared that it would " strengthen the ' dual leadership ' system [ over the CCDI ] by making it more defined , procedure @-@ oriented , and institutionalised . " In practice , this signalled the intention of the leadership that CDIs across the country operate separate from the party apparatus , with local CDIs responsible to higher @-@ level CDIs in nearly all substantive respects . Beginning in 2014 , CDI chiefs across the country began to shed concurrent executive positions which could create conflicts of interest ( for example , a CDI chief also serving as a vice @-@ mayor or department head ) ; CDI personnel also began removing themselves from " leading groups " and similar policy @-@ coordination and consultation groups . These changes were intended to free CDI resources to " solely focus on the work of enforcing discipline " . 
 Since the 18th National Congress the CCDI has established several new organisations , including four new discipline and inspection offices . On 28 March 2013 the Central Committee ordered the establishment of Propaganda and Organisation Departments in the CCDI , the first such departments in a central @-@ level institution other than the Central Committee . According to China scholar Willy Lam , the establishment of a CCDI Organisation Department means " that the CCDI leadership can recruit cadres outside the established channels of the CCP Organisation Department , which has since 1949 been responsible for the Party 's human resources @-@ related operations . " 
 In 2014 , the CCDI established an internal Office for the Supervision of Disciplinary System Officials . The office , an internal check on CCDI officials , ensures that officials charged with enforcing discipline operate within the rules themselves and has jurisdiction over CDI officials at all administrative levels . The CCDI intends " zero tolerance " towards CDI officials breaching discipline themselves , and they will be " exposed by name in the media " if they break the rules . That year , the CCDI set up offices in bodies directly reporting to the central committee ( such as the Organisation and Propaganda Departments ) and State Council bodies . These offices , known as " Commissioned Bodies " , report directly to the CCDI and are not responsible to the institutions in which they are located .

 = = = Central level = = = 
 The Secretary , known as the First Secretary during Chen Yun 's term ( 1978 – 1987 ) , is head of the CCDI . Elections of its Secretary , Deputy Secretary and Secretary @-@ General are held at its 1st Plenary Session , held immediately after a national congress . The CCDI proposes an elected Secretary to the 1st Plenary Session of a central committee , which can approve or reject them . The CCDI Secretary has a number of elected deputies ; currently , there are eight deputy secretaries . Each CCDI Secretary since 2003 has concurrently headed the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work . 
 Since 1978 all CCDI heads have been members of the PSC , although Wei Jianxing was a member from 1997 – 2002 but not from 1992 – 1997 . The 12th National Congress required that the CCDI head serve concurrently on the PSC , but this was rescinded by Zhao Ziyang at the 13th National Congress in 1987 . Although most of Zhao Ziyang 's reforms were later themselves rescinded , concurrent PSC membership was not reintroduced until the 15th National Congress in 1997 . 
 The Standing Committee is the highest body when the CCDI is not convened for a plenary session . Elected by the 1st Plenary Session of the CCDI , it requires approval from the 1st plenary session of the Central Committee to take office . The Standing Committee presents a report to the CCDI at every plenary session ; the latter is the only national @-@ level organisation , with the National People 's Congress and the Central Committee , which holds at least one plenary session a year . CCDI plenary sessions , which discuss its past and future work , are usually held in January . The 18th Standing Committee has 19 members , one of whom ( Huang Xiaowei ) is a woman . 
 The CCDI employs about 1 @,@ 000 people . Since the 1993 merger of its internal functions with the MOS , it has grown to 27 bureaus and offices ; of these , the Office for Discipline Inspection and Supervision , the Case Hearing Office and the Office for Circuit Inspection Work are the most important . <unk> and its ten divisions are responsible for investigating breaches of party discipline and unlawful acts by party members . Of the ten divisions , four investigate cases at the vice @-@ ministerial level and above ; the remaining six investigate " officials at the level of provincial governor , vice @-@ governor , chair and vice @-@ chair of provincial standing committees of the National People 's Congress , chair and vice @-@ chair of provincial Political Consultative Conferences , city mayors and deputies . " In addition , there are twelve institutions which are directly subordinate to the CCDI . 
 = = = Lower levels and inspection teams = = = 
 Below the central level there are several commissions for discipline inspection ( CDI ) . The CDI 's composition is decided by the CDI a level above it , and endorsed by its party committee and the committee superior to it ; the establishment of discipline commissions at the local level is decided by the upper @-@ level party committee . The main duties and responsibilities of local CDIs are to educate party members on their duties and rights , preserve party discipline , uphold party decisions , see that party members exercise their duties in accordance with the party constitution , examine cases and investigate corruption . It is expected to report its findings regularly to its corresponding @-@ level party committee . If a member of the local party committee is involved in corruption , the local CDI should ask the party committee at the corresponding level and the CDI at the level above to approve a full investigation . Before the 2014 reforms it was difficult for the CDIs to carry out their responsibilities ; although they no longer needed approval from the secretary of the corresponding @-@ level party committee , CDI officials were often appointed to positions of power within the institutions they were tasked to supervise ( see above ) . The 2004 reforms increased CDI independence from the party committee ; they were previously elected by the corresponding @-@ level party committee , but beginning in 2004 CDI membership was selected by the upper @-@ level CDI . The 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee in 2013 again reformed the CCDI 's structure , with each CDI directly responsible to the CCDI . 
 The Office for Circuit Inspection Work sends inspection teams throughout the country to help the local CDIs . In 2003 there were five inspection teams , and by 2013 the number had grown to twelve . In 2010 , the CCDI was authorised to send inspection teams to the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) . Despite this , there are several weaknesses to its institutional design in the sense that certain informal aspects of CPC rule compete with formal procedures ( that the CCDI and its lower @-@ level organs are tasked with supervising ) for hegemony ; examples are , as outlined <unk> Guo , " vague institutional positions , incrementally declining effects as time goes by , vulnerability to patron @-@ <unk> or guanxi network at the grassroots level , and the dilemma of ' open ' or ' undercover ’ investigation " . The CCDI and its inspection teams initiate ordinary and intensive inspection of party organisations at all levels and , in the eyes of many in the provinces , are a " tribunal of justice " : handing down verdicts to the guilty and exonerating the innocent . 
 Inspection teams are not empowered to initiate formal investigations , make arrests or met out punishments . If an inspection team gathers on wrongdoing and corruption in general , the information is passed on to either the Organization Department or the CCDI . When an investigation is completed , they need to submit a report to the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work , to the region it inspected and the individuals which were the target of the investigation . The report is then uploaded on the CCDI 's website and made public . The regulations which govern inspection team conduct states that they must " Learn from the reports from local party committees ; <unk> in party disciplinary meetings ; Manage whistleblower letters , phone calls , and visits ; Regarding issues of party members or officials ; Organize forums to understand public opinions of local leaders ; <unk> with individuals ; Review relevant documents and records ; Conduct surveys and evaluate the opinions of the public ; Visit the local bureau or individual department ; and Consult with other government departments to gain better understand [ ing ] of the issues . 
 = = Work with other institutions = = 
 = = = Central Military Commission = = = 
 The military has its own discipline @-@ enforcement body , known as the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Military Commission ( CDICMC ) and modelled on the CCDI . The CDICMC has " dual responsibility " to the CCDI and the Central Military Commission , and its membership is selected by the Central Military Commission . The first military disciplinary organisation was established in 1955 and was dissolved during the Cultural Revolution . The modern incarnation of the CDICMC was formed in January 1980 under the direction of the Central Committee of the Communist Party . Since 1990 the CDICMC 's work has largely been carried out by the PLA 's General Political Department , the military 's highest political body . The head of the CDICMC is customarily also deputy chief of the General Political Department , and ( since the 16th Party Congress in 2002 ) a concurrent Deputy Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection . 
 Occasionally , the CCDI has directly intervened in cases involving high @-@ ranking officers of the PLA . Direct CCDI involvement has only been cited in high @-@ profile cases , such as Vice Admiral Wang <unk> in 2005 and Lieutenant General Gu <unk> in 2012 . When the CDICMC completes such an investigation , the case is usually given to military prosecution authorities for court @-@ martial . Unlike CCDI cases ( whose conclusions are generally announced in press releases ) , details of CDICMC cases are rarely publicly recorded . The CDICMC will occasionally conduct an " initial investigation " of alleged wrongdoing by a military officer , then handing the case over to the CCDI for " further investigation " . 
 = = = Ministry of Supervision = = = 
 The Ministry of Supervision ( MOS ) was established by the State Council in 1987 to supervise in " government departments , state organs and public officials , and maintaining administrative discipline . " Since its inception , the MOS ' jurisdiction was unclear ; most government personnel , as party officials , were under the purview of the CCDI . Before 1987 , the CCDI was responsible for issuing administrative sanctions to public officials ; since it enforced party discipline and the MOS enforced state law , in theory " the two agencies operated in separate spheres " . The reality was less clear @-@ cut ; most public servants were party members , and the MOS and CCDI customarily began separate investigations of the same person . In these dual investigations , the CDIs ( and sometimes the CCDI ) claimed primary jurisdiction over cases involving important party figures and tried to prevent the MOS from doing its work . To solve this problem , the MOS and the CCDI were effectively merged in 1993 – 1994 ; although their organisational identities remained separate , the internal offices of the MOS merged with the CCDI . Since then , the CCDI has conducted the work of the MOS ; the Minister of Supervision customarily holds the concurrent post of Deputy Secretary of the CCDI , and the organisations share a website . 
 = = Duties and responsibilities = = 
 = = = Inner @-@ party supervision = = = 
 The CCDI ( and its local affiliates ) enforces the inner @-@ party supervision system . Although the system 's history dates back to the 1970s and 1980s , it was not formalised until the 2004 " Internal Supervision Regulation " ( ISR ) . The ISR reaffirmed the powers of the CCDI , institutionalised the central inspection teams and clearly separated the Party 's decision @-@ making institutions from its supervisory ones . With the ISR the CPC issued a list of member responsibilities subject to oversight by the CCDI and its local affiliates . Member supervision was not new ; however , information on what was supervised ( and explanations for why things were under supervision ) was novel . Every party member is subject to supervision , but the ISR emphasises that leaders would be its focus . This was probably in reaction to the fact that no institutions except the central party leadership ( including the local CDIs ) had the de facto ability to supervise lower @-@ level party institutions . 
 The ISR defines three forms of inner @-@ party supervision : top @-@ to @-@ bottom , bottom @-@ to @-@ top and peer @-@ to @-@ peer . Of the three , bottom @-@ to @-@ top is the least institutionalised and was presented as the moral – but not institutional – responsibility of ordinary party members . The mechanism for lodging complaints against higher @-@ level party officials or proposing their dismissal was unspecified . According to Ting Gong , the main problem is that if an ordinary party member lodges a complaint or accuses an official of corruption , " there is no guarantee that personal petitions will be accommodated or even processed as they are subject to further investigation and the approval of higher @-@ level authorities " . 
 The top @-@ to @-@ bottom system requires party committees at higher levels to supervise lower @-@ level committees . According to the ISR , the central party leadership should regularly send central inspection teams to regions , state organisations and state @-@ owned enterprises . The central inspection teams ' structure was reformed by the ISR ; before it , they were ad hoc institutions in the fight against corruption . The ISR introduced formal criteria for joining a central inspection team and empowered its investigative authority . 
 Peer @-@ to @-@ peer supervision is defined as regular " democratic life meetings " and the duty of standing committees to report their work to the party committee to whom they are responsible . The primary goal of peer @-@ to @-@ peer supervision is to strengthen party members ' subjective responsibility by making them feel collectively responsible for the Party as a whole . This system is supervised by the party committee and the CDI at the next higher level . 
 = = = Jurisdiction = = = 
 The jurisdiction of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS , with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members . Like the MOS , the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline . Since the CCDI does not have the power to prosecute , it is supposed to transfer cases ( after investigation ) to the Supreme People 's Procuratorate or the Supreme People 's Court . Despite this , its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined . The CDI 's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer ( or sometimes no transfer ) of cases to the Supreme People 's Procuratorate . 
 According to Graham Young , the CCDI 's " responsibilities deal with four types of offences : [ w ] ork mistakes , [ p ] <unk> mistakes , [ l ] ine mistakes [ and ] [ c ] <unk> @-@ revolutionary actions " . Andrew <unk> wrote that by looking at the " offences based on annual reports by provincial <unk> contained in provincial yearbooks " , its responsibility includes 20 types of offences ; " [ a ] <unk> and dictatorial exercise of power , [ a ] <unk> , [ f ] <unk> , [ f ] <unk> , [ i ] <unk> , [ h ] <unk> ( such as bourgeois spiritual pollution , leftism ) , [ p ] <unk> seeking , [ n ] <unk> and use of Party authority to advance their families , friends and relatives , [ b ] <unk> , [ a ] <unk> inefficiency , [ c ] <unk> , [ h ] <unk> , [ p ] <unk> corruption , [ f ] <unk> , [ e ] <unk> , [ t ] heft , [ s ] <unk> , [ b ] <unk> , [ i ] <unk> acquisition of and dealing in foreign exchange [ and ] [ w ] asting and squandering public funds " . According to Jeffrey Becker , " <unk> handbooks and regulations typically list six general types of mistakes ( <unk> ) ; political , economic , organisational , dereliction of one 's duty , opposition to the party 's socialist morals , and violations of integrity laws and regulations . " Although the CCDI overlaps the MOS , it has more responsibilities since it is obligated to prevent breaches of party rules , norms and other non @-@ criminal behaviour . The party constitution vaguely defines the CCDI 's jurisdiction : 
 <unk> implement the Party 's basic line , principles , and policies ... correctly exercise the powers entrusted to them by the people , be honest and upright , work hard for the people , make themselves an example , carry forward the style of hard work and plain living , forge closes ties with the masses , uphold the Party 's mass line , accept criticism and supervision by the masses , oppose bureaucratism , and oppose the unhealthy trend of abusing one 's power for personal gain . 
 = = = Petition system , investigative procedures and Shuanggui = = = 
 For a case to be investigated , a person needs to petition the CCDI . Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office , petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions ( such as the Supreme People 's Court , Supreme People 's Procuratorate , the National People 's Congress and party leadership as high as the PSC ) as well . Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website , and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work ( which sends inspection teams throughout the country ) . In a case handled by former <unk> Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li <unk> , a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner , several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin , Li Peng , Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing . 
 An investigation has eight steps : " preliminary evidence and complaint management , preliminary confirmation of disciplinary violations , approval for opening the case , investigation and evidence collection , case hearing , implementation of disciplinary sanctions , appeal by the disciplined official , and continued supervision and management of the case " . The first step begins with the receipt a petition , which is formally accepted when the CCDI has proof ( or suspicion ) of wrongdoing . This process depends on the position of the accused ; if the person has a vice @-@ ministerial or deputy @-@ gubernatorial rank , the investigation must first be approved by the CCDI Standing Committee . If approved , the CCDI Standing Committee will request permission from the PSC for a full investigation . An investigation of a provincial party leader must be accepted by the Politburo . To investigate a member of the Politburo or the PSC , the full backing of the PSC and retired high @-@ level leaders is required . When a case is approved , the subject enters Shuanggui ( " double designation " ) and must appear at a " designated location at a designated time . " During Shuanggui , the subject is questioned about specific disciplinary violations . The length of Shuanggui is unspecified , and the subject is not protected by the state legal system . This system gives the CCDI precedence over the legal system in the investigation of party leaders . According to Chinese media , Shuanggui was instituted to prevent a subject 's protection by his patron or a network ( guanxi ) and scholars such as Ting Gong and Connie Meaney agree that guanxi is a genuine threat to CCDI investigative teams . The suspect is then subject to " off @-@ site detention " " to prevent interference from ' local protectionism ' and ' factionalism ' " ( guanxi ) , preserving the investigation 's integrity . 
 The subject is detained in an unspecified location under a 24 @-@ hour suicide watch by a team of six to nine " accompanying protectors " ( as they are officially called ) , working eight @-@ hour shifts . Shuanggui does not condone corporal punishment and the accused is , in theory , respectfully treated until proven guilty . Despite this proscription of force , according to Flora <unk> it " can easily occur because all basic procedural guarantees are removed as soon as <unk> begins " . Problems with Shuanggui , such as forced confessions , have occurred with inadequately @-@ trained officials in areas controlled by local CDIs . 
 = = = Regulations = = = 
 CDIs at every level have , as one of their most important duties , the authority to issue and interpret regulations . In recent years the CCDI has issued several regulations on behalf of the central committee , including " Internal Supervision Regulation " in 2004 ; " Regulations on Inner @-@ Party Supervision " , " Provisions on the CCP 's Disciplinary Penalties " and " Provisions About Establishing the Responsibility System for Party Construction and Clean Government " in 2005 , and " Interim Stipulations : Leading Cadres ’ Integrity Report " in 2006 . 
 The importance of law in the struggle against corruption has been emphasised since the early 1980s . Deng pointed out in 1980 that the anti @-@ corruption effort was a political struggle which , to be successful , must be fought in an institutional environment . At the 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CCDI in 2000 , Jiang drew a similar conclusion : " The most important thing is to uphold and improve a system of institutions which can guarantee the Party ’ s strong leadership and socialist prosperity , and make sure that the system is functioning by means of laws , regulations , policies and education . " Despite this , until the 16th National Congress the CPC 's anti @-@ corruption system was based on campaign @-@ style events rather than formal procedures ( partially due to the 1940s Yan 'an Rectification Movement and its legacy ) . The idea that campaigns – not institutions – were the best weapon against corruption predominated under Deng , and is best seen in the establishment of the Central Party Rectification Steering Committee during the 1980s . This was the CPC central leadership 's preferred way to combat corruption , since its enforcement depended largely on the leadership . However , the sharp increase in corrupt activities during the 1990s led the Party to change course . 
 Under Wei Jianxing , the 15th CCDI reviewed an estimated 1 @,@ 600 corruption @-@ related party regulations and documents in the run @-@ up to the 16th National Congress ; of these , an estimated 1 @,@ 100 were still considered viable . During this period , it published " Plan for Building Honest Morals and Controlling Corruption from 2004 to 2007 " and the six @-@ volume " Complete Regulations on Building Honest Morals and Controlling Corruption Within the Party " in an effort to <unk> the Party 's anti @-@ corruption system . To formalise its procedures , the 16th CCDI Standing Committee passed regulations requiring all local CDIs to combat corruption with lawful methods . Signaling their serious intent , the CCDI , the CPC 's Organisation Department , the MOS and the State @-@ owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued joint " Regulations on Honestly Conducting Business by Leaders of the State @-@ Run Enterprises " in 2005 . According to CPC analyst Shao <unk> , " The pace of institutional anti @-@ corruption [ development ] by the CCP has been unprecedented . " 
 = Tay Whale = 
 The Tay Whale , known locally as The Monster , was a humpback whale that swam into the Firth of Tay of eastern Scotland in 1883 . It was harpooned in a hunt , but escaped , and was found floating dead off Stonehaven a week later . It was towed into Dundee by a showman , John Woods , and exhibited on a train tour of Scotland and England . 
 The Regius Professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen University , John Struthers dissected the whale , much of the time in public with a military band playing in the background , organised by Woods . The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money , and Struthers famous . 
 William McGonagall wrote an infamously bad poem about the events . 
 = = History = = 
 In December 1883 , a humpback whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee , at that time the country 's major whaling port , and attracted much local interest . The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic , but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter , some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters . 
 After several failed attempts , they harpooned the humpback on 31 December 1883 . It was a strong male , and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose and then to the Firth of Forth . After a struggle that lasted all night , the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped . 
 A week later the whale was found dead , floating out at sea . It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach . John Struthers , the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen , quickly visited the carcass , recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches . A local entrepreneur , John Woods , bought the whale and had it transported to his yard in Dundee . On the first Sunday that it was there , 12 @,@ 000 people paid to see it . 
 The local newspaper , the Dundee Courier , published at least 21 stories on the Tay Whale between 12 November 1883 and 11 January 1884 . The headlines included : 
 Appearance of a Whale in the River - 12 November 
 Whale Hunting in the Tay - 16 November 
 Return of the Whale to the Tay - 21 November 
 On the Trail of the Whale - 7 December 
 Christmas Greeting from the Whale - 25 December

 The Runaway Whale - 4 January 
 The Tay Whale Found Dead - 8 January 
 The Whale 's Corpus - 9 January 
 The Recovered Whale at Stonehaven . Sale of the Monster to a Dundee Man - 11 January 
 Finally on 25 January 1884 , when the whale was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition , Struthers was allowed to come and dissect the famous specimen . He was well used to working on stinking carcasses : his dissecting room was reputed to stink " like the deck of a Greenland whaler " . He had two assistants ; but the dissection was disturbed by John Woods , who admitted the public , for a fee , to watch the dissection in progress , while a military band played in the background . 
 There were snow showers , but Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed ; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London . Finally on 7 August 1884 Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton . Struthers eventually wrote seven anatomy articles over the next decade on the whale , and ultimately published a complete monograph on it in 1889 , entitled Memoir on the Anatomy of the Humpback Whale , Megaptera <unk> . 
 In 2011 , the whale 's skeleton was displayed in the McManus Galleries in Dundee .

 Struthers became popularly famous for his dissection of the Tay Whale , his largest specimen . It was one of a wide range of specimens of many species that he energetically collected to form a museum of zoology , to illustrate Darwin 's theories . 
 = = Fame in doggerel = = 
 The whale became so famous that the doggerel poet William Topaz McGonagall ( 1825 – 1902 ) wrote a notably bad poem , " The Famous Tay Whale " , about it . Two of the verses run : 
 And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need , 
 No matter what other people may think or what is their creed ; 
 I know fishermen in general are often very poor 
 And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door . 
 So Mr. John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty @-@ six pound , 
 And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound ; 
 Which measures forty feet in length from the snout to the tail , 
 So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail . 
 This was not the only piece of doggerel verse about the whale , as a poet signing himself " Spectator " published " The Whale Interviewed by his Mother on his Exploits in the River Tay " in the Dundee Courier , with verses such as : 
 Oh ! why went you there , my son , my son , 
 Within the range of their banging gun ? 
 " Fear not , mother , ’ twas only a lark , 
 I reckoned they would shoot wide of the mark . "

 = Elmo Tanner = 
 William Elmo Tanner , known as Elmo Tanner ( August 8 , 1904 – December 20 , 1990 ) was an American whistler , singer , bandleader and disc jockey , best known for his whistling on the chart @-@ topping song “ Heartaches ” with the Ted Weems Orchestra . Tanner and Weems recorded the song for two different record companies within a period of five years . Neither recording was successful originally . The song became a hit for both record companies after a Charlotte , North Carolina disk jockey played it at random in 1947 . 
 Tanner was originally hired by Weems as a vocalist ; the bandleader discovered Tanner 's whistling ability while the band was traveling to an engagement . Like Bing Crosby , he was able to whistle from his throat due to the muscles in his larynx . He subsequently became a featured performer as a whistler , earning the nicknames " Whistler ’ s Mother ’ s Boy " , " The Whistling Troubador , " and " the nation ’ s best @-@ known whistler " . He began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936 ; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys , and he later appeared in the movie Swing , Sister , Swing ( 1938 ) and the musical film short , Swing Frolic ( 1942 ) . Weems considered Tanner 's whistling important enough to his orchestra that in 1939 he insured Tanner 's throat for $ 10 @,@ 000 . Besides musical whistling , he also imitated birds for Disney . 
 After a failed attempt at running a restaurant in his native Nashville in the early 1950s , he toured with the Elmo Tanner Quartet until 1958 , when he found work as a disc jockey in Florida . After working as an auto dealer in the 1960s , in the early 1970s he resumed musical activity , singing with a St. Petersburg , Florida @-@ based quartet . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tanner was born on August 8 , 1904 in Nashville , Tennessee . He grew up in Detroit , and moved to Memphis with his family by 1926 . As a young boy , Tanner studied the violin and was successful with it until eye trouble made it difficult for him to read notes . His musical training helped Tanner to develop the ability to scan music or lyrics quickly and then either sing or whistle what he had just read . On his walk home from work , Tanner passed a cemetery each night and started whistling as he passed by . Not everyone appreciated Tanner 's whistling in the evening ; he was once jailed in Albuquerque , New Mexico for whistling after 10pm . A graduate of the University of Tennessee , Tanner raced automobiles and worked as a mechanic in Memphis . While performing the duties of his employment he liked to whistle and sing . One day in 1928 , he had a repair job for a customer who happened to work at WMC radio . After hearing Tanner singing while working on his car , the announcer suggested Tanner audition for the radio station . His consequent on @-@ air appearance brought a call from Paramount Records , which had offices in Chicago . 
 = = Career = = 
 By the late 1920s , Elmo Tanner had moved to the Chicago area and had established himself as a professional musician . Although Elmo Tanner never gained a large reputation as a singer , he was occasionally featured as such with Weems . It was as a vocalist that he made his initial recordings . He recorded a few dozen sides as a soloist for Paramount and Vocalion in 1927 through 1929 . Interestingly , the Paramount discs appeared in the Race record series , and the Vocalion sides were likewise marketed to African Americans . His versatility was noted by Vocalion , who utilized him to provide vocals for jazz outfits such as Jimmie Noone and for more sedate recordings with the Victor Young orchestra and with organist Eddie House . Not having signed an exclusive contract with any recording company , he was able to appear on the prestigious Victor label with Nathaniel Shilkret . In 1928 he formed a duet with Fred Rose as " The Tune Peddlers " and appeared on radio stations WLS , KYW , and WBBM . 
 While working at KYW with Rose , Tanner received an offer from Ted Weems . Weems offered a higher salary than Tanner was making at the radio station , but Tanner was hesitant because the job with Weems involved substantial travel . The KYW station manager offered to match the $ 50 per week salary . A few days later , Weems made a higher offer which was met by the station manager 's offer to match it . This continued until only Fred Rose came to work . When he arrived , Rose told the station manager that Weems now offered Tanner $ 100 a week and he had accepted it . 
 = = = Ted Weems Orchestra and “ Heartaches ” = = = 
 Tanner joined the Ted Weems band as a singer in 1929 and became a prominent feature of the group . Tanner 's whistling talent was unveiled by accident . In high spirits on their way to their next performance , the band members were singing , yelling and whistling on the bus . When Tanner joined in , Weems was impressed enough to add a whistling segment to one of the band 's sets . Tanner whistled the Show Boat song , " Make Believe " ; the audience asked for an encore . Tanner 's whistling became so popular that Perry Como , another featured performer in the band , said “ The whistler was the whole band . ” On occasion , Tanner ’ s lips would pucker up , interfering with his whistling . Although generally noted for his graciousness as a bandleader , Weems would have fun at Tanner ’ s expense , running him through the most difficult songs in his repertoire when he noticed Tanner was struggling . Tanner became known as " Whistler ’ s Mother ’ s Boy " , " The Whistling Troubador , " and " the nation ’ s best @-@ known whistler " . Tanner was noted for the ease with which he hit high notes and performed trills . He had the ability to whistle while triple @-@ tonguing , and like Bing Crosby , he was able to whistle from his throat due to the muscles in his larynx . His range was from low G to high B ♭ . Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a " top pick " . Ted Weems considered Tanner 's whistling so important to his band , he insured the musician 's throat with Lloyd 's of London for $ 10 @,@ 000 in 1939 . The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner 's possible inability to whistle and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform . 
 In an era when whistling was commonly featured on popular recordings , Tanner was often confused with Fred Lowery , who was blind and worked with Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights . People would come up to Tanner and ask if it was true that he was blind . “ Only on Saturday night , ” he would reply . When not singing or whistling , Elmo played guitar in the band . The primary purpose was evidently to show Tanner was " doing something " while keeping him in view , as it became a standard joke that the guitar he was playing had rubber bands in place of strings . 
 Tanner began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936 ; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys , In 1938 he appeared in the movie Swing , Sister , Swing with the Weems outfit . Tanner also featured with Ted Weems and his Orchestra in a 1942 musical film short , Swing Frolic . During this time period Tanner appeared on the popular radio show Beat the Band with Weems ; the program ran from January 28 , 1940 until February 23 , 1941 . 
 Tanner , Ted Weems , and the rest of his orchestra joined the Merchant Marine in 1942 . At ( and intermittently before ) his discharge in 1944 he pursued a solo career . He headlined in various nightclubs and theaters such as Chicago ’ s Oriental and Colosimo ’ s and at the Orpheum in Los Angeles alongside the King Sisters and Maurice Rocco . Besides musical whistling , he also imitated birds for Disney . He continued to perform songs that were associated with Weems , such as “ Nola ” . Tanner announced he would be fronting a twelve @-@ piece band in September 1946 ; the band 's theme was " Heartaches " . He took over the Andy Anderson unit that was based in Atlanta and signed on with the William Morris Agency . His orchestra featured his whistling and vocals by Carol Bridges . However , this proved to be short @-@ lived because of the surprise success of an old recording . 
 = = = = The delayed success of " Heartaches " = = = = 
 “ Heartaches ” , composed by Al Hoffman and John <unk> in 1931 , was recorded as an unusual half @-@ rumba , half washboard rhythm . In 1933 , Victor had assigned the recording of the song to Ted Weems and his Orchestra , and wanted it recorded quickly . Weems and his band had time for only one rehearsal before recording the song . Initially , Weems did not like the song ; he decided to omit the lyrics by way of having Tanner whistle instead . While running through the song at rehearsal , someone thought of trying it with a speedier tempo than initially written . It was not a large seller , and the master was filed away . In 1938 , Weems was now working with Decca Records and was preparing to make another record . When someone had forgotten to assign a song for the " B " side of the record , Weems and Tanner made another recording of " Heartaches " ; the Decca version was not any more successful than the Victor one had been five years earlier . 
 In 1947 , a young disk jockey in Charlotte , North Carolina who worked the overnight shift had recently received some older records which he brought to work with him . He chose one at random and put it on the turntable . Shortly after the record had finished , the radio station 's telephones began ringing with people asking about the song and requesting to hear it again . By afternoon , the city 's music stores were calling the radio station , hoping to learn where they could order copies of " Heartaches " . Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales . As disk jockeys in other parts of the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it , the demand for " Heartaches " went from coast to coast . This older recording went to the top of all the main charts in 1947 , including sales , juke box play , and airplay . 
 Unusually , two separate recordings were given equal credit in the charts . Victor ’ s version was recorded on August 4 , 1933 and issued on Bluebird <unk> . Decca ’ s recording was made on August 23 , 1938 and originally appeared on catalog number <unk> . The hit records were credited to RCA Victor 20 @-@ 2175 and Decca <unk> , respectively . Altogether the recordings were credited with selling 8 @.@ 5 million copies . Tanner said in a 1960 interview that neither he nor Ted Weems received any compensation for the " Heartaches " re @-@ issue as they both had let the contracts on the song expire while they were in the Merchant Marine . Tanner and Weems missed collecting an estimated $ 250 @,@ 000 in royalties because of the expired contracts . 
 Because of the renewed success of “ Heartaches ” , Tanner joined the re @-@ formed Weems outfit in March 1947 , and both were signed to Mercury Records . This later outfit often received poor reviews , with the exception of Elmo ’ s “ outstanding ” whistling ; it was Tanner ’ s whistling that audiences most responded to . Tanner made one more recording of " Heartaches " in 1953 with Billy Vaughn for Dot Records .

 Tanner left Weems in 1950 to open a restaurant in Nashville . This occupied him for a year and a half , but it proved to be a failure and Tanner suffered financially . He formed the Elmo Tanner Quartet and resumed touring for the next few years , until , tired of travel , he broke up his group in Seattle in 1958 . He spent the next fourteen months in Birmingham as a disk jockey and leading a musical combo . He reunited briefly with Weems , then settled in the St. Petersburg , Florida area in Treasure Island . In 1959 , Tanner began working as a disc jockey on radio station <unk> in St. Pete Beach , Florida , a position which lasted several years . During this time he continued to make recordings with orchestras such as David Carroll and Billy Vaughn to continued positive reviews . His association continued with Weems , making the occasional guest appearance with the band he was closely connected to . In the early 1960s , Tanner was also selling Datsuns at a local St. Petersburg auto dealership . In the early 1970s he resumed musical activity , singing with a St. Petersburg @-@ based quartet .

 In 1936 , while Tanner was living in Chicago , he was divorced from his first wife , Verne . Tanner married Eleanor Jones of Birmingham on January 31 , 1939 in Indianapolis . While playing an engagement with Weems , Tanner got his marriage license between the first and second acts on the bill , bought a wedding ring between the second and third acts and was married between the third and fourth acts . He met his second wife while working with the Weems band on Catalina Island . They had four children together : Elmo Jr . , twins Margaret and Patricia , and John Emmet . By 1969 he was retired . Tanner underwent gall bladder surgery in 1985 and was able to recover at his home in St. Petersburg . He died on December 20 , 1990 in St. Petersburg , Florida . Tanner is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery , Nashville , Tennessee . He was posthumously inducted into the <unk> ' Hall of Fame in 1991 , joining previous inductees Bing Crosby and Fred Lowery .

 General Sir John Gordon Noel Wilton , KBE , CB , DSO ( 22 November 1910 – 10 May 1981 ) was a senior commander in the Australian Army . He served as Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) , the Army 's professional head , from 1963 until 1966 , and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee ( CCOSC ) , forerunner of the role of Australia 's Chief of the Defence Force , from 1966 until 1970 . His eight @-@ year tenure as senior officer of first the Army and then the Australian military spanned almost the entire period of the nation 's involvement in the Vietnam War . 
 Born in Sydney , Wilton entered the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in 1927 . Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time , he took a commission in the British Army following his graduation in 1930 . He spent most of the remainder of the decade with the Royal Artillery in India . Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War II and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery . He saw action with the 7th Division in Syria and the 3rd Division in New Guinea , earning a mention in despatches in the former campaign and the Distinguished Service Order in the latter . Finishing the war a temporary colonel , he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1947 . Wilton was posted to Korea in 1953 to take command of the 28th Commonwealth Brigade , leading it in its final action of the war in July . He was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire and awarded the US Legion of Merit for his performance in Korea . 
 Wilton was promoted to major general in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1962 and made CGS the following January , with the rank of lieutenant general . As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army 's divisional structure , the reintroduction of conscription , and deployments during the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi and the Vietnam War . Knighted in 1964 , he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC . In this role he had overall responsibility for Australia 's forces in Vietnam , and worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation , including a tri @-@ services academy , a joint intelligence group , and the amalgamation of separate government departments for the Army , Navy and Air Force . Wilton was promoted to general in September 1968 , and retired from the military in November 1970 . He served as Consul @-@ General to the United States in 1973 – 75 , and died in 1981 , aged seventy . 
 = = Early career = = 
 John Wilton was born in Sydney on 22 November 1910 , the second of two sons to English migrants Noel and Muriel Wilton . Noel was an electrical engineer , and moved with his family to Hobart in 1915 to take up employment with the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Department . Attending various schools , John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents ' separation in 1917 , before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921 . In 1923 he moved with them to Grafton , New South Wales , where he managed the Clarence River County Council . John attended Grafton High School , where he attained his leaving certificate . Considered by family to be a " loner " , " a clear thinker " , and a " quite , determined , achiever " , he entered the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in February 1927 , aged sixteen . Early on he was subjected to the usual <unk> handed out to younger cadets by seniors , but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class . Although somewhat aloof from his fellows , he did well in team sports such as rugby and hockey , as well as swimming and diving . Second academically in his class of twelve , Wilton graduated from Duntroon on 9 December 1930 . 
 By 1930 , the effects of the Great Depression had reduced the opportunities for Duntroon graduates . Only four of Wilton 's classmates joined the Australian Military Forces , while four transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and four to the British Army . Wilton was among the last @-@ mentioned , taking a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery , with seniority from 22 November 1930 . Seeking active duty , he requested a posting to India , and sailed with the 6th Field Brigade to Bombay in November 1931 . He spent the next three years based at <unk> , near the Nepalese border . Promoted to lieutenant in November 1933 , he undertook training and exercises with his battery , and learned to speak Urdu , but saw no action . In February 1935 he was posted to Burma , joining the 10th ( Abbottabad ) Battery of the Indian Mountain Artillery at Maymyo , near Mandalay . According to biographer David Horner , Wilton 's " first taste of excitement " was in April 1935 , when he joined the hunt for a rogue tiger and shot the animal as it attacked and mauled one of his companions . In November he saw operational service with his unit in skirmishes with local tribesmen in the Wa State of northern Burma , on the Chinese border . 
 After eight months extended leave in 1936 , and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps , Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9 July 1938 at St. Andrew 's Church in Summer Hill , New South Wales . John had met Helen , then a nurse , on a double date in Sydney while he was in his last year at Duntroon ; the couple had two sons and a daughter . On the same trip home he was invited to transfer to the Australian military , and accepted . Promoted to captain in December 1938 , Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in Karachi , and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery on 26 May 1939 . His service with the British Army in India and Burma had afforded him regimental experience that he could never have gained in Australia , as well as an understanding of mountainous and tropical conditions that would benefit him in years to come . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Wilton spent a year in coastal artillery posts at North Head and Port Kembla before transferring to the Second Australian Imperial Force . He was promoted major on 7 May 1940 and given command of a battery in the 2 / 4th Field Regiment , part of the recently formed 7th Division , which embarked for the Middle East in October . On the voyage he wrote his wife a letter in case he was killed , admonishing : " Remember what has always been our motto — nothing can defeat us — not even death ! " Appointed the division 's Brigade Major Royal Artillery on 19 March 1941 , Wilton served under Brigadier Frank Berryman in the Syrian campaign , and was responsible for coordinating operations during the Battle of Merdjayoun in June . Assigned to the staff of Headquarters I Corps , Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 2 ( Artillery ) on 1 November ; this would be the final artillery posting of his career . He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 25 November . On 30 December , Wilton was mentioned in despatches for his service with the 7th Division . He entered the Middle East Staff School at Haifa in January 1942 , and graduated in May . 
 Returning to Australia , Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 1 in Major General Stanley Savige 's 3rd Division in August 1942 . Savige later recalled that " I never had a more competent staff , nor such a co @-@ operative team , than that staff after Wilton came along . " The 3rd Division was part of Lieutenant General Edmund Herring 's II Corps . In October , Herring succeeded Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell as commander of New Guinea Force , and Savige became acting corps commander . With his attention focused on the corps , Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd Division . Wilton travelled to New Guinea in February 1943 to reconnoitre the terrain and begin plans for the division 's forthcoming campaign in Salamaua . He was attached to Kanga Force in Wau during March 1943 , prior to its absorption by 3rd Division the following month . Herring had ordered that the 3rd Division " threaten " Salamaua , and despite Wilton 's attempts to clarify precisely what this meant , the order remained vague . Savige and Wilton interpreted it as meaning that the 3rd Division was to capture Salamaua , when in fact its main purpose in the campaign was to divert Japanese forces from Lae . In any event , 3rd Division progressed steadily and by August it had to be ordered to slow down so that Lae could be attacked before Salamaua . Wilton received much of the credit for 3rd Division 's performance . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) for his " skill and ability in New Guinea " between July 1942 and April 1943 , the citation being promulgated on 27 April 1944 . 
 In September 1943 , following his service with 3rd Division , Wilton was posted to Washington , D.C. as General Staff Officer , Australian Military Mission ; he spent November and December 1944 in Europe , observing the Allies ' military organisation . He was promoted temporary colonel in May 1945 , and spent the remainder of the war on the staff of General Sir Thomas Blamey 's Advanced Land Headquarters at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies and Forward Echelon Advance Land Headquarters at Manila in the Philippines . On Blamey 's recommendation , Wilton was honoured for the " particularly high standard " of his work on the general staff with appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) , promulgated on 6 March 1947 .

 = = = Rise to senior command = = = 
 Wilton was still only a substantive captain at the end of hostilities , but was considered by the Military Board to be among those " promising officers who have forced their way to the top during the war " and hence to deserve retention of their wartime rank . He became Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters ( AHQ ) , Melbourne , in March 1946 , and took charge of the same directorate a year later . By now promoted to substantive colonel , in 1950 he was a member of the Bridgeford Mission , which advised the Australian government on the state of the Malayan Emergency . On a visit to Singapore in February – March 1951 as part of a joint planning team , he urged his British counterparts to maintain their presence in Malaya as the basis of a combined force , without which Australia would be reluctant to commit any troops for the region 's security . Wilton relinquished his post at AHQ in November 1951 , and attended the Imperial Defence College in London during 1952 . Having been assigned a combat command in the Korean War , he was promoted to brigadier on 13 March 1953 , arrived in Seoul within the week , and took over the 28th Commonwealth Brigade from fellow Duntroon graduate Brigadier Thomas Daly on 25 March . 
 The 28th was described in the official history of Australia 's involvement in the Korean War as " the most nationally diverse " brigade in the 1st Commonwealth Division , consisting of Australian , British , Indian and New Zealand units , yet also " an outstandingly well @-@ knit formation " . After operating on the eastern side of the Jamestown Line from April , the 28th was transferred westward to relieve the 29th Brigade at the Hook , the Commonwealth Division 's most vulnerable position , on 9 – 10 July . At 6 : 15pm on 23 July , Wilton informed his battalion chiefs that an armistice was ready to be signed , and to keep patrols to the minimum level necessary for the line 's security . The brigade 's last action took place over the next three days , when it used artillery , mortar , machine @-@ gun and rifle fire to repulse a heavy assault by Chinese troops , inflicting as many as 3 @,@ 000 casualties . Wilton later recalled the " terrible and gruesome sight " of no @-@ man 's land " literally carpeted with dead bodies " . He was present for the armistice ceremony at Panmunjom on 27 July . Having succeeded in maintaining his command 's discipline and morale during a potentially problematic time at the end of the conflict and the beginning of peace , he handed over the 28th to Brigadier Ian Murdoch on 19 February 1954 . For his service in Korea , Wilton was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the Queen 's Birthday Honours on 10 June 1954 . He was also awarded the US Legion of Merit for his " outstanding leadership and initiative " ; the decoration was gazetted on 1 May 1956 . 
 After returning to Australia , Wilton was appointed Brigadier in Charge of Administration at Headquarters Eastern Command , his first administrative post . In November 1955 he was assigned to the General Staff at AHQ , where he was responsible for intelligence , operations and plans , and took part in Australian preparations for SEATO exercises . He was promoted to major general on 24 March 1957 , and became Commandant of the Royal Military College , Duntroon . Although not strongly religious , Wilton considered himself responsible for the spiritual and moral development of younger cadets ; he made a point of attending church parade regularly , and in 1959 personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the college 's Anzac Memorial Chapel , which would open in 1966 . His chief goal , though , was academic : concerned that graduates were at risk of falling behind their increasingly tertiary @-@ qualified peers in industry and public service , he worked assiduously to make the college a degree @-@ granting institution ; this was realised in 1967 . From June 1960 through 1962 , Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters , Bangkok . He believed Thailand to be strategically vital , declaring " if you want to hold Southeast Asia , you need to hold Thailand " . His position allowed him to closely observe the deteriorating situation in Laos , which threatened to spill over into Thailand , and the Western Powers ' growing focus on South Vietnam . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in the 1962 Queen 's Birthday Honours , in particular for his " conspicuous devotion to duty and his singleness of purpose " as Commandant of Duntroon . On 21 January 1963 , Wilton was promoted lieutenant general and became Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) , succeeding Lieutenant General Sir Reginald Pollard . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) in the 1964 New Year Honours .

 Following the lead of the US Army , in 1960 the Australian Army had replaced its former " triangular " divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters , with a " pentropic " organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters . This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions , while increasing their individual strength . Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure , reasoning that the number of battalions , rather than their relative strength , was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments . The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961 . In October 1964 , Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation . In the meantime , as a response to the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , the Australian government reintroduced conscription , which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments . Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery , and vice versa ; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that " it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier " , he wrote on it " This assumption not justified " . In February – March 1965 , following a request from the Malaysian government , Australia despatched 1 Squadron , Special Air Service Regiment , and 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment , to Borneo — a commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army 's personnel and battalion numbers . 
 By mid @-@ 1964 , Australia had already sent a small team of military advisors , as well as a flight of newly acquired DHC @-@ 4 Caribou transports , to aid the South Vietnamese government in its fight against the Viet Cong . The 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment , was deployed in May 1965 . It was attached to a US Army brigade , and Wilton was responsible for setting its operational parameters . In August , he recommended to his opposite number in the RAAF , Air Marshal Alister Murdoch , the despatch of two UH @-@ 1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam . Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air / ground operations in the region before any large @-@ scale commitment of Australian forces . He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on <unk> grounds , despite the fact that two @-@ thirds of the RAAF 's UH @-@ 1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation . According to the official history of the post @-@ war Air Force , when the Federal government deployed No. 9 Squadron and its UH @-@ 1s to Vietnam less than a year later , the unit was under @-@ prepared for combat operations . 
 Wilton supported the RAAF 's request that the deputy commander of Australian Forces Vietnam be an air officer , despite the misgivings of some senior Army personnel and the fact that an appointment of this level was not commensurate with the services ' relative commitments to the conflict . In what the official history of Australia in the Vietnam War described as a " pragmatic and far @-@ sighted approach " , Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land / air cooperation , and avoid " increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces " . Following the Federal government 's decision in March 1966 to despatch a task force of two battalions to Vietnam , Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self @-@ contained area of operations for the Australians , in Phuoc Tuy Province , where they could function with a reasonable degree of independence . He also approved Nui Dat , in the centre of the province forward of the major population areas , as the task force 's main base , despite its distance from support units in Vung Tau and the extra effort required to defend it . Wilton rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because , he believed , " their operations became a bit of a meat grinder " with " tremendous casualties " . On 19 May 1966 , he took over from Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee ( CCOSC ) , a position foreshadowing that of the modern Chief of the Defence Force . He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly . According to the official history , the timing of the CCOSC handover was " especially significant " as it " coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman , Chiefs of Staff Committee . Wilton , therefore , carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment . " 
 = = = Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee = = = 
 = = = = Vietnam = = = = 
 Wilton accepted the domino theory and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam , but as early as mid @-@ 1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the North . <unk> about expanding Australia 's involvement , he advocated deploying a Centurion tank squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam , but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967 . Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena , reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people . He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander , Brigadier Ronald Hughes , when the latter was criticised at home for conducting " American style operations " outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy , such as the set @-@ piece battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral in mid @-@ 1968 . Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support , and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation , leading to the formation of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in July 1968 . On 22 August , the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to general , effective 1 September , in recognition of his " outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment " . He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey , twenty @-@ seven years before . 
 US troop reductions in 1969 under President Richard Nixon 's Vietnamization policy led to increasing demands for similar withdrawals of Australian troops . Wilton , Daly and other senior officers argued that the " balanced " nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be " one out , all out " ; the government chose a phased withdrawal , pulling out one battalion in October 1970 and the other two in October and December 1971 . The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton 's own family ; all his children actively opposed it , and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside Parliament House , Canberra , having earlier called upon students at the Australian National University not to register for national service . The Canberra Times ran an article on the Parliament House incident , complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice . As Australia 's senior soldier , Wilton refused to comment on the situation ; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another 's viewpoints , and relations within the family remained amicable . 
 One of the most controversial aspects of Australia 's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969 . Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it , and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground , Brigadier Stuart Graham . When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong , he pointed out that the South Vietnamese , who had been expected to patrol the minefield , were not playing their part . Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander 's decision to implement it was " better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything " . He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was " the biggest blunder " Australia made in Vietnam , declaring that this was " like being wise after the event " . 
 = = = = Joint defence aspirations = = = = 
 Wilton 's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army , Navy and Air Force , nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam . David Horner noted that in an emergency , Wilton " had to issue directives and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee . " According to historian Eric Andrews , Wilton " chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform " . While CGS , he had joined Scherger in calling for a single Australian Defence Force organisation with one Minister of Defence , in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy , supported by its own minister and department . In July 1967 , he became a member of the Tertiary Education ( Services ' Cadet Colleges ) Committee to plan a tri @-@ service military academy , which was eventually opened as the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986 . He was also able to push through a plan to establish , in 1970 , the Joint Intelligence Organisation to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single @-@ service intelligence groups . 
 In 1967 , and again in 1970 , Wilton recommended the creation of a single Defence Board of Administration , consisting of the Defence Minister , the Defence Secretary , CCOSC , and the three service chiefs , to take over the functions of the Air , Military , and Naval Boards , along with those of their separate ministers . While nothing came of this at the time , Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department , which it commenced soon after defeating the Liberals in the December 1972 Federal election . The following year , the single @-@ service ministries were abolished in favour of an all @-@ encompassing Department of Defence ; by 1984 , the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force , directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Wilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral Sir Victor Smith on 23 November 1970 , and retired from the military . He subsequently worked on the Kerr Committee that reviewed pay and conditions in the armed forces , visiting several overseas bases including Nui Dat and Vung Tau . Wilton finished his career as a diplomat , serving as Australia 's Consul @-@ General in New York from September 1973 to November 1975 . In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee , which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and Aboriginal representatives . He died of prostate cancer at his home in Canberra on 10 May 1981 , aged seventy . Survived by his wife and children , Wilton was accorded a military funeral at Duntroon , in the Anzac Memorial Chapel he helped found , and cremated at Norwood Park Crematorium , Canberra . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Reflecting on Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , Wilton considered that it was justified , and that the West 's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam , and the spread of communism to Laos and Cambodia , by almost a decade . " Whether that was worthwhile " , he added , " is a matter for the historian to judge " . The key lesson , he felt , was not to intervene in a conflict " unless you are prepared to win " , because it was " not something that you can just put one foot in and feel the temperature " . 
 Biographer David Horner described Wilton as " arguably the most important and influential Australian Army officer in the second half of the twentieth century " . Horner credited him with making significant contributions to the evolution of the Australian Defence Force through the pursuit of joint command and control . He further noted that whereas Wilton 's predecessor as CCOSC , Scherger , had been promoted to 4 @-@ star rank after four years in the role , and Wilton himself after two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half , Wilton 's successors gained their 4 @-@ star rank upon taking up the position , indicating its growing importance . 
 From an early age Wilton was considered cerebral and introspective ; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind , high standards , and little inclination or capacity for small talk . His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames " Happy Jack " , " Smiling John " and " Sir <unk> " , though he was capable of thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour . Major General Paul Cullen , the Citizen Military Forces member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966 , described Wilton as " very stiff , very regular , very formal — but a pleasant man " . Korean War historian Robert O 'Neill contended that " One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever playing to the gallery .

 Liz had written a comedy sketch titled " Dealbreakers " in the episode " Mamma Mia . " In " Dealbreakers " Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) doled out comic catchphrases as relationship advice to other women such as " If he wears an Atlanta Falcons jersey to your sister 's wedding ? That 's a Deal Breaker , ladies ! " Liz tried to gain attention for writing the sketch , including being in a photoshoot for Time Out magazine with Jenna and ultimately on the cover alone and a talk show appearance in the episode " Kidney Now !

 This episode opens with Liz seeing her books and a cardboard cutout of herself in a bookstore window . She shows Mike ( Jon Glaser ) , a nametag @-@ wearing employee that she is the author but he grows angry with her , showing a quote from her book " If your man is over thirty and still wears a nametag to work , that 's a <unk> , " and he tears apart her cutout . Several other men in Liz 's life including Frank Rossitano ( Judah Friedlander ) , J.D. Lutz ( John Lutz ) , Pete , Tracy , and the janitor yell at her for providing advice which they believed damaged their relationships . Tracy 's wife Angie ( Sherri Shepherd ) kicked him out of their home and he moves in with Liz as punishment for damaging his marriage . Once there he reads Liz 's Dealbreakers book in detail and discovers that much of the book was written directly about him ( calling his various oddities " deal breakers " ) . Also Jenna , angry with Liz over the search for a new cast member which started in the previous episode , travels to Iceland to film a low @-@ budget werewolf movie . 
 Meanwhile , Jack , who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric ( GE ) , travels to Washington , D.C. , to participate in a task force on microwaves as the industry is struggling , but he says he refuses to take any bailout money . He believes the meeting will be quite simple and quick , but once there he is confronted by Devon Banks ( Will Arnett ) who has begun working with the federal government . Devon reveals that he has spent the last year since being fired from GE in " Do @-@ Over " working to get back at Jack by making connections in the Barack Obama administration through a friendship with the president 's daughters , Sasha and Malia . Devon leaks Jack 's controversial testimony from the hearing , believing that public pressure will force Jack to resign in three days . Jack spends that time asking the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff writers — Frank , Lutz , and James " Toofer " Spurlock ( Keith Powell ) — to come up with an idea " as good as the light bulb " to improve the microwave . They try to incorporate suggestions such as making the microwave bigger or making them break down more often so they require replacement , but Jack eventually abandons the project as a failure . However , instead of leaving GE , Jack convinces Devon to give the company bailout money ( which he had previously refused ) , effectively making Devon Jack 's boss .

 " Into the Crevasse " was written by co @-@ showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by Beth McCarthy @-@ Miller , a long @-@ time television director who worked with 30 Rock creator Tina Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live . " Into the Crevasse " originally aired in the United States on October 22 , 2009 , on NBC as the second episode of the show 's fourth season and the 60th overall episode of the series . 
 Comedic actor Will Arnett made his fifth appearance as Devon Banks on 30 Rock , after appearing on " Fireworks " , " Jack Gets in the Game " , " Succession " , and " Do @-@ Over " . Jon Glaser , a comedy actor , guest starred as Mike , a nametag @-@ wearing employee who grows angry with Liz Lemon after showing her a quote from her book . Caitlin Fowler and Shawn Gianella appeared in " Into the Crevasse " as porn versions of Jenna Maroney and Jack Donaghy , respectively , while adult film actress Savanna Samson played the porn version of Liz , as part of Tracy Jordan owning Liz 's life rights . At the end of the episode , Gianella and Samson recreate an earlier scene in which Jack gives Liz her retainer , though , upon receiving the retainer , Samson asks Gianella " How will I ever thank you ? " prompting Tracy to stop production . This whole scene is a reference to a pornographic parody of 30 Rock released earlier the same year . Despite rumors to the contrary , the actors playing ' porn versions ' of 30 Rock characters were not the same performers featured on the original parody . 
 Carlock was asked in a 2009 interview if the TGS writers were going to be seen more in the upcoming season , to which he replied , " One of the great things about this show and the blessing and the curse is that we have so many characters and so many different interactions between characters that work so well . [ ... ] And so , yeah , absolutely because we love those guys " . In " Into the Crevasse " , Frank , Toofer , and Lutz help Jack come up with ideas on how to improve microwaves . 
 Part of this episode featured Jenna shooting a movie in Iceland as a retaliation to Liz , whom Jenna believes is behind the idea of adding a new cast member on TGS , a show Jenna stars in and Liz is the head writer for , though it was Jack 's idea to cast a new actor . In " Season 4 " , the season premiere episode , Jack explains that the show 's staff have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times , and informs Liz to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image . Jenna is not happy with this decision as she believes that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor . The search for a new cast member would continue throughout the season .

 The episode makes several references to the automotive industry crisis of 2008 – 2009 and the financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 . When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies " ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes the rest of us have to put on a show , " a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs en route to a November 19 congressional hearing . The dilemma over bailout money also bears resemblance to federal bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler . In describing how he plans to destroy Jack 's image , Devon says " by the time I 'm done you 're going to make AIG look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves , " a reference to two notable corporations from the financial crisis . Devon also says that in his search for an organization more powerful than GE he selected the American government because , " American Idol 's not on until January . " 
 In their attempt to design a new microwave Jack , Frank , and Toofer change features on the microwave such as adding four doors and putting wheels on it until Jack stops the project saying they had " invented the Pontiac <unk> . " While living in Liz 's apartment Tracy orders several adult films on pay @-@ per @-@ view including The Curious Case of Benjamin Butt and I 'm @-@ A @-@ Do @-@ Us , puns on the films The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ( 2008 ) and Amadeus ( 1984 ) . The story Jack tells Liz about the time he fell down into a crevasse and had to climb down into the darkness is inspired by the 1988 book Touching the Void . In a discussion with Jenna about werewolves , Liz mentions " Thriller " , a music video by recording artist Michael Jackson .

 = Russian ironclad Ne Tron Menia = 
 The Russian ironclad Ne Tron Menia ( Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was the second of the three Pervenets @-@ class broadside ironclads built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the mid @-@ 1860s . She joined the Baltic Fleet upon completion and never left Russian waters . Beginning in 1870 the ship was assigned to the Gunnery Training Detachment and was frequently rearmed . Ne Tron Menia was placed in reserve and hulked a decade later . In 1905 the ship was disarmed and she was sold in 1908 . After the end of the Russian Civil War , she was acquired by the Soviets before being sold to a factory in 1925 . The ship was sunk in the Siege of Leningrad during World War II and was scrapped after she was salvaged in 1950 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The <unk> @-@ class ironclads were designed as Coastal defence ships to protect the approaches to Saint Petersburg and were referred to as " self @-@ propelled armored floating batteries " . As such , a heavy armament and protection were the most important factors in their design . Ne Tron Menia means Touch Me Not and refers to the Biblical verse , John 20 : 17 . 
 Ne Tron Menia was 220 feet ( 67 @.@ 1 m ) long overall , with a beam of 53 feet ( 16 @.@ 2 m ) and a designed draft of 14 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 340 long tons ( 3 @,@ 390 t ) and her iron hull had a pronounced tumblehome . She was fitted with large rams at bow and stern ; the stern ram also serving to protect her rudder and propeller . The ship did not steer well and had " an unpredictable habit of suddenly lurching to one side or another " , probably as a result of poor water flow to the rudder . Ne Tron Menia required six men to man her wheel and her total crew numbered 459 officers and enlisted men . 
 She received the refurbished engine from the steam ship of the line Konstantin as a cost @-@ cutting measure , originally intended for her sister Pervenets . This was probably a direct @-@ acting steam engine and was built by the British firm of Humphrys & Tennant . Steam was provided by four rectangular fire @-@ tube boilers . During sea trials on 18 July 1865 , the engine produced a total of 1 @,@ 200 indicated horsepower ( 890 kW ) and gave the ship a maximum speed of 7 @.@ 75 – 8 knots ( 14 @.@ 35 – 14 @.@ 82 km / h ; 8 @.@ 92 – 9 @.@ 21 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 500 long tons ( 510 t ) of coal , but her endurance is unknown . Ne Tron Menia was schooner @-@ rigged with three iron masts . Under a combination of sail and steam the ship could reach a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) 
 Ne Tron Menia was completed with seventeen 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled guns . Fifteen were mounted on the broadside on the main deck and two guns were placed in pivot mounts on the upper deck to serve as chase guns . One of the main deck guns was removed and a 7 @.@ 72 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) 60 @-@ pounder smoothbore gun was added on the upper deck in 1868 . 
 Unlike Pervenets , the ship 's tumblehome of 27 ° , intended to deflect shells , began above the waterline so the narrow vertical strake of wrought iron armor at the waterline was increased to a thickness of 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 mm ) in compensation for its reduced protective abilities . The rest of the ship 's side was protected with 4 @.@ 5 inches of armor that reduced to 4 inches ( 102 mm ) beginning 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) from the ship 's ends . It backed by 10 inches ( 254 mm ) of teak and extended 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) below the waterline . The ship 's hull was divided by six watertight transverse and two longitudinal bulkheads for protection against underwater damage . The open @-@ topped conning tower was also protected by 4 @.@ 5 inches of armor . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Ne Tron Menia , Touch Ne Not ( from the biblical Latin phrase Noli me <unk> which appears in John 20 : 17 ) , was ordered on 31 May 1862 when a contract was signed with the British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell . The total price of the ship was 923 @,@ 500 rubles . The state @-@ owned <unk> Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg was leased to Mitchell and the Naval Ministry agreed to upgrade the facilities to handle iron @-@ hulled , ironclad warships . The construction of a new slipway large enough to handle the ship delayed the start of construction until 30 January 1863 and the delay allowed the design to be modified to handle larger and more powerful eight @-@ inch rifles about to enter service . These guns required more room to operate than the older , ineffectual smoothbore guns , so the main deck was slightly widened by raising the point at which the hull 's tumblehome began . Based on the experiences with her sister , bilge keels 12 inches ( 305 mm ) deep and 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) were fitted to reduce the ship 's rolling . Ne Tron Menia was not formally laid down until 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 23 June 1864 . 
 The ship entered service on 18 July 1865 with the Baltic Fleet . She collided with the armored frigate Petropavlovsk in July 1869 , and was frequently assigned to the Gunnery Training Detachment after 1870 . As part of this formation , Ne Tron Menia was frequently rearmed to train officers and men on some of the latest guns to enter service . In 1880 she mounted a dozen 8 @-@ inch on her gun deck . On her upper deck , sometimes mounted on platforms that extended over her bulwarks , were a 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) mortar , a 3 @.@ 42 @-@ inch ( 87 mm ) four @-@ pounder , four @-@ barreled gun , a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , and a 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) Palmcrantz auto @-@ cannon . The mortar was removed in 1881 as it strained the ship 's structure . 
 To alleviate the cramped conditions of the steersmen , the ship 's wheel was transferred from the gun deck to a platform that spanned her bulwarks in front of the mizzenmast in 1871 . The conning tower was removed 1876 – 77 and new boilers were installed . These increased the engine 's power to 1 @,@ 700 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 300 kW ) and Ne Tron Menia reached 8 @.@ 5 knots on sea trials . In 1883 , she rammed the Norwegian ship Heiden in 1882 and the ship was placed in reserve three years later . She was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and was hulked on 23 March 1895 . Ne Tron Menia served with the Mine School at Kronstadt before she was disarmed on 15 September 1905 and stricken from the Navy List on 11 October . Turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal , she was sold on 8 September 1908 to be used as a barge . Ne Tron Menia was acquired by the Soviets after the Russian Civil War and then sold to the Leningrad Metal Works on 24 June 1925 . During World War II , she was sunk in the Neva River . She was raised in 1950 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = Battle of Mahé = 
 The Battle of Mahé was a minor naval engagement of the last year of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought on 19 August 1801 in the harbour of Mahé in the Seychelles , a French colony in the Indian Ocean . Since the demise of the French Indian Ocean squadron in 1799 , the Royal Navy had maintained dominance in the East Indies , controlling the shipping routes along which trade flowed and allowing the rapid movement of military forces around the theatre . French First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte had long @-@ harboured ambitions of threatening British India , and in 1798 had launched an invasion of Egypt as an initial step to achieving this goal . The campaign had failed , and the French army in Egypt was under severe pressure by early 1801 , partly due to the presence of a British squadron acting with impunity in the Red Sea . 
 To disrupt British ships supplying the Red Sea squadron the French Navy sent the newly built 36 @-@ gun frigate Chiffonne to the Western Indian Ocean under the command of Pierre Guiyesse . This ship , also carrying 32 exiled political prisoners , was instructed to operate from Mahé . After an eventual journey , Chiffone arrived in the Seychelles in August and Guiyesse ordered his crew to effect repairs before the mission could begin . Anchored in a bay sheltered by coral reefs and protected by a hastily erected gun battery , he believed his ship would be safe from attack . 
 The British commander in the region , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier , had assumed the French would send a force against the Red Sea squadron and ordered the 38 @-@ gun frigate HMS Sibylle under Captain Charles Adam to investigate . Adam sailed to Mahé and discovered the French ship undergoing repairs . Carefully manoeuvring through the coral reefs , Adam brought Sybille alongside Chiffone and fought a brief but fiercely contested battle before Guiyesse was forced to surrender . A month later , the French brig Flèche , operating from the same harbour on the same mission , was intercepted and sunk by the brig HMS Victor . These operations were the last significant actions of the war in the Indian Ocean , the Peace of Amiens coming into effect in October . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1801 the French Revolutionary Wars were drawing to a close . The conflict , which had begun in 1792 , had seen the new French Republic and its allies fighting against a shifting coalition of European powers , of which only Great Britain , recently renamed the United Kingdom , had been consistently opposed to France . In the Indian Ocean , where Britain maintained a lucrative trading Empire centred on British India , the Royal Navy had enjoyed almost continual supremacy under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier . Only between 1796 and 1799 had the French Navy , in the form of a squadron of frigates operating from the island base of Île de France under the command of Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey , offered any resistance . Gradually this force had either returned to France or been defeated in battle , and the destruction of the frigate Preneuse at the Battle of Port Louis in December 1799 had restored absolute British control . 
 = = = Bonaparte in Egypt = = = 
 The importance of the East Indies to British trade encouraged a number of French plans to threaten the region , of which the most advanced was the invasion , in 1798 , of Egypt by a French Army under General Napoleon Bonaparte . Although the campaign saw initial success , the annihilation of the French Mediterranean Fleet by Sir Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798 effectively doomed the campaign to failure . Later in the year Bonaparte considered building a squadron at Suez in the Red Sea , but the plans were abandoned when a British squadron , operating from Jeddah under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral John Blankett assumed control of the region . Bonaparte returned to France the following year , but the British Red Sea squadron remained in operation . 
 In 1801 , a British army landed in Northern Egypt , sparking a short campaign which ended with the Capitulation of Alexandria and the complete surrender of French forces in the country . Blankett 's squadron provided distant support for this effort , sending an army from the garrison of India up the Nile , although this force arrived too late to influence the campaign . The French however wished to disrupt British operations in the Red Sea , and considered a number of schemes including diverting Ganteaume 's expedition to the Indian Ocean . Eventually however the only warship available was the newly constructed 36 @-@ gun frigate Chiffonne , which sailed from Nantes on 14 April 1801 under the command of Commander Pierre Guiyesse . Also on board were 32 political prisoners condemned to exile , who Guiyesse was ordered to land at Mahé . 
 = = = Guiyesse 's journey = = = 
 Chiffonne had an eventful voyage to the Indian Ocean , capturing a Portuguese merchant schooner off Brazil on 15 May and then encountering a Portuguese frigate <unk> on 18 May . Armed with 24 24 @-@ pounder carronades , <unk> was no match for Chiffone 's 36 12 @-@ pounder long guns and surrendered after a short fight . Guiyesse subsequently released the warship , although not before throwing the guns overboard and forcing the officers to agree parole . Passing the British @-@ held Cape of Good Hope , Guiyesse captured the East Indiaman Bellona on 16 June , placing a prize crew aboard and sending the ship to Île de France , where it arrived without incident . Chiffone however was not sailing for the naval base at Port Louis , but to the small French harbour on Mahé in the Seychelles . The Seychelles were a French colony administered by Île de France , although they had supposedly been declared neutral following an attack on Mahé by HMS Orpheus . More importantly for Guiyesse , Mahé was well situated as a base from which to prey on the British shipping routes to the Red Sea . 
 Rainier had been campaigning in the Indian Ocean since 1794 , and had anticipated that the French might send a naval force to disrupt operations in the Red Sea . He surmised that the Seychelles were ideally situated for this type of operation and issued orders for one of his largest frigates to cruise in the area to intercept any French raiders . This ship was HMS Sibylle , a 38 @-@ gun frigate captured from the French in 1794 at the Battle of Mykonos . The commander was Charles Adam , who had replaced Edward Cooke after Cooke was mortally wounded during the capture of the French frigate Forte in the Bay of Bengal at the Action of 28 February 1799 . 
 On arriving at Mahé , Guiyesse landed his prisoners and ordered his men to make repairs to their frigate following their long journey . The foremast in particular needed work , and it was consequently removed , Guiyesse carefully anchoring Chiffone at the centre of a complex series of coral reefs . The captured schooner and a small ketch were anchored alongside assisting with repairs and Guiyesse had ordered his men to establish a supporting gun battery on the shore , positioned to inflict raking fire on any ship attempting to engage the French frigate . This battery was composed of guns taken from the forecastle of Chiffone , stabilised on wooden planks and protected by fascines . Behind the battery a furnace had been constructed to allow the guns to fire specially heated shot , designed to set fire to attacking ships . 
 = = Battle of Mahé = = 
 In the early morning of 19 August , Sybille was reconnoitering the Seychelles when flag signals were observed over Ste . Anne Island , a small island to the east of Mahé . Adam felt this was an unusual circumstance and ordered his ship to investigate . Passing Ste . Anne flying false French colours , Chiffone could be clearly seen at anchor close inshore at Mahé . Adam ordered the main topsail backed and prepared his ship with springs on the anchor cables to provide more maneuverability in shallow waters . The main batteries of 24 @-@ pounder long guns were cleared for action and , with his preparations made , Adam gave orders for the foresail set , gliding slowly forward into the complex system of reefs which sheltered the French ship . Passage through these obstacles was only possible by stationing a man at the masthead who was tasked with observing the colour of the water ahead of the ship : darker water indicated deeper water , but the gradations in color were so slight that they could only be observed from the vantage point on top of the mainmast . 
 Adam 's slow progress took more than an hour , reaching the safer waters of the inner roads at 10 : 15 . Guiyesse was prepared , and at 10 : 00 he had fired a warning shot at the distant Sybille and raised the French tricolor . Adam was still separated from Chiffone by an impenetrable reef , but had now closed the distance between the ships to approximately 200 yards ( 180 m ) , well within effective range . At 10 : 25 Sybille was aligned correctly and Adam raised his ensign and fired the first broadside , followed instantly by fire from Chiffone , the schooner and the battery on shore , which as planned was positioned correctly to rake Sybille . The exchange was a short one , lasting only 17 minutes . At 10 : 42 , with casualties mounting and his ship damaged , Guiyesse struck his colours and cut his ship 's anchor cables , allowing Chiffone to drift onto the reef . The schooner had been sunk by well placed shot from the quarterdeck . Adam responded by swinging Sybille about to fire on the battery , sending ship 's boats to take possession of Chiffone and attack the shore party manning the battery . When the boats reached the beach however , the French gunners retreated inland , leaving their guns behind . 
 Sybille 's loss was light , with two men killed and a junior officer lightly wounded . Casualties on Chiffone were far heavier , reported as 23 killed and 30 wounded . Approximately 160 of the surviving crew were captured , with as many as 100 escaping inland from the grounded frigate or the battery . In the aftermath of the battle Adam of the Sybille demanded an explanation from the Governor of Mahé Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> de Quincy as to why the neutrality terms had been violated by Chiffone . Quincy was able however to persuade Adam that he was not responsible and reached an agreement that Seychelles merchant vessels flying a flag bearing the words " Seychelles Capitulation " would be allowed to pass through the British blockade of Île de France unmolested . Chiffone was removed from the reef and repaired , Adam sailing with his prize and two captured schooners on 4 May and returning to Madras , arriving on 22 September , where Rainier authorised the purchase of the ship for the Royal Navy under the same name . Adam was subsequently presented with a commemorative sword by the Madras Insurance Company worth 200 guineas .

Victor , commanded by Captain George Ralph Collier , was a small ship with an exceptionally heavy armament , mounting 16 32 @-@ pounder short @-@ ranged carronades and two 6 @-@ pounder long guns . Collier had been detached from the Red Sea squadron to hunt for Flèche and initially sailed to Diego Garcia to stock up on turtle meat before starting his cruise off the Seychelles . Sighting his quarry , Collier gave chase and caught the French brig at 17 : 30 , only to have his rigging badly damaged by two broadsides from Flèche , although his own guns caused considerable damage in return . Bonami used his advantage to pull away from Victor , but was unable to lose his opponent . Collier followed his elusive enemy for the next two days , occasionally pulling within range but never close enough for a decisive action . By dawn on 5 September however the French brig had escaped . 
 Collier assumed that Flèche was seeking shelter at Mahé and directed Victor towards the harbour . When the island came in sight at 15 : 30 on the same day , the French brig could be seen in the anchorage . Collier slowly approached his target , anchoring beyond the reef at 19 : 00 @.@ with night approaching Collier was unwilling to risk his vessel in the complex channels , and instead the ship 's master , James Crawford , took a boat out during the night and took soundings to locate a safe channel . Although the boat came under fire , a course was successfully plotted . The next morning Flèche lay ready for action at the mouth of the channel , a revolutionary red flag flying at the mast head and volunteers from the escaped crew of Chiffone helping to man the guns . Collier took Victor across the reef in the face of the French brig , which maintained a constant raking fire into the British ship as it advanced . The process took all day , Victor not reaching the safer waters of the inner road until 21 : 00 and gradually warping within close range of Flèche during the evening . At 23 : 45 Collier deemed his ship was close enough to the enemy and opened fire with his main broadside . A fierce close range duel began , lasting more than two hours , until at 02 : 20 on 7 September Flèche began to sink . 
 As British boat crews advanced on the brig to take possession , the French crew drove their brig onto the reef deliberately and set the vessel ablaze . As they departed the British crew arrived , lowered the flag and extinguished the fire . The damage to the French ship had been too great however and Flèche slowly rolled over into deeper water and sank below the surface . Although two men had been wounded in the fighting on 2 September , not a single British casualty was recorded on 7 September , despite heavy damage to the hull and rigging of Victor . Bonami later reported four of his men killed and did not specify the number of wounded , although British sailors reported seeing significantly higher casualties when they boarded the brig .

 The fighting at Mahé marked the final significant engagements of the war in the Indian Ocean ; Lord St Vincent described the capture of Chiffone as " the last and neatest frigate action of the war " . On 1 October the terms of the Peace of Amiens were agreed , and although news did not reach the Indian Ocean until February 1802 Rainier had been expecting the peace and had launched no offensive operations in the meantime . The Peace effectively returned the theatre to its pre @-@ war status , the only territory which permanently changed hands was Dutch Ceylon , which became a Crown Colony . Both sides sought to use the peace to rebuild their naval forces in the East Indies : no one in the theatre expected the Peace to last long , and when the Napoleonic Wars began in May 1803 both Britain and France maintained powerful squadrons in the Indian Ocean .

 = Spanish conquest of Chiapas = 
 The Spanish conquest of Chiapas was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Mexican state of Chiapas . The region is physically diverse , featuring a number of highland areas , including the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and the Montañas Centrales ( Central Highlands ) , a southern littoral plain known as Soconusco and a central depression formed by the drainage of the Grijalva River . 
 Before the Spanish conquest , Chiapas was inhabited by a variety of indigenous peoples , including the Zoques , various Maya peoples , such as the Lakandon Ch 'ol and the Tzotzil , and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas . Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire , centred in Valley of Mexico , and paid the Aztecs tribute . News of strangers first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire . In the early 1520s , several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land , and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast . The first highland colonial town in Chiapas , San Cristóbal de los Llanos , was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527 . Within a year , Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River , Comitán , and the Ocosingo valley . <unk> rights were established , although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave @-@ raiding rights . 
 The colonial province of Chiapa was established by Diego Mazariegos in 1528 , with the reorganisation of existing encomiendas and colonial jurisdictions , and the renaming of San Cristóbal as Villa Real , and its relocation to Jovel . Excessive Spanish demands for tribute and labour caused a rebellion by the indigenous inhabitants , who attempted to starve out the Spanish . The conquistadores launched punitive raids , but the natives abandoned their towns and fled to inaccessible regions . Internal divisions among the Spanish led to a general instability in the province ; eventually the Mazariegos faction gained concessions from the Spanish Crown that allowed for the elevation of Villa Real to the status of city , as Ciudad Real , and the establishment of new laws that promoted stability in the newly conquered region . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Mexican state of Chiapas occupies the extreme southeast of Mexico , covering an area of 74 @,@ 415 square kilometres ( 28 @,@ 732 sq mi ) . To the west , it borders with the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Veracruz , and to the north with Tabasco . It borders on the east with Guatemala ; the southern border consists of 260 kilometres ( 160 mi ) of Pacific coastline . Chiapas is geographically and culturally diverse . It features two principal highland regions : to the south is the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and in central Chiapas are the Montañas Centrales ( Central Highlands ) . They are separated by the Depresión Central , containing the drainage basin of the Grijalva River . The Sierra Madre highlands gain altitude from west to east , with the highest mountains near the Guatemalan border . 
 The littoral zone of Soconusco lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas , and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre . Although the entire coastal strip is often referred to as Soconusco , Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands . The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El <unk> ( " The <unk> " ) ; it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region ( Spanish : <unk> @-@ Costa ) . 
 The Depresión Central consists of a drainage basin some 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) long and varying in width from 30 to 60 kilometres ( 19 to 37 mi ) . The Grijalva River is fed by drainage from the Cuchumatanes mountains of Guatemala and from both of the Chiapas highland regions , <unk> the Sierra Madre . The wide plains feature a hot climate with moderate rainfall . The Depresión Central is itself divided into two zones , the eastern is the Grijalva Valley stretching from the Guatemalan border to the Sumidero Canyon ; the western zone is the Meseta Central , or Central Plateau , in colonial times referred to as the Valle de Jiquipilas y <unk> . This region of high plains blocks the passage of the Grijalva River , which has cut its way through towards Tabasco by means of the Sumidero Canyon . Los <unk> is another highland region at the northern extreme of the Meseta Central and bordering with Oaxaca ; it is considered the first upthrust of the Sierra Madre . 
 The Central Highlands rise sharply to the north of the Grijalva , to a maximum altitude of 2 @,@ 400 metres ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) , then descend gradually towards the Yucatán Peninsula . They are cut by deep valleys running parallel to the Pacific coast , and feature a complex drainage system that feeds both the Grijalva and the Lacantún River , which feeds into the Usumacinta River . The Central Highlands feature high rainfall and diverse vegetation dependent upon altitude , from high @-@ altitude pine forests to lowland tropical forest further north and east towards the plains of Tabasco and Petén . At the eastern end of the Central Highlands is the Lacandon Forest , which is largely mountainous with lowland tropical plains at its easternmost extreme . 
 = = Chiapas before the conquest = = 
 The earliest human inhabitants of Chiapas were foragers living in the northern highlands and along the coastal strip from approximately 6000 BC until about 2000 BC . For approximately the last two millennia BC , the majority of the territory that is now covered by the state of Chiapas was occupied by Zoque @-@ speaking peoples . Gradually , Mayan @-@ speakers began to make inroads from the east and , from about 200 AD , Chiapas was divided roughly equally between the Zoques in the western half and Maya in the eastern half ; this distribution continued up to the time of the Spanish conquest . 
 A broad swathe of western Chiapas was held by the Zoques , covering the Depresión Central , the middle Grijalva basin , the <unk> and parts of the Pacific coastline . The main Zoque settlements in the Depresión Central were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Their settlements on the western side of the Grijalva River included <unk> , Jiquipilas , <unk> and the <unk> valley . <unk> was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the modern state capital , Tuxtla Gutiérrez . The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques , and dominated trade routes running through their territory . In pre @-@ Columbian times , the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region , Chiapa and Copanaguastla . The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas , whose ethnicity and language are unknown . The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest ; they had forced a number of important Zoque settlements to pay them tribute , and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire . The <unk> territory lay between the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya , in the upper and middle Grijalva basin ; their main settlements were Acala , Chiapa , <unk> , Pochutla and <unk> . 
 The central highlands were occupied by a number of Maya peoples , including the Tzotzil , who were divided into a number of provinces ; the province of Chamula was said to have five small towns grouped closely together . The Tojolabal were another Maya people , with territory around Comitán . The Coxoh Maya held territory in the upper reaches of the Grijalva drainage , near the Guatemalan border , and were probably a subgroup of the Tojolabal . Soconusco was an important communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America . It had been subjugated by the Aztec Triple Alliance at the end of the 15th century , under the emperor <unk> , and paid tribute in cacao . The Cholan Maya @-@ speaking Lakandon ( not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name ) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén in Guatemala . The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish . 
 = = Prelude to conquest = = 
 Rumours of strangers on the Atlantic coast reached Chiapas long before the physical presence of Spaniards in the region . This was followed by messengers from the Aztec emperor , Moctezuma II , to the K 'iche ' Maya of the Guatemalan Highlands , warning them to prepare for war against the Spanish intruders . This was soon followed by news that the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the conquistadores . A mixed embassy that included Chiapanecas , K 'iche 's and Kaqchikel Maya visited Hernan Cortés in the recently conquered Aztec capital , and were well received . 
 In 1522 , Spanish ships explored the Pacific shore of Chiapas when Andrés Niño followed the coast from Panama northwest to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . In December that year , <unk> , who was lord of the Tzotzil Maya town of Zinacantan , travelled to the Spanish settlement at Villa del Espíritu Santo ( modern Coatzacoalcos ) to pledge an alliance with the newcomers . 
 = = Strategies , tactics and weaponry = = 
 The Spanish conquest had as its principal aims the physical incorporation of the indigenous peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire , and their spiritual conversion to Christianity . This involved the dismantling of indigenous power structures , the destruction of pagan temples and idols , the concentration of indigenous populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised , the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes , and the introduction of Christian imagery . One side of this involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force ; the religious side of this struggle was the generally peaceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity . In Chiapas , such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order . The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements , the construction of churches and convents , and the religious instruction of the natives . 
 The 16th @-@ century Spanish conquistadores were armed with broadswords , rapiers , crossbows , matchlocks and light artillery . Mounted conquistadores were armed with a 3 @.@ 7 @-@ metre ( 12 ft ) lance , that also served as a pike for infantrymen . A variety of halberds and bills were also employed . As well as the one @-@ handed broadsword , a 1 @.@ 7 @-@ metre ( 5 @.@ 5 ft ) long two @-@ handed version was also used . Crossbows had 0 @.@ 61 @-@ metre ( 2 ft ) arms stiffened with hardwoods , horn , bone and cane , and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley . Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks , especially in a humid tropical climate . 
 Metal armour was of limited use in the hot , wet tropical climate . It was heavy and had to be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting ; in direct sunlight , metal armour became unbearably hot . Conquistadores often went without metal armour , or only donned it immediately prior to battle . They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents , and commonly combined this with the use of a simple metal war hat . Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry ; generally this was a circular target shield , convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood . Rings secured it to the arm and hand . 
 While the encomienda colonial labour @-@ supply system was in the process of being established , slave raids became a part of the cycle of conquest . The Spanish would round up indigenous peoples , brand them as slaves , and trade them at ports on the Gulf of Mexico for horses and weaponry , allowing further conquest and the acquisition of new slaves for trade . 
 The Tzotzil Maya of highland Chiapas used spears , thrown rocks , bows and arrows , and large flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior from head to foot and could be rolled up for storage . Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades , built from packed earth and stone , and reinforced with tree trunks . Defenders would hurl stones down from above , or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers . As the Spanish became established in Chiapas , indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions . 
 = = = Impact of Old World diseases = = = 
 Although heavily populated prior to the conquest , the impact of Old World diseases was one of the factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot , moist lands of the Depresión Central , which remain sparsely populated to this day . Likewise , Soconusco was rapidly depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish . Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox , influenza , measles and a number of pulmonary diseases , including tuberculosis . 
 = = Conquest of Soconusco = = 
 Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523 , en route to conquer Guatemala . Alvarado 's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs , and included cavalry and artillery ; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula , Tenochtitlan , <unk> , Tlaxcala , and Xochimilco . Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco , and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown . They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish . Alvarado 's letter to Hernán Cortés describing his passage through Soconusco is lost , and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo , who was not present , but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado . By 1524 , Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces . Over the next fifty years , native population levels collapsed catastrophically as a result of exposure to Old World diseases , with an estimated 90 – 95 % drop . In spite of this , the colonial administration demanded twice as much tribute in cacao as had been paid to the Aztecs prior to the Spanish invasion , and cacao continued to be an important crop throughout the colonial period . Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony , the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards . As a result , the inhabitants of Soconusco were less likely to be rounded up into new reducción settlements , where the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature . 
 Spanish jurisdiction over the province of Soconusco was subject to frequent changes . Immediately after the conquest , it was held in encomienda first by Hernán Cortés , then by Jorge de Alvarado . By 1530 , the Audiencia Real of Mexico had jurisdiction over the province of <unk> , which was now held in encomienda by the Spanish Crown . It was governed by colonial officers appointed in Mexico . In 1556 , Soconusco passed into the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala , with independent governors appointed by the Crown . From 1564 – 69 , Soconusco was passed back into the jurisdiction of Mexico , before once again becoming an independent province administered by the Audiencia Real of Guatemala , where it remained until the late 18th century . 
 Ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the inhabitants was equally chaotic ; it was first placed under the Diocese of Tlaxcala but was transferred to the Diocese of Guatemala in 1536 . The Dominican Order was active in Soconusco during the early years of colonial rule , but withdrew in 1545 due to the low levels of indigenous population and the unhealthy climate . In 1545 it became a part of the Diocese of Chiapa . It was returned to Guatemala in 1561 , and back to Chiapa in 1596 .

 = = = Luis Marín , 1524 = = = 
 In 1524 Luis Marín led a small party on a reconnaissance expedition into Chiapas . He set out from Coatzacoalcos ( renamed Espíritu Santo by the Spanish ) , on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico . His party passed through Zoque territory and followed the Grijalva upriver . Near modern Chiapa de Corzo the Spanish party fought and defeated the <unk> . Following this battle , Marín headed into the central highlands of Chiapas , and around Easter , he passed through the Tzotzil Maya town Zinacantan without opposition from the inhabitants . The Zinacantecos , true to their pledge of allegiance two years earlier , aided the Spanish against the other indigenous peoples of the region . 
 Marín arrived at Chamula , another Tzotzil town , where he was initially met by a peaceful embassy . Marín understood this as the submission of the inhabitants , but he was met by armed resistance when he tried to enter the province . The Spanish found that upon their approach the Chamula Tzotzil had abandoned their lands and stripped it of food in an attempt to discourage the invaders . A day after their initial approach , Marín found that the Chamula Tzotzil had gathered their warriors upon a ridge that was too steep for the Spanish horses to climb . The conquistadores were met with a barrage of stones , spears , arrows , boiling water mixed with lime and ash , and found the nearby town defended by a formidable 1 @.@ 2 @-@ metre ( 4 ft ) thick defensive wall fashioned from stone and earth and reinforced with <unk> . The Tzotzil mocked the Spanish , hurling small quantities of gold at them and inviting them to try and take the rest that they had within their walls . The Spanish stormed the wall , to find that the inhabitants had left spears planted inside to make the Spanish think that warriors were still defending the town , when they had actually withdrawn under cover of torrential rain that had interrupted the battle . After taking the deserted Chamula , the Spanish expedition continued against their allies at Huixtan . Again the inhabitants offered armed resistance before abandoning their town to the Spanish . Conquistador Diego Godoy wrote that the Indians killed or captured at Huixtan numbered no more than 500 . The Spanish , by now disappointed with the scarce pickings , decided to retreat to Coatzacoalcos in May 1524 . 
 The expedition originally had high expectations of encountering a densely populated region that would quickly submit to Spanish rule , with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores , effectively as slave labour . The fierce resistance to Luis Marín 's expedition quickly extinguished such hopes . However , within two years of this first reconnaissance , titles of encomienda were being issued and used as justification to seize slaves . Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz , and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de <unk> . 
 = = = Pedro de Alvarado , 1525 = = = 
 A year later , Pedro de Alvarado entered Chiapas when he crossed a part of the Lacandon Forest in an attempt to link up with an expedition headed by Hernán Cortés , that crossed from the Gulf of Mexico to Honduras . Alvarado entered Chiapas from Guatemala via the territory of the Acala Ch 'ol ; he was unable to locate Cortés , and his scouts eventually led him to Tecpan Puyumatlan ( modern Santa Eulalia in Guatemala ) , in a mountainous region near the territory of the Lakandon Ch 'ol . The inhabitants of Tecpan Puyumatlan offered fierce resistance against the Spanish @-@ led expedition , and Gonzalo de Alvarado wrote that the Spanish suffered many losses , including the killing of messengers sent to summon the natives to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown . After failing to locate Cortés , the Alvarados returned to Guatemala . 
 = = Conquest of the Chiapas Highlands , 1527 @-@ 1547 = = 
 Highland Chiapas , known as Chiapa , fell under the jurisdiction of New Spain until 1530 , when it was transferred to Guatemala . In 1540 , Chiapa became a self @-@ governing province for four years , after which it once again fell within the jurisdiction of Guatemala . The province of Chiapa was governed from Ciudad Real , now known as San Cristóbal de las Casas . 
 Pedro de Portocarrero , a young nobleman , led the next expedition into Chiapas after Alvarado , again from Guatemala . His campaign is largely undocumented but in January 1528 he successfully established the settlement of San Cristóbal de los Llanos in the Comitán valley , in the territory of the Tojolabal Maya . This served as a base of operations that allowed the Spanish to extend their control towards the Ocosingo valley . One of the scarce mentions of Portocarrero 's campaign suggests that there was some indigenous resistance but its exact form and extent is unknown . The Coxoh Maya , who inhabited a small area along the San Gregorio River between Comitán and the Guatemalan border , were probably conquered in 1528 . The Spanish concentrated them into five small reducciones , three of which were established along the Royal Road ( Spanish : Camino Real ) running from San Cristóbal to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala . Portocarrero established Spanish dominion over a number of Tzeltal and Tojolabal settlements , and penetrated as far as the Tzotzil town of Huixtan . He travelled no further into Tzotzil territory , since those lands had already been given in encomienda to residents of Villa de Espíritu Santo . 
 By 1528 , Spanish colonial power had been established in the Chiapas Highlands , and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores . Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva , across Comitán and <unk> to the Ocosingo valley . This area was incorporated into the Villa de San Cristóbal district , also including Chamula , Chiapan , and Zinacantán . The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district , that included Ch 'ol Maya territory around Tila , and Zoque territory around <unk> and <unk> . 
 In the early years of conquest , encomienda rights effectively meant rights to pillage and round up slaves , usually in the form of a group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre . Prisoners would be branded as slaves , and taken to a port to be sold , in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons , supplies , and horses . In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders , chain them up , whip them and set their war dogs upon them , in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing . 
 = = = Diego Mazariegos , 1528 = = = 
 In 1528 , captain Diego Mazariegos crossed into Chiapas via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec with <unk> and recruits recently arrived from Spain , who were without military experience . By this time , the indigenous population had been greatly reduced by a combination of disease and famine . They first travelled to Jiquipilas to meet up with a delegation from Zinacantan , who had asked for Spanish assistance against rebellious vassals in <unk> <unk> . A small contingent of Spanish cavalry was enough to bring the Zinacantecos ' vassals back into line . After this , Mazariegos and his companions proceeded to Chiapan and set up a temporary camp nearby , that they named Villa Real . Mazariegos was the cousin of the then governor of New Spain , Alonso de Estrada . He had arrived with a mandate to establish a new colonial province of Chiapa in the Chiapas Highlands . He initially met with resistance from the veteran Spanish conquistadores who had already established themselves in the region . Mazariegos heard that Pedro de Portocarrero was in the highlands , and sought him out in order to persuade him to leave . The two conquistadors eventually met up in Huixtan . Mazariegos entered into protracted three @-@ month negotiations with the Spanish settlers in Coatzacoalcos ( Espíritu Santo ) and San Cristóbal de los Llanos . Eventually an agreement was reached , and the encomiendas of Villa del Espíritu Santo that lay in the highlands were removed from that jurisdiction and merged those of San Cristóbal to form the new province . Unknown to Mazariegos , the king had already issued an order that the settlements of San Cristóbal de los Llanos be transferred to Pedro de Alvarado . The end result of the negotiations between Mazariegos and the established settlers was that Villa de San Cristóbal de los Llanos was broken up , and those settlers who wished to remain were transferred to Villa Real , which had been moved to the fertile Jovel valley , containing rich <unk> land belonging to Chamula . Pedro de Portocarrero decided to leave Chiapas , and he returned to Guatemala . Mazariegos proceeded with the policy of moving the Indians into reducciones , new nuclear settlements that were easy to control . This process was made easier by the much reduced indigenous population levels . The town of San Andrés <unk> was established in this way by the relocation of the Tzotzil inhabitants of the <unk> valley . Mazariegos reallocated those encomiendas that had belonged to the inhabitants of Villa del Espíritu Santo , and gave Zinacantan to Pedro de Estrada , his brother . Mazariegos issued licences of encomienda covering still unconquered regions , such as Pochutla at the edge of the Ocosingo valley , in order to encourage colonists to conquer new territory . The Province of Chiapa had no coastal territory , and at the end of this process about 100 Spanish settlers were concentrated in the remote provincial capital at Villa Real , surrounded by hostile Indian settlements , and with deep internal divisions . 
 = = = Rebellion = = = 
 Although Mazariegos had managed to establish his new provincial capital without armed conflict , excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion . The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food , wood for construction and firewood , and that they build new houses for the Spanish . In addition , pigs had been introduced by the Spanish and were causing great damage to the natives ' maize fields . In August 1528 , Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies ; the natives , seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers , took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters . Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish . 
 Villa Real was now surrounded by hostile territory , and any Spanish help was too far away to be of value . The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves . The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves . The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops . At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish , resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast down upon them from the mountaintop . The battle lasted various days , and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico . The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory , but the rest of the province of Chiapa remained rebellious . 
 After the battle of Quetzaltepeque , Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill . He sent his brother to the capital of New Spain to ask for help , and then retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council , which was left to defend the fledgling colony . By now , Nuño de Guzmán was governor in Mexico , and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end @-@ of @-@ term judge over Mazariegos , and as alcalde mayor ( a local colonial governor ) . He occupied his post for a year , during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province , especially the northern and eastern regions , but was unable to make much headway . 
 = = = Founding of Ciudad Real = = = 
 The constant change of colonial administrators , and the corresponding reissue of encomienda licenses to relatives and friends of the incoming official , prolonged the instability in the province of Chiapa . In 1531 , Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa . He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real . Once again , the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners . The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan ; it was not successful in terms of conquest , but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses . The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still @-@ independent regions , leading to a cycle of slave raids , trade for supplies , followed by further conquests and slave raids . 
 Alvarado despatched his lieutenant Baltasar Guerra to pacify the rebel Chiapanecas and Zoques , and the victorious conquistadores in turn demanded encomiendas . The general instability continued , but the Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions . In 1535 , the Mazariegos faction succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city , with the new name of Ciudad Real . They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony , such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative . In practise , the quick turnover of encomiendas continued , since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit . This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s , when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists . At around the same time , the Audiencia de los <unk> intervened , appointing judges to exert greater control over the allocation of encomiendas . 
 = = = Establishment of the Dominicans = = = 
 In 1542 , the New Laws were issued with the aim of protecting the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos . In an effort to enforce the New Laws , a fleet of 27 ships set out from Spain on 19 July 1544 , carrying friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his religious followers . Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545 . The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population . Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities . 
 The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists . They refused to take confessions or give sacraments to Spaniards who mistreated Indians , and even went so far as to imprison a dean and excommunicate the president of the Audiencia Real . Colonial opposition to the actions of the Dominicans reached such dangerous levels that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives . They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages , the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán . Las Casas based himself in the former , and friar Tomás Casillas took charge of Cinacantlán . From Villa Real , Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa . The territory of Chiapas was subdivided into a number of regions based on <unk> divisions ; these were the <unk> , Lakandon , <unk> , Tojolabal , Tzeltal , and Zoque . The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros ( St. James the Moor @-@ slayer ) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority . 
 It soon became evident that the Dominicans needed to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real , and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed . In 1547 , while de las Casas was in Spain , Francisco Marroquín , bishop of Guatemala , placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real . The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols , and preached sermons with destructive imagery , such as from the Book of Revelation , that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview . Saints were associated with animals , in much the same way as the Indians identified themselves with <unk> spirit @-@ forms . Different Mesoamerican <unk> were tied to Christian concepts , where the <unk> world of the dead became Hell , <unk> became Heaven , and <unk> became Paradise . 
 = = Conquest of the Lacandon Forest , 1559 – 1695 = = 
 By the mid @-@ 16th century , the Spanish frontier expanding outwards from Comitán and Ocosingo reached the Lacandon Forest , and further advancement was impeded by the region 's fiercely independent inhabitants . At the time of Spanish contact in the 16th century , the Lacandon Forest was inhabited by Ch 'ol people referred to as Lakam Tun . This name was <unk> , first to El <unk> , then to <unk> and finally to Lacandon . The Lakandon Ch 'ol of the time of the Spanish conquest should not be confused with the modern Yucatec @-@ speaking Lacandon people occupying the same region . The main Lakandon village was situated on an island in Lake Miramar , also referred to as Lakam Tun by the inhabitants . The Lakandon were aggressive , and their numbers were swelled by refugees from neighbouring indigenous groups fleeing Spanish domination . The ecclesiastical authorities were so worried by this threat to their peaceful efforts at evangelisation that they eventually supported military intervention . The first Spanish expedition against the Lakandon was carried out in 1559 , commanded by Pedro Ramírez de Quiñones . 
 From time to time the Spanish launched punitive military expeditions against the <unk> to try to stabilise the northern frontier of the Guatemalan colony ; the largest expeditions took place in 1685 and 1695 . Repeated expeditions into the Lacandon Forest succeeded in destroying some villages but did not manage to subdue the inhabitants of the region , nor bring it within the Spanish Empire . This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule . 
 Resistance against the Spanish continued , and hostile Ch 'ol killed a number of newly baptised Christian Indians . Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor López were active among the Lakandon and Manche Ch 'ol between 1692 and 1694 ; they eventually outstayed their welcome and were expelled by the Ch 'ol . In 1695 , the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán , and soldiers commanded by Jacinto de Barrios Leal , president of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala , conquered a number of Ch 'ol communities . The most important of these was Sakb 'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas , which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores , or Dolores del Lakandon , in April 1695 . This was one part of a three @-@ pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Chiapas and neighbouring Petén ; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from Huehuetenango , in the Guatemalan Highlands . The third group , under Juan Díaz de Velasco , marched from Verapaz , Guatemala , against the Itza of northern Petén . Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops . The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers . Mercederian friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon , and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Ch 'ols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Ch 'ol communities . 
 Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697 . The Ch 'ol of the Lacandon Forest were resettled in Huehuetenango , in the Guatemalan Highlands , in the early 18th century . The resettled Lakandon Ch 'ol were soon absorbed into the local Maya populations there and ceased to exist as a separate ethnicity . The last known Lakandon Ch 'ol were three Indians that were recorded as living in Santa Catarina Retalhuleu in 1769 .

 = Muhammad = 
 Muḥammad ( Arabic : محمد ; c . 570 CE – 8 June 632 CE ) is the central figure of Islam and widely regarded as its founder by non @-@ Muslims . He is known to Muslims as the " Holy Prophet " , almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam , which they believe to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam , Abraham , Moses , Jesus , and other prophets . He united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings , practices , and the Quran , which Muslims believe was revealed to him by God , formed the basis of Islamic religious belief . 
 Born in the Arabian city of Mecca , in approximately 570 CE , Muhammad was orphaned at an early age ; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib . After his childhood , Muhammad primarily worked as a merchant . Occasionally , he would retreat to a cave named Hira in the mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer ; later , at age 40 , he reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave , where he stated he received his first revelation from God . Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly , proclaiming that " God is One " , that complete " surrender " ( lit. <unk> ) to him is the only way ( <unk> ) acceptable to God , and that he was a prophet and messenger of God , similar to the other prophets in Islam . 
 Muhammad gained few early followers , and met hostility from some Meccan tribes . To escape persecution , Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina ( then known as Yathrib ) in the year 622 . This event , the Hijra , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar , also known as the Hijri Calendar . In Medina , Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina . In December 629 , after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes , Muhammad gathered an army of 10 @,@ 000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca . The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed . He destroyed 360 pagan idols at the Kaaba . In 632 , a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage , Muhammad fell ill and died . Before his death , most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam . 
 The revelations ( each known as <unk> , lit . " Sign [ of God ] " ) , which Muhammad reported receiving until his death , form the verses of the Quran , regarded by Muslims as the " Word of God " and around which the religion is based . Besides the Quran , Muhammad 's teachings and practices ( sunnah ) , found in the Hadith and sira literature , are also upheld by Muslims and used as sources of Islamic law ( see Sharia ) . 
 = = Names and appellations in the Quran = = 
 The name Muhammad ( / <unk> , <unk> / ) means " praiseworthy " and appears four times in the Quran . The Quran addresses Muhammad in the second person by various appellations ; prophet , messenger , servant of God ( ' <unk> ) , announcer ( <unk> ) [ Quran 2 : 119 ] , witness ( <unk> ) , [ Quran 33 : 45 ] bearer of good tidings ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , [ Quran 11 : 2 ] reminder ( <unk> ) , [ Quran 88 : 21 ] one who calls [ unto God ] ( <unk> ‘ ī ) , [ Quran 12 : 108 ] light personified ( <unk> ) [ Quran 05 : 15 ] , and the <unk> lamp ( <unk> <unk> ) [ Quran 33 : 46 ] . Muhammad is sometimes addressed by designations deriving from his state at the time of the address : thus he is referred to as the enwrapped ( al @-@ <unk> ) in Quran 73 : 1 and the shrouded ( al @-@ <unk> ) in Quran 74 : 1 . In Sura Al @-@ Ahzab 33 : 40 God singles out Muhammad as the " Seal of the Prophets " , or the last of the prophets . The Quran also refers to Muhammad as Aḥmad " more praiseworthy " ( Arabic : أحمد , Sura As @-@ Saff 61 : 6 ) .
