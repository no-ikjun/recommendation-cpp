 Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissenting opinion for four Justices . The primary objection of the dissent was that the ruling of the majority was inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the Miranda rule : the need for a clear rule that is easily applied in all cases . Alito argued the decision shifted custody determination from a simple test to an inquiry that must account for individualized characteristics . Alito emphasized that age is not the only characteristic that may affect a subject under interrogation and that in future cases the court will be tasked with adding additional characteristics to custody determination or by " arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect 's age from other personal characteristics " . 
 = = Reception and subsequent developments = = 
 The case attracted differing opinions within the legal community . Steven <unk> , professor at Northwestern University School of Law , characterized the ruling as " huge " , noting that police would no longer be able to choose to question young suspects at a school in order to avoid giving a Miranda warning , a practice he characterized as a " loophole " . The Juvenile Law Center praised the ruling as " a resounding statement " in line with " settled research and basic common sense " . Steven Shapiro , legal director of the ACLU concurred , stating that " we have to ensure that students ' rights are protected ... and the decision is a step in that direction . " 
 Other analysts were troubled that the decision would leave " a murky landscape for law enforcement " . John Charles Thomas , representing the National District Attorneys Association , concluded " The pressure is basically to err on the side of caution , to give the Miranda warning almost every time . " Professor Stephen <unk> of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of " When in doubt , give Miranda warnings " , but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning . " The reality is that even with Miranda warnings , it 's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices , and so in the long run , I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion .

 = Helmut Lent = 
 Oberst Helmut Lent ( 13 June 1918 – 7 October 1944 ) was a German night @-@ fighter ace in World War II . Lent shot down 110 aircraft , 102 of them at night , far more than the minimum of five enemy aircraft required for the title of " ace " . Born into a devoutly religious family , he showed an early passion for glider flying ; against his father 's wishes , he joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 . After completing his training , he was assigned to the 1 . Squadron , or Staffel , of Zerstörergeschwader 76 ( ZG 76 ) , a wing flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin @-@ engine heavy fighter . Lent claimed his first aerial victories at the outset of World War II in the invasion of Poland and over the North Sea . During the invasion of Norway he flew ground support missions before he was transferred to the newly established Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 ( NJG 1 ) , a night @-@ fighter wing . 
 Lent claimed his first nocturnal victory on 12 May 1941 and on 30 August 1941 was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for 22 victories . His steady accumulation of aerial victories resulted in regular promotions and awards . On the night of 15 June 1944 , Major Lent was the first night fighter pilot to claim 100 nocturnal aerial victories , a feat which earned him the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds on 31 July 1944 . 
 On 5 October 1944 , Lent flew a Junkers Ju 88 on a routine transit flight from Stade to <unk> , 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) south of Paderborn . On the landing approach one of the engines cut out and the aircraft collided with power lines . All four members of the crew were mortally injured . Three men died shortly after the crash and Lent succumbed to his injuries two days later on 7 October 1944 . 
 = = Childhood , education and early career = = 
 Helmut Lent was born on 13 June 1918 in <unk> , district of Landsberg an der <unk> , Province of Brandenburg , Germany ( now <unk> , Lubusz Province , western Poland ) and christened Helmut Johannes Siegfried Lent . He was the fifth child of Johannes Lent , a Lutheran minister and Marie Elisabeth , née <unk> . Helmut Lent had two older brothers , Werner and Joachim , and two older sisters , Käthe and Ursula . His family was deeply religious ; in addition to his father , both of his brothers and both grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers . 
 From Easter 1924 until Easter 1928 , Lent attended the local public primary school at <unk> . His father and oldest brother Werner then tutored him at home in preparation for the entrance examination at the public secondary school at Landsberg . In February 1933 , Helmut joined the Jungvolk , the junior branch of the Hitler Youth . From March 1933 , he acted as a youth platoon leader , or <unk> ( 1 March 1933 – 1 April 1935 ) and flag @-@ bearer , or <unk> ( 1 April 1935 – 9 November 1935 ) until he left the Jungvolk to prepare for his diploma examination . Helmut passed his graduation examinations at the age of seventeen on 12 December 1935 . On 2 February 1936 , he began the eight @-@ week compulsory National Labor Service ( Reichsarbeitsdienst ) at <unk> . He joined the military service in the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker on 1 April 1936 , against the wishes of his father . 
 His military training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School ( Luftkriegsschule 2 ) at Gatow , on the south @-@ western outskirts of Berlin . He swore the National Socialist oath of allegiance on 21 April 1936 . Flight training began on Monday , 7 August 1936 at Gatow . His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 <unk> D @-@ <unk> single engine biplane . Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz . By this time , Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook . In conjunction with flight training , the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises , Lent was involved in a road accident , breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months . This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937 , after taking his commission examination , he was promoted to Fähnrich . On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A / B License . He earned his wings on 15 November 1937 . On 1 February 1938 , he was promoted to Oberfähnrich ( first ensign ) , and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant . By this time , he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time , mostly in daylight flights , in single engine training aircraft . 
 After leaving Gatow , Helmut Lent was posted to the Heavy Bomber Crew School , or Große <unk> at Tutow , in northeast Germany . He spent three months training as an observer ( 1 March 1938 – 30 May 1938 ) . Prior to completing this course , Lent was run over by a car , resulting in a broken lower jaw , concussion , and internal bleeding . On 1 July 1938 , Lent was posted to the 3rd Group of Jagdgeschwader 132 " Richthofen " ( III . / JG 132 ) , flying on 19 July 1938 for the first time after his injuries . 
 At the beginning of September , Lent 's squadron , 7 . / JG 132 , relocated to <unk> near Dresden , in preparation and support of the annexation of Czechoslovakia . Lent flew a number of operational patrols in this conflict until his Staffel relocated again to <unk> on 29 September 1938 . After the tension over the occupation of the Sudeten territories eased , Lent 's unit began a conversion to the Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun . On 1 November 1938 III . / JG 132 moved to <unk> , between Berlin and Frankfurt an der Oder , and was renamed II . / JG 141 , and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron . 
 II . / JG 141 changed its designation to I. / Zerstörergeschwader 76 ( I. / ZG 76 ) on 1 May 1939 at the same time relocating to an airfield at Olmütz , Czechoslovakia . The group was being re @-@ equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 , and Lent made his first flight in the Bf 110 on 7 June 1939 . Lent was granted his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot 's Certificate ( Erweiterter Luftwaffen @-@ Flugzeugführerschein ) , also known as ' C ' -Certificate , confirming proficiency on multi @-@ engine aircraft , on 12 May 1939 . While converting to the Bf 110 , Lent did not have a regular wireless operator ( <unk> ) in the rear gunner 's seat , but on 14 August 1939 he was accompanied in M8 + AH for the first time by Gefreiter Walter Kubisch . During the prelude of World War II on 25 August 1939 I. / ZG 76 deployed to an airfield at <unk> to the southeast of Breslau . 
 = = World War II = = 
 World War II began at 04 : 45 on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces crossed the Polish border . Helmut Lent , flying a Bf 110 marked M8 @-@ DH , took off from <unk> , at 04 : 44 to escort Heinkel He 111 bombers on a mission over Krakow . 
 = = = Invasion of Poland = = = 
 The German plans for the invasion of Poland were conceived under the codename Fall Weiss ( Case White ) . This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions , the north , the west and the south , beginning at 04 : 45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939 . On this morning Helmut Lent , with Kubisch as his wireless operator and rear gunner , escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III . / Kampfgeschwader 4 ( KG 4 ) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack . At 16 : 30 on 2 September 1939 , the second day of the German attack , Lent took off in the direction of Łódź and claimed his first aerial @-@ victory of the war , shooting down a PZL <unk> 
 At this point of the campaign the Bf 110s switched from bomber escort to ground @-@ attack since the Polish Air Force was all but defeated . In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin @-@ engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft , a PZL <unk> , on 9 September . On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine . Lent made a forced landing behind German lines . He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign , destroying one anti @-@ aircraft battery . For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded one of the first Iron Cross 2nd class of World War II on 21 September 1939 . I. / ZG 76 relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British , who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939 . From early October to middle December I. / ZG 76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939 . 
 = = = Battle of the Heligoland Bight = = = 
 During the first month of the war the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti @-@ shipping operations on the German Bight . RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became to be known as the Battle of the Heligoland Bight . Twenty @-@ four twin @-@ engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron , No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland . Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects , but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands . 
 Helmut Lent was ordered to intercept and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling — Lent had just landed at Jever from an armed patrol — claimed three Wellingtons , two of which , shot down at 14 : 30 and 14 : 45 , were later confirmed . The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron , captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer <unk> Lewis respectively , and both crashed in the shallow sea off Borkum . It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A <unk> , LF @-@ J , piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse , which crash @-@ landed on the sand dunes of Borkum . Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley , as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after it had already been badly damaged and was about to crash . The Wellington was credited to pilot Carl @-@ August Schumacher . 
 His success as a fighter pilot over the North Sea had made him a minor national hero . Exploits such as those at Heligoland made good news stories for German propaganda machine . Consequently , he attracted fan mail — mainly from young girls and women — among them Elisabeth Petersen . Lent replied to her letter , and he and Elisabeth met on a blind date at the <unk> hotel in Hamburg , after which they enjoyed a skiing holiday in <unk> in February 1940 . 
 = = = Norwegian Campaign and Battle of Britain = = = 
 On 8 April 1940 eight aircraft of 1 . / ZG 76 , under the command of Staffelkapitän Werner Hansen , deployed northward from Jever to Westerland on Sylt in preparation for operation Weserübung , the invasion of Norway . The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital , Oslo , and six major ports from Kristiansand in the south to Narvik in the north . Simultaneously , Junkers 52 ( Ju 52 ) transport aircraft would drop parachute troops to secure Oslo 's Fornebu airport . Additional Ju 52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop , by which time the airfield had to be in German hands . 1 . / ZG 76 was to provide air cover and ground @-@ attack support for both waves . Eight Bf 110 Zerstörer of 1 . / JG 76 took off at 7 : 00 in the morning , planning to synchronize their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8 : 45 . The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one @-@ way operation ; the Bf 110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip . Their fuel was calculated to provide them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu , and the pilots would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized . 
 On the early morning flight to Fornebu , Lent engaged and shot down a Norwegian Gloster Gladiator . While the Ju 52s transporting the German paratroops came under heavy fire , Lent 's Rotte engaged the enemy ground positions . Lent 's starboard engine caught fire , forcing him to land immediately . With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun , Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands . 
 At 18 : 50 the same day , Lent and his Staffelkapitän Werner Hansen took off again from Fornebu in undamaged Bf 110s . During the 40 @-@ minute flight , they came across a RAF Short Sunderland flying boat , serial number <unk> , from No. 210 Squadron RAF which they shot down together ; Hansen received credit for the " kill " . Helmut Lent was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class on 13 May 1940 before he was transferred to Trondheim on 18 May . He claimed his second aerial victory of the Norwegian campaign on 27 May over a RAF Gloster Gladiator from No. 263 Squadron RAF , piloted by Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull . On 2 June 1940 Lent and his wingman <unk> claimed a Gladiator each . The flight lasted 5 hours and 46 minutes and their opponents were again from No. 263 Squadron , aircraft serial number <unk> piloted by Pilot Officer J.L. Wilkie , and <unk> piloted by Pilot Officer L.R. Jacobsen . He claimed his seventh victory overall and final of the Norwegian theatre of operations on 15 June 1940 over a No. 254 Squadron RAF Bristol Blenheim , piloted by Pilot Officer P.C. Gaylord . On 1 July 1940 Lent was promoted to Oberleutnant and on 13 July 1 . / ZG 76 was relocated to Stavanger / Forus . 
 Helmut Lent briefly participated in the Battle of Britain when on 15 August 1940 twenty @-@ one Bf 110s from I. / ZG 76 escorted He 111 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 26 ( KG 26 ) on their attack on Yorkshire and the Newcastle / Sunderland area . I. / ZG 76 lost seven aircraft on this mission and it was Helmut Lent 's 98th and final mission as a Zerstörer pilot . 
 = = = Night fighter career = = = 
 By June 1940 RAF Bomber Command penetrations of German airspace had increased to the level that Hermann Göring decreed that a night @-@ fighter force should be formed . The officer tasked with its creation was Wolfgang Falck , Gruppenkommandeur of the I. / Zerstörergeschwader 1 ( ZG 1 ) . The night @-@ fighter force began to expand rapidly , with existing units being divided to form the nucleus of new units . By October 1940 Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 ( NJG 1 ) comprised three Gruppen , while Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 ( NJG 2 ) and Nachtjagdgeschwader 3 ( NJG 3 ) , were still forming . It was during this period that Helmut Lent reluctantly became a member of the night @-@ fighter force . At the end of August Lent wrote home , " We are currently converting to night fighting . We are not very enthusiastic . We would sooner head directly for England . " 
 Lent completed night fighter training at Ingolstadt in south @-@ western Germany , and was appointed squadron leader , or Staffelkapitän , of the newly formed 6 . / NJG 1 on 1 October 1940 . The squadron was based at Fliegerhorst Deelen , located 12 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 8 mi ) north of Arnhem in the Netherlands . On the night 11 – 12 May 1941 , Lent claimed his first nocturnal aerial victories against two Wellington IC bombers from No. 40 Squadron RAF on a mission against Hamburg . BL @-@ H ( serial number <unk> ) was shot down at 01 : 40 near <unk> and BL @-@ Z ( <unk> ) at 02 : 49 near Nordstrand . 
 On 1 July 1941 , he took command of 4 . / NJG 1 , stationed in the Netherlands at Fliegerhorst ( airfield ) Leeuwarden , 161 kilometres ( 100 mi ) north of Arnheim , on the Friesland coast , where he remained until his death . From this position in the so @-@ called German Bight , the squadron patrolled the North Sea coast , and could intercept Allied night @-@ time bombing missions , what the Luftwaffe called terror attacks , based out of England . By the end of the war , the 4 . / NJG 1 was one of the most successful <unk> — a squadron of a night fighter wing — of the Luftwaffe . Other members included such night fighter pilots as Oberleutnant Helmut <unk> , Leutnant Ludwig Becker ( 44 victories , KIA February 1943 ) , Leutnant Egmont Prinz zur Lippe @-@ Weißenfeld ( 51 victories , killed in a flying accident in the Netherlands in March 1944 ) , Leutnant Leopold <unk> ( 41 victories ) , Oberfeldwebel Paul <unk> ( 46 victories , killed in a flying accident at Fliegerhorst Gilze @-@ Rijen in the Netherlands in February 1943 ) , and Unteroffizier Siegfried Ney ( 12 victories , KIA February 1943 ) . On 30 August 1941 , Lent received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for seven daytime and 14 night victories . 
 On 1 November 1941 , Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of the newly formed II . / NJG 2 . Lent 's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur , his 20th night @-@ time , and his last in 1941 , came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November . He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin , which came down near <unk> . The six @-@ man crew of the bomber , <unk> of No. 75 ( New Zealand ) Squadron , was killed in action . This achievement earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht ( his first of six in total ) , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht . To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations ' section of one 's Service Record Book . 
 He was promoted to Hauptmann on 1 January 1942 . Later that year , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 6 June 1942 , at which time his total stood at 34 nocturnal victories plus seven day @-@ time victories . The award was presented at the Führerhauptquartier on 28 and 29 June , his tally standing then at 39 nocturnal and seven day @-@ time victories . Lent also held the distinction of achieving the first Lichtenstein radar @-@ assisted air victory in a Dornier Do <unk> @-@ 5 night fighter . 
 By the end of 1942 , Lent had 56 victories and was the top German night @-@ fighter ace . He was promoted to Major on 1 January 1943 and appointed Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 3 ( NJG 3 ) on 1 August 1943 . After 73 kills , of which 65 were claimed at night , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 2 August 1943 and notified by telegram on 4 August . The Swords were presented to him at the Führerhauptquartier at Rastenburg on 10 / 11 August 1943 . 
 In January 1944 , Lent downed three so @-@ called " heavies " — four @-@ engined strategic bombers — in one night , but his aircraft was damaged by return fire , requiring a forced landing . He used only 22 cannon shells to down two bombers on the night of the 22 – 23 March 1944 , and fired only 57 rounds in seven minutes against three Avro Lancasters on 15 – 16 June . Promoted to Oberstleutnant , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds in recognition of his 110 confirmed air kills , the first of two night @-@ fighter pilots to be awarded the decoration . The second was Heinz @-@ Wolfgang Schnaufer , who , with 121 aerial victories , became aviation history 's leading night @-@ fighter pilot . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 All German officers were required to obtain official permission to marry ; however , this was usually a bureaucratic formality . When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen , his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date , his case was more complicated . ' Elisabeth Petersen ' was in fact Helene ( Lena ) <unk> , born in Moscow in April 1914 . She had been afraid to reveal her true identity , since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich , but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry , she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941 . They were married on 10 September 1941 in <unk> , Hamburg . The marriage produced two daughters . Christina was born on 6 June 1942 ; the second , <unk> , was born on 6 October 1944 , shortly after her father 's fatal crash . 
 Both of Helmut 's older brothers , Joachim and Werner , as members of the Confessing Church ( German : <unk> Kirche ) , encountered trouble with the Nazi party . The Confessing Church , led by Pastor Martin Niemöller , was a schismatic Protestant church which opposed the Reich 's efforts to " <unk> " Germany 's Protestant churches . It stood in outspoken opposition to National Socialist principles , particularly those embodied in the Aryan Paragraph . Through the Barmen Declaration , the church condemned the national German Evangelical Church as heretical . Werner Lent , an adherent to the Confessing church , was arrested for the first time in 1937 after preaching an anti @-@ Nazi sermon . In June 1942 , his brother Joachim was arrested by the Gestapo after reading the so @-@ called Mölders letter from the pulpit . The Mölders letter was a propaganda piece conceived by Sefton Delmer , the chief of the British black propaganda in the Political Warfare Executive ( PWE ) to capitalize on the death of Germany 's fighter ace Werner Mölders ; this letter , ostensibly written by Mölders , attested to the supreme importance of his Catholic faith in his life — by implication , placing faith above his allegiance to the National Socialist Party . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 5 October 1944 , Lent flew his Junkers Ju @-@ 88 G – 6 , coded D5 + AA , from Stade to Paderborn . His crew included his long @-@ time radio operator Oberfeldwebel Walter Kubisch , the member of a <unk> ( propaganda company ) Leutnant Werner Kark in the aerial gunner position , and Oberleutnant Hermann <unk> , second radio operator . Lent was on his way to visit the Geschwaderkommodore of the Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 , Oberstleutnant Hans @-@ Joachim Jabs , to discuss operational matters . During the landing approach , the left engine of the plane failed , causing the wing to dip . Lent was unable to keep the plane steady and it struck high @-@ voltage cables and crashed . All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive . Kubisch and <unk> succumbed to their injuries on the same day , Kark on the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944 . 
 Helmut Lent 's state funeral was held in the Reich Chancellery , Berlin , on Wednesday 11 October 1944 . Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring took the salute at Lent 's coffin , which was draped in the national flag of the Third Reich . Ahead of the coffin , carrying Lent 's honours and decorations on a velvet cushion , marched Oberstleutnant Werner Streib , the Inspector of Night Fighters . Six steel @-@ helmeted officers , all recipients of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross , escorted the coffin on its caisson and stood as guard of honour during the ceremony : Oberstleutnant Günther <unk> , Oberstleutnant Hans @-@ Joachim Jabs , Major Rudolf Schoenert , Hauptmann Heinz <unk> , Hauptmann Karl <unk> and Hauptmann Paul <unk> . On 12 October 1944 Lent and his crew were interred in a single grave in the military cemetery at Stade .

 On 18 July 1964 , a German Armed Forces ( Bundeswehr ) Army Aviation Corps ( <unk> ) installation in Rotenburg ( <unk> ) ( Lower Saxony ) was renamed the Lent Barracks , or Lent @-@ Kaserne , in his honour . In 2014 , the German Armed Forces have decided to rename the Lent Barracks . Although Lent was not a war criminal , he was a Nazi and is therefore no longer considered an appropriate namesake within the German Armed Forces . The process , which is expected to finalize in end 2015 , involves 1 @,@ 500 soldiers and 250 civil employees of the site and was initiated by the commander Oberstleutnant Edmund Vogel in early 2015 . 
 A number of Helmut Lent 's awards were auctioned at Sotheby 's , London , on 18 July 1966 . The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder for the total sum of £ 500 . The purchaser was Adolf Galland , the former General der Jagdflieger , acting on behalf of the Federal German Ministry of Defence . The awards were sold by Helmut Lent 's elder daughter Christina after consultation with her mother , Lena , who was in urgent need for money to pay for an operation . The Federal Ministry of Defence presented the collection to the Museum of Defence History ( <unk> Museum ) in Rastatt , Germany .

 Helmut Lent is officially credited with 110 victories in 507 flights . The total includes 103 victories at night , during which he destroyed 59 four @-@ engine bombers and one Mosquito , among other types . Lent received a posthumous promotion to Oberst ( Colonel ) .

 = Let Me In ( film ) = 
 Let Me In is a 2010 American horror romance film written and directed by Matt Reeves and starring Kodi Smit @-@ McPhee , Chloë Grace Moretz , Elias Koteas , and Richard Jenkins . It is a remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In ( 2008 ) . It tells the story of a bullied 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy who develops a friendship with a female vampire child in Los Alamos , New Mexico in the early 1980s . 
 Interest in producing an English version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly before it was released to audiences . In 2008 , Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson , the director of the Swedish film , the opportunity to direct , which he declined . Matt Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay . Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters . The film 's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original , yet make it more accessible to a wider audience . Principal photography began in early November 2009 , and concluded in January 2010 . The film 's budget was estimated to be $ 20 million . 
 Let Me In premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 13 , 2010 , and was released in North America on October 1 , 2010 . The film was placed on several critics ' top @-@ ten list . Many critics noted it as a rare Hollywood remake which stayed true to the original , while others criticized it for being too derivative of the Swedish film . The film earned $ 24 million in box office revenue worldwide , of which $ 12 million was earned in the United States and Canada . Chloë Grace Moretz won several awards for her performance with critics praising the on @-@ screen chemistry with her co @-@ star , Kodi Smit @-@ McPhee . Let Me In was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray in North America on February 1 , 2011 , and in the UK on March 14 , 2011 . An official comic book miniseries prequel titled Let Me In : Crossroads was released after the film which establishes the back @-@ story of Abby and ends where the theatrical film begins . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In March 1983 , in Los Alamos , New Mexico , a disfigured man is taken to the hospital . An unnamed police detective ( Elias Koteas ) tries to question him about a recent murder . The detective is called to a phone and told that the man 's daughter was just downstairs . While he is on the phone , the man jumps out of the window leaving behind a scrawled note that reads " I 'm sorry Abby . " 
 Two weeks earlier , Owen ( Kodi Smit @-@ McPhee ) , an unhappy and lonely 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy who is neglected by his divorcing parents , sees a young girl named Abby ( Chloë Grace Moretz ) and an older man , Thomas ( Richard Jenkins ) , moving in next door and notices that she is barefoot despite the snow . Owen meets Abby one night and asks if she is cold upon seeing no footwear on her feet . Abby states that she doesn 't get cold . Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments . At school , a bully named Kenny ( Dylan Minnette ) and two of his friends Donald ( Nicolai Dorian ) and Mark ( Jimmy " Jax " <unk> ) constantly terrorize Owen , who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth . Abby encourages him to retaliate . 
 Thomas murders a man and collects the blood , but accidentally spills it . Hungry , Abby attacks a concerned neighbor named Jack ( Chris Browning ) to drink his blood , revealing that she is a vampire . On another night , Thomas hides in the back of a teenager 's car , murders the passenger , and tries to flee , but crashes the car and becomes trapped inside . He pours concentrated sulfuric acid on his face , disfiguring himself to prevent his identification . He is taken to the hospital , bringing the story back to the first scene . 
 Abby learns what happened and climbs up the hospital building to see Thomas after speaking to the front desk worker who noticed that Abby is barefoot upon departure and couldn 't find her afterwards . She knocks on the window and he points to his throat , unable to speak , and leans out of the window ; Abby drinks his blood . Thomas passes out and falls to his death . That night , Owen is awakened by Abby who insists he verbally invite her in . She spends the night in his bed upon discarding her clothes and agrees to be his girlfriend . The next day , Owen 's class goes ice @-@ skating on the river . Kenny and his friends threaten to throw Owen into a hole in the ice . Emboldened by his relationship with Abby , Owen hits Kenny with a metal pole , splitting his left ear and causing him to scream in pain . At the same moment , several kids spot a body encased in the ice and begin screaming . It is the body of Jack who Thomas threw into the ( then unfrozen ) river . Along with the body is Thomas 's bag . 
 Later , Owen sees Abby and hoping to make a blood pact with her , cuts his finger . Unable to control herself , Abby laps up a drop of Owen 's blood revealing her vampire form . Not wanting to hurt Owen , the barefoot vampire flees and instead attacks a woman named Virginia ( Sasha <unk> ) upon jumping out of a tree . Virginia 's boyfriend Larry ( Dylan <unk> ) witnesses the attack and calls an ambulance upon chasing her off . The next night , Abby admits to Owen that she is a vampire and that Thomas was not her father . Owen discovers an aged photo of her with Thomas as a young boy . As Thomas continued to age , he posed as Abby 's father while she did not physically age past twelve . 
 In the hospital the next morning , a nurse goes into Virginia 's unit to open the curtains and finds Virginia feasting on her own bloody wrists . She has been turned into a vampire by Abby . As sunlight enters the room , Virginia bursts into flames that quickly spread throughout the unit , killing them both and setting the entire floor on fire . 
 Owen sneaks out to spend the night at Abby 's . The next morning , the detective forces his way into Abby 's apartment and finds her asleep . He begins to uncover a window but is distracted by Owen . Abby wakes and attacks the detective to feed on his blood . The dying detective appeals to Owen for help , but Owen does not intervene . Abby tells Owen she will have to leave town . They share a kiss and he watches tearfully as she enters a taxi and leaves . 
 During Owen 's swim class , Kenny , his sadistic older brother Jimmy ( Brett <unk> ) , and their friends , are seeking revenge for the injury Owen had inflicted to Kenny 's ear . They ambush Owen and throw him into the pool . Jimmy says that if Owen can hold his breath underwater for three minutes , he will only be cut on the cheek , otherwise Jimmy will poke out one of Owen 's eyes . Owen is forced underwater by Jimmy . After one minute , Kenny and his friends realize this is excessive and try telling Jimmy to stop , but he angrily refuses . But then an unseen assailant breaks through the skylight , attacking the bullies , and Owen sees torn @-@ off limbs sinking into the pool all around him . Owen emerges from pool to catch his breath and then sees a pair of familiar bare feet come near him . He then looks up , faintly smiling to see an off @-@ screen Abby . 
 Owen leaves town in broad daylight on a train , traveling with a large trunk . From inside , a message in Morse code is tapped out . Owen taps out a response and then looks out the window , quietly singing to himself " Eat some now , save some for later , " the jingle of Now and Later candy , which Abby and Owen had shared in an earlier scene .

 According to Hammer Films executive producer Nigel Sinclair , interest in the project initially began in the middle of 2007 , before the original Let the Right One In had screened for audiences . The rights for the English @-@ language film were later acquired by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival , where Let the Right One In won the " Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature , " and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director . John Nordling and Carl <unk> , the Swedish producers of the original film , were both involved as producers for the adaptation . Tomas Alfredson , the director of the Swedish film , was initially asked to direct the remake , but he turned it down stating that " I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell . " Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with " If you call it a faithful remake , I think that 's true to say that 's what it is . It 's not a reimagining ; the same beats [ are there ] , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary . " He later said , " I call it his [ Reeves ' ] version . I don 't call it his remake or his re @-@ imagining of it . " The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson . He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film . " If one should remake a film , it 's because the original is bad . And I don 't think mine is , " he said . Producer Donna <unk> said , " We 're incredibly admiring of the original , but to be honest with you , that picture grossed $ 2 million . It 's not like we 're remaking Lawrence of Arabia . " Producer Simon Oakes made it clear that the plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film , except that it will be made " very accessible to a wider audience . " 
 Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist , on the other hand , says that Reeves told him that he " will make a new film based on the book , and not remake the Swedish film " and so " it 'll be something completely different , but it 's going to be really interesting to see . " Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book 's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson 's adaptation . " It 's a terrific movie and a fantastic book . I think it could be a really touching , haunting and terrifying film . I 'm really excited about what it could be " , he said . In response to the criticism he said , " I can understand because of people 's love of the [ original ] film that there 's this cynicism that I 'll come in and trash it , when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film . I 'm so drawn to it for personal and not mercenary reasons ... I hope people give us a chance . " When Reeves was initially approached , he at first was against the idea but after reading the novel gained a better appreciation for the story , 
 I said ... that we shouldn 't remake it . I read the book too and was completely taken with it and I was really intrigued how personal the story felt . I thought John Lindqvist had written this terrific story , and he also adapted it for the film ... I wrote Lindqvist and told him that it wasn 't just that I was drawn to the story because it was a brilliant genre story — which it is — but also because of the personal aspect of it . It really reminds me of my childhood . 
 = = = Adapting and writing = = = 
 In adapting the film , a few adjustments were made , such as changing the names of the protagonists to Owen and Abby , and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to " a small New Mexico town . " Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters , but he refused , saying that " would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely ... we need that childlike innocence . " He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so " we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story . " The filmmakers have noted that " they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In , placing it firmly in an American context " , while at the same time paying respect to the original . In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one , Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren 't in the original film , stating that " the story was so big that you couldn 't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book . " Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film , stating " There are things that [ Lindqvist ] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation . But there are some things that hopefully don 't detract and fit into the context of the story . It 's a mixture of details from the book , the original film and things that grew out of adapting it . " In adapting the story for American audiences , Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil . He used Ronald Reagan 's " evil empire speech " as an example of American thought during that period . Reeves stated , " The idea of Reagan 's ' evil empire ' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us . Evil was ' Other , ' it was over there , it was the Soviets " . Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen , as he " would be grappling with these very , very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [ Reagan era ] mindset and religiousness . How would you fit in ? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day ? The humanity of that . "

 In July 2009 , audition tapes were leaked to the Internet , showing Chloë Grace Moretz , Mary Mouser , and Ariel Winter auditioning for the role of the vampire , Abby . Smit @-@ McPhee , in an interview with The Herald Sun , hinted that he may have landed the role as Owen . The casting of Moretz and Smit @-@ McPhee in the leading roles was confirmed on October 1 , 2009 , along with the addition of Richard Jenkins as Abby 's adult companion . In a press release , director Matt Reeves described Smit @-@ McPhee , Moretz and Jenkins as his " absolute dream cast " , and added that he " couldn 't be more excited to be working with them . " Both Smit @-@ McPhee and Moretz were cast before the release of The Road or Kick @-@ Ass , and the films ' directors John Hillcoat and Matthew Vaughn respectively each praised the young actors and recommended them to Reeves . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began in Albuquerque , New Mexico on November 2 , 2009 . Filming took place in several different New Mexico locations , before concluding in Albuquerque in January 2010 . A large section of the film was filmed at Los Alamos High School in Los Alamos , New Mexico . Los Alamos County granted a special request from the film 's director and producer to name the town in the movie " Los Alamos , New Mexico . " The local police department loaned the film crew 1980s style uniforms and patrol cars to use for the film and over 100 local teenagers were cast as extras . Reeves felt that Lindqvist 's story was very naturalistic and wanted the film to be shot the same way . After viewing Bright Star , he hired Greig Fraser as his cinematographer because he admired Fraser 's work with natural light on the film . Shortly before filming , Reeves sought advice from Steven Spielberg for directing child actors . Spielberg instructed Reeves to have the two leads each keep a diary in character with the intention of sharing with Reeves what they wrote in it . Reeves stated , " It was all a process of trying to , not only guide them , but in places , trying to let them guide me toward their perspective . That was important . " 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 Method Studios was contracted to handle the film 's visual effects work . The studio 's supervisor Sean Faden , worked alongside the film 's visual effects supervisor , Brad Parker throughout the production . Several of the film 's scenes proved to be a challenge for the team . Director Reeves wanted the " car @-@ crash " sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first @-@ person . Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving , the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a " rotisserie " in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car 's roll down the hill . Jenkin 's stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled . The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot . Houdini software was used for much of the film 's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form . Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby 's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen 's apartment without invitation . Faden stated , " Normally in such a scene , the character would be shot on set , dressed in blood . But in this case , the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn ’ t have allowed us enough control . " Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference . Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film , A Nightmare on Elm Street , Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz 's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face .

 Let Me In : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film 's soundtrack album . It was released by Varèse Sarabande on October 12 , 2010 . The music was composed by Michael Giacchino . Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult " balancing act " for some scenes . He mentioned , " I was always trying to say , ' let 's take music out ! ' and Matt [ Reeves ] was like , ' no , put it in ! ' " In composing the score , he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed . Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said , " ... it was tricky finding the right balance of , well , should this be scary ? Or should this be sentimental ? Or should it be emotional ? Or should it be this ? It was a weird balance because you 're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as far as what everyone 's intentions are in the film .

 Let Me In received critical acclaim upon release .

The consensus is that " similar to the original in all the right ways — but with enough changes to stand on its own — Let Me In is the rare Hollywood remake that doesn 't add insult to inspiration . " Let Me In was included on Rotten Tomatoes list of the ten best reviewed wide release films of 2010 in addition to being the best reviewed horror film of 2010 . Metacritic gave the film an average score of 79 % based on 35 reviews , judged to be " generally favorable reviews " .

 Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote " Let Me In is a genre @-@ busting triumph . Not just a horror film , but the best American horror film in the last 20 years . " Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film " is more than a respectful remake ; ' Let Me In ' is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right . " 
 Lou Lumenick of The New York Post called Let Me In " the scariest , creepiest and most elegantly filmed horror movie I ’ ve seen in years — it positively drives a stake through the competition . " A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote " what makes ' Let Me In ' so eerily fascinating is the mood it creates . It is at once artful and unpretentious , more interested in intimacy and implication than in easy scares or slick effects . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times praised the film while comparing it to the original . He stated , " Reeves understands what made the first film so eerie and effective , and here the same things work again . " Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers , who was initially skeptical , gave the film a positive review while writing , " I thought for sure that any Hollywood remake of Tomas Alfredson 's artful Swedish vampire film , Let the Right One In , would be a crass desecration . Well , color me blushing " and " Prepare to be wowed . It 's a <unk> . " Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , stating , " Reeves has Americanized a very good foreign film without <unk> it . " 
 Let Me In was not well received by all critics . Some disputed Reeves ' claims that he was not remaking the film but re @-@ adapting the book , criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film . Josh Tyler wrote " The movie he ’ s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film , the two are so similar that it ’ s almost impossible to differentiate between them . " In a similar vein , Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted , " Reeves hasn 't really <unk> out anything new ; on the contrary , there is actually less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version . " Beth <unk> wrote , " How Reeves can take the credit ' written and directed by Matt Reeves ' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original . " In comparing the two films , she opined that the remake " makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity . " Mark Kermode called it " the most utterly redundant remake of the year " . 
 According to Sukhdev Sandhu of The Telegraph , " Let Me In doesn 't need to exist unless , that is , the very notion of Swedish cinema is strange and unpalatable to you .... What ’ s missing is the alluring otherness of Let the Right One In . That film 's brittle textures and haunted ambiance seemed in some strange way to have sprung organically from the nation in which it was set . This remake , by contrast , smells of boardrooms and calculating machines . "

Let Me In is a great American movie . There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present . But Let Me In puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs . Like the Swedish movie it made me cry , but not at the same points . Let Me In is a dark and violent love story , a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful . Again .

 The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Jim Reardon . It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training a new group of animators , and this episode was one of their first efforts . Show runner Mike Reiss said he will always remember it as the episode " that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess . " Reardon said there was " literally a mistake in every other scene " when the episode came back from Korea . Several scenes had to be re @-@ animated in the United States because of these glitches , but according to Reardon , " you can still see the lesser ones that got through , such as line quality problems particularly in the first act . " Though it aired in season three , " When Flanders Failed " was produced during the previous season . It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end , and was scheduled to air in autumn that year . The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer . 
 " When Flanders Failed " features the second appearance of the character Akira , voiced by Hank Azaria . He was previously seen in the season two episode " One Fish , Two Fish , Blowfish , Blue Fish " , where he is a waiter at a Japanese restaurant . It is revealed in this episode that the characters Ned Flanders , Moe Szyslak and Montgomery Burns are left @-@ handed , just like The Simpsons creator Matt Groening . The Simpsons writer George Meyer came up with the idea of The Leftorium when the writers were trying to figure out what Ned 's failed business would be . The inspiration came from a friend of Meyer 's who opened a left @-@ handed store that was quickly forced to close down due to lack of business . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title of the episode is a reference to the title of the poem " In Flanders Fields " . Homer watches the Canadian Football League Draft on television . The Simpsons writers Jay Kogen , Wallace Wolodarsky , and John Swartzwelder appear on the draft list . Akira 's school is located in the mall next to Shakespeare 's Fried Chicken , a reference to the English poet and playwright William Shakespeare . Akira gives Bart 's karate class the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War by Sun Tzu . The episode 's ending in which Homer gathers the citizens to The Leftorium is a reference to the film It 's a Wonderful Life , including Homer 's toast and the way Ned and his wife Maude are dressed . Richard Sakai is seen in one of the crowd shots at The Leftorium at the end of the episode . The word schadenfreude became increasingly known in popular culture after it appeared in this episode . Lisa asks Homer if he has ever heard of schadenfreude after he expresses delight that Ned 's business is failing . Defining it for him , she says , " It 's a German term for ' shameful joy ' , taking pleasure in the suffering of others . "

 In its original American broadcast , " When Flanders Failed " finished 29th in the ratings for the week of September 30 – October 6 , 1991 , with a Nielsen rating of 13 @.@ 9 , equivalent to approximately 12 @.@ 8 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 In December 2002 , " When Flanders Failed " was utilized in a Roanoke Presbyterian Church Sunday School class , to stimulate a discussion among both children and adults , about why unfortunate things happen to good people . Phil Brown , the teacher of the class , said the reason they used episodes of The Simpsons was " to get something that would get the kids excited and be more than just a traditional Sunday School lecture series . " 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . Kirk Baird of the Las Vegas Sun named it the fifth best episode of The Simpsons , and Central Michigan Life called it an " instant classic " . 
 Pete Oliva of North Texas Daily said the episode " proves that it is possible to laugh and cry at the same time without being able to control either response . " Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said " When Flanders Failed " shows that even if The Simpsons is not dealing with famous celebrities or " high profile places " , the writers can still " wring uproarious comedy out of their cast of regulars . Flanders is a special creation in the canon of humor , a regular guy who is funny because of how hyper @-@ normal he is compared to his Neanderthal neighbors . The focus on people who are left @-@ handed , and the whole idea of being a lefty , is an unusual basis for a television show . But then again , nothing about The Simpsons is ever common . " Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town also praised the writers , stating that they " are able to craft a downtrodden tale for the perpetually clueless Flanders family that serves to illustrate how dark emotions can eventually be overcome by Homer 's guilt . A memorable episode . " Niel Harvey of The Roanoke Times called " When Flanders Failed " a " classic bit of Simpsonia . " The episode 's reference to It 's a Wonderful Life was named the 26th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . 
 Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 3 @.@ 5 / 5 rating and commented that " perhaps it is not profound in its examination of jealousy causing people to behave irrationally , but it handles the topic in a serious manner while not compromising the show 's humor . The side story with Bart stems from the era of the series when Bart was the big star , but it still has some funny bits . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote : " Mean Homer equals Funny Homer , so ' When Flanders Failed ' presents an above average show . He seems unusually crude here , which makes him amusing . The subplot with Bart and his karate class also adds good material , especially when he threatens to turn the ' Touch of Death ' on Lisa . Another sappy finish slightly mars this one , but it remains generally solid . " Kimberly Potts of AOL named it tenth best episode of the show and commented : " <unk> is the theme of this tight episode about Homer 's joy at the failure of Flanders ' Leftorium store . There are few times Homer is more shamelessly smug than he was while imitating Flanders and using Ned 's yard sale grill , and we haven 't even mentioned Bart 's ' Touch of Death ' subplot .

Additionally , Final Fantasy VIII was voted the 22nd @-@ best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu . The game 's characters were created by Tetsuya Nomura , and are the first in the series to be realistically proportioned in a consistent manner . This graphical shift , as well as the cast in general , has received generally positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites . 
 The six main playable characters in Final Fantasy VIII are Squall Leonhart , a loner who keeps his focus on duty ; Rinoa Heartilly , a passionate young woman who follows her heart in all situations ; Quistis Trepe , an instructor with a serious , patient attitude ; Zell Dincht , a martial artist with a passion for hot dogs ; Selphie Tilmitt , a cheerful girl who loves trains and flies the airship Ragnarok ; and Irvine Kinneas , a marksman and consummate ladies ' man . Playable supporting characters include Laguna Loire , Kiros Seagill , and Ward Zabac , who appear in " flashback " sequences ; and antagonists Seifer Almasy and Edea Kramer . Other characters such as the main villain Ultimecia make appearances throughout the story ; their significance and backstories are revealed as the game progresses . 
 = = Cast creation and influences = = 
 Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima stresses the dynamic of players ' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games ; thus , he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop . With Final Fantasy VII , protagonist Cloud Strife 's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud 's responses to certain situations and dialogue . With Final Fantasy VIII , which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall , Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking , even while other characters remain uninformed : this led to the inner dialogues Squall has through the game . 
 Character designer Tetsuya Nomura , while exchanging e @-@ mails with director Yoshinori Kitase during the period between the development of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII , suggested that the game should have a " school days " feel . Because Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age , the idea worked . Thus , they created the concept of military academies , called " Gardens " , in which students would train to become " SeeD " mercenaries . Nojima also planned for the two playable parties featured in the game — Squall 's present day group and Laguna Loire 's group of twenty years in the past — to highly contrast with one another . Laguna 's group consists of characters in their late twenties and have a lot of combat experience . They are also close friends who have fought together for a long time and trust one another . On the other hand , Squall 's party is young and inexperienced , and Squall himself does not initially understand the value of friendship . 
 Kitase expressed a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ( " foreign " being in relation to Japan ) ; his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting . The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall , initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance . However , Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine , which led to the design seen in @-@ game . When designing Cloud Strife , Nomura gave him distinctly spiky , bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game 's protagonist . With Squall , Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role , giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose . A complete history was not yet conceived , so Nomura left the explanation for Squall 's scar to Nojima . Squall 's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket , included for the purpose of challenging the game 's full motion video designers . This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced . 
 " Guardian Forces " , creatures who are brought into battle to attack enemies or support the party , are the version of summons appearing in Final Fantasy VIII . Nomura felt they should be unique beings , without clothes or other human @-@ like concepts . This was problematic , as he did not want them to " become the actual monsters " , so he took great care in their design . <unk> — an old wizard from earlier Final Fantasy games — was replaced ; other human @-@ like designs were re @-@ imagined nude and with creature @-@ like elements . Nomura , also the director of the Guardian Force animation sequences , wanted to create a greater impact than the summons of Final Fantasy VII . Leviathan was created as a test and included in a game demo . Garnering a positive reaction from players , Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion . 
 In a Famitsu Weekly interview with Kitase , Nomura , and <unk> Naoi , the team agreed that Final Fantasy VIII reflects Nomura 's preferred technique , as opposed to Final Fantasy VII , which featured characters that " weren 't really his style " . The team also decided to use realistically proportioned characters . The higher level of full motion video technology would have otherwise created an inconsistency between the in @-@ game graphics and the higher definition full motion video graphics . Additionally , Kitase explained that the main logo of the game — Squall and Rinoa embracing — was inspired by the team 's efforts to express emotion through body language . 
 = = Creatures and races = = 
 The world of Final Fantasy VIII is predominantly occupied by humans . Another prominent race is the " Shumi " , a small tribe of creatures with yellow skin and large arms . The tribe lives in an underground village on the <unk> continent . The Shumi frown upon showing off their large hands ; NORG , the owner of Balamb Garden , was exiled from the tribe for his ostentation . All Shumi undergo a biological metamorphosis at some point in their lives ; a qualified Shumi will become an Elder while another may become a mute " <unk> " . <unk> are covered in red fur , which the Shumi attribute to " the passionate ingenuity in their hearts " . Additionally , <unk> have appeared in several Final Fantasy spin @-@ offs , including Chocobo World and Chocobo Racing . 
 Chocobos — large galliform birds common throughout the Final Fantasy series — are featured in the game . In this title , Chocobos are generally undomesticated and can be found in various forests throughout the world . Each forest has a minigame where the player must corral baby Chocobos to locate the mother . If the player catches a bird , a baby Chocobo ( a <unk> ) named Boko will follow the player around . Boko has his own game called Chocobo World that can be downloaded from the PlayStation disc onto a PocketStation game unit . Series composer Nobuo Uematsu created two Chocobo themes for Final Fantasy VIII : " Mods de Chocobo " and " <unk> de Chocobo " . 
 Final Fantasy VIII also features an array of common real world creatures , such as cats and dogs . The game also includes numerous monsters , many of which have appeared earlier in the series . Popular recurring monsters include <unk> , Behemoth , Bomb , Cactuar , Iron Giant , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = Playable characters = = 
 = = = Squall Leonhart = = = 
 Squall Leonhart ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is the main protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII . He is a young student at Balamb Garden who was identifiable by the scar on his face that a fellow student , Seifer , inflicted . He rarely speaks and has the reputation of being a lone wolf . As Squall 's story unfolds , he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa , despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending . Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing out in the rain at the orphanage where he grew up , wondering where " Sis " went . Squall 's weapon is a gunblade , a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered . His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called <unk> . 
 = = = Rinoa Heartilly = = = 
 Rinoa Heartilly ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Rinoa <unk> ) is the primary female protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII . She is the 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of General Caraway , a high @-@ ranking officer in the Galbadian army , and Julia Heartilly , a successful pianist and singer . Rinoa is a member of the Forest Owls , a resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation . When Squall and his party of SeeD help the resistance movement fight Galbadia , Rinoa decides to stay with them ; as a result she ends up falling in love with Squall . She has black hair with brown highlights and dark eyes . Outspoken , spirited , emotional , and honest with her feelings , she speaks her mind without reservation . Because of her ambition , she can often be stubborn . The year before the game begins , she dated with Squall 's long @-@ standing rival Seifer Almasy . 
 Rinoa first meets Squall at the SeeD inauguration ball at Balamb Garden . During the dance , she manages to charm the usually antisocial Squall into dancing with her . Her purpose for visiting the Garden is revealed when the Forest Owls hire Squall , Zell Dincht , and Selphie Tilmitt as mercenaries . Later , Rinoa is possessed by Ultimecia when she loses her influence over Sorceress Edea , which causes Rinoa to fall into a coma @-@ like state . Consequently , Squall tries desperately to revive her , eventually traveling to the country of Esthar . However , Ultimecia manages to use Rinoa to release Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison . After Rinoa 's use expires , Ultimecia possesses Adel and leaves Rinoa to die in space . Squall rescues her , and the two attempt to share a personal moment on the Ragnarok spaceship while the game 's theme song , " Eyes On Me " , plays in the background . During the game 's ending , she reunites with Squall , and kisses him for the first time on the Balamb Garden balcony . 
 In battle , she uses a weapon called a " Blaster Edge " , which consists of an arm holster and a projectile that returns like a boomerang . In her Combine Limit Break , she attacks in unison with her dog , Angelo . When Rinoa gains Sorceress powers , she acquires a second Limit Break , Angel Wing , which increases her spell @-@ casting ability , along with rendering her in a state of " magic " berserk for the remainder of the battle . 
 Character artist Tetsuya Nomura found Rinoa the hardest character to design in Final Fantasy VIII . Nomura emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in full motion video technology become the entire focus , believing that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters " too beautiful " and focus more on physical appearance than personality . With this in mind , Nomura tried to make her " cute , not gorgeous " . To further emphasize this , he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa 's character that he felt conveyed this idea , and sent them to Kazushige Nojima along with the character 's design . 
 In addition to Final Fantasy VIII , Rinoa appears in a PlayStation 2 technology demo recreating the pre @-@ rendered music video cutscene sequence from the game in real @-@ time . She also appears in the 2004 board video game Itadaki Street Special and the 2012 rhythm video game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy , and is set to appear in the puzzle role @-@ playing video game Puzzle & Dragons as part of the Final Fantasy collaboration . Her outfits are available in the video games Gunslinger Stratos 2 and Star Ocean : Till the End of Time , and three of Rinoa 's weapon ( the Valkyrie , Cardinal and Shooting Star ) are Ultimecia 's exclusive weapons in Dissidia Final Fantasy . 
 = = = Laguna Loire = = = 
 Laguna Loire ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a man whose past and relation to the main characters are revealed slowly throughout the game . Most of the sequences involving Laguna appear in the form of " dreams " experienced by the primary protagonists . Squall always experiences these dreams from Laguna 's point of view , although he does not think too highly of Laguna . Laguna attacks with a Machine gun and his Limit Break is Desperado , which involves a swinging rope , a grenade , and a barrage of bullets . During the dream segments , he is a twenty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old soldier in the Galbadian army who travels with his companions , Kiros Seagill and Ward Zabac . He is also an aspiring journalist . 
 During the first two dream segments , Laguna and his team are shown getting lost and visiting the hotel where singer Julia Heartilly , Laguna 's romantic interest , performs . After a scouting mission at Centra , the three soldiers are separated and Laguna is injured . A young woman named Raine nurses him back to health after he is brought to Winhill . He falls in love with and marries her . However , he is drawn away from his new home when a young girl in their care , Ellone , is kidnapped . Laguna tracks her down in Esthar , where he helps liberate the nation from the despotic rule of Sorceress Adel . The people of Esthar elect Laguna as their president and Ellone is sent back to Winhill without him . After Raine dies , her child ( whom Ward and Kiros imply to be Squall in a conversation aboard the Ragnarok ) and Ellone are sent to an orphanage . Laguna is unable to leave his post to visit her and remains president of Esthar to the present day . Ellone and Laguna are reunited in space , and Laguna helps the party prepare for their fight against Ultimecia . 
 The concept of two main characters was planned since the beginning of the game 's development . Nomura tried to create a contrast between Laguna 's and Squall 's occupations ; thus , Laguna became a soldier with a light @-@ hearted charisma , and Squall became a reserved mercenary student . The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement Squall , who is different from previous main characters . Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthly 's list of the top ten video game politicians . 
 Laguna Loire appears in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , where he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata in the Japanese version and Armando Valdes @-@ Kennedy in the English version . He is featured in his youthful Final Fantasy VIII appearance while his older and his Galbadian soldier forms . His costume of a knight is also available as <unk> content . Laguna was also planned to appear in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as the head of Mirage Arena . 
 = = = Seifer Almasy = = = 
 Seifer Almasy ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a classmate and rival of Squall , who can only be controlled by the player during the Dollet sequence . He reappears as a boss later in the game . He acts as a foil to Squall in many respects , having dated Rinoa before she met Squall , and assuming a leadership position among his friends . Like Squall , Seifer wields a gunblade which he calls " Hyperion " . His Limit Break , Fire Cross , allows him to use an attack called No Mercy . He later uses the more powerful techniques Demon Slice and <unk> against the player . Seifer has a short temper and is often depicted as a bully who desires attention . He is also fiercely independent and is often punished for his recklessness . He is the leader of Balamb Garden 's disciplinary committee with his friends Fujin and Raijin . After joining Ultimecia , he becomes the leader of the Galbadian army . 
 During the introduction sequence , Seifer cuts Squall across the left side of his face with his gunblade , leaving a scar . Squall retaliates with a backhand slash that leaves Seifer with a mirrored scar . At the following field exam in Dollet , Seifer acts independently from his teammates Squall and Zell , abandoning them ; consequently , he fails and is not promoted to SeeD . Spurred by dreams of a brighter future , he defects to Sorceress Edea so he could be her " knight " . From his point of view , Squall and the others are " evil " and he recognizes himself as a hero . As Seifer is brainwashed by the sorceress , he alienates himself from his friends . Eventually , Fujin and Raijin abandon him and he is defeated shortly afterward . Following Edea 's defeat , the party confronts Seifer one last time as he now serves Ultimecia , and either they or Gilgamesh defeat him . Seifer escapes , kidnapping Rinoa and bringing her to Adel . At the end of the game , Seifer is seen fishing and having fun with Fujin and Raijin . 
 Nomura had originally intended Seifer not only as Squall 's rival , but also as part of the love triangle between him , Squall , and Rinoa . Although this concept was shelved in the final script , Seifer remains Squall 's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall 's . They have equivalent but mirrored scars on their faces and their jackets are of opposing color and length . Both characters use <unk> ; Squall 's gunblade is larger and requires two hands , while Seifer 's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand . A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts II as a member of the Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin . Seifer in the virtual Twilight Town is a rival of the main character , Roxas , and at one point mentions that he does not wish to cooperate with destiny . He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu and Will Friedle in the Japanese and English versions , respectively . He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy VIII . 
 The book " Converging Traditions in the Digital Moving Image : <unk> of Illusion , Images of Truth " discusses that while Seifer is seen as a show @-@ off and a troublemaker , protagonist Squall Leonhart identifies with him . IGN listed Seifer as the 91st best video game villain , stating that he makes for a great rival due to the similarities between him and Squall . 
 = = = Quistis Trepe = = = 
 Quistis Trepe ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old instructor at Balamb Garden , where Squall , Zell , and Seifer are students . She uses a chain whip in battle , and her Limit Break , Blue Magic , a common ability found throughout the Final Fantasy games , allows her to imitate monsters ' attacks . Early in the game , Quistis is discharged as an instructor because she " [ lacks ] leadership qualities " . Afterwards , she maintains a more informal relationship with the other characters as a fellow member of SeeD . 
 As a child , Quistis stayed at an orphanage with most of the main characters . She then lived with foster parents , with whom she never developed any intimacy , before moving to Galbadia Garden at age ten . She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later . Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam . She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion . As a result , Squall stops paying attention to her , which leads to Quistis asking if he is paying attention . Squall rudely tells her to go " talk to a wall " , a famous comical line in the game , and not to burden him with her problems . This furthers the player 's perception of Squall 's awkwardness and anti @-@ social tendencies . When Irvine refreshes the main characters ' memories about the orphanage , they remember that Squall 's asocial behavior began when Ellone , an older sister figure to Squall , left the orphanage unexpectedly . As a result of these revelations , Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic . Later , she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa , his romantic interest . 
 When designing the characters , Nomura had wanted at least one female character to wear a skirt . Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part , but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better . The role was eventually passed to Selphie . Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher , despite being around the same age as the rest of the group . 
 = = = Selphie Tilmitt = = = 
 Selphie Tilmitt ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a student at Balamb Garden who recently transferred from Trabia Garden . She is active and energetic , although slightly clumsy . She participates in many extracurricular activities , such as planning the Garden Festival and running the school 's website . She wields nunchaku in battle , and her Limit Break Slot allows the player to cast a random spell numerous times as well as certain magic used exclusively in her limit break . In addition to battle , she pilots the Ragnarok starship . 
 Selphie first appears when running into Squall while late for class . She asks Squall to show her around because she recently transferred . During the Dollet exam , Selphie joins Squall 's team after Seifer abandons them . She becomes a SeeD with Squall and Zell , and the three are assigned to the same team . When Galbadia launches missiles at Trabia Garden , she reacts with outrage and helps destroy the missile base . Throughout the game , she revisits her childhood closeness with Irvine , who serves as her copilot on the Ragnarok . 
 Selphie was the second character that Nomura drew , after Squall , intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle . When he first designed Selphie , Nomura drew her in overalls ; however , he realized that none of the characters would be wearing a skirt . In the end , he gave Selphie a mini @-@ skirt and let Quistis have pants . In the Kingdom Hearts series , Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands , and uses a jump rope instead of nunchaku . She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version , and by Molly Keck in the English version . 
 = = = Zell Dincht = = = 
 Zell Dincht ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> Din ) is a student at Balamb Garden with Squall and Seifer . Seventeen years old , Zell is a martial artist who fits the role of unarmed character , just like Tifa Lockhart did in the previous game , Final Fantasy VII . Zell attacks with punches and kicks , his weapons being gloves , and his Limit Break , Duel , requires the player to input button combinations on the controller to deal damage . Zell is slightly impulsive and overconfident in his own skill ; however , he is loyal to his friends . Seifer gives him the nickname " chicken @-@ <unk> " . He also has a passion for hot dogs ; a recurring gag is that they are always sold out by the time he reaches the cafeteria . 
 Zell lived at the same orphanage as many of the other protagonists ; this is where Seifer first began to bully him . He was later adopted by the Dincht family in the town of Balamb . His motivation for enrolling at Garden is to live up to the memory of his grandfather , a famous soldier . 
 Zell was designed to look and act like the main character of a shōnen manga ( Japanese comic books intended primarily for boys ) ; his neighbors in Balamb describe him as a " ' comic @-@ bookish ' type of hero " . He also thinks of himself as Seifer 's rival , despite not being the main character . The inspiration for the tattoo on his face came from an MTV music video that featured a man with a full body tattoo . 
 Zell 's ultimate weapon is named Ehrgeiz , directly referencing the game of the same name which came out around the same time Final Fantasy VIII did . Also , continuing the similarities to Tifa Lockhart of Final Fantasy VII , Zell 's final limit break is My Final Heaven , while Tifa 's was called just Final Heaven . 
 = = = Irvine Kinneas = = = 
 Irvine Kinneas ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a student at Galbadia Garden , one of the three mercenary academies in the game . He is one of the Garden 's elite sharpshooters , always carrying his rifle . His Limit Break is Shot , which deals damage and inflicts status effects depending on the type of ammunition . Irvine is depicted as a cowboy , tall and fair @-@ skinned with long brown hair that he wears pulled back in a ponytail . He also enjoys flirting with the female characters , being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm . He acts like a carefree , but misunderstood loner ; however , this is merely a façade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence . 
 When Sorceress Edea becomes the Galbadian ambassador , Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall 's team to assassinate her ; Irvine is introduced as the sniper for the mission . Moments before the assassination attempt , he explains to Squall that he always chokes under pressure . In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure , he fires an accurate shot , but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet . At Trabia Garden , Irvine reveals that he and most of the other party members had lived in the same orphanage , run by Cid and Edea Kramer . However , the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces ( GF ) , magical beings who cause severe long @-@ term memory loss as a side effect . Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party , he is able to remember his past . During the game , Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie , acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage . 
 With Irvine , Nomura tried to strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not becoming too unattractive . He gave Irvine a handsome appearance , but a casual personality , hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall . Keeping with this idea , Nomura gave him goggles ; however , this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy @-@ like appearance to set him apart from other goggle @-@ wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series . 
 = = = Kiros Seagill = = = 
 Kiros Seagill ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is one of Laguna 's comrades in the Galbadian Army . He wields a pair of <unk> ( <unk> ) or gauntlet @-@ daggers , with which he repeatedly slices his enemies in his Limit Break , Blood Pain . His weapons ' name is given as " <unk> " in the English localization of the game . Following the failed mission in Centra , Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward . He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army , but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement . His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year . When Laguna is forced to leave Winhill to find Ellone , Kiros accompanies him , helping him earn money as an amateur actor to fund the expedition . Kiros remains by Laguna 's side throughout his adventures in Esthar , earning a place as Laguna 's advisor when he becomes president . Like Ward , Kiros ' interactions with Laguna are based on the staff 's interactions during development . 
 = = = Ward Zabac = = = 
 Ward Zabac ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is Laguna 's other comrade . An imposing man , he wields a large harpoon in battle ; in his Limit Break , Massive Anchor , he uses it to crush his opponents from above . During the incident at Centra , he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers . After being separated from Laguna and Kiros , he becomes a janitor at the D @-@ District Prison . When Laguna becomes president of Esthar , Ward joins Kiros as an advisor , directing affairs with gestures and ellipses . Laguna and Kiros can understand what he is saying by his reactions . Like Kiros , Ward 's interactions with Laguna are based on the staff 's interactions during development . 
 = = = Edea Kramer = = = 
 Edea Kramer ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Idea <unk> ) is initially presented as a power @-@ hungry sorceress who seizes control of Galbadia from President Deling . Her motives are unknown , but SeeD is dispatched to assassinate her . Later , it is revealed that Edea is actually the wife of Headmaster Cid , and was known as " Matron " to Squall and the other kids that lived at the orphanage . It is eventually explained that Edea was not acting of her own will , but was possessed by a sorceress from the future named Ultimecia . When Ultimecia 's control is broken , Edea takes the side of the SeeDs in the struggle and joins Squall 's party for a short time . However , she accidentally gives her powers to Rinoa , making her a sorceress . Being a sorceress , Edea attacks with magical bursts of energy and her Limit Break , Ice Strike , consists of a magically conjured icicle , hurled like a javelin . This Limit Break is depicted in a cutscene during Edea 's coronation as head of Galbadia , when she ( possessed by Ultimecia ) attacks Squall with it . 
 Edea is one of three character concepts , along with Fujin and Raijin , to have been created before Final Fantasy VIII . Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of Final Fantasy VII , based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano , who was the character illustrator of Final Fantasy VI and previous games . In Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , Edea 's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia 's . 
 = = Other characters = = 
 = = = Adel = = = 
 Adel ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a sorceress from Esthar who initiated the Sorceress War some years ago before the start of the game . As the ruler of Esthar , she ordered her soldiers to abduct every girl to find a suitable successor for her powers , including the young Ellone . During the Esthar revolution , Laguna and Dr. Odine devised an artifact to cancel the sorceress power , and placed her in suspended animation in outer space . In the present , after Edea is released from Ultimecia 's control , Ultimecia possesses the new sorceress , Rinoa , and commands her to free Adel , so she can become Ultimecia 's new and more powerful vessel . Adel is successfully freed , so Rinoa is discarded as a host . However , in order to defeat Ultimecia , Dr. Odine plans for Ultimecia to once again possess Rinoa . Eventually , Squall 's party defeats Adel when she tries to absorb Rinoa at the Lunatic Pandora , thus Adel 's powers transfer to Rinoa , Ultimecia possesses her again , and using Ellone 's powers , they start " Time Compression " , which leads to the final battle . 
 = = = Cid Kramer = = = 
 Cid Kramer ( シド ・ <unk> , Shido <unk> ) is the headmaster of Balamb Garden . After the failed assassination attempt on Edea , the Garden Master , NORG , attempts to seize power from Cid and reconcile with Edea . This sparks an internal conflict , in which the students and personnel side with either Cid or NORG . However , Squall and Xu quell the conflict and return Cid to power . Afterward , Cid aggressively confronts NORG , who started the conflict over financial issues . Cid is the husband of Sorceress Edea , with whom he ran an orphanage and founded the SeeD organization . They are estranged for most of the game , however , because they lead opposing factions until Ultimecia releases her magical possession of Edea . 
 Because most Final Fantasy titles include a character named " Cid " , Nomura wanted to design someone with differences from the past <unk> in the series . He gave this version of Cid the appearance and personality of an older , benevolent character who would watch over Squall 's party and offer them advice and motivation . Nojima decided that this type of good @-@ natured character would work best as the headmaster of Balamb Garden . 
 = = = Ellone = = = 
 Ellone ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a mysterious girl and the missing " Sis " of Squall 's past . She has the ability to send a person 's consciousness back in time and into the body of another , so they can experience the actions of that person . She uses this talent to send Squall 's party into Laguna 's past adventures , hoping that they would alter the past ; however , she eventually realizes that her abilities can only view history , not alter it . Ultimecia needs this power to achieve " Time Compression " , so she uses Edea and the Galbadian military to find her . 
 Ellone is an important character in the story , tying the relationships between some of the characters , and being the primary objective of Ultimecia . However , Ellone 's importance is mostly told in the flashbacks , and explained gradually . After Ellone 's parents were killed by Esthar soldiers , under orders of sorceress Adel , she lived with Raine in the small Winhill village , where she also developed a close relationship with her adoptive uncle , Laguna . These peaceful times lasted until she was finally captured by Esthar . Then , Laguna travelled to Esthar to rescue her , at the same time he participated in Esthar 's rebellion to overthrow Adel . After Adel 's incarceration in space , Laguna having to remain in Esthar as president , and then Raine 's death , Ellone moved to Cid and Edea 's orphanage , where she became an older sister figure to Squall and the other orphans , and eventually she also followed Cid to Balamb Garden . Early in the game , Squall 's party finds Ellone in the library of Balamb Garden , but the characters don 't have further interactions . It is later explained that the " Guardian Forces " ( GF ) which the SeeDs use in battle cause memory loss , thus explaining why Squall doesn 't remember Ellone , Edea and his past in the orphanage . 
 = = = Fujin = = = 
 Fujin ( <unk> , Fūjin ) is a young woman with pale skin , short silver hair and an eye patch . She is a member of Balamb Garden 's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Raijin ; the three of them form a close " posse " , even when Seifer leaves Garden . Fujin prefers to speak in terse sentences , often with only a single word , such as " RAGE ! " and " <unk> ! " ( in the Japanese version she only spoke in Kanji ) . However , near the end of the game , she explains to Squall that she will temporarily break ties with Seifer because of his recent behavior . In battle , Fujin wields a chakram and uses wind @-@ based magic . She shares her name with the Japanese god of wind , Fūjin . 
 Fujin and Raijin were to appear in Final Fantasy VII ; however , the designers excluded them due to their similarity to the Turks . In Kingdom Hearts II , a younger version of Fujin , named " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , appears as a member of Seifer 's gang . She is voiced by Rio Natsuki in the Japanese version and by Jillian Bowen in the English version . 
 = = = Raijin = = = 
 Raijin ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a member of Balamb Garden 's disciplinary committee with Seifer and Fujin ; the three form a close " posse " , as he calls it . He has a habit of ending his sentences with " ya know " ( <unk> , mon 'yo , in the Japanese version ) . Like Fujin , he supports Seifer when he betrays SeeD and Garden to side with Edea . Near the end of the game , he stands by Fujin 's plea to the party to help save Seifer from himself . In the ending FMV , he celebrates catching a large fish until Fujin kicks him into the water . In battle , Raijin uses thunder @-@ based magic and a bō staff with large weights on either end . He shares his name with the Japanese god of thunder , Raijin . 
 Raijin and Fujin were to appear in Final Fantasy VII ; however , the designers decided against it due to their similarity to the Turks . In Kingdom Hearts II , a younger version of Raijin , named " Rai " ( <unk> ) , appears as a member of Seifer 's gang . He is voiced by Kazuya Nakai in the Japanese version , and by Brandon Adams in the English version . 
 = = = Ultimecia = = = 
 Ultimecia ( <unk> , <unk> ) is the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VIII . Because she operates through the body of a possessed Edea to gain control of Galbadia , Ultimecia 's existence is revealed only after possessing Rinoa to release Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison to take as a new host . A sorceress from the future , Ultimecia is capable of reaching her consciousness into the distant past via a special " Junction Machine " to possess other sorceresses . She seeks to achieve " Time Compression " , which would cause all eras to merge ; this would extinguish all life but her own as she becomes an omnipresent goddess . This would give her power on a par to <unk> the Great , who , according to the background had created the world . 
 In fact , Squall and the heroes do help Ultimecia start Time Compression , but they do so to confront her in her own time . After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel , Adel transfers her power to Rinoa , then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again , and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past , at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression . At that moment , the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia 's distant future and defeat her . After the final battle , the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea . 
 Ultimecia is the villainess representing Final Fantasy VIII in Dissidia : Final Fantasy and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , where she is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka ( Japanese ) and Tasia Valenza ( English ) .

 The characters of Final Fantasy VIII have received praise by reviewers . The Gaming Age reviewer was originally concerned with the shift to consistently realistically proportioned characters , but he ultimately found them more appealing . Moreover , the review stated that the character designs and graphical quality allowed the characters to " convey emotions much more dramatically " . Game Revolution cited similar praise , agreeing that the change " really makes the graphics impressive " . Jeff <unk> of IGN commented that the " low @-@ polygon characters of Final Fantasy VII are gone , replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high @-@ polygon models that only look better the closer they get " . GameSpot agreed with the transition , claiming that " involving , personal , and emotional stories are far more believable when they come from , well , people , not short , bizarrely shaped cartoon characters " . 
 The cast itself has received criticism from reviews . <unk> criticized the manner in which romantic interactions play out , stating that " considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens — not to mention forming the central image of the box art — it 's incomprehensible why no one says ' I love you ' to anyone , ever " . With Squall , he felt that " <unk> does break one cardinal rule : when your story is character centered , you 'd better center it on a character the audience can care about . Squall , unfortunately , just doesn 't fit the bill " . However , GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the " epic " concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the " personal " , in that " the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex ; moreover , the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny " . A later editorial by IGN 's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment , appreciating that Squall and Rinoa 's single kiss during the finale serves " one of the player 's main rewards for hours of dedication " . Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline , he stated that " it 's only later in the game , once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters , that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced " . 
 = Bud Dunn = 
 Emerson " Bud " Dunn ( May 15 , 1918 – January 11 , 2001 ) was a Tennessee Walking Horse trainer from Kentucky who spent most of his career in northern Alabama . He trained horses for over forty years and won his first Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship at age 74 with the horse Dark Spirit 's Rebel ; at the time , he was the oldest rider ever to win the honor . He was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame in 1987 and was named trainer of the year twice , in 1980 and again in 1991 . At age 81 , in 1999 , Dunn won his second World Grand Championship on RPM , making him the oldest winning rider for the second time . 
 His son Steve was also a successful trainer who matched his father 's record . Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within their breed . Dunn died of a heart attack in January 2001 .

 Dunn was born Emerson Dunn on May 15 , 1918 in Scott County , Kentucky , near Lexington , to Lucius Dunn and Sadie Burgess Dunn . He grew up on his family 's farm and was involved with horses from a young age . He moved to northwest Alabama in the 1950s . He and his wife Elaine ( née Lewis ) had three children , Billie Ann , David and Steve . Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer . Dunn died on January 11 , 2001 at the age of 82 , following two heart attacks brought about by complications from knee replacement surgery . He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery , Sheffield , Alabama . 
 Steve Dunn himself won two World Grand Championships , the first before his father won one . Steve Dunn 's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989 , and Out On Parole in 2002 . Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships . When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992 , three years after Steve 's first , Steve said , " I think him winning meant more to me than when I won it . " Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve , " I always wanted him to work out here . But ain 't many fathers and sons ever got along that long . "

 Dunn began training horses in his teens , and began training Tennessee Walking Horses specifically in 1951 . He participated in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration almost every year for 50 years , beginning in 1950 , and at one time was so popular he signed autographs for several hours before performances . In total , he personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration over the years , not counting an estimated several hundred others that were trained by him and shown by other riders . Dunn 's training facility , Bud Dunn Stables ( later Bud Dunn & Son ) were located in Florence , Alabama and covered ten acres . At one point in the mid @-@ 1980s , Dunn had over 50 horses in training . 
 Dunn was given the Trainer of the Year award for the first time in 1980 , by the Professional Walking Horse Trainers Organization . He trained Tennessee Walking Horses for over 40 years , and during his career won two World Grand Championships , with the horses Dark Spirit 's Rebel and RPM , and 20 World Championships with various other horses .

 = SS El Oriente = 
 SS El Oriente was a cargo ship built in 1910 for the Morgan Line , a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Company . During World War I , she was known as USS El Oriente ( ID @-@ <unk> ) in service with the United States Navy . At the end of war , she reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente . During World War II she was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) as SS Henri Dunant ( sometimes also spelled Henry Dunant ) , but reverted to her original name of SS El Oriente at the end of the charter . 
 SS El Oriente was one of four sister ships that carried cargo and a limited number of passengers for the Morgan Line . She was acquired by the U.S. Navy in July 1918 , and converted to carry horses and mules to France , and after the Armistice , was converted again to carry American troops home from Europe . 
 El Oriente returned to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until June 1941 , when the entire Morgan Line fleet was purchased by the United States Maritime Commission . El Oriente served as a civilian @-@ crewed cargo ship during World War II , sailing primarily between the United States and the United Kingdom . In September 1944 , she was chartered by the ICRC and sailed under the Swiss flag carrying food parcels to American prisoners of war held in German camps . Henri Dunant continued to sail under Swiss charter until October 1945 , when she was returned to the United States and reverted to her former name . El Oriente was placed in the James River Reserve Fleet in November 1945 , and was sold for scrapping in July 1946 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 SS El Oriente was a cargo and passenger steamship launched on 11 May 1910 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. of Newport News , Virginia ( yard no . 132 ) , and delivered to the Atlantic division of the Morgan Line on 24 October 1910 . She was the third of four sister ships ; the other three being El Sol , El Mundo , and El Occidente . El Oriente was 6 @,@ 008 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was 430 feet 2 inches ( 131 @.@ 11 m ) long by 53 feet 1 inch ( 16 @.@ 18 m ) abeam , and made 16 knots ( 30 km / h ) . The vessel sailed for the Morgan Line , the brand name of the Southern Pacific Steamship Company ( a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad ) , which employed her to carry cargo and a limited number of passengers between New York ; New Orleans , the eastern terminus of the Southern Pacific line ; and Galveston , Texas . 
 = = World War I = = 
 After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 , it 's unclear what role , if any , El Oriente played early on in the war . Her sister ships El Occidente and El Sol were both requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) on behalf of the United States Army , and both were designated as animal transport ships . If El Oriente were used by the Army as an animal transport ship , she would have needed a refit which typically meant that any second- or third @-@ class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried . It is known that El Oriente sailed in an American convoy to France on 16 April 1918 with U.S. Navy transports Maui , Calamares , Pocahontas , and Madawaska , British transports Czar and Czaritza , and U.S. cruiser Seattle , and reached France on 28 April . 
 The next recorded activity of El Oriente was on 29 July , when she was acquired by the U.S. Navy and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander William Delahanty , USNRF , in command . El Oriente was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) and carried animals and supplies for the U.S. Army , joining her two sister ships , El Sol and El Occidente in that duty . 
 El Oriente 's first Navy voyage to France began when she sailed from Newport News with 500 animals on 11 August . Unlike earlier animal transport crossings for the Army , where there was as much as a 4 % mortality rate , the voyages in August 1918 and after carried a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship . As part of this new program , El Oriente delivered her full load of horses and mules — suffering no losses — at Bordeaux on 2 September . El Oriente made an additional roundtrip with 500 more animals in October , losing only three of her equine cargo during the voyage . El Oriente continued sailing for the NOTS through April 1919 , sometimes carrying a small number of troops on return voyages to the United States . At that time El Oriente was converted to carry troops , and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force to help return larger numbers American servicemen from Europe . 
 She sailed on 11 June for Bordeaux and returned with officers and men of the 6th Cavalry Regiment on 4 July . She made additional voyages in July and August , returning 978 members of the 3rd Infantry Division to Philadelphia on the latter voyage . In all , El Oriente returned 2 @,@ 986 healthy and wounded American servicemen from France in three voyages . On 15 September at Philadelphia , El <unk> was decommissioned , and returned to the Morgan Line soon after . 
 = = Interwar civilian service = = 
 El Oriente resumed cargo service with the Morgan Line , and enjoyed a quiet career , typically sailing between New York and Galveston . One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente came upon the wreck of the schooner , Caldwell H. Colt , which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale . When El Oriente came upon the hulk , only her captain remained alive , surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue . El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there . 
 = = World War II = = 
 In June 1941 , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) announced that it had requisitioned the entire Morgan Line fleet of ten ships , including El Oriente and her remaining sister ships , El Occidente and El Mundo . The ships were to finish previously scheduled cargo runs and be handed over to the USMC over the following six weeks . The USMC had been charged with assembling a 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 GRT U.S. fleet to " aid the democracies " fighting Germany in World War II , and paid $ 4 @.@ 7 million for the ships and a further $ 2 @.@ 6 million for repairs and refits . 
 El Oriente was handed over to the USMC and assigned to United States Lines , Inc . , for operation . The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines . Little is known of El Oriente 's movements over the next eight months , but on 17 February El Oriente sailed from Houston , Texas , to Philadelphia and on to Reykjavík . From Reykjavík , she sailed to the Clyde , arriving there at the end of July . Over the next 5 months , El Oriente sailed around the British Isles , calling at Kirkwall , Belfast Lough , Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , and Liverpool , and back to Clyde in late December . From there , she sailed on one trip to Murmansk where she arrived on 27 January 1943 . 
 Murmansk had limited port facilities and slow unloading of cargo ( often performed by Soviet women and political prisoners ) , which , coupled with inclement weather and long waits for convoy escorts , often required lengthy stays by Allied cargo ships . El Oriente was no exception , staying in Murmansk for nearly five weeks . To compound the lengthy wait ( and , often , accompanying boredom ) faced by cargo ships waiting to unload , the nearest German airfield was 35 miles ( 56 km ) away — about 7 to 10 minutes flying time — which gave almost no advance warning of air raids . German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti @-@ aircraft fire , drop their payloads , and fly away . El Oriente was caught in one such attack on 27 February , with four of the ship 's Naval Armed Guards men killed in the attack . 
 El Oriente departed Kola Inlet on 1 March and returned to Liverpool , from which she sailed in a convoy for New York on 6 April , and returned to Belfast Lough in late June . After calling at Barry and Milford Haven , El Oriente began two roundtrips to New York at the end of June . In October the ship visited Loch Ewe , Methil , and Immingham before returning to New York again in November . After another transatlantic crossing and circuit amongst British ports , El Oriente returned to New York in May 1944 . 
 In June , the cargo vessel sailed to Cuba , calling at Havana and Puerto <unk> before returning to New York . She next sailed to La Guaira , Venezuela ; Maracaibo , Venezuela ; and <unk> , Cuba , before returning to New York in mid August . El Oriente sailed to Philadelphia in mid September in preparation for a charter .

 On 28 September 1944 , El Oriente was chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross , reflagged as a Swiss ship , and renamed SS Henry Dunant ( sometimes erroneously spelled as Henri Dunant ) , after Red Cross movement founder Henry Dunant . She was last of 14 ships chartered by Swiss interests to sail under the Swiss flag during World War II . On 5 October , Henry Dunant departed Philadelphia with a cargo of mail and 900 @,@ 000 food parcels intended for Allied prisoners of war interned in German camps . 
 Henry Dunant continued sailing for the ICRC through 24 October 1945 . The ship returned to Norfolk , resumed her former name of El Oriente , and entered the James River Reserve Fleet on 7 November 1945 . On 3 July 1946 , El Oriente was sold for scrapping to the Patapsco Scrap Co . , of Baltimore , Maryland , for $ 12 @,@ 175 . 
 = USS Bennington ( PG @-@ 4 ) = 
 USS Bennington ( Gunboat No. 4 / PG @-@ 43 ) was a member of the Yorktown class of steel @-@ hulled , twin @-@ screw gunboats in the United States Navy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . She was the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the town of Bennington , Vermont , site of the Battle of Bennington in the American Revolutionary War . 
 The contract to build Bennington was awarded to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Philadelphia in November 1887 . Her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works which laid down Bennington 's keel in June 1888 . Bennington was launched in June 1890 . She was just over 244 feet ( 74 m ) long and 36 feet ( 11 m ) abeam and displaced 1 @,@ 710 long tons ( 1 @,@ 740 t ) . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner @-@ rigged masts . The ship 's main battery consisted of six 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 2 cm ) guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller caliber guns . 
 After her June 1891 commissioning , Bennington was attached to the Squadron of Evolution and for its cruise to South America . The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894 , after which she was assigned to the duties in the Pacific . She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands to protect American interests there . On her way to support United States Army operations of the Philippine – American War , Bennington claimed Wake Island for the United States . After two years in the Philippines , she returned to the United States and was decommissioned for 18 months of repairs and refitting . After her March 1903 re @-@ commissioning , most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America . 
 On 21 July 1905 at San Diego , California , Bennington suffered a boiler explosion , that killed 66 men and injured nearly everyone else on board . Shortly after the explosion , a tug beached the ship to prevent her from sinking . Eleven men were awarded the Medal of Honor for " extraordinary heroism " in the aftermath of the explosion . After Bennington was refloated , the damage was deemed too extensive to repair and the ship was decommissioned in September . The ship was sold for scrap in 1910 , but instead served as a water barge for the Matson Line at Honolulu from 1912 . In 1924 , the former Bennington was scuttled off the coast of Oahu . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The Yorktown class gunboats – unofficially considered third @-@ class cruisers – were the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and , yet , able to carry a heavy battery . Bennington was authorized in the 1888 fiscal year , and the contract for her construction was awarded to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Chester , Pennsylvania . The hull for Bennington was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works and built to the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair design . The mechanical design was patterned after the layout for her older sister ship Yorktown developed by William Cramp & Sons . 
 Bennington 's keel was laid down in June 1888 , and the ship was launched on 3 June 1890 , sponsored by Anne Aston , the daughter of Rear Admiral Ralph Aston , Chief Engineer of the U.S. Navy . 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 As built , Bennington was 244 feet 5 inches ( 74 @.@ 50 m ) in length and 36 feet ( 11 m ) abeam . Her steel hull had an average draft of 14 feet ( 4 m ) , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water . At the waterline was a turtleback deck of ⅜ -inch ( 9 @.@ 5 mm ) steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces . The deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) below the waterline at the sides of the ship . Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads ; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle . 
 Above the armored deck , Bennington had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them . The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval @-@ shaped to deflect shot . It was outfitted with a steam @-@ powered Ship 's wheel , an engine order telegraph , and speaking tubes ; it was protected by 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of steel armor plate . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Bennington was powered by two triple @-@ expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of 10 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) , three @-@ bladed screw propellers . The cylinders of each engine were 22 , 31 , and 51 inches ( 56 , 79 , and 130 cm ) in diameter and had a 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) stroke . Each engine was rated at 3 @,@ 400 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 500 kW ) and together were designed to move the ship at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ) , though the ship exceeded that in her trials , topping out at 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 The engines , situated in separate watertight compartments , were each fed by a pair of coal @-@ fired boilers . Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 90 m ) in diameter and 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 33 m ) in length with a total grate area of 220 square inches ( 1 @,@ 400 cm2 ) . Bennington 's coal bunkers could carry up to 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of fuel , and were shielded from " shot and shell " . At a near top @-@ speed of 16 knots , the ship could cover 2 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 200 km ) in 6 ½ days ; at the more economical speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) she could cruise 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 22 @,@ 000 km ) over 62 days . 
 To supplement her steam power plant , Bennington was built with three masts that were schooner @-@ rigged . She had a total sail area of 6 @,@ 300 square feet ( 590 m2 ) . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow Bennington to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime .

The two guns on the gun deck were mounted 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the waterline , while the other four were 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) above . The guns fired 105 @-@ pound ( 48 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing 18 @.@ 8 pounds ( 8 @.@ 5 kg ) at 1 @,@ 950 feet per second ( 590 m / s ) . At an elevation of 30 @.@ 2 ° , the guns had a range of 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . Each gun was shielded with steel plating 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick . 
 Bennington 's secondary battery consisted of four 6 @-@ pounder ( 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 24 in ) ) guns , and four 1 @-@ pounder ( 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) ) guns . Both were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss . According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication , an armor @-@ piercing round fired from a 6 @-@ pounder gun could penetrate 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of armor at a distance of 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) .

 USS Bennington ( Gunboat No. 4 ) was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 20 June 1891 under the command of Commander Royal B. Bradford . As one of the first steel @-@ hulled gunboats of the " New Navy " , Bennington was assigned to the Squadron of Evolution , a unit made up entirely of " New Navy " ships that was established to test and perfect tactics and doctrine developed at the Naval War College . In addition to operating as the first tactical fleet of the U.S. Navy , the squadron performed the secondary mission of cruising to foreign ports to demonstrate to the world the types of modern ships the United States was capable of building . In that latter role , Bennington and the rest of the squadron departed New York on 19 November 1891 for the unit 's cruise to Brazil . 
 On 5 May 1892 , Bennington was transferred to the South Atlantic Squadron and cruised South American waters until 19 July . Setting out from Bahia , Brazil , the gunboat visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400th anniversary celebration of Columbus ' voyage to the western hemisphere . She concluded the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz , with a replica of Columbus ’ s caravel Pinta in tow for Cuba . After stops in the Canary Islands , the Netherlands West Indies , and Havana , the gunboat arrived back in the United States at Hampton Roads , Virginia , on 26 March . 
 Following participation in the 1893 International Naval Review at Hampton Roads , Bennington moved north for operations along the coast of New England before beginning preparations for foreign service . To this end , she entered the New York Navy Yard on 24 May and remained there until 6 August . The ship departed New York on the 6th and arrived in Lisbon on the 18th . She cruised the Mediterranean , visiting various ports along its shores , for the next six months . In February 1894 , orders arrived sending her to the Pacific . On the 18th , the gunboat transited the Strait of Gibraltar and headed back across the Atlantic . After steaming around Cape Horn and stopping at several Latin American ports , the warship finally arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 30 April . 
 = = Pacific Duty = = 
 Bennington served In the Pacific for a little more than four years . For the most part , her duty consisted of cruising along the west coast protecting American interests in Latin America during the numerous political upheavals that occurred at that time in Central and South America . In addition , she made two extended cruises to the Hawaiian Islands . The first came after a group of pro @-@ royalists attempted in January 1895 to stage a countercoup against the provisional government of the islands . Bennington departed Mare Island on 28 May , arrived at Honolulu on 5 June , and spent the next nine months protecting American interests in the islands . On 5 March 1896 , she departed Honolulu , bound for San Francisco where she arrived on 16 March . The following day , the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for five months of repairs . 
 On 8 August , she resumed cruises along the west coast . That employment lasted a year and a week . On 14 August 1897 , Bennington headed back to Hawaii . She arrived in Lahaina Roads on 27 September and reached Honolulu on the 30th . Except for a six @-@ day cruise back to Lahaina in March 1898 , the gunboat remained at Honolulu for just over nine months . 
 At the outbreak of the Spanish – American War , Bennington was in Hawaiian waters . After spending the first two months of the war in the Hawaiian Islands , she departed Honolulu on 16 June and steamed to the west coast of the United States . The warship arrived in San Francisco on 26 June and patrolled the California coast for the remainder of hostilities . On 18 September , Bennington stood out of San Francisco on her way ultimately to the Philippines . She arrived in Hawaii on 27 September and devoted a little over three months to operations in nearby waters . On 7 January 1899 , she resumed her voyage west . Ten days out of Honolulu , she stopped at Wake Island . There Commander Edward D. Taussig , Bennington 's commander , under direct orders from President William McKinley claimed the atoll for the United States , despite protests from Germany ( which considered the island group a part of its claim of the Marshall Islands ) . Wake eventually became an important link in the Honolulu – Manila trans @-@ Pacific cable . Bennington later made a stop at San Luis d <unk> , Guam , from 23 January to 15 February where Commander ( later Rear Admiral ) Taussig accepted the relinquishment of Guam from her Spanish colonial governor . Taussig briefly served as the first naval governor of Guam and established a native ruling council , before continuing on to Manila where Bennington arrived on 22 February . 
 = = Philippine – American War = = 
 For a little more than two years after her February 1899 arrival , Bennington served in the Philippine Islands in support of the Army 's campaigns during the Philippine – American War . For the most part , her service in the islands consisted of patrol and escort duty – preventing rebel movement and stopping the importation of arms , as well as seeing American troops and supplies safely between the islands . Occasionally , Bennington did see action . On 10 September , she shelled a fort near Legaspi on the southeastern coast of Luzon . Two days later , she captured and destroyed the insurgent vessel <unk> . Between 7 and 9 November , the warship supported an Army landing at San Fabian on the shores of Lingayen Gulf in northwestern Luzon . The gunboat began a four @-@ month assignment as station ship at Cebu on 26 November and concluded that duty on 19 March 1900 . 
 After visiting Cavite on Luzon , the gunboat headed for Japan on 3 April and underwent repairs there from 9 April to 19 May before heading back to the Philippines . The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June . She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army ’ s operations in the island chain . On 3 January 1901 , she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong . The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs . At the completion of that work , she departed Hong Kong on 25 June . After a visit to Shanghai , the warship headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August . She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901 . 
 While she was out of commission at Mare Island , Bennington was refitted . A pilothouse that had been added on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893 – 94 – were removed . Bennington 's mainmast was also removed , leaving her as a two @-@ mast rig . In addition , two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge . After 18 months of inactivity , Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas . 
 Over the next 27 months , Bennington cruised in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of North and South America . The warship visited Alaskan ports in the summer of 1903 and the coast of Central America the following fall and winter . In May 1904 , she steamed to Hawaii and then proceeded to the Aleutians in June . The winter of 1904 and 1905 saw her voyage south for visits to Pacific ports in Central and South America . In February 1905 , she departed San Francisco for a two @-@ month cruise to the Hawaiian Islands , returning to San Diego on 19 July , after a difficult 17 @-@ day voyage . 
 = = Boiler explosion = = 
 On the morning of 21 July 1905 , Bennington 's crew was preparing her to sail to the aid of the monitor Wyoming which had broken down and was in need of a tow . After her crew had finished the difficult task of coaling the ship that morning , most of them were belowdecks cleaning themselves from the dirty job . Unbeknownst to anyone on board , three problems with one of Bennington 's boilers – oily feed water , an improperly closed steam valve , and a faulty steam gauge – were conspiring against them . At about 10 : 30 , excessive steam pressure in the boiler resulted in a boiler explosion that rocked the ship , sending men and equipment flying into the air . The escaping steam sprayed through the living compartments and decks . The explosion opened Bennington 's hull to the sea , and she began to list to starboard . Quick actions by the tug Santa Fe — taking Bennington under tow and beaching her – almost certainly saved the gunboat from sinking . 
 The combination of the explosion and the scalding steam killed a number of men outright and left others mortally wounded ; the final death toll was one officer and sixty @-@ five men , making it one of the U.S. Navy 's worst peacetime disasters . Nearly all of the forty @-@ six who survived had an injury of some sort ; eleven of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor for " extraordinary heroism displayed at the time of the explosion " . One of the survivors was John Henry Turpin , who had also survived the explosion of Maine in Havana in February 1898 and was , reportedly , the only man to survive both explosions . The sheer number of casualties – the death toll exceeded the U.S. Navy 's death toll for the entirety of the Spanish – American War – overwhelmed San Diego 's medical facilities , and many burn victims had to be cared for in makeshift facilities tended by volunteers . 
 The number of dead also taxed the morticians in San Diego , who were hard @-@ pressed to prepare all of the victims for burial . On 23 July , two days after the explosion , the majority of those killed were buried in the cemetery at Fort Rosecrans . The victims are commemorated by the USS Bennington Monument , a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) granite obelisk dedicated in the cemetery on 7 January 1908 . 
 In spite of rumors of misconduct by Bennington 's engineering crewmen , an official investigation concluded that the explosion was not due to negligence on the part of the crew .

 After the explosion , Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard . Because of the extent of the damages and the age of the ship , Bennington was not repaired but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905 . After five years of inactivity , Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November . Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge . She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924 , when she was scuttled off Oahu .

 = Diamonds Are Forever ( novel ) = 
 Diamonds Are Forever is the fourth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond . Fleming wrote the story at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica , inspired by a Sunday Times article on diamond smuggling . The book was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1956 . 
 The story centres on Bond 's investigation of a diamond @-@ smuggling ring originating in the mines of Sierra Leone and ends in Las Vegas . Along the way Bond meets and falls in love with one of the members of the smuggling gang , Tiffany Case . Much of Fleming 's background research formed the basis for his non @-@ fiction 1957 book The Diamond Smugglers . Diamonds Are Forever deals with international travel , marriage and the transitory nature of life . 
 As with Fleming 's previous novels , Diamonds Are Forever received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication . The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper , first in an abridged , multi @-@ part form and then as a comic strip . In 1971 it was adapted into the seventh Bond film in the series and was the last Eon Productions film to star Sean Connery as Bond . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The British Secret Service agent James Bond is sent on an assignment by his superior , M. Acting on information received from Special Branch , M tasks Bond with infiltrating a smuggling ring transporting diamonds from mines in the Crown colony of Sierra Leone to the United States . Bond must infiltrate the smugglers ' pipeline to uncover those responsible . Using the identity of " Peter Franks " , a country house burglar turned diamond smuggler , he meets Tiffany Case , an attractive gang member who has developed an antipathy towards men after being gang @-@ raped as a teenager . 
 Bond discovers that the ring is operated by the Spangled Mob , a ruthless American gang run by the brothers Jack and Seraffimo Spang . He follows the trail from London to New York . To earn his fee for carrying the diamonds he is instructed by a gang member , Shady Tree , to bet on a rigged horse race in nearby Saratoga . There Bond meets Felix Leiter , a former CIA agent working at Pinkertons as a private detective investigating crooked horse racing . Leiter bribes the jockey to ensure the failure of the plot to rig the race , and asks Bond to make the pay @-@ off . When he goes to make the payment , he witnesses two homosexual thugs , Wint and Kidd , attack the jockey . 
 Bond calls Tree to enquire further about the payment of his fee and is told to go to the Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas . The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and operates as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob . Spang also owns an old Western ghost town , named Spectreville , restored to be his own private holiday retreat . At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany . After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily . Spang suspects that Bond may be a ' plant ' and has him captured and tortured . With Tiffany 's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push @-@ car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train . Bond changes the points and re @-@ routes the train onto a dead @-@ end , and shoots Spang before the resulting crash . Assisted by Leiter , Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York , where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London , a relationship developing between them as they go . Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board . They kidnap Tiffany , planning to kill her and throw her overboard . Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters ; he makes it look like a murder @-@ suicide . 
 Tiffany subsequently informs Bond of the details of the pipeline . The story begins in Africa where a dentist bribes miners to smuggle diamonds in their mouths ; he extracts the gems during routine appointments . From there , the dentist takes the diamonds to a rendezvous with a German helicopter pilot . Eventually the diamonds go to Paris and then on to London . There , after telephone instructions from a contact known as ABC , Tiffany meets a person who explains how the diamonds will be smuggled to New York City . After returning to London — where Tiffany moves into Bond 's flat — Bond flies to Freetown in Sierra Leone , and then to the next diamond rendezvous . With the collapse of the rest of the pipeline , Jack Spang ( who turns out to be ABC ) shuts down his diamond @-@ smuggling pipeline by killing its participants . Spang himself is killed when Bond shoots down his helicopter .

 By mid 1954 the author Ian Fleming had published two novels — Casino Royale ( 1953 ) and Live and Let Die ( 1954 ) — and had a third , Moonraker , being edited and prepared for production . That year he read a story in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone . He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and , through an old school friend , he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe , the ex @-@ head of MI5 , then working in a security capacity for the diamond @-@ trading company De Beers . The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers , a non @-@ fiction book published in 1957 . 
 After Fleming 's friend , William Stephenson , sent him a magazine article about the spa town of Saratoga Springs , Fleming flew to the US in August 1954 , where he met his friends Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo ; the three travelled to the town in New York State . There , Fleming and Cuneo visited a mud @-@ bath : en route to an up @-@ market establishment they took the wrong directions and ended up at a run @-@ down outlet , which became the inspiration for the Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths scene in the book . Fleming met the rich socialite , William Woodward , Jr . , who drove a Studillac — a Studebaker with a powerful Cadillac engine . According to Henry Chancellor , " the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian , and he shamelessly appropriated this car " for the book . Woodward was killed by his wife shortly afterwards — she claimed she mistook him for a prowler — and when Diamonds Are Forever was published , it was dedicated to Bryce , Cuneo and " the memory of W. W. Jr . , at Saratoga , 1954 and 55 " . 
 Fleming also travelled to Los Angeles with Cuneo , visiting the Los Angeles Police Intelligence headquarters , where they met Captain James Hamilton , who provided Fleming with information on the Mafia organisation in the US . From Los Angeles Fleming travelled to Las Vegas , where he stayed at the Sands Hotel ; he interviewed the hotel owner , Jack Entratter , where he learnt the background to the security systems and methods of cheating that he used in the novel . 
 Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January and February 1955 . He followed his usual practice , which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine , in which he said : " I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour 's work between six and seven in the evening . I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula , you write 2 @,@ 000 words a day . " On completion Fleming wrote to his friend Hilary Bray : 
 I baked a fresh cake in Jamaica this year which I think has finally exhausted my inventiveness as it contains every single method of escape and every variety of suspenseful action that I had omitted from my previous books — in fact everything except the kitchen sink , and if you can think up a good plot involving kitchen sinks , please send it along speedily . 
 He returned to London with the completed 183 @-@ page typescript in March that year ; he had earlier settled on a title , which he based on an advertisement slogan " A Diamond is Forever " in the American edition of Vogue . 
 Although Fleming provides no dates within his novels , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications — have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . Chancellor put the events of Diamonds Are Forever in 1954 ; Griswold is more precise , and considers the story to have taken place in July and August 1953 .

 Fleming had previously travelled to the US on the RMS Queen Elizabeth ; the experience provided background information for the final four chapters of the novel . His trip had included a railway journey on the Super Chief , during which he and Cuneo had visited the cab to meet the driver and engineer , and an excursion on the 20th Century Limited , both of which gave information Fleming used for Spang 's train , the Cannonball . Fleming had a long @-@ standing interest in trains and following his involvement in a near @-@ fatal crash associated them with danger . In addition to Diamonds Are Forever , he used them in Live and Let Die , From Russia , with Love and The Man with the Golden Gun . 
 As with several others of his works , Fleming appropriated the names of people he knew for the story 's characters . The name of one of Fleming 's two travelling companions from the US , Ernest Cuneo , was used as Ernie <unk> , Bond 's taxi @-@ driving ally in Las Vegas , and one of the homosexual villains , " Boofy " Kidd , was named after one of Fleming 's close friends — and a relative of his wife — Arthur Gore , 8th Earl of Arran , known to his friends as " Boofy " . Arran , an advocate of the relaxation of the British laws relating to homosexuality , heard about the use of his name before publication and complained to Fleming about it , but was ignored and the name was retained for the novel . During his trip to America Fleming had come across the name Spang — old German for " maker of shoe buckles " — which he appropriated for the villainous brothers . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The writer Jonathan Kellerman 's introduction to the 2006 edition of Diamonds Are Forever describes Bond as a " surprisingly ... complex " character who , in contrast with the cinematic representation , is " nothing other than human . ... Fleming 's Bond makes mistakes and pays for them . He feels pain and regret . " The novelist Raymond Benson — who later wrote a series of Bond novels — writes that the character develops in Diamonds Are Forever , building on Fleming 's characterisation in his previous three novels . This growth arises through Bond 's burgeoning relationship with the book 's main female character , Tiffany Case . He falls in love ; the first time he has done so since Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale . According to Benson , Tiffany is portrayed as tough , but lonely and insecure , and " is Fleming 's first fully developed female character . " The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett write that many of the main female characters in Fleming 's novels are uncommon , and Tiffany — along with Pussy Galore from Goldfinger and Honeychile Rider from Dr. No — has been " damaged ... sexually " having previously been raped . The effect of the trauma has led to Tiffany working for the villain , which allows Bond to complete his mission , and align her to a more honest lifestyle . 
 The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that Diamonds Are Forever along with Goldfinger and The Man with the Golden Gun have gangsters as antagonists rather than as spies ; the novel is the only one in the Bond canon without a connection to the Cold War . Panek , comparing the gangsters to Bond 's normal adversaries , identifies them as " merely incompetent gunsels " when compared with the British agent , who can eliminate them with relative ease . The essayist Umberto Eco sees the <unk> as being a forerunner of the SPECTRE organisation Fleming uses in his later novels . Kingsley Amis , who later wrote a Bond novel , considered that there was " no decent villain " , while Eco judges three of the villains — the two Spang brothers and Winter — as physically abnormal , as many of Bond 's adversaries are . Anthony Synnott , in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels , also considers that the gangster Michael " Shady " Tree fits into the abnormal category , as he is a red @-@ haired hunchback with " a pair of china eyes that were so empty and motionless that they might have been hired by a taxidermist " . 
 = = Style = = 
 Diamonds Are Forever opens with a passage in which a scorpion hunts and eats its prey , and is subsequently killed by one of the diamond couriers . Eco sees this " cleverly presented " beginning as similar to the opening of a film , remarking that " Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill " . When the writer William Plomer was proof @-@ reading the manuscript he saw literary merit , and wrote to Fleming that the passages relating to the racing stables at Saratoga were " the work of a serious writer " . Kellerman considers that " Fleming 's depiction of Las Vegas in the ' 50s is wickedly spot on and one of the finest renditions of time and place in contemporary crime fiction . The story is robust and complex . " 
 Fleming used well @-@ known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism , which Amis called " the Fleming effect " . Amis describes " the imaginative use of information , whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond 's world ... [ is ] bolted down to some sort of reality , or at least counter @-@ balanced . " Benson considers that in Diamonds Are Forever the use of detail is " rich and flamboyant " which allows an " interesting and amusing " description of the US . Benson considers a weakness of the book to be a lack of structural development , although this is compensated by character development ; Kellerman also believes the novel to be " rich in characterization " . 
 Benson analyses Fleming 's writing style and identifies what he describes as the " Fleming Sweep " : a stylistic point that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using ' hooks ' at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next : Benson feels that the sweep in Diamonds Are Forever was " at full force " in the novel , which " maintain [ s ] a constant level of excitement " as a result . 
 = = Themes = = 
 According to Benson the main theme of Diamonds Are Forever is expressed in the title , with the permanency of the gemstones held in contrast to other aspects of the story , particularly love and life . Towards the end of the novel Fleming uses the lines " Death is forever . But so are diamonds " , and Benson sees the gems as a metaphor for death and Bond as the " messenger of death " . 
 The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observes that " the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that , although superficially devoted to the Anglo @-@ American war against communism , they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans " ; Benson sees that Diamonds Are Forever contains examples of Fleming 's feelings of superiority towards American culture , including his description of the sleaziness of Las Vegas . Amis , in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier , pointed out that Leiter is 
 ... such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he , the American , takes orders from Bond , the Britisher , and that Bond is constantly doing better than he , showing himself , not braver or more devoted , but smarter , wittier , tougher , more resourceful , the incarnation of little old England . 
 The cultural historian Jeremy Black points to the theme of international travel in Diamonds Are Forever , which was still a novelty to most people in Britain at the time . This travel between a number of a locations exacerbates one of the problems identified by Black : that there was no centre to the story . In contrast to the other novels in the Bond canon , where Casino Royale had Royale , From Russia , with Love had Istanbul and Dr. No had Jamaica , Diamonds Are Forever had multiple locations and two villains and there was " no megalomaniac fervour , no weird self @-@ obsession , at the dark centre of the plot " . 
 According to Fleming 's biographer , Andrew Lycett , after the novel was completed , Fleming added four extra chapters " almost as an afterthought " , detailing the events on the Queen Elizabeth . This introduced the question of marriage , and allowed Fleming to discuss matrimony through his characters , with Bond telling case " Most marriages don 't add two people together . They subtract one from the other . " Lycett opines that the addition was because of the state of Fleming 's own marriage which was going through a bad time .

 Diamonds Are Forever was published on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape with a cover designed by Pat Marriott . As with the three previous Bond books , the first edition of 12 @,@ 500 copies sold out quickly ; the US edition was published in October 1956 by Macmillan . The novel was serialised in The Daily Express newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwards — the first of Fleming 's novels he had sold to the newspaper — which led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels . From November 1956 sales of Diamonds Are Forever , and Fleming 's other novels , all rose following the visit of the Prime Minister , Sir Anthony Eden , to Fleming 's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the Suez Crisis ; Eden 's stay was much reported in the British press . The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when Eon Productions adapted Dr. No for the cinema , and in 1971 when Diamonds Are Forever was produced for the big screen . In February 1958 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK , which sold 68 @,@ 000 copies before the end of the year . Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions , translated into several languages and has never been out of print . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 Julian Symons , reviewing Diamonds Are Forever in The Times Literary Supplement , thought that Fleming had some enviable qualities as a writer , including " a fine eye for places ... an ability to convey his own interest in the mechanics of gambling and an air of <unk> " . Symons also saw defects in Fleming 's style , including " his inability to write convincing dialogue " . For Symons , the novel was Fleming 's " weakest book , a heavily padded story about diamond smuggling " , where " the exciting passages are few " . 
 Milward Kennedy of the The Manchester Guardian , thought that Fleming was " determined to be as tough as Chandler , if a little less lifelike " , while Maurice Richardson , in The Observer , considered Bond " one of the most cunningly synthesised heroes in crime @-@ fiction " . Richardson wrote how " Fleming 's method is worth noting , and recommending : he does not start indulging in his wilder fantasies until he has laid down a foundation of factual description . " Elements of a review by Raymond Chandler for The Sunday Times were used as advertising for the novel ; Chandler wrote that it was " about the nicest piece of book @-@ making in this type of literature which I have seen for a long time ... Mr. Fleming writes a journalistic style , neat , clean , spare and never pretentious " . 
 Writing in The New York Times , Anthony Boucher — described by Fleming 's biographer John Pearson as " throughout an avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " — was mixed in his review , thinking that " Mr. Fleming 's handling of American and Americans is well above the British average " , although he felt that " the narrative is loose @-@ jointed and weakly resolved " , while Bond resolves his assignments " more by muscles and luck than by any sign of operative intelligence " .

 Diamonds Are Forever was adapted as a daily comic strip for the Daily Express newspaper , and syndicated around the world . The original adaptation ran from 10 August 1959 to 30 January 1960 . The strip was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky . 
 The novel was loosely adapted in a 1971 film starring Sean Connery and directed by Guy Hamilton . Diamonds Are Forever was the final Bond film undertaken by Sean Connery with Eon Productions , although he returned to the role of Bond twelve years later with Kevin McClory 's Taliafilm company for Never Say Never Again . 
 In July 2015 Diamonds Are Forever was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 , starring Toby Stephens as Bond ; it was directed by Martin Jarvis . 
 = New York State Route 75 = 
 New York State Route 75 ( NY 75 ) is a north – south state highway in Erie County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 20 @.@ 85 miles ( 33 @.@ 55 km ) from an intersection with NY 39 in the Collins hamlet of Collins Center to an interchange with NY 5 in the town of Hamburg . The route passes through the village of Hamburg , which serves as the northern terminus of a 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) overlap between U.S. Route 62 ( US 62 ) and NY 75 . Past Hamburg , NY 75 connects to the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 or I @-@ 90 ) northwest of the village before ending a short distance from Lake Erie . The portion of NY 75 south of Hamburg is a two @-@ lane rural highway ; in contrast , the section north of the village is four lanes wide and serves commercial and residential areas . 
 The origins of NY 75 date back to 1930 when New York State Route 62 was assigned to an alignment extending from Great Valley to Buffalo via Hamburg and Athol Springs . NY 62 was renumbered to NY 75 c . 1932 to eliminate numerical duplication with US 62 , and the route was truncated to end in Hamburg in the late 1930s after most of it became part of US 219 . The section of modern NY 75 south of Hamburg was initially New York State Route 18A , an alternate route of then @-@ NY 18 through Collins and Eden . NY 18 was truncated c . 1962 to begin in Niagara County , at which time NY 18A became part of NY 75 .

 NY 75 begins at an intersection with NY 39 in Collins Center , a small hamlet in the town of Collins . It initially heads northeastward as the two @-@ lane Sisson Highway , serving a handful of homes on the northern edge of the community prior to entering an open area dominated by farmland . About 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from NY 39 , the road curves northward , taking on a due north alignment as it heads across the rolling terrain that comprises most of northern Collins . The highway serves just one community , the hamlet of Whites Corners , on its way into the adjacent town of North Collins . Here , development along NY 75 remains limited at first , consisting of only a handful of isolated farms situated among fields or one of several forested areas . It quickly passes through Marshfield , located just past the town line , on its way toward Langford . A brief stretch of homes begins about 3 miles ( 5 km ) into the town as the route enters Langford , located 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) north of Collins Center . 
 In the center of the community , NY 75 intersects Langford Road , designated as NY 249 west of the junction and County Route 39 ( CR 39 ) east of NY 75 . Past NY 249 , the route exits Langford and heads across another stretch of fields and farms toward the Eden town line . NY 75 breaks from its due north routing just south of it , taking on a more westerly heading to avoid a valley surrounding the south branch of Eighteenmile Creek . It ultimately enters the valley , however , winding its way northward down the depression 's southwestern side to reach the creek floor . From here , NY 75 follows the base of the valley to the northwest for 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) , serving a handful of homes situated along the forested creekside . The route eventually climbs out of the gully and heads due north for a short distance across more fields to a junction with US 62 . 
 At this point , NY 75 turns northeastward , overlapping with US 62 into the nearby town of Hamburg along <unk> State Road . Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and a pocket of homes at the start of the concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley . The influx of homes brings US 62 and NY 75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg , where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue . The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue , where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street . While US 62 continues east into Hamburg 's central business district on Main Street , NY 75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village . 
 Outside of the village , NY 75 becomes Camp Road and begins to parallel the Buffalo Southern Railroad , separated from NY 75 by only a row of homes and businesses . While on this stretch , the highway widens from two to four lanes . After 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , the route makes a turn to the northwest , passing under the railroad and entering the southeastern portion of a commercial strip that follows NY 75 for 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) exit 57 . It continues past the Thruway for another 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) before ceasing at a junction with US 20 . Continuing on , the highway remains four lanes wide but serves primarily residential areas located in and around Athol Springs , a hamlet on the shores of Lake Erie . 
 Just outside Athol Springs , NY 75 passes under two railroad bridges , carrying the Norfolk Southern Railway @-@ owned Lake Erie District line and the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Lake Shore Subdivision line over the highway . On the other side of the overpasses , NY 75 curves northeastward as it becomes Saint Francis Drive , leaving Camp Road to continue northwestward to the lake as a two @-@ lane street . The route continues on , passing south of Saint Francis High School before ending shortly afterward at a partial interchange with NY 5 . NY 75 northbound merges directly into NY 5 eastbound , a limited @-@ access highway , while NY 75 southbound begins as an offshoot of NY 5 westbound . The remaining connections are made by way of a loop road leading from Big Tree Road , which NY 5 and NY 75 both intersect just south of the interchange . 
 = = History = = 
 All of what is now NY 75 was state @-@ maintained by 1926 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the portion of modern NY 75 north of the village of Hamburg was designated as part of NY 62 , a highway extending from Great Valley north to Buffalo . The section between Collins Center and Eden gained a designation c . 1931 when it became part of NY 18A , an alternate route of then @-@ NY 18 between Collins and Eden . NY 18A overlapped with NY 39 between the hamlets of Collins ( where NY 18A began at NY 18 ) and Collins Center , from where the route followed Sisson Highway north to rejoin NY 18 in Eden . US 62 was extended into New York c . 1932 . As a result , the portion of NY 62 south of the hamlet of Athol Springs was renumbered to NY 75 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway . The remainder of old NY 62 became part of an extended NY 5 . 
 When US 219 was extended into New York c . 1935 , it was overlaid on the pre @-@ existing NY 75 from Great Valley to Hamburg , creating a lengthy overlap with the route . The overlap was eliminated in the late 1930s when NY 75 was truncated on its southern end to the village of Hamburg . Similarly , NY 18A was truncated to Collins Center on its southern end in the 1950s , eliminating its overlap with NY 39 . NY 18 continued to extend south of Niagara County until c . 1962 when it was truncated to begin 35 miles ( 56 km ) north of Hamburg in Lewiston . NY 18A , now separated from its parent route , became an extension of NY 75 , which connected to NY 18A 's former routing by way of an overlap with US 62 between Hamburg and Eden .

 Epstein , who is Jewish , was born in San Diego , California . He was a Parade All @-@ American at Torrey Pines High School and honored as the top kicker in the nation by Prep Football Report and PrepStar College Recruiting . In the 1997 CIF Championship game , he kicked a 58 @-@ yard field goal . Epstein 's 1997 kick was a San Diego section CIF record ( tied with Nate <unk> 's 1995 kick ) until David Quintero posted a 59 @-@ yard kick on September 11 , 2015 . He participated in the July 25 , 1998 47th Annual Shrine All @-@ Star Football Classic of California All @-@ stars against Texas All @-@ stars , but missed two early field goal attempts in a 10 – 5 victory . 
 = = University of Michigan = = 
 Epstein enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1998 and played college football as a placekicker and punter for head coach Lloyd Carr 's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1998 to 2001 . He was successful on 26 of 42 field goals and 85 of 88 extra point attempts . Epstein also averaged 39 @.@ 9 yards on 167 punts ( 50 of which were downed inside the 20 yard line ) at Michigan . He was a two @-@ time finalist for both the Lou Groza and Ray Guy Awards at Michigan , according to some sources , but the University of Michigan seems to only recognize him as Guy Award finalist as a junior in 2000 . 
 Epstein 's freshman season for the 1998 Wolverines was the redshirt 5th year senior season for Michigan placekicker Jay Feely . His only point of the season was a PAT against Eastern Michigan on September 19 . Of Epstein 's 10 career tackles , his only 2 @-@ tackle performance came against Minnesota in the October 31 battle for the Little Brown Jug . Epstein performed punting duties for the team in its final two games against Hawaii and Arkansas ( in the 1999 Florida Citrus Bowl ) , landing 6 of his 9 punts inside the 20 yard line and averaging 40 @.@ 1 yards per punt . Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co @-@ champions with Ohio State and Wisconsin . 
 Jeff Del Verne kicked field goals for the 1999 Wolverines early in the season . In fact , Del Verne led the team in scoring after 5 games . However , on October 9 ( in the team 's sixth game ) , Epstein tied Mike Gillette 's November 19 , 1988 Michigan record for longest field goal with a 56 @-@ yard kick against Michigan State in the Michigan – Michigan State football rivalry game . The kick was the longest ever by a Michigan State opponent at the time . It was the first successful field goal of Epstein 's Michigan career ( following two previous misses ) . On October 30 , 1999 , his 20 @-@ yard field goal with 18 seconds remaining clinched a 34 – 31 victory over Indiana for Michigan . That day would be Epstein 's highest scoring day as a Wolverine ( 2 – 2 FGs and 4 – 4 in PATs ) . The game marked the first time that he handled the placekicking , kickoff and punting responsibilities . Of his seven kickoffs 3 were touchbacks and 3 more were covered inside the 20 . Epstein punted six times , resulting in his first 50 @-@ yard punt and 2 punts landing inside the 20 yard line . For his efforts , he earned his first Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week award . Epstein was the first player to handle placekicking , kickoff and punting responsibilities for Michigan since Mike Gillette in 1988 . In overtime in the January 1 , 2000 Orange Bowl against Alabama , his PAT provided the margin of victory ( after he missed a 36 @-@ yard field goal at the end of regulation time ) . Epstein finished the season with 36 points ( 5 – 8 FGs and 21 – 22 PATs ) and 32 punts for 1282 yards ( 40 @.@ 1 average / 7 inside 20 ) . 
 In 2000 , Epstein and Del Verne split kicking duties ( sometimes in the same game ) . On September 16 , 2000 , Epstein missed a 24 @-@ yard field goal for the 2000 team with 3 : 24 remaining against to UCLA . Although Michigan got back within field goal range , John Navarre was intercepted on the 15 @-@ yard line and the team lost 23 – 20 . In that game , Epstein , who totalled 400 punt yards on 9 attempts , had landed what would become his career high 5 punts inside UCLA 's 20 @-@ yard line and executed his first career 60 @-@ yard punt . On October 14 , he executed a 67 @-@ yard punt that was downed inside the 20 @-@ yard line and became his career long against Indiana . On November 4 , Epstein was thwarted on an attempt to tie the game at the end of regulation when a 57 @-@ yard field goal attempt went through the hands of his holder against Northwestern in a 54 – 51 loss after Northwestern scored a go @-@ ahead touchdown with 20 seconds left . Earlier in the game , he had completed a 6 @-@ yard forward pass and a 52 @-@ yard field goal . On November 18 against Ohio State in the Michigan – Ohio State football rivalry game , Epstein scored 8 points ( a 25 @-@ yard field goal and 5 PATs ) . He dropped 3 of his 6 punts inside the 20 yard line and posted a touchback when kicking off to Ohio State with 1 : 18 remaining to force them to attempt to drive from their own 20 . He earned his second Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition . Epstein finished the season with 50 points ( 8 – 14 FGs and 26 – 28 PATs ) and 55 punts for 2224 yards ( 40 @.@ 4 average / 19 inside 20 ) . He earned All @-@ Big Ten Conference honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter and placekicker . Epstein was one of 10 finalists for the inaugural Ray Guy Award . Michigan finished the season as Big Ten Co @-@ champions with Purdue and Northwestern . 
 When Epstein 's field goal attempt for the 2001 Wolverines was blocked on September 8 with 9 : 11 remaining against Washington and run back for a touchdown , it gave the Huskies a lead that they would not relinquish on the way to a 23 – 18 game . Epstein made a 51 @-@ yard field goal against Iowa on October 27 to give Michigan a 6 @-@ point lead with 3 : 57 remaining . The 32 – 26 score held up . He posted a school record 57 @-@ yard field goal against Michigan State in the November 3 , 2001 Michigan – Michigan State football rivalry game known as <unk> . However , later in the game , Epstein 's short punt and two Michigan penalties , made way for Michigan State 's controversial game @-@ winning drive . He made the game @-@ winning 31 @-@ yard field goal against the Wisconsin on November 17 , 2001 with 10 seconds left . Epstein set up the field goal when his punt bounced off of Badger Brett Bell and was recovered by Brandon Williams with 14 seconds left . In the game 3 of his 8 punts were downed inside the 20 yard line , including a 48 @-@ yarder that was downed on the 1 @-@ yard @-@ line to set up Michigan 's first score . 3 of his 5 kickoffs were touchbacks and a fourth one into the end zone was just returned 15 yards . Epstein 's performance earned him Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition and his 8 points ( 2 FGs and 2 PATs ) gave him the team scoring lead with 69 points . He finished the season with 76 points ( 13 – 20 FGs and 37 – 37 PATs ) and 71 punts for <unk> yards ( 39 @.@ 3 average / 17 inside 20 ) . Epstein 's single @-@ season punt yardage total was a school record that was surpassed the following season by Adam Finley . His 76 points just edged out B. J. Askew 's 72 points and Marquise Walker 's 68 points . Epstein earned All @-@ Big Ten Conference second team honors as a placekicker from the coaches and honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter . He concluded his career by making 2 field goals in the January 26 , 2002 Senior Bowl .

 Epstein was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2002 NFL Draft and played in six games with the Jaguars in the 2002 NFL season before being picked up off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on October 23 , 2002 , where he was a kickoff specialist for the remainder of the season . Epstein tore his anterior cruciate ligament with one week remaining in the 2002 season and had offseason surgery . Despite being reactivated during the 2003 preseason , he was released before the 2003 season . 43 @-@ year @-@ old Gary Anderson performed the PATs and field goals for the 2002 Vikings .

As a Jaguar , Epstein made 5 out of 9 field goals ( with a long of 34 yards ) and 13 PATs . He was 0 – 4 on field goals of 39 yards or longer . Of his 72 career kickoffs , 10 of them were touchbacks and his average distance was 61 @.@ 7 yards . After Epstein was released , the Jaguars continued to have troubles as his successor Tim Seder was cut five games later . 8 of Epstein 's 28 career points came in a 28 – 25 October 6 , 2002 Jacksonville victory over Philadelphia . He was 2 @-@ for @-@ 2 on both field goals and PATs . 
 The Denver Broncos signed Epstein in February 2004 and assigned him to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe . He was released in September 2004 . He was the punter and performed kickoffs for the World Bowl XII champion 2004 Thunder team , although Jonathan Ruffin performed field goal attempts for them .

He appeared in four regular season games for Edmonton , made 8 of 12 field goal attempts and punted 16 times for an average of 41 yards ( 37 m ) but that record and especially a blocked kick on September 18 , his final game for the Eskimos , resulted in his release on September 29 . Edmonton would go on to win the 93rd Grey Cup . The Houston Texans signed him in January 2006 and assigned him to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe . He was released in May 2006 . On February 6 , 2008 , Hayden Epstein signed back on with the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL , but he was released again on April 28 .

 = Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus = 
 The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus ( Greek : <unk> Δημοκρατία τῆς <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> tis <unk> <unk> ) was a short @-@ lived , self @-@ governing entity founded in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars on February 28 , 1914 by Greeks living in southern Albania ( Northern Epirotes ) . 
 The area , known as Northern Epirus ( <unk> <unk> ) to Greeks and with a substantial Greek population , was taken by the Greek Army from the Ottoman Empire during the First Balkan War ( 1912 – 1913 ) . The Protocol of Florence however , had assigned it to the newly established Albanian state . This decision was rejected by the local Greeks , and as the Greek army withdrew to the new border , an autonomous government was set up at Argyrokastron ( Greek : <unk> , today Gjirokastër ) , under the leadership of Georgios Christakis @-@ Zografos , a distinguished local Greek politician and former Minister of Foreign Affairs , and with tacit support from Greece . 
 In May , the autonomy was confirmed by the Great Powers with the Protocol of Corfu . The agreement ensured that the region would have its own administration , recognized the rights of the local population and provided for self @-@ government under nominal Albanian sovereignty . However , it was never implemented because in August the Albanian government collapsed . The Greek Army reoccupied the area in October 1914 following the outbreak of World War I. It was planned that Northern Epirus would be ceded to Greece following the war , but withdrawal of Italian support and Greece 's defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign resulted in its final cession to Albania in November 1921 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Northern Epirus and the Balkan Wars = = = 
 In March 1913 , during the First Balkan War , the Greek Army entered Ioannina after breaching the Ottoman fortifications at Bizani , and soon afterwards advanced further north . Himarë had already been under Greek control since 5 November 1912 , after a local <unk> , Gendarmerie Major Spyros <unk> , led a successful uprising that met no initial resistance . By the end of the war , Greek armed forces controlled most of the historical region of Epirus , from the <unk> mountains along the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa in the east . 
 At the same time , the Albanian independence movement gathered momentum . On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë , Ismail <unk> declared Albania 's independence , and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority only in the immediate area of Vlorë . Elsewhere , the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës , while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler . Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time , by the Greeks in the south and the Serbs in the north . 
 The last Ottoman census , conducted in 1908 , counted 128 @,@ 000 Orthodox Christians and 95 @,@ 000 Muslims in the region . Of the Orthodox population , an estimated 30 @,@ 000 to 47 @,@ 000 spoke Greek exclusively . The rest of the Orthodox community spoke an Albanian patois at home , but was literate only in Greek , which was used in cultural , trading and economic activities . Moreover , they expressed a strong pro @-@ Greek feeling , and were the first to support the following breakaway autonomist movement . Considering these conditions , loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy , whose leaders were mostly Muslim , could not be guaranteed . 
 = = = <unk> of the Greek – Albanian border = = = 
 The concept of an independent Albanian state was supported by the Great European Powers , particularly Austro @-@ Hungary and Italy . Both powers were seeking to control Albania , which , in the words of Italian Foreign Minister Tommaso <unk> , would give whichever managed this " incontestable supremacy in the Adriatic " . The Serbian possession of Shkodër and the possibility of the Greek border running a few miles south of Vlore was therefore strongly resisted by these states . 
 In September 1913 , an International Commission of the European Powers convened to determine the boundary between Greece and Albania . The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps : those of Italy and Austro @-@ Hungary insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian , while those of the Triple Entente ( the United Kingdom , France , and Russia ) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian , the younger generation was Greek in intellectual outlook , sentiment , and aspirations . Under Italian and Austro @-@ Hungarian pressure , the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania . 
 = = = Protocol of Florence = = = 
 With the delineation of the exact boundaries of the new state , the region of Northern Epirus was awarded to Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Florence , signed on 17 December 1913 . On 21 February 1914 , the ambassadors of the Great Powers delivered a note to the Greek government asking for the Greek army 's evacuation of the area . Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos acceded to this in hopes of a favorable solution to Greece 's other outstanding problem : the recognition of Greek sovereignty over the islands of the North Eastern Aegean . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 = = = Declaration of Independence = = = 
 This turn of events was highly unpopular among the pro @-@ Greek party in the area . The pro @-@ Greek Epirotes felt betrayed by the Greek government , which had done nothing to support them with firearms . Additionally , the gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable Albanian forces to take control of the region . To avert this possibility , the Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self @-@ governance . Georgios Christakis @-@ Zografos , a distinguished Epirote statesman from Lunxhëri ( gr . <unk> ) and former Greek foreign minister , took the initiative and discussed the situation with local representatives in a " Panepirotic Council " . Consequently , on 28 February 1914 , the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was declared in Gjirokastër ( gr . <unk> ) and a provisional government , with Christakis @-@ Zografos as president , formed to support the state 's objectives . In his speech on 2 March , Christakis @-@ Zografos stated that the aspirations of the Northern Epirotes had been totally ignored , and that the Great Powers had not only rejected their becoming autonomous within the Albanian state but also refused to give guarantees regarding their fundamental human rights . Zografos concluded his speech by stating that the Northern Epirotes would not accept the destiny the Powers had imposed upon them : 
 The flag of the new state was a variant of the Greek national flag , consisting of a white cross centered upon the blue background surmounted by the imperial Byzantine eagle in black . 
 In the following days , Alexandros <unk> , Zografos ' nephew and a MP for Arta , was installed as foreign minister . Colonel Dimitrios <unk> , a local from <unk> , resigned from his post in the Greek army and joined the provisional government as minister of military affairs . Within a few days , he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5 @,@ 000 volunteer troops . The local bishop , <unk> of <unk> , took office as minister of Religion and Justice . A number of officers of Epirote origin ( not exceeding 30 ) , as well as ordinary soldiers , deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries . Soon , armed groups , such as the " Sacred Band " or <unk> ' men around Himarë ( gr . <unk> ) , were formed in order to repel any incursion into the territory claimed by the autonomous government . The first districts to join the autonomist movement outside of Gjirokastër were Himarë , Sarandë and <unk> . 
 = = = Greece ’ s reaction and evacuation = = = 
 The Greek government was reluctant to overtly support the uprising . Military and political officials continued to carry out a slow evacuation process , which had begun in March and ended on 28 April . Resistance was officially discouraged , and assurances were given that the Great Powers and the International Control Commission ( an organization founded by the Great Powers in order to secure peace and stability in the area ) would guarantee their rights . Following the declaration in Gjirokastër , Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Korçë ( gr . <unk> ) asking them to join the movement ; however , the Greek military commander of the city , Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis , followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law , threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag . When the local bishop of <unk> ( gr . <unk> ) , Spyridon , proclaimed the Autonomy , Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled . 
 On March 1 , Kontoulis ceded the region to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie , consisting mainly of former deserters of the Ottoman army and under the command of Dutch and Austrian officers . On March 9 , the Greek navy blockaded the port of Sarandë ( gr . <unk> <unk> , known also as Santi Quaranta ) , one of the first cities that had joined the autonomist movement . There were also sporadic conflicts between Greek army and Epirote units , with a few casualties on both sides . 
 = = = Negotiations and armed conflicts = = = 
 As the Greek army withdrew , armed conflicts broke out between Albanian and Northern Epirote forces . In the regions of Himarë , Sarandë , Gjirokastër and Delvinë ( gr . <unk> ) , the revolt had been in full force since the first days of the declaration , and the autonomist forces were able to successfully engage the Albanian gendarmerie , as well as Albanian irregular units . However , Zografos , seeing that the Great Powers would not approve the annexation of Northern Epirus to Greece , suggested three possible diplomatic solutions : 
 full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Albanian prince ; 
 an administrative and cantonal system autonomy ; and 
 direct control and administration by the European Powers . 
 On March 7 , Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania , and intense fighting occurred north of Gjirokastër , in the region of <unk> , in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus ; Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate <unk> , facing resistance from the Epirotes . On March 11 , a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson . Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government , but <unk> insisted on complete autonomy , a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates , and negotiations reached a deadlock . Meanwhile , Epirote bands entered <unk> and continued on to <unk> and Korçë . 
 At this point , the entire region that had been claimed by the provisional government , with the exception of Korçë , was under its control . On March 22 , a Sacred Band unit from <unk> reached the outskirts of Korçë and joined the local guerillas , and fierce street fighting took place . For several days , Northern Epirote units controlled the city , but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements . 
 The International Control Commission , in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results , decided to intervene . On May 6 , Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis . Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day . By the time the cease @-@ fire order was received , the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë , making the city 's Albanian garrison 's surrender imminent .

 = = = Protocol of Corfu = = = 
 Negotiations were carried out on the island of Corfu , where on 17 May 1914 Albanian and Epirote representatives signed an agreement known as the Protocol of Corfu . According to its terms , the two provinces of Korçë and Gjirokastër that constituted Northern Epirus would acquire complete autonomous existence ( as a corpus separatum ) under the nominal Albanian sovereignty of Prince Wied . The Albanian government had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper @-@ rank officials , taking into account as much as possible the opinion of the local population . Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie and the prohibition of military levies from people not indigenous to the region . In Orthodox schools , the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction , with the exception of the first three classes . The use of the Greek language was made equal to Albanian in all public affairs . The Ottoman @-@ era privileges of Himarë were renewed , and a foreigner was to be appointed as its " captain " for 10 years . 
 The execution of and adherence to the Protocol was entrusted to the International Control Commission , as was the organization of public administration and the departments of justice and finance in the region . The creation and training of the local gendarmerie was to be conducted by Dutch officers . 
 Territory : All the provisions in question shall apply to the populations of the territories previously occupied by Greece and annexed to <unk> Forces : Except in case of war or revolution , non @-@ native military units shall not be transferred to or employed in these <unk> : The International Control Commission ( I.C.C. ) will take possession in the territory in question , in the name of the Albanian Government , by proceeding to the place . The officers of the Dutch mission will at once begin the organization of the local gendarmerie ... Before the arrival of the Dutch officers , the necessary steps will be taken by the Provisional Government of Argyrokastro for the removal of the country of all armed foreign elements . These provisions will not only be applied in that part of the provinces of Korytsa now occupied militarily by Albania , but in any other southern <unk> of language : The permission to use both Albanian and Greek shall be assured , before all authorities , including the Courts , as well as the elective <unk> : The Powers who , by the Conference of London , have guaranteed the institution of Albania and established the I.C.C. guarantee the execution and maintenance of the foregoing provisions . 
 The agreement of the Protocol was ratified by the representatives of the Great Powers at Athens on 18 June and by the Albanian government on 23 June . The Epirote representatives , in an assembly in Delvinë , gave the final approval to the terms of the Protocol , although the delegates from Himara protested , claiming that union with Greece was the only viable solution . On July 8 , control of the cities of Tepelenë and Korçë passed to the provisional government of Northern Epirus . 
 = = = Instability and disestablishment = = = 
 After the outbreak of World War I , the situation in Albania became unstable , and political chaos emerged as the country was split into a number of regional governments . As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania , sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu 's ratification , and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country . In the following days , an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government , managing to capture its citadel for several days , while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small @-@ scale armed operations . 
 These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos , as well as the possibility that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania , triggering a wider conflict . On 27 October , after receiving the approval of the Great Powers , the Greek Army 's V Army Corps entered the area for a second time . The provisional government formally ceased to exist , declaring that it had accomplished its objectives .

 = = = Greek administration ( October 1914 – September 1916 ) = = = 
 During the Greek administration at the time of the First World War , it had been agreed to by Greece , Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue would be left for the post @-@ war future . In August 1915 , Eleftherios Venizelos stated in the Greek parliament that " only colossal faults " could separate the region from Greece . Upon Venizelos ' resignation in December , however , the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and <unk> the region 's future by formally incorporating it into the Greek state . In the first months of 1916 , Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives to the Greek Parliament . In March , the region 's union with Greece was officially declared , and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa . 
 = = = Italian – French occupation and Interwar period = = = 
 The politically unstable situation that followed in Greece during the next months , with the National Schism between royalists and Venizelos ’ supporters , divided Greece into two states . This situation , according also to the development of the Balkan Front , led Italian forces in Gjirokastër to enter the area in September 1916 , after gaining the approval of the Triple Entente , and to take over most of Northern Epirus . An exception was Korçë which was retaken by French forces from Bulgarian occupation , and turned into the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army . After the war 's end in 1918 , the tendency to reestablish the autonomy of the region continued . 
 Under the terms of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 ( the Venizelos @-@ <unk> agreement ) , Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece , but political developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco @-@ Turkish War ( 1919 – 1922 ) and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921 . 
 In February 1922 , the Albanian Parliament approved the Declaration of Minority Rights . However , the Declaration , contrary to the Protocol of Corfu , recognized minority rights only in a limited area ( parts of Gjirokastër , Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë ) , without implementing any form of local autonomy . All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935 , in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations . In 1925 , Albania 's present borders were set , leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus . 
 = = The Northern Epirote issue and the autonomy question = = 
 From the Albanian perspective , adopted also by Italian and Austrian sources of that time , the Northern Epirote movement was directly supported by the Greek state , with the help of a minority of inhabitants in the region , resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania . In Albanian historiography , the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers ' disregard for Albania 's national integrity . 
 With the ratification of the Protocol of Corfu , the term " Northern Epirus " , the state ’ s common name — and consequently that of its citizens , " Northern Epirotes " — acquired official status . However , after the region 's cession to Albania , these terms were considered associated with Greek irredentist action and not granted legal status by the Albanian authorities ; anyone making use of them was persecuted as an enemy of the state . 
 The autonomy question remains on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian @-@ Greek relations as part of the Northern Epirote issue . In 1925 , Albania 's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence , and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus . In the 1960s , Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority , with no results . In 1991 , after the collapse of the communist regime in Albania , the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus , on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious . This proposal was rejected , spurring the minority 's radical wing to call for a union with Greece . Two years later , Omonoia ’ s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders , based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu . In 1997 , Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority @-@ inspired breakaway Republic still exists .

 = Halifax Explosion = 
 The Halifax Explosion was a maritime disaster in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , on the morning of 6 December 1917 . SS Mont @-@ Blanc , a French cargo ship laden with high explosives , collided with the Norwegian vessel SS Imo in the Narrows , a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin . A fire on board the French ship ignited her cargo , causing a large explosion that devastated the Richmond district of Halifax . Approximately 2 @,@ 000 people were killed by blast , debris , fires and collapsed buildings , and an estimated 9 @,@ 000 others were injured . 
 Mont @-@ Blanc was under orders from the French government to carry her cargo of high explosives from New York via Halifax to Bordeaux , France . At roughly 8 : 45 am , she collided at low speed – approximately one knot ( 1 to 1 @.@ 5 miles per hour or 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 kilometres per hour ) – with the unladen Imo , chartered by the Commission for Relief in Belgium to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York . The resulting fire aboard the French ship quickly grew out of control . Approximately 20 minutes later at 9 : 04 : 35 am , Mont @-@ Blanc exploded . The blast was the largest man @-@ made explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons , releasing the equivalent energy of roughly 2 @.@ 9 kilotons of TNT . 
 Nearly all structures within an 800 @-@ metre ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) radius , including the entire community of Richmond , were obliterated . A pressure wave snapped trees , bent iron rails , demolished buildings , grounded vessels , and scattered fragments of the Mont @-@ Blanc for kilometres . Hardly a window in the city proper survived the blast . Across the harbour , in Dartmouth , there was also widespread damage . A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi 'kmaq First Nations people who had lived in the Tuft 's Cove area for generations . 
 Relief efforts began almost immediately , and hospitals quickly became full . Rescue trains began arriving from across eastern Canada and the north @-@ eastern United States , but were impeded by a blizzard . Construction of temporary shelters to house the many people left homeless began soon after the disaster . The initial judicial inquiry found the Mont @-@ Blanc to have been responsible for the disaster , but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame . There are several memorials to the victims of the explosion in North End . 
 = = Background = = 
 The community of Dartmouth lies on the east shore of Halifax Harbour , while Halifax is on the west shore . Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war ; the harbour was one of the British Royal Navy 's most important bases in North America , a centre for wartime trade , and a home to privateers who harried the British Empire 's enemies during the American Revolution , the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 . The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area , but Halifax faced an economic downturn after the British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906 . 
 After 1906 , the Canadian Government took over the Halifax Dockyard ( now CFB Halifax ) from the Royal Navy . This dockyard later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910 . Just before the First World War , the Canadian government began to make a determined , costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities . The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence . As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own , the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re @-@ adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations . In 1915 , management of the harbour fell under the control of the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin ; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax , including patrol ships , tugboats , and minesweepers . 
 The population of Halifax / Dartmouth had increased to between 60 @,@ 000 and 65 @,@ 000 people by 1917 . Convoys carried soldiers , men , animals and supplies to the European theatre of war . The two main points of departure were in Nova Scotia at Sydney in Cape Breton and Halifax . Hospital ships brought the wounded to the city , and a new military hospital was constructed in the city . 
 The success of German U @-@ boat attacks on ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean led the Allies to institute a convoy system to reduce losses while transporting goods and soldiers to Europe . Merchant ships gathered at Bedford Basin on the northwestern end of the harbour , which was protected by two sets of anti @-@ submarine nets and guarded by patrol ships of the Royal Canadian Navy . The convoys departed under the protection of British cruisers and destroyers . A large army garrison protected the city with forts , gun batteries , and anti @-@ submarine nets . These factors drove a major military , industrial and residential expansion of the city , while the weight of goods passing through the harbour increased nearly ninefold . All neutral ships , bound for ports in North America , were required to report to Halifax for inspection . 
 = = Disaster = = 
 The Norwegian ship SS Imo had sailed from the Netherlands en route to New York to take on relief supplies for Belgium , under the command of Haakon From . The ship arrived in Halifax on 3 December for neutral inspection and spent two days in Bedford Basin awaiting refuelling supplies . Though given clearance to leave the port on 5 December , Imo 's departure was delayed as her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon . The loading of fuel was not completed until after the anti @-@ submarine nets had been raised for the night . Therefore , the vessel could not weigh anchor until the next morning . 
 The French cargo ship SS Mont @-@ Blanc arrived from New York late on 5 December , under the command of Aimé Le <unk> . The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid , the highly flammable fuel benzole , and guncotton . She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe , but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised . Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war , but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations . 
 Navigating into or out of Bedford Basin required passage through a strait called the Narrows . Ships were expected to keep to the starboard ( right ) side of the channel as they passed oncoming traffic ; in other words , vessels were required to pass port to port . Ships were restricted to a speed of five knots within the harbour . 
 = = = Collision and fire = = = 
 Imo was granted clearance to leave Bedford Basin by signals from the guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7 : 30 on the morning of 6 December , with Pilot William Hayes aboard . The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour 's speed limit in an attempt to make up for the delay experienced in loading her cargo . Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong ( western ) side of the harbour . The pilots agreed to pass starboard to starboard . Soon afterwards though , Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris , which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid @-@ channel . Horatio Brannen , the captain of Stella Maris , saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident . 
 Francis Mackey , an experienced harbour pilot , had boarded the Mont @-@ Blanc on the evening of 5 December ; he had asked about " special protections " such as a guard ship given the Mont @-@ Blanc 's cargo , but no protections were put in place . The Mont @-@ Blanc started moving at 7 : 30 am on 6 December , heading towards Bedford Basin . Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area . He first spotted Imo when she was about 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship 's starboard side , as if to cut him off his own course . Mackey gave a short blast of his ship 's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way , but was met with two short blasts from the Imo , indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position . The captain ordered Mont @-@ Blanc to halt its engines and angle slightly to starboard , closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows . He let out another single blast of his whistle , hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard , but was again met with a double @-@ blast in negation . 
 Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and , realizing that a collision was imminent , gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont @-@ Blanc . Though both ships had cut their engines by this point , their momentum carried them right on top of each other at slow speed . Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo , Mackey ordered Mont @-@ Blanc to steer hard to port ( starboard helm ) and crossed the Norwegian ship 's bows in a last @-@ second bid to avoid a collision . The two ships were almost parallel to each other , when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts , indicating the ship was reversing its engines . The combination of the <unk> ship 's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right @-@ hand propeller caused the ship 's head to swing into Mont @-@ Blanc . Imo 's prow pushed into the French vessel 's No. 1 hold on her starboard side . 
 The collision occurred at 8 : 45 am . While the damage to Mont Blanc was not severe , it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold . As Imo 's engines kicked in , she quickly disengaged , which created sparks inside Mont @-@ Blanc 's hull . These ignited the vapours from the benzol . A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont @-@ Blanc 's decks . The fire quickly became uncontrollable . Surrounded by thick black smoke , and fearing she would explode almost immediately , the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship . A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire . The frantic crew of Mont @-@ Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode , but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion . As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore , the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street . 
 Towing two <unk> at the time of the collision , Stella Maris responded immediately to the fire , anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6 . The tug 's captain , Horatio H. Brannen , and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc . They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe . Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship 's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire . The five @-@ inch ( 127 @-@ millimetre ) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten @-@ inch ( 254 @-@ millimetre ) hawser came down . It was at this point that the blast occurred . 
 = = = Explosion = = = 
 At 9 : 04 : 35 am , the out @-@ of @-@ control fire aboard Mont @-@ Blanc finally set off her highly explosive cargo . The ship was completely blown apart and a powerful blast wave radiated away from the explosion at more than 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) per second . Temperatures of 5 @,@ 000 ° C ( 9 @,@ 030 ° F ) and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at the centre of the explosion . White @-@ hot shards of iron fell down upon Halifax and Dartmouth . Mont @-@ Blanc 's forward 90 mm gun , its barrel melted away , landed approximately 5 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) north of the explosion site near Albro Lake in Dartmouth , while the shank of her anchor , weighing half a ton , landed 3 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) south at Armdale . 
 A cloud of white smoke rose to over 3 @,@ 600 metres ( 11 @,@ 800 ft ) . The shock wave from the blast travelled through the earth at nearly 23 times the speed of sound and was felt as far away as Cape Breton ( 207 kilometres or 129 miles ) and Prince Edward Island ( 180 kilometres or 110 miles ) . An area of over 160 hectares ( 400 acres ) was completely destroyed by the explosion , while the harbour floor was momentarily exposed by the volume of water that vaporized . A tsunami was formed by water surging in to fill the void ; it rose as high as 18 metres ( 60 ft ) above the high @-@ water mark on the Halifax side of the harbour . Imo was carried onto the shore at Dartmouth by the tsunami . The blast killed all save one aboard the whaler , everyone aboard the pinnace and 21 of the 26 men aboard Stella Maris ; she ended up on the Dartmouth shore , severely damaged . The captain 's son , First Mate Walter Brannen , who had been thrown into the hold by the blast , survived , as did four others . All but one of the Mont @-@ Blanc crew members survived . 
 Over 1 @,@ 600 people were killed instantly and 9 @,@ 000 were injured , more than 300 of whom later died . Every building within a 2 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) radius , over 12 @,@ 000 in total , was destroyed or badly damaged . Hundreds of people who had been watching the fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them . <unk> and lamps overturned by the force of the blast sparked fires throughout Halifax , particularly in the North End , where entire city blocks were caught up in the inferno , trapping residents inside their houses . Firefighter Billy Wells , who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body , described the devastation survivors faced : " The sight was awful , with people hanging out of windows dead . Some with their heads missing , and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires . " He was the only member of the eight @-@ man crew of the fire engine " Patricia " to survive . 
 Large brick and stone factories near Pier 6 , such as the Acadia Sugar Refinery , disappeared into unrecognizable heaps of rubble , killing most of their workers . The Nova Scotia cotton mill located 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 93 mile ) from the blast was destroyed by fire and the collapse of its concrete floors . The Royal Naval College of Canada building was badly damaged , and several cadets and instructors maimed . 
 The death toll could have been worse had it not been for the self @-@ sacrifice of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher , Patrick Vincent ( Vince ) Coleman , operating at the railyard about 750 feet ( 230 m ) from Pier 6 , where the explosion occurred . He and his co @-@ worker , William Lovett , learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning Mont @-@ Blanc from a sailor and began to flee . Coleman remembered , however , that an incoming passenger train from Saint John , New Brunswick , was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes . He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train . Several variations of the message have been reported , among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic : " Hold up the train . Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode . Guess this will be my last message . Good @-@ bye boys . " Coleman 's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt . It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway , helping railway officials to respond immediately . Passenger Train No. 10 , the overnight train from Saint John , is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham , saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers . Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city . He was honoured with a Heritage Minute in the 1990s and inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004 . 
 = = Rescue efforts = = 
 First rescue efforts came from surviving neighbours and co @-@ workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings . The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen , firefighters and military personnel who began to arrive , as did anyone with a working vehicle ; cars , trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded . A flood of victims soon began to arrive at the city 's hospitals , which were quickly overwhelmed . The new military hospital , Camp Hill , admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December . 
 Firefighters were among the first to respond to the disaster , rushing to Mont @-@ Blanc to attempt to extinguish the blaze before the explosion even occurred . They also played a role after the blast , with fire companies arriving to assist from across Halifax , and by the end of the day from as far away as Amherst , Nova Scotia ( 200 kilometres or 120 miles ) and Moncton , New Brunswick ( 260 kilometres or 160 miles ) on relief trains . Halifax Fire Department 's West Street Station 2 was the first to arrive at Pier 6 with the crew of the Patricia , the first motorized fire engine in Canada . In the final moments before the explosion , hoses were being unrolled as the fire spread to the docks . Nine members of the Halifax Fire Department lost their lives performing their duty that day . 
 Royal Navy cruisers in port sent some of the first organized rescue parties ashore . HMS Highflyer , along with the armed merchant cruisers HMS <unk> , HMS Knight Templar and HMS Calgarian , sent boats ashore with rescue parties and medical personnel and soon began to take wounded aboard . A US Coast Guard cutter , USCG Morrill , also sent a rescue party ashore . Out at sea , the American cruiser USS Tacoma and armed merchant cruiser USS Von Steuben ( formerly SS Kronprinz Wilhelm ) were passing Halifax en route to the United States . Tacoma was rocked so severely by the blast wave that her crew went to general quarters . Spotting the large and rising column of smoke , Tacoma altered course and arrived to assist rescue at 2 pm . Von Steuben arrived a half @-@ hour later . The American steamship Old Colony , docked in Halifax for repairs , suffered little damage and was quickly converted to serve as a hospital ship , staffed by doctors and orderlies from the British and American navy vessels in the harbour . 
 Dazed survivors immediately feared that the explosion was the result of a bomb dropped from a German plane . Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack , but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined . All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city 's hospitals , including the two army hospitals in the city . 
 Adding to the chaos were fears that a second explosion was imminent . A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine . While the fire was quickly put out , the cloud of steam was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that a second explosion was imminent . Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area . As the rumour spread across the city , many families fled their homes . The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon . However , many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour . 
 Surviving railway workers in the railyards at the heart of the disaster carried out rescue work , pulling people from the harbour and from under debris . The overnight train from Saint John was just approaching the city when hit by the blast but was only slightly damaged . It continued into Richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage . Passengers and soldiers aboard used the emergency tools from the train to dig people out of houses and bandaged them with sheets from the sleeping cars . The train was loaded with injured and left the city at 1 : 30 with a doctor aboard , to evacuate the wounded to Truro . 
 Led by Lieutenant Governor MacCallum Grant , leading citizens formed the Halifax Relief Commission at around noon . The committee organized members in charge of organizing medical relief for both Halifax and Dartmouth , supplying transportation , food and shelter , and covering medical and funeral costs for victims . The commission would continue until 1976 , participating in reconstruction and relief efforts and later distributing pensions to survivors . 
 Rescue trains were dispatched from across Atlantic Canada , as well as the northeastern United States . The first left Truro around 10 am carrying medical personnel and supplies , arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3 pm . The track had become impassable at Rockingham , on the western edge of Bedford Basin . To reach the wounded , rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets . By nightfall , a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro , Kentville , Amherst and <unk> and from the New Brunswick towns of Sackville , Moncton and Saint John . 
 Relief efforts were hampered the following day by a blizzard that blanketed Halifax with 16 inches ( 41 cm ) of heavy snow . Trains en route from other parts of Canada and from the United States were stalled in snowdrifts , while telegraph lines that had been hastily repaired following the explosion were again knocked down . Halifax was isolated by the storm , and rescue committees were forced to suspend the search for survivors , though the storm aided efforts to put out fires throughout the city . 
 = = Destruction and loss of life = = 
 The exact number killed by the disaster is unknown . The Halifax Explosion Remembrance Book , an official database compiled in 2002 by the Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management , identified 1 @,@ 950 victims . As many as 1 @,@ 600 people died immediately in the blast , tsunami , and collapse of buildings . The last body , a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds , was not recovered until the summer of 1919 . An additional 9 @,@ 000 were injured . 1 @,@ 630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires , and another 12 @,@ 000 damaged ; roughly 6 @,@ 000 people were left homeless and 25 @,@ 000 had insufficient shelter . The city 's industrial sector was in large part gone , with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged . 
 A mortuary committee chaired by Alderman R. B. Coldwell was quickly formed at Halifax City Hall on the morning of the disaster . The <unk> Road School in Halifax 's west end was chosen as a central morgue . A company of the Royal Canadian Engineers ( RCE ) repaired and converted the basement of the school to serve as a morgue and classrooms to serve as offices for the Halifax coroner . Trucks and wagons soon began to arrive with bodies . Coroner Arthur S. <unk> took over from Coldwell as the morgue went into operation and implemented a system to carefully number and describe bodies ; it was based on the system developed by his father , John Henry <unk> , to identify Titanic victims in 1912 . 
 Many of the wounds inflicted by the blast were permanently debilitating , such as those caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion . Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour , many from inside buildings , leaving them directly in the path of glass fragments from shattered windows . Roughly 5900 eye injuries were reported , and 41 people lost their sight permanently . The many eye injuries led to better understanding on the part of physicians of how to care for damaged eyes , and " with the recently formed Canadian National Institute for the Blind , Halifax became internationally known as a centre for care for the blind " , according to Dalhousie University professor Victoria Allen . The lack of coordinated pediatric care in such a disaster was also noted by a surgeon from Boston named William Ladd who had arrived to help . His insights from the explosion are generally credited with inspiring him to pioneer the specialty of pediatric surgery in North America . 
 An estimated $ C35 million in damages resulted ( $ 562 million today ) . About $ 30 million in financial aid was raised from various sources , including $ 18 million from the federal government , over $ 4 million from the British government , and $ 750 @,@ 000 from the state of Massachusetts . 
 = = = Dartmouth = = = 
 Dartmouth was not as densely populated as Halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour , but still suffered heavy damage . Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side . Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed , including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company . Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of the victims were treated there . 
 = = = Mi 'kmaq settlement = = = 
 There were small enclaves of Mi 'kmaq in and around the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore . Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in Tufts Cove , also known as Turtle Grove . The settlement , dating back to the 18th century , had been a subject of controversy because white settler landowners wanted to remove the Mi 'kmaq residents . In the years and months preceding the explosion , the Department of Indian Affairs had been actively trying to force the Mi 'kmaq to give up their land , though this had not occurred by the time of the explosion . The fire aboard Mont @-@ Blanc drew the attention of many onlookers on both sides of the harbour . The physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami . While a precise Mi 'kmaq death toll is unknown , records show that nine bodies were recovered , and the settlement was abandoned in the wake of the disaster . Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia . 
 = = = Africville = = = 
 The black community of Africville , on the southern shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula , was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south . However , Africville 's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion . Families recorded the deaths of five residents . Africville received little of the donated relief funds and none of the progressive reconstruction invested in other parts of the city after the explosion . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Many people in Halifax at first believed the explosion to be the result of a German attack . The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time , for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion . While John Johansen , the Norwegian helmsman of the Imo , was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion , it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously . Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person , supposedly written in German . It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian . Immediately following the explosion , most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned . Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known , although rumours of German involvement persisted . 
 A judicial inquiry known as the Wreck Commissioner 's Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision . Proceedings began at the Halifax Court House on 13 December 1917 , presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale . The inquiry 's report of 4 February 1918 blamed Mont @-@ Blanc 's captain , Aimé Le <unk> , the ship 's pilot , Francis Mackey , and Commander F. Evan Wyatt , the Royal Canadian Navy 's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour , gates and anti @-@ submarine defences , for causing the collision . Drysdale agreed with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L.A. Demers ' opinion that " it was the Mont @-@ Blanc 's responsibility alone to ensure that she avoided a collision at all costs " given her cargo ; he was likely influenced by local opinion , which was strongly anti @-@ French , as well as by the " street fighter " style of argumentation used by Imo lawyer Charles Burchell . According to Crown counsel W.A. Henry , this was " a great surprise to most people " , who had expected the Imo to be blamed for being on the wrong side of the channel . All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod , and bound over for trial . However , a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice , Benjamin Russell found there was no evidence to support these charges . Mackey was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus and the charges dropped . The charges against Le <unk> were also dismissed . This left only Wyatt to face a grand jury hearing . On 17 April 1918 , a jury acquitted him in a trial that lasted less than a day . 
 Drysdale also oversaw the first civil litigation trial , in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other . His decision ( 27 April 1918 ) found Mont @-@ Blanc entirely at fault . Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada ( 19 May 1919 ) , and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London ( 22 March 1920 ) , determined Mont @-@ Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision . No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 Efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris , repair buildings , and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion . By late January 1918 , around 5 @,@ 000 were still without shelter . A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units , which were furnished by the Massachusetts @-@ Halifax Relief Fund . 
 The North End Halifax neighbourhood of Richmond bore the brunt of the explosion . In 1917 , Richmond was considered a working @-@ class neighbourhood and had few paved roads . After the explosion , the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city 's North End . English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond . Adams , inspired by the Victorian garden city movement , aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low @-@ rise , low @-@ density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood . The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree @-@ lined , paved boulevard . They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material , blocks of compressed cement called <unk> . The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919 . Once finished , the <unk> neighbourhood consisted of homes , businesses and parks , which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax . It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district . In contrast , the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts . 
 Every building in the Halifax dockyard required some degree of rebuilding , as did HMCS Niobe and the docks themselves ; however , all of the Royal Canadian Navy 's minesweepers and patrol boats were undamaged . Prime Minister Robert Borden pledged that the government would be " co @-@ operating in every way to reconstruct the Port of Halifax : this was of utmost importance to the Empire " . Although Captain Symington of the USS Tacoma speculated that the port would not be operational for months , in fact a convoy departed on 11 December and dockyard operations resumed before Christmas .

 The Halifax Explosion was one of the largest artificial non @-@ nuclear explosions . An extensive comparison of 130 major explosions by Halifax historian Jay White in 1994 concluded that " Halifax Harbour remains unchallenged in overall magnitude as long as five criteria are considered together : number of casualties , force of blast , radius of devastation , quantity of explosive material , and total value of property destroyed . " For many years afterward , the Halifax Explosion was the standard by which all large blasts were measured . For instance , in its report on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima , Time wrote that the explosive power of the Little Boy bomb was seven times that of the Halifax Explosion . 
 Construction began in 1964 on the Halifax North Memorial Library , designed to commemorate the victims of the explosion . The library entrance featured the first monument built to mark the explosion , the Halifax Explosion Memorial Sculpture , created by artist Jordi Bonet . The sculpture was dismantled by the Halifax Regional Municipality in 2004 and parts have been scattered and lost . The Halifax Explosion Memorial Bells were built in 1985 , relocating memorial carillon bells from a nearby church to a large concrete sculpture on Fort Needham Hill , facing the " ground zero " area of the explosion . The Bell Tower is the location of an annual civic ceremony every 6 December . A memorial at the Halifax Fire Station on Lady Hammond Road honours the firefighters killed while responding to the explosion . Fragments of Mont @-@ Blanc have been mounted as neighbourhood monuments to the explosion at Albro Lake Road in Dartmouth , at Regatta Point , and elsewhere in the area . Simple monuments mark the mass graves of explosion victims at the Fairview Lawn Cemetery and the Bayers Road Cemetery . A Memorial Book listing the names of all the known victims is displayed at the Halifax North Memorial Library and at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic , which has a large permanent exhibit about the Halifax Explosion . Harold Gilman was commissioned to create a painting memorializing the event , although his work , Halifax Harbour at Sunset , " tells very little about the recent devastation , as the viewpoint is set back so that the harbour appears undisturbed " . 
 The canonical novel Barometer Rising ( 1941 ) by the Canadian writer Hugh MacLennan is set in Halifax at the time of the explosion and includes a carefully researched description of its impact on the city . Following in MacLennan 's footsteps , journalist Robert MacNeil penned Burden of Desire ( 1992 ) and used the explosion as a metaphor for the societal and cultural changes of the day . MacLennan and MacNeil 's use of the romance genre to fictionalize the explosion is similar to the first attempt by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Frank McKelvey Bell , author of the short novella A Romance of the Halifax Disaster ( 1918 ) . This work follows the love affair of a young woman and an injured soldier . Keith Ross Leckie scripted a miniseries entitled Shattered City : The Halifax Explosion ( 2003 ) , which took the title but has no relationship to Janet Kitz 's non @-@ fiction book Shattered City : The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery ( 1990 ) . The film was criticized for distortions and inaccuracies . 
 In 1918 , Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in thanks and remembrance for the help that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee provided immediately after the disaster . That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association , who began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston 's support after the explosion . The gift was later taken over by the Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism . The tree is Boston 's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season . In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities , the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree . 
 = Odex 's actions against file @-@ sharing = 
 Odex 's actions against file sharing were legal actions against Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) and their subscribers in Singapore by Odex , a Singapore @-@ based company that virtually distributes sub @-@ licensed Japanese anime . From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against anyone who had downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement . Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers . After rulings from the Subordinate Courts , Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation . More than a third of the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S $ 3 @,@ 000 ( US $ 2 @,@ 000 ) to S $ 5 @,@ 000 ( US $ 4 @,@ 000 ) each . 
 The Singaporean anime community considered Odex 's actions to be controversial , sudden , and heavy @-@ handed — especially when it was discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old . In response , Odex dropped its pay @-@ or @-@ be @-@ sued letter approach in favour of cease @-@ and @-@ desist emails to downloaders . Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP . In January 2008 , Odex appealed the decision , and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data , but only directly to Japanese anime studios . Subsequently , these studios started their own legal actions against Singaporean downloaders . Some observers predicted that the High Court 's decision would set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading . The case raised issues of individual privacy , intellectual property , and free use of the Internet . Odex 's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage , which coincided with similar actions against consumer file sharing of music in the United States . 
 = = Actions = = 
 Odex is a Singaporean company that licenses and releases anime for local and regional consumption . The company tracked people it believed to be illegally downloading its releases in Singapore , using the method employed by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in the United States . Like the RIAA , Odex hired the American tracking company BayTSP to obtain the IP addresses of downloaders from their respective countries and to track them for several months . BayTSP singled out the website <unk> as a major source of the downloads and tracked many of its BitTorrent users . This data was used to apply for subpoenas to compel ISPs to reveal personal information associated with each IP address . In May 2007 , the ISP SingNet consented in writing to release personal information about its customers , before Odex 's first application against the ISP had its hearing . On 13 August , Odex succeeded in its application against StarHub , which , as a result , was required to reveal the identities of about 1 @,@ 000 ISP users . However , it is revealed that Starhub didn 't revealed any user data to Odex as they were reviewing their rights when Odex lost their appeal to Pacific Internet ( <unk> ) . Odex was represented by law firm Rajah & Tann in all its cases against major ISPs , including its application against <unk> . 
 After downloading that originated from Singaporean IP addresses had been recorded by BayTSP , Odex sent letters of demand to people associated with the IP addresses it had tracked . The letters requested monetary compensation for downloads of the company 's licensed material . The recipients were asked to contact Odex within one week and pay settlement fees from S $ 3 @,@ 000 to S $ 5 @,@ 000 or face legal action . The recipients also had to sign a non @-@ disclosure agreement , promise to destroy all copies of the downloaded anime , and stop downloading the copyrighted material . 
 On 9 August 2007 , an Odex representative said it intended to obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary . The company initially believed that , unlike in other countries , mere warning letters would not stop the downloads in Singapore . Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series , such as Bleach , D.Gray @-@ man , Fullmetal Alchemist and <unk> . There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S $ 15 million from 3 @,@ 000 individuals from out @-@ of @-@ court settlements , but Odex responded that it did not require each of them to pay a uniform S $ 5 @,@ 000 . The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual . Odex confirmed that more than 3 @,@ 000 IP addresses had been disclosed as a result of the court orders , but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20 % of its enforcement costs . The company 's director , Peter Go , subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers ' personal data . He justified his company 's actions by stating that , according to BayTSP 's statistics , Singapore had one of the highest rates of illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85 % . 
 On 3 September 2007 , Odex director Stephen Sing announced on his company 's Internet forum that Odex would no longer send letters of demand to Internet users who had stopped their illegal downloading since the beginning of the enforcement drive . Two weeks later , Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders . The company did not obtain subscribers ' information directly from ISPs , but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers . Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti @-@ piracy drive , and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably . 
 On 29 January 2008 , the High Court handed down its ruling on Odex 's appeal . It held that Pacific Internet had to release the names of the alleged illegal downloaders directly to the Japanese anime studios . In the light of this decision , Peter Go said that the company 's role would shift from active enforcement to assisting the studios in their possible courses of action . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 The company 's actions attracted national media attention and were harshly criticised by the Singaporean anime community as " sudden and severe " . Anime fans were outraged by the issuing of legal threats to children as young as nine years old , as they believed children were unable to differentiate between legal and illegal downloading . There were widespread calls in online blogs and forums to boycott Odex 's products . 
 Odex blamed the approximate 70 % fall in its Video CD ( VCD ) and Digital Video Disc ( DVD ) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading . The response of anime fans was that the fall in sales was because Odex 's products were inferior , inaccurately translated , and released later than the online versions . Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes ( such as yaoi ) and on <unk> — anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue — whom they had hired . In response , the Board of Film Censors said that it did not ask for subtitles to be changed , that it merely classified content , and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles . In addition to problems of quality and scheduling , criticisms were directed at Odex 's litigious strategy and poor public relations . Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore ( <unk> ) in making its demands for compensation . 
 Stephen Sing was mocked and criticised after posting comments to an online forum which many considered to be gloating . Messages posted by Sing under the nickname " <unk> " included " Me too busy suing people " [ sic ] and " <unk> ! I double @-@ 6 @-@ ed so many downloaders serve them right ! " Sing was labelled the " most hated man in Singapore 's anime community " by members of the blogosphere , a wanted poster with his face circulated online , and he was taunted openly in his office . Sing asserted that threats of arson , assault and even death were made against him and filed a police report . Although he expressed regret over the remarks because they were a " PR disaster " and " very wrong " , he said that he had written them while feeling frustrated and did not apologise . He dismissed his " double @-@ 6 @-@ ed " remark , an expression of joy at the threats of lawsuits , as having been made " two months ago " , but it was revealed that they had been made only three weeks earlier . A Sunday Times article condemned these online responses as " propaganda " spread by " lynch mobs " and noted that some of these netizens had revealed the home addresses of Odex 's employees . Odex placed a quarter @-@ page advertisement in The Straits Times on 22 August 2007 to explain its actions . 
 Allegations were made by the online community that Odex had passed off fansubs as its own work . Sing admitted that this was partially true as Odex had hired anime fans to do subtitling in 2004 who had taken " the easy way out and copied word for word the subtitles on fansubs they downloaded " . Sing explained that when Odex released its anime , the company did not realise what the anime fans had done , and it has been " paying for this mistake ever since " . It was reported at the same time that all of Odex 's translation and subtitling was now done " in house " . However , Odex 's release of The Melancholy of <unk> <unk> in September 2007 was found to contain translations strongly resembling an earlier unauthorised fansub release . Emails were also sent to the media saying that Sing and Go were directors and shareholders of a defunct company , Games Mart , that shared the same corporate address as Odex and had been raided in 1999 by the police for selling game consoles with unauthorized modifications . This information was confirmed by the press , and Go wrote a letter to the media explaining that Games Mart was not affiliated with Odex in any way . 
 Members of an online forum expressed their unhappiness by selling " anti @-@ Odex " T @-@ shirts . Another netizen created a video parody , entitled <unk> Holocaust , and uploaded it to YouTube and other video @-@ sharing websites . A website was established giving details of an " Odex VCD recycling drive " , where those who joined could exchange their Odex VCDs for a black awareness ribbon to wear . A protest by a few people with several action figurines took place on 25 August 2007 under intense police scrutiny , which was considered by Western observers to be a rarity in Singapore . An online group , <unk> Defense , was set up to provide support for the downloaders facing legal action . It raised funds to hire a collective lawyer from <unk> Law Corporation to represent two of the downloaders when suits were filed against them in November 2008 by the anime studios . 
 There were assertions that Odex had charged 10 % interest for settlements paid through an instalment plan , but a press release by the company denied that it had required any such interest payments . By September 2007 , 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex , although , in a news conference , Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone . The company explained that it would not profit from the enforcement process and intended to donate to charity any excess amount received . It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected at the close of proceedings . On 31 August 2007 , in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases , Odex began to offer video on demand ( VOD ) on its relaunched website . Users could legally download and unlock a digital rights management ( DRM ) <unk> anime episode at S $ 2 for seven days . 
 In mid @-@ November 2007 , the cease @-@ and @-@ desist emails initiated by Odex and BayTSP reached several users in Japan , France , and the United States , some in the form of Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) notices from their ISPs . Although Odex and BayTSP announced shortly afterwards that the emails were sent out in error , Japanese commentators suggested that the enforcement action was " a step in a right direction " . On 21 November 2007 , Odex 's website was hacked and defaced and the VOD service put out of action . Its main page was replaced by an angry message against the company 's legal actions , and experts interviewed by representatives of the local media said that the perpetrator likely was from Singapore . 
 = = Odex v. Pacific Internet = = 
 = = = Subordinate Courts ' decision = = = 
 On 16 August 2007 , Odex initiated legal action against a third Internet Service Provider , Pacific Internet . Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the personal information of about 1 @,@ 000 subscribers . The closed @-@ door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts , where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet did not have to reveal its subscribers ' personal information . Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application , despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios . The decision came as a surprise to many , and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal . Although Lau denied Odex the court order , he warned that the right to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement . 
 In light of the decision , the ISP StarHub , represented by Drew & Napier , said " [ we are ] assessing our options , given the different decisions rendered by the court " . Meanwhile , it was revealed that SingNet had consented to Odex 's application , had not instructed its lawyers to attend the hearing , and the two @-@ week deadline for appealing against the application had passed . SingNet 's failure to contest Odex 's application , perhaps even expediting it , was perceived by some of its subscribers as a voluntary breach of privacy . SingNet later declared that it neither " gave consent " nor assisted Odex in its application for the release of subscriber information , and that its customer subscriptions remained unaffected . 
 In a rare move , District Judge Earnest Lau released a 14 @-@ page judgment explaining the court 's denial of Odex 's request for Pacific Internet 's client information . He compared Odex 's demands to an Anton Piller order , which provides for the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning . Seen as draconian , it is only used under extreme circumstances . He held that only copyright holders themselves , or their exclusive licensees , can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders . Out of all the anime licensed to Odex , only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company . The judge noted that , out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court , ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore ( <unk> ) , not Odex , to act for the copyright holders . Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet 's legal costs of S $ 7 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = High Court appeal = = = 
 Odex 's appeal against the Subordinate Courts ' decision began on 3 October 2007 before Justice Woo <unk> Li in the High Court . BayTSP 's CEO , Mark Ishikawa , and representatives of four Japanese studios , including TV Tokyo , Gonzo and Toei Animation , flew to Singapore to testify on behalf of Odex . Although the Japanese companies intended to file lawsuits themselves should Odex fail , the High Court approved their addition as parties to Odex 's appeal . 
 In his judgment of 29 January 2008 , Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers ' information only to the six Japanese companies that were parties to the case . He explicitly denied Odex access to this information . He upheld District Judge Lau 's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data . As a result , he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet 's legal costs of S $ 20 @,@ 000 . Following the ruling , some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies . The ruling may have set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders . 
 = = Further developments = = 
 = = = Subsequent action by anime studios = = = 
 In early August 2008 , seven months after the High Court ruling , <unk> ( previously Toshiba Entertainment ) , Geneon Entertainment , Sunrise , Gonzo and TV Tokyo initiated their own legal actions against downloaders . Like Odex , they were represented by Rajah & Tann and sent out letters of demand for payment to SingNet , StarHub and Pacific Internet subscribers asking users to " enter discussions " with the studios ' solicitors within seven days . <unk> , which supported Odex in its appeal against Pacific Internet , consulted Odex before beginning its legal actions . Settlements were reported to range between S $ 5 @,@ 000 and S $ 6 @,@ 000 per person , and in August 2008 , BayTSP was reported to be in contractual talks with other anime studios to track downloaders in Singapore . 
 Three months later , the anime studios filed a writ of summons with the Subordinate Courts against four " heavy downloaders " . The hearing was speculated to begin in 2009 or 2010 , with legal fees ranging from S $ 50 @,@ 000 to S $ 80 @,@ 000 . Because of its bearing on downloaders of other media , such as movies and games , the suits were closely watched by the public . In 2010 it was reported that Odex 's effort was unsuccessful as it was not the primary copyright holder . 
 = = = Similar actions in Singapore by other media owners = = = 
 In April 2015 , the makers of Dallas Buyers Club successfully obtained a court order against two major ISPs Starhub and M1 to reveal customers who have allegedly downloaded illegal copies of the movie . Samuel Seow Law Corporation represented the makers in sending demand letters to more than 500 subscribers asking for a written offer of damages and costs . This is the second reported instance of a major legal action taken by a media company against individuals in Singapore for alleged illegal downloading since Odex . 
 = = Legal opinions and analysis = = 
 The case was covered extensively by the country 's newspapers . In The Straits Times of Singapore , lawyers who were interviewed said anime fans would not have a strong defence against Odex if proof of uploading or downloading of unauthorised videos was presented . In his analysis , Thomas Koshy — a legal academic writing in Today — questioned the legality of Odex 's threatening criminal prosecution of downloaders . Koshy maintained that only the Attorney @-@ General had the power to prosecute and that there was no indication that he had authorised Odex to conduct prosecutions on his behalf . Moreover , Koshy opined that it was improper for Odex to have combined its demand for compensation with a threat of criminal prosecution ; although Odex 's letters alleged " illegal downloading activity " , the company threatened punishment associated with the more serious offence of distributing materials which infringed copyrights . Koshy noted that Odex had cited a legal provision intended to regulate people 's file sharing for monetary gain rather than downloading by a casual consumer . Burton Ong , an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law , suggested that an anime fan who downloaded a few episodes may have been able to rely on " fair dealing " as a defence against the charge of copyright infringement . One of the criteria for pursuing this line of defence would have been proving that the download subsequently boosted , rather than undermined , the commercial viability of the anime industry . 
 Anime fans and sympathisers used the Internet to raise funds and lodge a legal challenge to Odex 's methods ; one Internet user created an invitation @-@ only forum for those considering going to court against Odex over its allegations of illegal downloads . Fans solicited legal advice and put together a library of relevant material . A letter to The Straits Times pointed out that downloaders deciding to settle out of court with Odex were afforded no protection from lawsuits initiated by other companies within the anime industry . 
 Following District Judge Earnest Lau 's ruling in the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit , Koshy expressed his belief that SingNet might be in breach of the spirit of the Telecommunications Competition Code , which protects the confidentiality of subscribers ' information and prohibits unauthorised release . Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet , however , did not think that SingNet 's actions were improper , and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code . Andy Ho , another The Straits Times editor , expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively , thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech ; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted .

 The 2007 – 08 season was the 113th full season in Sunderland A.F.C. ' s history , their 107th in the league system of English football and 7th in the Premier League . After finishing 1st in the Championship during the 2006 – 07 season , Sunderland were promoted to the Premier League as champions . Sunderland had been relegated in the 2005 – 06 season with the record low points tally at the time of 15 . The 2007 – 08 season was Roy Keane 's first as a manager in the Premier League having won the Championship in his debut season . 
 Keane introduced 12 new signings in pre @-@ season and allowed seven players to leave the club . They won their first game of the season , but subsequently started to struggle for points , winning just two games in their first 16 . Their longest winning streak came towards the end of the season as they won three consecutive games . This late run helped Sunderland finish 15th , though they only managed to win two away games , of which the first came in late March . The team suffered first round exits in two of the cup competitions they entered : in the second round of the League Cup and the third round of the FA Cup . Kenwyne Jones was the club 's top goalscorer , recording 7 goals in the league . Left @-@ back Danny Collins was named as Sunderland 's player of the season , while on loan centre @-@ back Jonny Evans was named as the club 's young player of the season for the second season running . The club 's average attendance of 42 @,@ 728 was the fifth highest in the division .

 Discussions of takeover were held over the summer involving an Irish group , the Drumaville Consortium , led by Niall Quinn . They completed the takeover in July for £ 10 million as Quinn 's group took 72 @.@ 59 % of the club 's shares . During the 2006 – 07 season , Roy Keane took over as manager from chairman Niall Quinn , who served as manager for the first six games of the season . Keane had a successful start to his managerial career with a 2 – 1 win over Derby County on 11 September 2006 . On transfer window deadline day , Keane signed new players ; Dwight Yorke , Liam Miller , Ross Wallace , Stanislav Varga , Graham Kavanagh and David Connolly . A 2 – 0 win over Leicester City on 1 January 2007 sparked an 18 @-@ game unbeaten streak for Sunderland , which was eventually ended on 21 April 2007 after a 3 – 1 defeat at the hands of Colchester United . 
 Sunderland reached the top of the Football League Championship for the first time in the season with a 2 – 1 win over Southampton , which included an 87th @-@ minute winner from Grant Leadbitter . Their promotion was confirmed as third placed team Derby County lost 2 – 0 to Crystal Palace , as a result Birmingham City were also promoted . On the last day of the season , the Championship title would be decided . Sunderland won their game 5 – 0 against Luton Town , while Birmingham suffered a defeat against Preston North End thus crowning Sunderland as champions .
