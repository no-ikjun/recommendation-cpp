 Craters of the Moon is in south @-@ central Idaho , midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park . The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains . Combined U.S. Highway 20 – 26 – 93 cuts through the northwestern part of the monument and provides access to it . However , the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped , with only one paved road across the northern end . 
 The Craters of the Moon Lava Field spreads across 618 square miles ( 1 @,@ 601 km2 ) and is the largest mostly Holocene @-@ aged basaltic lava field in the contiguous United States . The Monument and Preserve contain more than 25 volcanic cones , including outstanding examples of spatter cones . The 60 distinct solidified lava flows that form the Craters of the Moon Lava Field range in age from 15 @,@ 000 to just 2 @,@ 000 years . The Kings Bowl and Wapi lava fields , both about 2 @,@ 200 years old , are part of the National Preserve . 
 This lava field is the largest of several large beds of lava that erupted from the 53 @-@ mile ( 85 km ) south @-@ east to north @-@ west trending Great Rift volcanic zone , a line of weakness in the Earth 's crust . Together with fields from other fissures they make up the Lava Beds of Idaho , which in turn are in the much larger Snake River Plain volcanic province . The Great Rift extends across almost the entire Snake River Plain . 
 Elevation at the visitor center is 5 @,@ 900 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) above sea level . 
 Total average precipitation in the Craters of the Moon area is between 15 – 20 inches ( 380 – 510 mm ) per year . Most of this is lost in cracks in the basalt , only to emerge later in springs and seeps in the walls of the Snake River Canyon . Older lava fields on the plain have been invaded by drought @-@ resistant plants such as sagebrush , while younger fields , such as Craters of the Moon , only have a seasonal and very sparse cover of vegetation . From a distance this cover disappears almost entirely , giving an impression of utter black desolation . Repeated lava flows over the last 15 @,@ 000 years have raised the land surface enough to expose it to the prevailing southwesterly winds , which help to keep the area dry . Together these conditions make life on the lava field difficult .

 = = = Native American history = = = 
 Paleo @-@ Indians visited the area about 12 @,@ 000 years ago but did not leave much archaeological evidence . Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie , west of the lava field . Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind . No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group . A hunting and gathering culture , the Northern Shoshone pursued elk , bears , American bison , cougars , and bighorn sheep — all large game who no longer range the area . The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2 @,@ 100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people . Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who , angered by lightning , coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed , fire shot from cracks , and the mountain exploded . 
 = = = Goodale 's Cutoff = = = 
 Pioneers traveling in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route in the area that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows . This alternative route was later named Goodale 's Cutoff and part of it is in the northern part of the monument . The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks , which today is memorialized in Idaho 's Massacre Rocks State Park . 
 After gold was discovered in the Salmon River area of Idaho , a group of emigrants persuaded an Illinois @-@ born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff . A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field . Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children , the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide . Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail . 
 = = = Exploration and early study = = = 
 In 1879 , two Arco cattlemen named Arthur Ferris and J.W. Powell became the first known people to explore the lava fields . They were investigating its possible use for grazing and watering cattle but found the area to be unsuitable and left . 
 U.S. Army Captain and western explorer <unk> Bonneville visited the lava fields and other places in the West in the 19th century and wrote about his experiences in his diaries . Washington Irving later used Bonneville 's diaries to write the Adventures of Captain Bonneville , saying this unnamed lava field is a place " where nothing meets the eye but a desolate and awful waste , where no grass grows nor water runs , and where nothing is to be seen but lava . " 
 In 1901 and 1903 , Israel Russell became the first geologist to study this area while surveying it for the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) . In 1910 , Samuel Paisley continued Russell 's work and later became the monument 's first custodian . Others followed and in time much of the mystery surrounding this and the other Lava Beds of Idaho was lifted . 
 The few whites who visited the area in the 19th century created local legends that it looked like the surface of the Moon . Geologists Harold T. Stearns coined the name " Craters of the Moon " in 1923 while trying to convince the National Park Service to recommend protection of the area in a national monument . 
 = = = Limbert 's expedition = = = 
 Robert Limbert , a sometime taxidermist , tanner , and furrier from Boise , explored the area , which he described as " practically unknown and unexplored ... " in the 1920s after hearing stories from fur trappers about " strange things they had seen while ranging the region " . 
 Limbert wrote : " I had made two trips into the northern end , covering practically the same region as that traversed by a Geological Survey party in 1901 . My first was a hiking and camping trip with Ad <unk> ( the wrestler ) , Dr. Dresser , and Albert Jones ; the second was with Wes Watson and Era Martin ( ranchers living about four miles [ 6 km ] from the northern edge ) . The peculiar features seen on those trips led me to take a third across the region in the hope that even more interesting phenomena might be encountered . " 
 Limbert set out on his third and most ambitious foray to the area in May 1920 , this time with Walter Cole and an Airedale Terrier to accompany him . Starting from Minidoka , Idaho , they explored what is now the monument area from south to north passing Two Point Butte , Echo Crater , Big Craters , North Crater Flow , and out of the lava field through the Yellowstone Park and Lincoln Highway ( now known as the Old Arco @-@ Carey Road ) . Taking the dog along was a mistake , Limbert wrote , " for after three days ' travel his feet were worn and bleeding " . 
 A series of newspaper and magazine articles written by Limbert were later published about this and previous treks , which increased public awareness of the area . The most famous of these was an article that appeared in a 1924 issue of National Geographic where he called the area " Craters of the Moon , " helping to solidify the use of that name . In the article he had this to say about the cobalt blue of the Blue Dragon Flows : 
 " It is the play of light at sunset across this lava that charms the spectator . It becomes a twisted , wavy sea . In the moonlight its glazed surface has a silvery sheen . With changing conditions of light and air , it varies also , even while one stands and watches . It is a place of color and silence ... " 
 = = = Protection and later history = = = 
 In large part due to Limbert 's work , Craters of the Moon National Monument was proclaimed on May 2 , 1924 by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge to " preserve the unusual and weird volcanic formations " . The Craters Inn and several cabins were built in 1927 for the convenience of visitors . The Mission 66 Program initiated construction of today 's road system , visitor center , shop , campground and comfort station in 1956 and in 1959 the Craters of the Moon Natural History Association was formed to assist the monument in educational activities . The addition of an island of vegetation completely surrounded by lava known as Carey <unk> ( air photo ) increased the size of the monument by 5 @,@ 360 acres ( 22 km2 ) in 1962 . 
 Since then the monument has been enlarged . On October 23 , 1970 , Congress set aside a large part of it — 43 @,@ 243 acres ( 175 km2 ) — as Craters of the Moon National Wilderness , protecting that part under the National Wilderness Preservation System . 
 From 1969 to 1972 , NASA visited the real Moon through the Apollo program and found that its surface does not closely resemble this part of Idaho . NASA astronauts discovered that real Moon craters were almost all created by meteorites while their namesakes on Earth were created by volcanic eruptions . Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an unfamiliar and harsh environment . 
 For many years , geologists , biologists and environmentalists have advocated for expansion of the monument and its transformation into a national park . Part of that goal was reached in 2000 when the monument was expanded 13 @-@ fold from 53 @,@ 545 acres ( 217 km2 ) to its current size to encompass the entire Great Rift zone and its three lava fields . The entire addition is called the Backcountry Area while the two older parts are called the Developed Area and Wilderness Area . Opposition by cattle interests and hunters to a simple expansion plan led to a compromise of having the addition become a national preserve in 2002 ( which allows hunting , not ordinarily permitted in national parks and monuments in the U.S. ) . Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve is co @-@ managed by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management , both under the Department of the Interior . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Snake River Plain is a volcanic province that was created by a series of cataclysmic caldera @-@ forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago . A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated . This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11 million years ago but ' moved ' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward . Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up , creating fault @-@ block mountains . After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides . 
 Leftover heat from this hot spot was later liberated by Basin and Range @-@ associated rifting and created the many overlapping lava flows that make up the Lava Beds of Idaho . The largest rift zone is the Great Rift ; it is from this ' Great Rift fissure system ' that Craters of the Moon , Kings Bowl , and Wapi lava fields were created . The Great Rift is a National Natural Landmark 
 In spite of their fresh appearance , the oldest flows in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field are 15 @,@ 000 years old and the youngest erupted about 2000 years ago , according to Mel Kuntz and other USGS geologists . Nevertheless , the volcanic fissures at Craters of the Moon are considered to be dormant , not extinct , and are expected to erupt in less than a thousand years . There are eight major eruptive periods recognized in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field . Each period lasted about 1000 years or less and were separated by relatively quiet periods that lasted between 500 and as long as 3000 years . Individual lava flows were up to 30 miles ( 50 km ) long with the Blue Dragon Flow being the longest . 
 Kings Bowl Lava Field erupted during a single fissure eruption on the southern part of the Great Rift about 2 @,@ 250 years ago . This eruption probably lasted only a few hours to a few days . The field preserves explosion pits , lava lakes , squeeze @-@ ups , basalt mounds , and an ash blanket . The Wapi Lava Field probably formed from a fissure eruption at the same time as the Kings Bowl eruption . More prolonged activity over a period of months to a few years led to the formation of low shield <unk> ( ? ) in the Wapi field . The Bear Trap lava tube , between the Craters of the Moon and the Wapi lava fields , is a cave system more than 15 miles ( 24 km ) long . The lava tube is remarkable for its length and for the number of well @-@ preserved lava cave features , such as lava stalactites and curbs , the latter marking high stands of the flowing lava frozen on the lava tube walls . The lava tubes and pit craters of the monument are known for their unusual preservation of winter ice and snow into the hot summer months , due to shielding from the sun and the insulating properties of basalt . 
 A typical eruption along the Great Rift and similar basaltic rift systems starts with a curtain of very fluid lava shooting up to 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) high along a segment of the rift up to 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long . As the eruption continues , pressure and heat decrease and the chemistry of the lava becomes slightly more silica rich . The curtain of lava responds by breaking apart into separate vents . Various types of volcanoes may form at these vents : gas @-@ rich pulverized lava creates cinder cones ( such as Inferno Cone – stop 4 ) , and pasty lava blobs form spatter cones ( such as Spatter Cones – stop 5 ) . Later stages of an eruption push lava streams out through the side or base of cinder cones , which usually ends the life of the cinder cone ( North Crater , Watchmen , and Sheep Trail Butte are notable exceptions ) . This will sometimes breach part of the cone and carry it away as large and craggy blocks of cinder ( as seen at North Crater Flow – stop 2 – and Devils Orchard – stop 3 ) . Solid crust forms over lava streams and lava tubes ( a type of cave ) , and are created when lava vacates its course ( examples can be seen at the Cave Area – stop 7 ) . 
 Geologists feared that a large earthquake that shook Borah Peak , Idaho 's tallest mountain , in 1983 would restart volcanic activity at Craters of the Moon , though this proved not to be the case . Geologists predict that the area will experience its next eruption some time in the next 900 years with the most likely period in the next 100 years . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Conditions = = = 
 All plants and animals that live in and around Craters of the Moon are under great environmental stress due to constant dry winds and heat @-@ absorbing black lavas that tend to quickly sap water from living things . Summer soil temperatures often exceed 150 ° F ( 66 ° C ) and plant cover is generally less than 5 % on cinder cones and about 15 % over the entire monument . Adaptation is therefore necessary for survival in this semi @-@ arid harsh climate . 
 Water is usually only found deep inside holes at the bottom of blow @-@ out craters . Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food . The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long , making it difficult for plants to establish themselves . Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows . Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil . 
 The shaded north slopes of cinder cones provide more protection from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds and have a more persistent snow cover ( an important water source in early spring ) . These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first . 
 Gaps between lava flows were sometimes cut off from surrounding vegetation . These literal islands of habitat are called <unk> , a Hawaiian name used for older land surrounded by younger lava . Carey <unk> is one such area in the southernmost part of the monument and is used as a benchmark to measure how plant cover has changed in less pristine parts of southern Idaho . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 There are 375 species of plant known to grow in the monument . When wildflowers are not in bloom , most of the vegetation is found in semi @-@ hidden pockets and consists of pine trees , cedars , junipers , and sagebrush . Strategies used by plants to cope with the adverse conditions include : 
 Drought tolerance by physiological adaptations such as the ability to survive extreme dehydration or the ability to extract water from very dry soil . Sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush are examples . 
 Drought avoidance by having small , hairy , or succulent leaves to minimize moisture loss or otherwise conserve water . Hairs on <unk> , the succulent parts of the <unk> cactus , and the small leaves of the <unk> are all local examples . 
 Drought escape by growing in small crevices or near persistent water supplies , or by staying dormant for about 95 % of the year . Mosses and ferns in the area grow near constant water sources such as natural potholes and seeps from ice caves . <unk> penstemon , <unk> <unk> , and gland cinquefoil grow in shallow crevices . <unk> , bush <unk> , <unk> , and even limber pine grow in large crevices . While dwarf <unk> ( photo ) carry out their entire life cycle during the short wet part of the year and survive in seed form the rest of the time . 
 A plant commonly seen on the lava field is the dwarf buckwheat ( Eriogonum <unk> var. <unk> ) ( photo ) , a flowering plant 4 inches ( 100 mm ) tall with a root system 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide . The root system monopolizes soil moisture in its immediate area , resulting in individual plants that are evenly spaced . Consequently , many visitors have asked park rangers if the buckwheat were systematically planted . 
 Wildflowers bloom from early May to late September but most are gone by late August . Moisture from snow @-@ melt along with some rainfall in late spring kick @-@ starts the germination of annual plants , including wildflowers . Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good . The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain . Some wildflowers that grow in the area are the arrow @-@ leaved <unk> , bitterroot , <unk> , desert parsley , dwarf monkeyflower , paintbrush , <unk> , scabland penstemon and the wild onion . 
 = = = Animals = = = 
 Years of cataloging by biologists and park rangers have recorded 2000 species of insect , 8 reptiles , 169 birds , 48 mammals , and even one amphibian ( the western toad ) . Birds and some rodents are seen most frequently in the Craters of the Moon area . Brown bears once roamed this area but have long ago become locally extinct . Traditional livestock grazing continues within the grass / shrublands administered by the BLM . 
 Most desert animals are nocturnal , or mainly active at night . Nocturnal behavior is an adaptation to both predation and hot summer daytime temperatures . Nocturnal animals at Craters of the Moon include woodrats ( also called <unk> ) , skunks , foxes , bobcats , mountain lions , bats , nighthawks , owls , and most other small desert rodents . 
 Animals that are most active at dawn and dusk , when temperatures are cooler than mid @-@ day , are called crepuscular . The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators , but is bright enough to allow them to locate food . Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is . <unk> animals in the area include mule deer , coyotes , porcupines , mountain cottontails , jackrabbits , and many songbirds . 
 Some desert animals are diurnal , or primarily active during the day . These include ground squirrels , marmots , chipmunks , lizards , snakes , hawks , and eagles . 
 Many animals have a specific temperature range where they are active , meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons . Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months , are diurnal during the late spring and early fall , and become crepuscular during the heat of summer . Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity . Some animals , like ground squirrels and marmots , have one or more periods of estivation , a summer hibernation that allows them to avoid the hottest and driest periods . 
 Several animals are unique to Craters of the Moon and the surrounding area . Subspecies of Great Basin pocket mouse , pika , yellow @-@ pine chipmunk , and yellow @-@ bellied marmot are found nowhere else . Lava tube beetles and many other cave animals are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho . 
 = = = = Mule deer = = = = 
 In May 1980 wildlife researcher Brad Griffith of the University of Idaho started a three @-@ year study to mark and count the mule deer in the monument . The National Park Service was concerned that the local herd might grow so large that it would damage its habitat . Griffith found that this group of mule deer has developed a drought evasion strategy unique for its species . 
 The deer arrive in the southern part of the pre @-@ 2000 extent of the monument mid @-@ April each year once winter snows have melted away enough to allow for foraging . Griffith found that by late summer plants in the area have already matured and dried to the point that they can no longer provide enough moisture to sustain the deer . In late July after about 12 days above 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) and warm nights above 50 ° F ( 10 ° C ) the herd migrates 5 to 10 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 to 16 @.@ 1 km ) north to the Pioneer Mountains to obtain water from free @-@ flowing streams and shade themselves in aspen and Douglas @-@ fir groves . Rain in late September prompts the herd to return to the monument to feed on bitterbrush until snow in November triggers them to migrate back to their winter range . This herd , therefore , has a dual summer range . It is also very productive with one of the highest fawn survival rates of any herd in the species . 
 Afternoon winds usually die down in the evening , prompting behavioral modifications in the herd . The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing . In 1991 there was a three @-@ year average of 420 mule deer . 
 = = Recreational activities = = 
 A series of fissure vents , cinder cones , spatter cones , rafted blocks , and overlapping lava flows are accessible from the Loop Drive , 7 miles ( 11 km ) long . Wildflowers , shrubs , trees , and wild animals can be seen by hiking on one of the many trails in the monument or by just pulling over into one of the turn @-@ offs . More rugged hiking opportunities are available in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness Area and Backcountry Area , the roadless southern and major part of the monument . 
 The Visitor Center is near the monument 's only entrance . Various displays and publications along with a short film about the geology of the area help to orient visitors . Ranger @-@ led walks are available in summer and cover topics such as wildlife , flowers , plants , or geology . Self @-@ guiding tours and displays are available year @-@ round and are easily accessible from the Loop Drive . 
 A paved trail less than 1 / 4 mile ( 400 m ) long at North Crater Flow ( photo ) crosses the North Crater Lava Flow , which formed about 2200 years ago , making it one of the youngest lava flows on the Craters of the Moon Lava Field . This lava is named for the purplish @-@ blue tint that tiny pieces of obsidian ( volcanic glass ) on its surface exhibit . Good examples of pahoehoe ( ropey ) , aa ( jagged ) , and some block lava are readily visible along with large rafted crater wall fragments . The rafted crater wall fragments seen on the flow were once part of this cinder cone but were torn away when the volcano 's lava @-@ filled crater was breached . A 1 @.@ 8 @-@ mile @-@ long trail ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) includes the 1 / 2 mile ( 800 m ) overlook trail but continues on through the crater and to the Big Craters / Spatter Cones parking lot . 
 Devils Orchard ( photo ) is a group of lava @-@ transported cinder cone fragments ( also called monoliths or cinder crags ) that stand in cinders . Like the blocks at stop 2 they were once part of the North Crater cinder cone but broke off during an eruption of lava . A 1 / 2 mile @-@ long ( 800 m ) paved loop trial through the formations and trees of the " orchard " is available . The interpretive displays on the trail emphasize human impacts to the area . 
 Inferno Cone Viewpoint ( photo ) is on top of Inferno Cone cinder cone . A short but steep trail up the cinder cone leads to an overlook of the entire monument . From there the Spatter Cones can be seen just to the south along with a large part of the Great Rift . In the distance is the over 700 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( > 200 m ) Big Cinder Butte , one of the world 's largest , purely basaltic , cinder cones . Further away are the Pioneer Mountains ( behind the Visitor Center ) and beyond the monument are the White Knob Mountains , the Lost River Range , and the Lemhi Range . 
 Big Craters and Spatter Cones ( photo ) sit directly along the local part of the Great Rift fissure . Spatter cones are created by accumulations of pasty gas @-@ poor lava as they erupt from a vent . Big Craters is a cinder cone complex less than 300 feet ( 91 m ) up a steep foot trail . 
 Tree Molds ( photo ) is an area within the Craters of the Moon Wilderness where lava flows overran part of a forest . The trees were incinerated but as some of them burned they released enough water to cool the lava to form a cast . Some of these casts survived the eruption and mark the exact location and shape of the burning trees in the lava . Both holes and horizontal molds were left , some still showing shapes indicative of bark . The actual Tree Molds area is a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the Tree Molds parking lot and picnic area off a moderately difficult wilderness trail . The Wilderness trail also leaves from this parking lot , and extends nearly 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) into the wilderness area before gradually disappearing near The Sentinel cinder cone . The 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) Broken Top loop trail encircles the youngest cinder cone in the monument and can be done separately or as part of a longer trek on the Wilderness trail . A pull off on the spur road leading to the Tree Molds area presents the Lava Cascades , a frozen river of Blue Dragon Flow lava that temporarily pooled in the Big Sink . 
 Cave Area is the final stop on Loop Drive and , as the name indicates , has a collection of lava tube caves . Formed from the Blue Dragon Flow , the caves are a half @-@ mile ( 800 m ) from the parking lot and include , 
 Dewdrop Cave , 
 Boy Scout Cave , 
 Beauty Cave , and 
 Indian Tunnel . 
 The caves are open to visitors but flashlights are needed except in Indian Tunnel and some form of head protection is highly recommended when exploring any of the caves . Lava tubes are created when the sides and surface of a lava flow hardens . If the fluid interior flows away a cave is left behind . Entering caves requires a free permit . 
 Craters of the Moon Campground has 51 sites – none of which can be reserved in advance . Camping facilities are basic but do include water , restrooms , charcoal grills , and trash containers . National Park Service rangers present evening programs at the campground amphitheater in the summer . Camping enables visitors to enjoy the park during the evening and morning , when the heat , glare and wind are far less . 
 A Lunar Ranger program enables children to earn an embroidered patch in a few hours . 
 Backcountry hiking is available in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond ( added in 2000 ) . Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers . From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom @-@ visited volcanic features . All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger . No drinking water is available in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly <unk> hikers . Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers . Pets , camp fires , and all mechanized vehicles , including bicycles , are not allowed in the wilderness area . 
 Skiing is allowed on the Loop Drive after it is closed to traffic in late November because of snow drifts . Typically there are 20 inches ( 51 cm ) of snow by January and 25 in ( 64 cm ) by February . Cross @-@ country skiing off Loop Drive is allowed but may be dangerous owing to sharp lava and hidden holes under the snow . Blizzards and other inclement weather may occur .

 = Rashtrakuta dynasty = 
 Rashtrakuta ( IAST : <unk> ) was a royal dynasty ruling large parts of the Indian Subcontinent between the sixth and 10th centuries . The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription is a 7th @-@ century copper plate grant detailing their rule from <unk> , a city in Central or West India . Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of <unk> ( modern Elichpur in Maharashtra ) and the rulers of Kannauj . Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas , their native home and their language . 
 The Elichpur clan was a feudatory of the Badami Chalukyas , and during the rule of Dantidurga , it overthrew Chalukya Kirtivarman II and went on to build an empire with the Gulbarga region in modern Karnataka as its base . This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta , rising to power in South India in 753 . At the same time the Pala dynasty of Bengal and the <unk> dynasty of Malwa were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively . An Arabic text , <unk> al @-@ Tawarikh ( 851 ) , called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world . 
 This period , between the eighth and the 10th centuries , saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains , each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time . At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south , a fruitful time of political expansion , architectural achievements and famous literary contributions . The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism . 
 During their rule , Jain mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in Kannada and Sanskrit . Amoghavarsha I , the most famous king of this dynasty wrote Kavirajamarga , a landmark literary work in the Kannada language . Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style , the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora in modern Maharashtra . Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka , both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites . 
 = = History = = 
 The origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic of Indian history . These issues pertain to the origin of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor Ashoka in the 2nd century BCE , and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the 6th and 7th centuries . The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty , the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ( present day Malkhed in the Gulbarga district , Karnataka state ) , who ruled between the 8th and 10th centuries has also been debated . 
 The sources for Rashtrakuta history include medieval inscriptions , ancient literature in the Pali language , contemporaneous literature in Sanskrit and Kannada and the notes of the Arab travellers . Theories about the dynastic lineage ( Surya Vamsa — Solar line and Chandra Vamsa — Lunar line ) , the native region and the ancestral home have been proposed , based on information gleaned from inscriptions , royal emblems , the ancient clan names such as " <unk> " , epithets ( Ratta , Rashtrakuta , <unk> <unk> ) , the names of princes and princesses of the dynasty , and clues from relics such as coins . Scholars debate over which ethnic / linguistic groups can claim the early Rashtrakutas . Possibilities include the north western ethnic groups of India , the Kannadiga , Reddi , the Maratha , or the tribes from the Punjab region . 
 Scholars however concur that the rulers of the imperial dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit . Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit ( historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada ) , and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages . The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty . Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas , they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well . 
 The heart of the Rashtrakuta empire included nearly all of Karnataka , Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh , an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries . The <unk> copper plate grant ( 753 ) confirms that the feudatory King Dantidurga , who probably ruled from <unk> in Berar ( modern Elichpur in Maharashtra ) , defeated the great Karnatic army ( referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas ) of Kirtivarman II of Badami in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire . He then helped his father @-@ in @-@ law , Pallava King Nandivarman regain Kanchi from the Chalukyas and defeated the <unk> of Malwa , and the rulers of Kalinga , Kosala and Srisailam . 
 Dantidurga 's successor Krishna I brought major portions of present @-@ day Karnataka and Konkan under his control . During the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha who took control in 780 , the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the Kaveri River and Central India . He led successful expeditions to Kannauj , the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Gurjara Pratiharas and the Palas of Bengal , gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory . He also brought the Eastern Chalukyas and Gangas of Talakad under his control . According to <unk> and Sen , the Rashtrakutas became a pan @-@ India power during his rule . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 The ascent of Dhruva Dharavarsha 's third son , Govinda III , to the throne heralded an era of success like never before . There is uncertainty about the location of the early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time . During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas , the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains . Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor <unk> II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala , the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges . His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata . Having conquered Kannauj , he travelled south , took firm hold over Gujarat , Kosala ( Kaushal ) , Gangavadi , humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi , installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon ( one statue of the king and another of his minister ) . The Cholas , the Pandyas and the Cheras all paid him tribute . As one historian puts it , the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar . The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Broach . 
 The successor of Govinda III , Amoghavarsha I made Manyakheta his capital and ruled a large empire . Manyakheta remained the Rashtrakutas ' regal capital until the end of the empire . He came to the throne in 814 but it was not until 821 that he had suppressed revolts from feudatories and ministers . Amoghavarsha I made peace with the Western Ganga dynasty by giving them his two daughters in marriage , and then defeated the invading Eastern Chalukyas at <unk> and assumed the title <unk> . His rule was not as militant as that of Govinda III as he preferred to maintain friendly relations with his neighbours , the Gangas , the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pallavas with whom he also cultivated marital ties . His era was an enriching one for the arts , literature and religion . Widely seen as the most famous of the Rashtrakuta Emperors , Amoghavarsha I was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and Sanskrit . His Kavirajamarga is considered an important landmark in Kannada poetics and Prashnottara Ratnamalika in Sanskrit is a writing of high merit and was later translated into the Tibetan language . Because of his religious temperament , his interest in the arts and literature and his peace @-@ loving nature , he has been compared to the emperor Ashoka and called " Ashoka of the South " . 
 During the rule of Krishna II , the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size decreased to the area including most of the Western Deccan and Gujarat . Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta . Indra III recovered the dynasty 's fortunes in central India by defeating the Paramara and then invaded the doab region of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers . He also defeated the dynasty 's traditional enemies , the Pratiharas and the Palas , while maintaining his influence over Vengi . The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor Govinda IV . After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories in the north and east , Krishna III the last great ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country ( Tondaimandalam ) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 In 972 A.D. , during the rule of <unk> Amoghavarsha , the Paramara King <unk> Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta , the capital of the Rashtrakutas . This seriously undermined the reputation of the <unk> Empire and consequently led to its downfall . The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II , a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district , declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat . Indra IV , the last emperor , committed Sallekhana ( fasting unto death practised by Jain monks ) at Shravanabelagola . With the fall of the Rashtrakutas , their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence . The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century . The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River – Godavari River doab called Vengi . The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas , and the hitherto @-@ suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south . 
 In conclusion , the rise of Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta had a great impact on India , even on India 's north . Sulaiman ( 851 ) , Al Masudi ( 944 ) and Ibn <unk> ( 912 ) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world . According to the travelogues of the Arabs Al Masudi and Ibn <unk> of the 10th century , " most of the kings of Hindustan turned their faces towards the Rashtrakuta king while they were praying , and they prostrated themselves before his ambassadors . The Rashtrakuta king was known as the " King of kings " ( Rajadhiraja ) who possessed the mightiest of armies and whose domains extended from Konkan to Sind . " Some historians have called these times an " Age of Imperial Kannauj " . Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj , levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India , the era could also be called the " Age of Imperial Karnataka " . During their political expansion into central and northern India in the 8th to the 10th centuries , the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after the its fall or came to power much later . Well @-@ known among these were the Rashtrakutas of Gujarat ( 757 – 888 ) , the <unk> of Saundatti ( 875 – 1230 ) in modern Karnataka , the <unk> of Kannauj ( 1068 – 1223 ) , the Rashtrakutas of Rajasthan ( known as Rajputana ) and ruling from <unk> or <unk> ( 893 – 996 ) , <unk> ( near Jabalpur ) , Mandore ( near Jodhpur ) , the Rathores of <unk> , <unk> dynasty of <unk> in modern Maharashtra and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj . Rajadhiraja Chola 's conquest of the island of Ceylon in the early 11th century CE led to the fall of four kings there . According to historian K. Pillay , one of them , King <unk> of the Jaffna kingdom , was an usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty . 
 = = Administration = = 
 Inscriptions and other literary records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected the crown prince based on heredity . The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son . Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth , as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha . The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister ( <unk> ) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely , a flag , a conch , a fan , a white umbrella , a large drum and five musical instruments called <unk> . Under him was the commander ( Dandanayaka ) , the foreign minister ( <unk> ) and a prime minister ( <unk> or <unk> ) , all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier . A <unk> was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer . All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science ( <unk> ) and possessed military training . There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when <unk> , daughter of Amoghavarsha I , administered <unk> Vishaya . 
 The kingdom was divided into Mandala or <unk> ( provinces ) . A Rashtra was ruled by a <unk> who on occasion was the emperor himself . Amoghavarsha I 's empire had sixteen <unk> . Under a Rashtra was a Vishaya ( district ) overseen by a <unk> . Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a Rashtra . For example , <unk> , a commander of Amoghavarsha I headed Banavasi @-@ 12000 , <unk> @-@ 300 , Puligere @-@ 300 , <unk> @-@ 500 and <unk> @-@ 70 , the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory . Below the Vishaya was the Nadu looked after by the <unk> or <unk> ; sometimes there were two such officials , one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally . The lowest division was a Grama or village administered by a <unk> or Prabhu Gavunda . 
 The Rashtrakuta army consisted of large contingents of infantry , horsemen , and elephants . A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment ( <unk> Kataka ) in the regal capital of Manyakheta . Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war . Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose . 
 The Rashtrakutas issued coins ( minted in an <unk> ) such as Suvarna , <unk> in silver and gold weighing 65 grains , <unk> weighing 48 grains , Gadyanaka weighing 96 grains , Kasu weighing 15 grains , <unk> with 2 @.@ 5 grains and <unk> of 1 @.@ 25 grain . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by its natural and agricultural produce , its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests . Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat , <unk> and Berar . <unk> , Gujarat , Ujjain , Paithan and <unk> were important centres of textile industry . Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal . The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from <unk> . White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia , Turkey , Poland , Arabia and Egypt . The Konkan region , ruled by the feudatory Silharas , produced large quantities of betel leaves , coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore , ruled by the feudatory Gangas , produced such woods as sandal , timber , teak and ebony . Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and <unk> . 
 The Deccan was rich in minerals , though its soil was not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains . The copper mines of Cudappah , Bellary , Chanda , <unk> , <unk> , Ahmadnagar , Bijapur and <unk> were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy . Diamonds were mined in Cudappah , Bellary , Kurnool and Golconda ; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres . The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra . Mysore with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry . 
 The Rashtrakuta empire controlled most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade . The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of <unk> , one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time . The empire 's chief exports were cotton yarn , cotton cloth , muslins , hides , mats , indigo , incense , perfumes , betel nuts , coconuts , sandal , teak , timber , sesame oil and ivory . Its major imports were pearls , gold , dates from Arabia , slaves , Italian wines , tin , lead , topaz , <unk> , sweet clover , flint glass , antimony , gold and silver coins , singing boys and girls ( for the entertainment of the royalty ) from other lands . Trading in horses was an important and profitable business , monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants . The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden Gadyanaka on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver <unk> ( a coin ) on vessels travelling locally . 
 Artists and craftsman operated as corporations ( guilds ) rather than as individual business . Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers , oilmen , artisans , basket and mat makers and fruit sellers . A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region . Some guilds were considered superior to others , just as some corporations were , and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges . Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and , like village assemblies , they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses . 
 The government 's income came from five principal sources : regular taxes , occasional taxes , fines , income taxes , miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories . An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress , such as when it faced natural calamities , or was preparing for war or overcoming war 's ravages . Income tax included taxes on crown land , wasteland , specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy , mines , salt , treasures unearthed by prospectors . Additionally , customary presents were given to the king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son . 
 The king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants . The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes , including land taxes , produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda ( village head ) . Land taxes were varied , based on type of land , its produce and situation and ranged from 8 % to 16 % . A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region . The land tax may have been as high as 20 % to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war . In most of the kingdom , land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted . A portion of all taxes earned by the government ( usually 15 % ) was returned to the villages for maintenance . 
 Taxes were levied on artisans such as potters , sheep herders , weavers , oilmen , shopkeepers , stall owners , brewers and gardeners . Taxes on perishable items such as fish , meat , honey , medicine , fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16 % . Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines , implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active . The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim . Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes . Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The Rashtrakuta kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance . Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured , basing their evidence on inscriptions , coins and contemporary literature . Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards Jainism since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit , Kannada and a few in <unk> and Prakrit were Jains . The Rashtrakutas built well @-@ known Jain temples at locations such as <unk> in Bagalkot district and their loyal feudatory , the Western Ganga Dynasty , built Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire , modern Karnataka , accounting for more than 30 % of the population and dominating the culture of the region . King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious writing , Prashnottara Ratnamalika , " having bowed to <unk> ( Mahavira ) , I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika " . The mathematician Mahaviracharya wrote in his <unk> <unk> , " The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain . May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha , follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide . " Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age . 
 However , the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized <unk> , followers of the Shaiva , Vaishnava and Shakta faiths . Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva . The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom . King Dantidurga performed the <unk> ( horse sacrifice ) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga ( 753 ) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor , King Krishna I ( 768 ) , bear the legend Parama <unk> ( another name for Shiva ) . The kings ' titles such as <unk> showed their Vaishnava leanings . Their flag had the sign of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers , perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas . The famous <unk> temple at Ellora and other rock @-@ cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing . Their family deity was a goddess by name <unk> ( also known as <unk> , Manasa <unk> ) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom . They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths . The temple at <unk> was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at <unk> was meant for worshipers of Shiva , Vishnu and Bhaskara ( Surya , the sun god ) . 
 In short , the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions , Jainism , <unk> and Shaivism . Buddhism too found support and was popular in places such as Dambal and Balligavi , although it had declined significantly by this time . The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara 's Advaita philosophy . Islamic contact with South India began as early as the 7th century , a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands . <unk> <unk> existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts , specifically in towns such as <unk> and Nagore . Muslim settlers married local women ; their children were known as Mappilas ( Moplahs ) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 Chronicles mention more castes than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system , some as many as seven castes . One traveller 's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins , Kshatriya , Vaishya and Sudras . The <unk> or <unk> caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics . People in the professions of sailing , hunting , weaving , <unk> , basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes . The <unk> caste provided many menial services to the wealthy . Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society ; only those Kshatriyas in the Sat @-@ Kshatriya sub @-@ caste ( noble Kshatriyas ) were higher in status . 
 The careers of Brahmins usually related to education , the judiciary , astrology , mathematics , poetry and philosophy or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts . Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non @-@ Brahminical professions ( agriculture , trade in betel nuts and martial posts ) . Capital punishment , although widespread , was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub @-@ castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes ( as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime ) . As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin 's right hand and left foot was severed , leaving that person disabled . 
 By the 9th century , kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India . Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary , but the children of the Vaishya and Shudra castes were not allowed . <unk> by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys , but was relatively frequent among other castes . Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided . 
 Joint families were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even father and son have been recorded in inscriptions . Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women . The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women . Among Brahmins , boys married at or below 16 years of age and the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger . This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes . Sati ( a custom in which a dead man 's widow would immolate herself on her husband 's funeral pyre ) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families . The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged . The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes . 
 In the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth , a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a dhoti for the lower part of the body . Only kings could wear turbans , a practice that spread to the masses much later . Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers , both male and female , in the king 's palace . Devadasis ( girls were " married " to a deity or temple ) were often present in temples . Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or different species . The <unk> inscription ( hero stone , virgal ) was made for the favourite hound of the feudatory Western Ganga King Butuga II that died fighting a wild boar in a hunt . There are records of game preserves for hunting by royalty . Astronomy and astrology were well developed as subjects of study , and there were many superstitious beliefs such as catching a snake alive proved a woman 's chastity . Old persons suffering from incurable diseases preferred to end their lives by drowning in the sacred waters of a pilgrim site or by a ritual burning . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Kannada became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth , dignity and productivity . This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era . Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose , poetry , rhetoric , the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain tirthankars . Bilingual writers such as <unk> gained fame , and noted scholars such as the Mahaviracharya wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I. 
 Kavirajamarga ( 850 ) by King Amoghavarsha I is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada , though it is evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries . Kavirajamarga is a guide to poets ( <unk> ) that aims to standardize these various styles . The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita , perhaps the 6th @-@ century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty . 
 The Jain writer Adikavi Pampa , widely regarded as one of the most influential Kannada writers , became famous for Adipurana ( 941 ) . Written in champu ( mixed prose @-@ verse style ) style , it is the life history of the first Jain tirthankara <unk> . Pampa 's other notable work was Vikramarjuna Vijaya ( 941 ) , the author 's version of the Hindu epic , Mahabharata , with Arjuna as the hero . Also called Pampa Bharata , it is a eulogy of the writer 's patron , King Chalukya <unk> of <unk> ( a Rashtrakuta feudatory ) , comparing the king 's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna . Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work . 
 Another notable Jain writer in Kannada was Sri Ponna , patronised by King Krishna III and famed for <unk> , his account of the life of <unk> , the 16th Jain tirthankara . He earned the title <unk> <unk> ( supreme poet in two languages ) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit . His other writings in Kannada were Bhuvanaika @-@ <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called " gems of Kannada literature " . 
 Prose works in Sanskrit was prolific during this era as well . Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya , a native of Gulbarga , who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was <unk> , a writing in 9 chapters . <unk> of 950 wrote in the court of Arikesari II , a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in <unk> . He was the author of <unk> champu , <unk> and other writings . The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics . The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthasastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner . <unk> , a Jain ascetic from <unk> in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka . He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine . 
 Trivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III . His classics were <unk> ( 915 ) , the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit , Damayanti Katha , <unk> and <unk> plates . Legend has it that Goddess Saraswati helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the kings court . Jinasena was the spiritual preceptor and guru of Amoghavarsha I. A theologian , his contributions are Dhavala and <unk> ( written with another theologian Virasena ) . These writings are named after their patron king who was also called <unk> . Other contributions from Jinasena were Adipurana , later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan . Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools : Ellora , around Badami , Aihole and Pattadakal , and at <unk> near Gulbarga . The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock @-@ cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta , areas also occupied by Jain monks , located in present @-@ day Maharashtra . The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence . Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods . 
 The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re @-@ dedicated the rock @-@ cut shrines . Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period . The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple , a splendid achievement confirming the " <unk> " status as " one among the four principal Kings of the world " . The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana , Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings . 
 The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan . The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy . It does not contain any of the <unk> common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka . According to art historian Vincent Smith , the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock @-@ cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world . According to art historian Percy Brown , as an accomplishment of art , the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture , a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers . 
 While some scholars have claimed the architecture at Elephanta is attributable to the Kalachuri , others claim that it was built during the Rashtrakuta period . Some of the sculptures such as Nataraja and Sadashiva excel in beauty and craftsmanship even that of the Ellora sculptures . Famous sculptures at Elephanta include Ardhanarishvara and <unk> . The latter , a three faced bust of Lord Shiva , is 25 feet ( 8 m ) tall and considered one of the finest pieces of sculpture in India . It is said that , in the world of sculpture , few works of art depicting a divinity are as balanced . Other famous rock @-@ cut temples in the Maharashtra region are the <unk> Lena and <unk> cave temples in Ellora ( famous for its sculptures of Vishnu and <unk> ) and the <unk> temple near Mumbai . 
 In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal , a UNESCO World Heritage site . Other well @-@ known temples are the <unk> temple at Konnur , Brahmadeva temple at Savadi , the <unk> , <unk> II , <unk> and <unk> temples at Aihole , Mallikarjuna temple at Ron , <unk> temple at <unk> ( <unk> ) , Someshwara temple at <unk> , Jain temples at <unk> , <unk> temple at Kuknur , <unk> temple at Sandur , numerous temples at <unk> in Gulbarga , and the <unk> temple at Gadag which was later expanded by Kalyani Chalukyas . Archeological study of these temples show some have the stellar ( <unk> ) plan later to be used profusely by the Hoysalas at Belur and Halebidu . One of the richest traditions in Indian architecture took shape in the Deccan during this time which Adam Hardy calls Karnata dravida style as opposed to traditional Dravida style . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 With the ending of the Gupta Dynasty in northern India in the early 6th century , major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India . These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural . The royal courts of peninsular India ( outside of Tamilakam ) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture . Inscriptions , including those that were bilingual , demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit . Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land . The local language formed the desi ( popular ) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga ( formal ) . Educational institutions and places of higher learning ( <unk> ) taught in Sanskrit , the language of the learned Brahmins , while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity . The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries . 
 Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century . Kavirajamarga , the work on poetics , refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as " Kannada country " . Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda , Vyakarana ( grammar ) , Jyotisha ( astronomy and astrology ) , Sahitya ( literature ) , <unk> ( Exegesis ) , <unk> ( law ) , Puranas ( ritual ) , and Nyaya ( logic ) . An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya ( classical ) style of writing was popular . The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they , though mediocre poets , had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit . An inscription in Kannada by King Krishna III , written in a poetic Kanda metre , has been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh . Kavirajamarga , a work on poetics in Kannada by Amoghavarsha I , shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time . Trivikrama 's Sanskrit writing , <unk> , is perhaps the earliest in the champu style from the Deccan .

 The game is the third installment of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy , in which the events take place between the first two games in the series , Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos . The player controls Ryu Hayabusa as he is framed for the murder of Irene Lew and investigates the circumstances behind her death . He eventually discovers a plan by CIA agent Foster and another person named Clancy to utilize an interdimensional rift to create and control a race of energy @-@ infused superhuman mutants . The game features similar gameplay from its previous two Ninja Gaiden titles and includes some new features such as the ability to hang overhead from pipes and sword power @-@ ups . 
 As with the previous titles , Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics . Early reviews praised the game for its plot , gameplay , and difficulty ; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish , inconsistent level designs , and the game 's difficulty level , in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues , stronger enemies , and omission of a password system . The Atari Lynx port , while receiving general praise for graphics and controls , received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items , attributing it to the Lynx 's small screen .

 Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom takes place between the events of the original Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos . The story opens with Irene Lew , one of the protagonists in the first two Ninja Gaiden titles , an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency on a mission called " Cardinal " . She gets chased to the edge of a cliff by a man who looks like Ryu Hayabusa , when the edge gives way , and Irene falls in the water to her apparent death . Ryu is accused of Irene 's murder but says it was not him , that it was somebody else who looked like him who tried to frame him . He first investigates a laboratory that Irene was investigating . After going through the laboratory , a mysterious man appears and tells Ryu to go the Castle Rock fortress , where he will give Ryu more information about Irene when he gets there . 
 On his way to the outer limits of Castle Rock fortress , Ryu encounters Foster , who was the head of the CIA 's Special Auxiliary Unit in the first Ninja Gaiden game , via a video image . After saying that nobody has ever made it through the fortress ' defenses alive , Ryu inquires about Irene , to which Foster replies : " I don 't know what you 're talking about . " Ryu vows to push on , Upon reaching the foundation of Castle Rock fortress , Ryu encounters his " original " , or a person designed to look like Ryu , and finds out that it was he who killed Irene . They both thrust themselves at each other , and afterwards look @-@ alike tells Ryu that he has gained all of his powers . The look @-@ alike flees , saying that Foster ordered him not to eliminate Ryu quite yet . 
 When Ryu reaches Castle Rock fortress , he encounters the stranger whom he met after his trip to the laboratory , who reveals his name as Clancy . He tells Ryu about a project he and Foster have been working on called the " Biohazard plan " . Clancy says that he can no longer work with Foster . He said Foster was designing creatures called " bio @-@ noids " – transformed superhumans that are infused with " life energy " that flows from an interdimensional rift that appeared after the demon from the first Ninja Gaiden game was defeated . He explained that this rift appeared at the site of the Castle Rock ruins , in which Foster rebuilt in order to harness this power . Clancy reveals that it was a bio @-@ noid that killed Irene , and that Foster controls the bio @-@ noids ; he pleas to Ryu to stop Foster . After making his way into the fortress , he encounters Foster and the look @-@ alike . Foster vows to eliminate Ryu and use the life energy from the rift and Ryu 's secrets of the Dragon Clan to make him into an all @-@ powerful bio @-@ noid . Just as Foster and the look @-@ alike advance on Ryu , Irene appears , to the amazement of both Ryu and Foster , and is armed with a machine gun ; she was working with the army with regards to Foster 's plan . The look @-@ alike then transmutes into a bio @-@ noid , which Ryu defeats . 
 After the defeat of the look @-@ alike bio @-@ noid , the door to the interdimensional rift throws wide open , and Clancy appears , telling Ryu , Irene , and Foster that they were all used as pawns in his plan to take over the ruins and claim all the life energy as his . Foster tries to follow Clancy through the door , but the energy tears him apart and is destroyed . Ryu instructs Irene to stay behind while he goes through the rift into the subspace , as he knows that he will be protected from the power that is inside . Ryu encounters the look @-@ alike bio @-@ noid again while inside the subspace , who was resurrected and transmuted into a super creature . After he defeats the look @-@ alike , Ryu is instantly teleported into a room , where he meets Clancy once again . He tells Ryu that he has already claimed the life energy as his and explains the truth behind Castle Rock – that the ruins are a dimensional warship called the " Ancient Ship of Doom " . He says that " these super @-@ dimensional ruins are the foundation upon which a new world will be created " , and that it will now be where all new life will originate from . The ship reappears in the real world , and Clancy then fires a test shot from the ship into the distance to demonstrate its power , which Irene watches in horror . He then drops Ryu through a trap door to the outside of the ship . 
 Ryu fights back to the inner chambers of the Ancient Ship of Doom , where he prepares to engage in the final showdown against Clancy , who has now transmuted into a super bio @-@ noid . Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age , but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle . After transforming twice into progressively @-@ stronger versions of himself , Clancy is defeated by Ryu , and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene ; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes , and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress . In the aftermath , Ryu tells Irene that Clancy 's and Foster 's plan have been foiled , and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone 's evil plans ; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition . The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom is a side @-@ scrolling platform game in which the player controls the player character Ryu Hayabusa as he investigates the events behind Irene Lew 's death . In the game , Ryu can jump , hang , and climb up and down walls with the control pad ; pressing the jump button while holding the control pad the direction away from the wall causes Ryu to spring off the wall . Ryu is also able to attack enemies with secondary weapons while on a wall by pressing the attack button . A new feature introduced in Ninja Gaiden III is the ability for Ryu to hang overhead from pipes or ivy ; he can swing up on top or drop from them , and as with walls , he can only attack enemies while hanging with secondary weapons . 
 As with the previous Ninja Gaiden games , Ryu 's physical strength is represented by a life meter on the top of the screen ; it decreases when Ryu gets his enemies or other dangerous objects . Throughout the levels , the player can find " Recovery Medicine " bottles that partially replenish Ryu 's physical strength ; as with all other items in the game , they are located in crystal balls that Ryu must slash to open . The player loses a " life " when Ryu 's life meter runs out , he falls into a pit , or if the timer runs out . The game ends when players lose all their lives , but they can continue and resume play at the beginning of the Act in which they have lost all their lives . However , in Ninja Gaiden III , players only get five continues total before being required to restart the game from the beginning . 
 Ryu can defeat enemies by attacking with his Dragon Sword or by using secondary weapons which consume Ryu 's " ninja power " ; such weapons include the following : " Windmill Throwing Stars " which move back and forth like boomerangs , " Fire Dragon Balls " which launch fireballs downward at an angle , the " Fire Wheel Art " which launches fireballs upward at an angle , the " Invincible Fire Wheel " that forms a series of rotating of fireballs around Ryu and destroys any enemy who comes into contact , and a new weapon in this series called the " Vacuum Wave Art " which hurls vacuum blades above and below Ryu simultaneously . Players can collect red and blue capsules to refill Ryu 's ninja power , and they can also collect " Scrolls of the spirit of the Dragon " to increase Ryu 's maximum ninja power level . Another new item in Ninja Gaiden III is the " Dragon Spirit Sword " that increases Ryu range of his sword . At the end of each Act is a boss which has its own life meter that decreases when damaged ; Ryu can defeat the boss by completely depleting its life meter . Ninja Gaiden III 's first four bosses consist of the " bio @-@ noids " – super @-@ human creatures created and controlled by Foster to take over the world ; they each represent the four elementals : earth , wind , fire , and water .

 Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom was ported by Tiger Electronics as an LCD handheld game . This port features five levels in which Ryu must reach the end of each level by defeating various robots with his Dragon Sword and a " ninja weapon ball " . At the end of each level , Ryu fights a boss ; the first four levels ' bosses are the same bio @-@ noids from the NES version , while the fifth level 's final enemy is the " Giant Boss " , which must be defeated to beat the game . Gameplay is similar to the NES version , in that Ryu and the bosses have life meters and that they feature similar items . Features included built @-@ in sound which could be muted , battery backup high score , and an automatic switch @-@ off feature in which the device shuts off after three minutes of inactivity . 
 = = Development = = 
 Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom was developed and released by Tecmo , who also did the previous two games in the series , Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos . It was released in Japan on June 26 , 1991 ( 1991 @-@ 06 @-@ 26 ) for the Famicom under the title Ninja Ryūkenden III : Yomi no <unk> ; it was released in North America for the NES in August 1991 . It was ported to the Atari Lynx in 1993 by Atari , and then Tecmo re @-@ released the game as part of its Ninja Gaiden Trilogy Super NES compilation in 1995 . It was released for the Wii 's Virtual Console service in North America on February 18 , 2008 ( 2008 @-@ 02 @-@ 18 ) . 
 Ninja Gaiden III was designed by Masato Kato , who took over Hideo Yoshizawa 's main role in the game 's development from the previous two titles . In an interview with Kato , he said that Ninja Gaiden III needed " to go into a new direction " . The game was given more of a science @-@ fiction motif as opposed to the Cthulhu Mythos motif in the previous two titles ; the enemies changed to look more robotic than in the previous games . The original intent from the developers was to make the game easier than the previous titles , " to create a game a normal player can enjoy " . However , the perceived popularity of difficult video games in North America caused Tecmo to release the game for the NES with a much higher difficulty level than the Japanese version . They also decided to place the events of Ninja Gaiden III between the events of the first two titles in order to maintain continuity ; they figured that it was too difficult to continue the story after Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos , so they developed the plot sometime before the events of Ninja Gaiden II that revolved around the game 's main antagonist , Foster . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom received preview coverage in video gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly , where it was displayed at the Consumer Software Group trade show in Tokyo on March 24 – 25 , 1991 . They said that Ninja Gaiden III was the best Famicom game in display there , that it " easily walked away with the best for this system ! " The game was also previewed in the July 1991 issue of Nintendo Power . They said that the game contained all the old features of previous Ninja Gaiden games which included ninja arts ( but they lamented at the lack of the " jump and slash " , absent from Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos ) and similar usage of cinematic cutscenes that made the original Ninja Gaiden game popular . They also particularly praised the new moves Ryu had as well as an excellent plot . GamePro magazine previewed the game in August 1991 . They said that the game 's visuals were good and on par with the previous titles and that the scrolling was great . 
 The game was featured in Electronic Gaming Monthly 's July 1991 issue as an " EGM Exclusive " . They praised the game , saying " Ninja Gaiden gets better every time ! " It was also one of the featured games in the August 1991 issue of Nintendo Power , where it received 11 pages of coverage , which included a full walkthrough of the first four Acts plus a brief plot overview of the entire game . It was in this issue where Ninja Gaiden III was purported to be the final Ninja Gaiden game by Tecmo . As in their preview , they gave praise to the action , gameplay , elaborate plot , and difficulty . GamePro reviewed the game in its September 1991 issue . The magazine gave the game top ratings in all categories except sound . They noted the difficulty level as being dictated by the enemies ' strategic placements in the various environments ; they added that while Act 1 is easy , the remainder of the game is very difficult . The review praised the usage and usefulness of the secondary weapons , Ryu 's new ability to hang overhead , and the new addition of the sword power @-@ up , which it said bore resemblance to the game Strider . They slightly criticized the game for leaving out the " cloning " power @-@ up from Ninja Gaiden II : The Dark Sword of Chaos as well as the limited continues and lack of passwords . In March 1992 , Ninja Gaiden III received three nominations in the " Nintendo Power Awards ' 91 " in the following NES @-@ related categories : " Best Graphics and Sound " , " Best Challenge " , and " Best Overall " . It won in the " Best Challenge " category ; the magazine commented that " the game @-@ playing public knows a challenging game when they see one ! " It placed second in the " Best Graphics and Sound " category , finishing behind Battletoads for the top spot . It was the ranked as the third " Best Overall " NES title for 1991 , finishing close behind Tecmo Super Bowl . 
 The Atari Lynx version of Ninja Gaiden III also received coverage in various magazines in 1994 . In GamePro magazine , they criticized the fact that the Lynx 's small screen makes it difficult for players to see the various power @-@ ups and enemies and to use secondary weapons . However , they praised the good controls , and they said the sound was fine though " weird and spacy " . VideoGames & Computer Entertainment praised the game for being better than the arcade version that was previously ported to the Lynx , but they were disappointed that Tecmo did not port the first two NES Ninja Gaiden titles to the handheld , as well . Electronic Gaming Monthly praised Tecmo for a good translation of the game from the NES to the Lynx – complete with good graphics , controls , and varied gameplay – while saying that " Ninja Gaiden [ III ] is a game that the Atari Lynx has been longing for " . Despite that , the reviewers noted that the Lynx 's small screen made all the sprites too small for most players to see well , and the screen 's blurring makes it frustrating for players to track character movements . In a retrospective review , Allgame gave a mostly negative review , saying that the background makes it difficult to see foreground elements , that players cannot see their character or what power @-@ ups they are collecting , and that sound is very poor , saying " thirteen banshees all wailing different , off @-@ key songs would only begin to approach just how bad the music is " . 
 A few modern video gaming websites reviewed Ninja Gaiden III upon its release to the Virtual Console in 2008 . Nintendo Life 's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings , saying that the game " passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast " . He added that while the presentation was great , he pointed out flaws in the " silly " plot , the inconsistently laid @-@ out level designs , and frustrating difficulty in addition to the five @-@ continue limit . He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one . IGN 's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu 's ability to scale and climb on top of walls , his ability to hang overhead , good storyline , and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power @-@ up and the Vacuum Wave . His chief criticism was the game 's difficulty , saying that it 's not the " rewarding kind of difficult " but instead " the cheap , annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to throw your controller at the TV screen and just go read a book " . As with the Nintendo Life review , Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre , including " weird science @-@ fiction themes about <unk> and clones " . 
 In a retrospective of the Ninja Gaiden series , Eurogamer said that Ninja Gaiden III was the only game in the NES trilogy not to make it to Europe . They made similar criticisms about the difficulty level , saying that the North American version was made more difficult than the Japanese version by utilizing limited continues , making the enemies much more powerful , and removing the password system present in the Japanese version . They said the story was too outlandish , calling the plot , of which a short @-@ lived anime Ninja Gaiden series would loosely be based , " a glorious load of old bollocks " . While the version from Ninja Gaiden Trilogy for the Super NES remedied most of their criticisms , they said that the game added new frustrations which included slower framerates , lower @-@ quality controls , and the omission and shuffling around of several tracks , which they said " is precisely the sort of thing that makes die @-@ hard videogame fans apoplectic with rage " . 
 = Calbovista = 
 Calbovista is a fungal genus containing the single species Calbovista subsculpta , commonly known as the sculptured puffball , sculptured giant puffball , and warted giant puffball . It is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America . The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) , white becoming brownish in age , and covered with shallow pyramid @-@ shaped plates or scales . It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations , from summer to autumn . 
 Although the puffball was originally described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935 , it was not published validly until 60 years later . The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta , from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts , and microscopically by the antler @-@ like branches of its capillitium ( thread @-@ like material among the spores ) . Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh ( the gleba ) is still firm and white . As the puffball matures , its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In her 1935 Mycologia article , American mycologist Elizabeth Eaton Morse noted the existence of an abundant and widely distributed puffball of the western United States that was commonly misidentified as Calvatia sculpta , although it differed from that species in having extensively branched capillitial threads . The puffball had characteristics that aligned it with several other taxa . The peridium was similar to those of Calvatia sculpta , Calvatia <unk> ( now known as Calvatia <unk> ) , Scleroderma <unk> , and Scleroderma <unk> ( now Scleroderma citrinum ) ; the rooting base was similar to Bovistella ; and the structure of the capillitial threads reminiscent of Bovista , Bovistella , and Mycenastrum . However , the new species had a unique combination of characteristics and did not fit neatly into any already @-@ described genera . As a result , Morse circumscribed the new genus Calbovista to contain Calbovista sculpta . The type collection was made at Soda Springs , California in May 1934 at an elevation of 6 @,@ 767 ft ( 2 @,@ 063 m ) . Morse 's publication of the genus was invalid because it lacked a description in Latin — a requirement of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature that was implemented effective January 1 , 1935 . The genus and species were published validly with a Latin description by Michelle Seidl in 1995 . 
 Alexander H. Smith described a variety , Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa , in 1965 , based on a collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest ( northeastern Washington ) in 1964 . This variety , known only from the type locality , differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales . Because it was based on an invalid genus , it too was invalid ; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa <unk> ex <unk> & <unk> Wyk . 
 Calbovista is usually classified in the family Lycoperdaceae , although the nomenclatural status of this group is unclear , as some authorities lump it into the Agaricaceae . By contrast , Sanford Myron Zeller placed Calbovista in <unk> , a family erected by him in 1948 to contain Calbovista and Mycenastrum , two genera united by similarities in capillitial morphology . Mycenastraceae is not currently considered to have independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae . 
 The genus name Calbovista combines the parts cal , referring to the genus 's puffball ally Calvatia , and <unk> , alluding to the genus 's similarity to Bovista and Bovistella . The specific epithet subsculpta refers to its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta , a species with which it had been frequently confused . Common names used to refer to the fungus include the sculptured puffball , sculptured giant puffball , and warted giant puffball . 
 = = Description = = 
 Fruit bodies are irregularly top @-@ shaped to roughly spherical , measuring 7 – 17 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 7 in ) wide by 6 – 12 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) high . It has a two @-@ layered peridium . The outer layer of the peridium ( the exoperidium ) is thick and leathery ( except where it thins toward the base ) , measuring 5 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) thick . It is divided into irregular three- to six @-@ sided , low pyramids that are usually blunt , but sometimes pointed . The pyramids are 5 – 8 mm thick . They have parallel markings , a feature Morse attributed to the differences in growth rate caused by variations in daytime and nighttime temperatures . The pyramid centers have short brownish hairs . The pyramids cover the entire peridium except for near the base , where it is smooth . Warts on the surface of young fruit bodies may be disproportionately thick . 
 The inner peridium is a thin shiny tissue that is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates . The puffball base , which occupies about a third to a quarter of the bottom of the fruit body , consists of moderately @-@ sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed . The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering . The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs . Initially white , the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature . As the gleba dries , the inner peridium dries and cracks , exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales . The gleba is supported by a yellowish @-@ brown to light brown <unk> . 
 The spherical spores measure 3 – 5 μm , including an outer covering ( an <unk> ) of about 0 @.@ 5 μm . Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted . They have an oil droplet , and a translucent pedicel ( a small stalk ) up to 2 @.@ 5 μm long . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 10 – 12 @.@ 5 μm long by 5 – 7 @.@ 5 μm wide . The capillitium comprises short , highly branched ( resembling antlers ) and entangled threads measuring 5 – 10 μm wide with walls up to 2 @.@ 5 μm thick . <unk> threads do not have septa . 
 The puffballs are edible when the interior gleba is still firm and white . The flesh has no odor and a mild taste . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 In the field , Calbovista puffballs are sometimes difficult to reliably distinguish from Calvatia sculpta . Although the latter species has prominent pyramidal warts , some specimens of Calbovista ( especially young ones ) may share this feature and the distinction between them becomes blurred . Microscopic differences can be used to tell the two species apart : Calvatia puffballs do not have a highly branched and entangled capillitium . Another lookalike , Mycenastrum corium , has a smooth peridium , a reduced or absent base , tends to split open in maturity into irregularly shaped sections , and has spiny capillitial threads . Calvatia subcretacea , also found in high elevations under conifers in western North America , has smaller fruit bodies , measuring up to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) high and 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide . It has small pointed warts with gray tips . Calvatia booniana is a large puffball — up to 60 cm ( 24 in ) in diameter — found in open pastures and grassy areas of the western United States that has flat polygonal scales on the outer peridium . In addition to its larger size , it differs from Calbovista in that it lacks a sterile base and its capillitia are less branched and have septa . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Calbovista is a saprobic species , decomposing dead plant material . Its fruit bodies grow singly , in groups , or occasionally in clusters . Fruiting occurs from April to August in areas with broken rocks mixed with soil , or in open coniferous forest at elevations ranging from 3 @,@ 000 to 11 @,@ 000 ft ( 900 to 3 @,@ 400 m ) . Another usual habitat is on road sides . Calbovista is a common mountain puffball . Its distribution covers the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of the western United States . On the eastern side of the Cascade Range , the puffball is often found growing under ponderosa pine . It has been collected from California , Colorado , Idaho , Washington , Wyoming , and Oregon . Its range extends north to British Columbia and Alaska . The puffball is often found by morel hunters in the spring , as it grows in similar habitats . 
 = SM U @-@ 20 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 20 or U @-@ XX was the lead boat of the U @-@ 20 class of submarines or U @-@ boats built for and operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) during the First World War . The design for U @-@ 20 was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy 's Havmanden class ( three of which had been built in Austria @-@ Hungary ) , and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war . 
 U @-@ 20 was just over 127 feet ( 39 m ) long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes , a deck gun , and a machine gun . U @-@ 20 had no wartime successes and was sunk in early July 1918 by the Italian submarine F @-@ 12 . The wreck of U @-@ 20 was located in 1962 and salvaged . A portion of her conning tower is on display in a military museum in Vienna . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 When it became apparent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short war , they moved to bolster their U @-@ boat fleet by seizing the plans for Denmark 's Havmanden class submarines , three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume . Although the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design , which was largely obsolete , it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for U @-@ 20 and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915 . 
 U @-@ 20 was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Pola Navy Yard . Due to demands by the Hungarian government , subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms , but this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design and resulted in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general . 
 U @-@ 20 was an ocean @-@ going submarine that displaced 173 tonnes ( 191 short tons ) surfaced and 210 tonnes ( 231 short tons ) submerged and was designed for a complement of 18 . She was 127 feet 2 inches ( 38 @.@ 76 m ) long with a beam of 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . For propulsion , she featured a single propeller shaft , a single 450 bhp ( 340 kW ) diesel engine for surface running , and a single 160 shp ( 120 kW ) electric motor for submerged travel . She was capable of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) while surfaced and 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 20 , the Havmanden class , upon which the U @-@ 20 class was based , had a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) , surfaced , and 23 nautical miles ( 43 km ) at 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) submerged . 
 U @-@ 20 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 66 mm / 26 ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 U @-@ 20 was laid down on 29 September 1915 , six months after she was ordered , and was launched on 18 September 1916 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 Upon completion , U @-@ 20 began diving trials . On her 15 March 1917 trial , she was accidentally rammed by Admiral Spaun in the Fasana Channel . The collision with the Austro @-@ Hungarian light cruiser twisted U @-@ 20 's periscope , extensively damaged the conning tower , and knocked off her deck gun . After seven months of reconstruction , U @-@ 20 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 20 October . 
 After initially operating out of Pola , U @-@ 20 was transferred to Trieste in February 1918 . Over the next three months , the U @-@ boat patrolled in the northern Adriatic between the Tagliamento estuary and Venice . U @-@ 20 had an encounter with an enemy submarine on 7 April but was not able to successfully launch an attack . On 3 July , Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Müller sailed U @-@ 20 out from Trieste for the Gulf of Venice . A day later , U @-@ 20 was spotted by the Italian submarine F @-@ 12 , which was on patrol in the northern Adriatic . F @-@ 12 initially pursued U @-@ 20 underwater , and then on the surface . At a range of 650 yards ( 590 m ) , F @-@ 12 torpedoed U @-@ 20 at position 45 ° 29 ′ N 13 ° 05 ′ E , sinking her with all hands . There was no wreckage on the surface , only an oil slick . Like all of her sister boats , U @-@ 20 had no wartime successes . 
 In mid 1962 , the wreck of U @-@ 20 was discovered in the northern Adriatic . Italian salvage crews raised the boat 's rear portion on 22 July and her front section on 21 November . The conning tower and a small midships section of U @-@ 20 were donated to the <unk> Museum in Vienna , where they are on display , while the rest of the boat was scrapped . The remains of the crewmen were buried on the grounds of the Theresian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt . 
 = Effects of Typhoon Bopha in Micronesia and Palau = 
 The effects of Typhoon Bopha in the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau were significant , though limited in extent in comparison to the cyclone 's intensity . Typhoon Bopha originated from a tropical depression south of Pohnpei on November 25 , 2012 , and tracked generally westward for more than a week . During this time , it threatened several islands across Micronesia , prompting the issuance of typhoon watches and warnings . The system skirted the Nomoi Islands on November 28 where it caused limited damage . Thereafter , it became a threat to Palau as an intense typhoon . Residents there boarded up their homes and some evacuated to public shelters while officials enacted a strict curfew during the typhoon 's passage . Bopha passed 55 km ( 35 mi ) south of Angaur island , or 100 km ( 65 mi ) south of Babeldaob , on December 2 with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . 
 Damage was most severe in the states of Angaur , Melekeok , Ngiwal , and Ngaraard where storm surge damaged or destroyed many homes . Electricity and water service in many areas was lost during the storm , and remained so for over a week in the hardest hit areas . Throughout Palau , 92 homes were destroyed while 59 others sustained severe damage . Total damage amounted to US $ 10 @.@ 1 million with repair costs estimated at US $ 15 – 20 million . A state of emergency was declared on December 5 while the Palau Red Cross Society assisted with recovery efforts . Palau 's congress allocated US $ 10 million for relief while international donors provided a collective US $ 235 @,@ 000 in aid . 
 = = Background = = 
 On November 25 , 2012 , a tropical depression developed to the south of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia . Initially tracking northwest and later due west under the influence of a strong subtropical ridge to its north , the system intensified into a tropical storm the following day at which time it received the name Bopha . The storm passed roughly 65 km ( 40 mi ) south of the Nomoi Islands early on November 28 . After slowly intensifying for several days Bopha underwent a period of rapid intensification from November 30 to December 1 , with its central pressure falling from 990 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 39 inHg ) to 945 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 91 inHg ) . The system reached its initial peak intensity on December 2 with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated Bopha to have been a much stronger storm , with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , a high @-@ end Category 4 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . 
 Around 06 : 00 UTC , Bopha passed 100 km ( 65 mi ) south of Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak . Shortly thereafter it made its closest approach the nation , tracking roughly 55 km ( 35 mi ) south of Angaur island . After clearing Palau , Bopha ultimately intensified further before making a devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines . The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) , a Category 5 on the SSHWS . The storm resulted in up to 1 @,@ 901 fatalities in the country and tremendous infrastructural damage . Land interaction substantially weakened the system by the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea . Turning north , Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December 6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification . After reaching its tertiary peak on December 7 , hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening . In a 24 ‑ hour span , the typhoon 's central pressure rose by 55 mbar ( hPa ; 1 @.@ 62 inHg ) while its winds fell from 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) to 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December 9 .

 Upon the Joint Typhoon Warning Center 's declaration of Tropical Depression 26W on November 26 , a tropical storm watch was issued for Nukuoro and Lukunor in the FSM . Hours later , the watch was superseded by a tropical storm warning while new watches were declared for <unk> and Chuuk . The watch was expanded during the afternoon of November 27 to include Poluwat . As the storm moved westward through the FSM and intensified on November 28 , a typhoon watch was issued for Woleai ; tropical storm warnings for the Nomoi Islands , Poluwat , and Satawal ; a tropical storm watch was also put in place for Faraulep . Throughout November 29 , watches and warnings were discontinued across the FSM , with all being canceled by the evening hours . During the morning of November 30 , the remaining advisories were discontinued ; however , new typhoon watches were issued for Koror , Ngulu Atoll , and a tropical storm watch for Yap and <unk> . 
 Prior to the storm 's arrival , the Micronesia Red Cross Society began stockpiling relief materials on Yap and Chuuk . Emergency communication testing , via satellite phones , was also conducted with regional offices . On November 30 , residents in Palau were urged to secure their homes in preparation for the typhoon . They were also advised to stock up on emergency supplies that would last for at least three days . The storm delayed shipment of emergency food supplies to a boarding school on a remote island in Micronesia . 
 Beginning on November 27 and continuing through December 3 , the National Emergency Management Office in Palau issued more than ten detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare . In response , numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic . On December 1 , a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm . As a precautionary measure , the nations electric grid was shut down at 6 : 00 p.m. local time on December 2 . All flights to and from Roman <unk> International Airport were suspended during the morning of December 3 . A strict curfew was put in place for the city of Koror for the duration of the typhoon . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Across Micronesia , impact from the typhoon was fairly limited . Winds on Nukuoro were estimated at 45 – 75 km / h ( 30 – 45 mph ) , resulting in minor damage to buildings and crops . Losses on the atoll reached $ 10 @,@ 000 . Lukunor , located farther west , experienced similar winds ; however , damage was slightly more severe . Notable coastal impact took place , with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged . Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 During the early hours of December 3 , Typhoon Bopha made its closest approach to Palau , bringing heavy rains and strong winds to much of the archipelago . Winds up to 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) impacted Angaur and 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) in Peleliu . Widespread damage took place across the republic , with the most severe occurring in the states of Angaur , Peleliu , <unk> , Melekeok , Ngiwal , and Ngaraard . Initial assessments stated that 92 homes were destroyed and 59 others were severely damaged ; however , later reports stated that nearly 200 were destroyed . This left roughly 350 people homeless . Along eastern facing coasts , storm surge caused extensive coastal damage and , in some cases , pushed several hundred feet inland , cutting off roads and leaving behind several feet of debris . Hundreds of residents were forced to evacuate to higher ground as a result of the flooding . According to preliminary reports , Angaur Island experienced extensive damage from the storm . At least six homes were destroyed and travel was severely hampered due to downed trees and debris blocking roads . On Peleliu , eight large coral masses were driven onto the reef surrounding the island . Crops and vegetation across the island sustained heavy damage ; however , most homes were reportedly " ok " . 
 On the main island of Babeldaob , the coastal states of Melekeok , Ngiwal , and Ngaraard reported that nearly all homes along the shore were damaged or destroyed by storm surge . Power and water service was almost completely lost across the three states as well . In Koror , wind gusts up to 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) downed trees and power lines . Rainfall at the local National Weather Service office reached 84 mm ( 3 @.@ 32 in ) . Water and power systems across the republic were severely disrupted , with some areas remaining without service more than a week after the storm . Two schools in Ngaraard also sustained severe damage . Despite the severity of the storm , there were no reports of casualties . Across Palau , total damage to crops and property reached U $ 10 @.@ 1 million while the cost to repair damage from the storm was estimated at US $ 15 – 20 million .

 After the storm had moved through the region on December 2 , officials began allowing evacuees to return home on December 3 . The same day , all airports and roads were re @-@ opened ; however , some roads on Koror remained impassable due to damage from storm surge . Additionally , electricity shut off prior to the storm was restored on Koror . On December 5 , the President of Palau declared a state of emergency and US $ 10 million was authorized by congress for relief efforts . The Palau Red Cross Society began distributing clean @-@ up kits and communal tools in the eastern states of Melekeok , Ngaraard , and Ngiwal by December 7 . Further distributions on the southern islands of Anguar and Peleliu began the following day . A week after the typhoon 's passage , damage assessments across Palau had been completed and authorities had begun a large @-@ scale reconstruction of damaged properties . The operation , known as the Bopha Catastrophe Relief Committee , was being coordinated by Dr. Patrick <unk> , president of Palau Community College . The committee planned to build 30 homes across the republic : 10 in Ngaraard and 5 each in Angaur , Melekeok , Ngiwal , and Peleliu . By December 12 , telecommunications and water supplies were 95 percent restored while power had been brought back to 90 percent of capacity . Although water had been restored to most areas by December 13 , residents were advised to continue boiling water , especially in more populated locales until further notice . Schools resumed classes on December 17 across the republic ; however , several institutions were either temporarily relocated or had half days due to damage from the storm . On December 23 , the Government of Palau announced that , " in the holiday spirit " , December 24 and 31 would be declared national holidays for 2012 in light of the typhoon . In some areas , residents burned vegetative debris left behind by the storm . 
 By December 12 , Palau received a US $ 100 @,@ 000 grant from USAID and US $ 25 @,@ 000 from the Bank of Guam for relief efforts . On December 13 , the Government of Japan offered ¥ 5 million ( US $ 60 @,@ 000 ) worth of emergency goods , such as jerry cans and water purifiers , through the Japan International Cooperation Agency . The following day , the Republic of Korea provided US $ 50 @,@ 000 in humanitarian assistance to Palau through the local Red Cross . 
 = Robert Rossen = 
 Robert Rossen ( March 16 , 1908 – February 18 , 1966 ) was an American screenwriter , film director , and producer whose film career spanned almost three decades . 
 His 1949 film All the King 's Men won Oscars for Best Picture , Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress , while Rossen was nominated for an Oscar as Best Director . He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture . In 1961 he directed The Hustler , which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two . 
 After directing and writing for the stage in New York , Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937 . There he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941 , and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization , a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II . In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal Wallis 's newly formed production company , Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures , another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies , usually in collaboration with Columbia . 
 Rossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947 , and believed the Party was " dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in . " 
 He ended all relations with the Party in 1949 . Rossen was twice called before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , in 1951 and in 1953 . He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance , refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist . As a result , he found himself blacklisted by Hollywood studios as well as unable to renew his passport . At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and his blacklisting ended . In order to repair finances he produced his next film , Mambo , in Italy in 1954 . While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success , conflicts on the set of Lilith so disillusioned him that it was his last film . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Robert Rosen was born on March 16 , 1908 , and raised on the Lower East Side of New York City . His parents were Russian @-@ Jewish immigrants and his father was a rabbi . As a youth Rossen attended New York University , hustled pool and fought some prizefights . - the latter two providing crucial background for his two greatest films , Body and Soul and The Hustler , respectively . 
 He started his theatrical career as a stage manager and director in stock and off @-@ Broadway productions , mainly in the social and radical theaters that flourished in New York in the early and mid @-@ 1930s , as did John Huston , Elia Kazan and Joseph Losey . In 1932 Rossen directed John <unk> 's Steel , about labor agitation , and Richard Maibaum 's The Tree , about a lynching . A year later Rossen directed Birthright , in which Maibaum attacked Nazism , which had just triumphed in Germany with the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler in 1933 . 
 In 1935 Rossen wrote and directed his first play , The Body Beautiful , a comedy about a naive burlesque dancer . Although the play closed after four performances , Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy was so impressed that in 1936 he signed Rossen to a personal screenwriting contract . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 In 1936 Rossen married Susan Siegal ; the couple had three children . 
 = = = Work in Hollywood = = = 
 For his first credit in Hollywood , in 1937 Rossen co @-@ wrote with <unk> Finkel a script based on the prosecution of crime lord Lucky Luciano and eventually titled Marked Woman . Although some of Warner Bros. management saw Rossen as an unknown quantity , the result won praise from both Jack L. Warner and the Daily Worker . Rossen 's first solo script was for They Won 't Forget ( 1937 ) , a fictionalized account of the lynching of Leo Frank , featuring Lana Turner in her debut performance . 
 Dust Be My Destiny , co @-@ written in 1939 by Rossen , is the story of a fugitive from justice who is eventually acquitted with help from an attorney and a journalist , the latter arguing that " a million boys all over the country " were in a similar plight . Warner Bros. then ordered producer Lou Edelman to cut the script , adding that " This is the story of two people – not a group . It is an individual problem – not a national one . " Rossen was one of three writers on the gangster melodrama The Roaring Twenties , released in 1939 . A remake of the 1932 play and film Life Begins was written in 1939 by Rossen and released in 1940 as A Child Is Born . The plot recounted the experiences of six expectant mothers , and there was little scope to modify the original . 
 The Sea Wolf , released in 1941 , was based on Jack London 's novel . Although the film had a strong cast and production , Rossen 's re @-@ draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film . While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy , he became a symbol of fascism . He split the novel 's idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman . Warner Bros. cut many political points during production . 
 Blues in the Night , written by Rossen and two colleagues and released in 1941 , shows a group of jazz musicians traveling in the Depression . Their informal methods represent working @-@ class culture rather than the commercialized music of the big bands . However , The New York Times ' reviewer thought the sound track was " about all the film has to offer " , and Warner was disappointed with the sales . 
 After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , the Screen Writers Guild set up on December 8 , 1941 , the Hollywood Writers Mobilization , a body to organize writers for the war effort . Rossen served as the body 's chairman until 1944 and advocated the opening of a Second Front to support West European resistance again the Nazis . His earnings were much greater than in 1937 . However , his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects , including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , which John Huston eventually directed in 1948 . 
 In 1945 Rossen joined a picket line against Warner Bros , making an enemy of Jack Warner . Rossen signed a contract with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis , who had previously been Warner Bros. ' head of production . However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company , The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947 . In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot , which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself . The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies . 
 Dick Powell had been a crooner but was making a new career as a dramatic actor . When Columbia Pictures agreed to make Johnny O 'Clock for him in 1947 , Powell successfully campaigned for Rossen to direct , and this became Rossen 's debut in directing . As this crime melodrama proved a modest success , Roberts Productions signed Rossen to direct Abraham Polonsky 's script of Body and Soul , described by Bob Thomas as " possibly the best prizefight film ever made . " Rossen preferred an ending in which the hero wins a boxing match and then is killed by a gangster , but Polonsky insisted on his own ending , in which the hero escapes into obscurity before the fight . Following the success of Body and Soul , Rossen formed his own production company and signed with Columbia Pictures a contract that gave him wide autonomy over every second film that he made at the studio . 
 All the King 's Men ( 1949 ) was based on the novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren , which in turn was based on the career of the Louisiana politician Huey Long . Rossen introduced a new concept , that the defenders of the ordinary people can in turn become the new <unk> . As a requirement for his participation in the film , Rossen had to write to Columbia 's Harry Cohn saying that he was no longer a Communist Party member . Cohn 's critiques of the draft of Rossen 's script included scrapping a framing structure that was difficult for audiences to follow and several improvements in the relationships and motivations of characters . A meeting of the Communist Party in Los Angeles severely criticized the film , and Rossen severed all relations with the Party . All the King 's Men won the Academy Award for Best Picture , Broderick Crawford won the award for Best Actor and Mercedes McCambridge was honored as Best Supporting Actress . Rossen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director but lost to Joseph L. Mankiewicz for A Letter to Three Wives . Rossen won a Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe for Best Picture . His next film , The Brave Bulls , was directed in 1950 and released in 1951 . This was Rossen 's last work before the studios blacklisted him . New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called this " the best film on bull @-@ fighting yet . "

 After the end of World War II in 1945 , the rightwing elements who had resisted the US entry into World War Two because of their pro @-@ Fascist isolationism , continued their attempts to control and punish the left @-@ leaning and highly talented entertainment professionals who had done so much to support Churchill and FDR and fight the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral . In 1946 , the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional <unk> and used this power to re @-@ invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti @-@ Fascist artists before the war . The Communist victory of China in 1949 and the start of the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti @-@ Communist hysteria being whipped up at the time . 
 During hearings in 1947 , Jack Warner included Rossen among the many openly leftist writers whom his studio , Warner Bros. , had hired as the earliest and most openly anti @-@ Nazi studios in Hollywood ( Warner Bros had made " Confessions of a Nazi Spy ' in 1939 and were attacked by GOP forces for this at the time ) . Warner reportedly accused Rossen of incorporating Communist propaganda in scripts and claimed this was why he had fired him , though in fact the real reason for Warner 's enmity with Rossen were his writer 's union activities . 
 Rossen was one of 19 " unfriendly witnesses " subpoenaed in October 1947 by the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) during the second Red Scare but was one of eight not called to testify . In 1951 , Rossen was named as a Communist by several HUAC witnesses and he appeared before HUAC for the first time in June 1951 . He exercised his rights under the Fifth Amendment against self @-@ incrimination , taking what came to be known as the " augmented Fifth " . He testified that he was not a member of the Communist Party and that he disagreed with the aims of the party , but when asked to state whether he had ever been a member of the party , Rossen refused to answer . He was placed on the unofficial blacklist by the Hollywood studios , and Columbia broke its production contract with him . 
 In an unconstitutional though widespread practice during the Communist <unk> , the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen 's passport . This , and his inability to find work , brought Rossen , like his friend , ex @-@ Communist Elia Kazan , back to the committee in May 1953 , where he named 57 people as Communists . He explained to the committee why he chose to testify : " I don 't think , after two years of thinking , that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation . " Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father 's decision : 
 " It killed him not to work . He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk , and he didn 't know what to do . What I think he wanted to know was , what would I think of him if he talked ? He didn 't say it in that way , though . Then he explained to me the politics of it — how the studios were in on it , and there was never any chance of his working . He was under pressure , he was sick , his diabetes was bad , and he was drinking . By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time , from my point of view . What could any kid say at that point ? You say , ' I love you and I 'm behind you . ' " 
 Like Elia Kazan 's testimony , Rossen 's HUAC testimony destroyed many lifelong friendships , along with dozens of careers ; however , unlike Kazan , Rossen 's career never recovered , while Kazan 's flourished for the rest of his life . 
 = = = Return to filmmaking = = = 
 From 1952 to 1953 , Rossen wrote Mambo , trying to repair his finances after almost two years without work following the 1951 HUAC hearing . He had to produce the film in Italy , and it was premiered in Italy in 1954 and the USA in 1955 . Rossen later said " Mambo was to be for fun only , " but he " took it seriously , and it didn 't come off . " Critics dismissed the film . However , in 2001 , Dorothea Fischer @-@ Hornung concluded that the film achieved more than Rossen and contemporary critics realized . The female lead resolves her own conflicts by devoting herself to dance . Katherine Dunham 's choreography highlights this process ; and innovative cinematography intensifies the dance scenes . 
 Rossen hoped Alexander the Great ( 1956 ) would be a blockbuster , but the majority of the reviews criticized the film for failing to keep the audience 's interest . However , the review from The New York Times wrote that " its moments of boredom are rare ... an overlong but thoughtful and spectacular entertainment . " 
 In 1961 , Rossen co @-@ wrote , produced and directed The Hustler . Drawing upon his own experiences as a pool hustler , he teamed with Sidney Carroll to adapt the novel of the same name for the screen . The Hustler was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two . Rossen was nominated as Best Director and with Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay but did not win either award . He was named Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle and shared with Carroll the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama . The Hustler was an enormous popular success and is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States , which had been on the decline for decades . 
 Rossen was already ill when he started on his final film , Lilith ( 1964 ) , and it was poorly received in the United States . After it Rossen lost interest in directing , reportedly because of conflicts with the film 's star , Warren Beatty . The filmmaker said , " It isn 't worth that kind of grief . I won 't take it any more . I have nothing to say on the screen right now . Even if I never make another picture , I 've got The Hustler on my record . I 'm content to let that one stand for me . " However , at the time of his death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach , a script he conceived in 1962 , showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral , which Neve described as a " symbol of America 's imperial reach " .

 Rossen died in New York City at age 57 on February 18 , 1966 , following a series of illnesses and is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings @-@ on @-@ Hudson , Westchester County , New York .

His grandchild , Daniel Rossen , is the guitarist / vocalist of alternative bands Grizzly Bear and Department of Eagles .

 Rossen was one of the directors who developed film gris ( French for " grey film " ) . In his films for Warner Brothers ' between 1937 and 1944 , consistent themes were the conditions of working people , the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers , and opposition to fascism . After Dust Be My Destiny , written by Rossen and released in 1939 , Frank Nugent , who regularly reviewed for The New York Times , complained about Warner Brothers ' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods . Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks , Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director : " The element common to many of my films is the desire for success , ambition , which is an important element in American life . It is an important element , and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization . " Polonsky commented that " Rossen 's talent is force applied everywhere without let @-@ up . " Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen 's works , but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen 's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness . 
 Farber noted the strong female characters of the 1930s and 1940s , and laments their replacing by all @-@ male relationships from the 1950s onwards . For the earlier pattern Farber cited Rossen 's 1946 script The Strange Love of Martha Ivers , which was over melodramatic but portrayed a woman consumed by power , money and success . Lilith created one of the few strong women in the 1960s . Rossen generally destroyed the main character . 
 All of Rossen 's <unk> were adaptions except Marked Woman , Racket Buster and Alexander the Great , which were based on real events . Before he was blacklisted in 1951 , only two of Rossen 's adaptions were of serious novels , and Rossen 's early drafts of the script for All the King 's Men received serious criticisms within Columbia . 
 While head of production at Warner , Hal Wallis considered that some of his best films – including The Roaring Twenties , Marked Woman and The Sea Wolf – were written by Rossen . Wallis was very pleased with Rossen 's script in 1946 for The Strange Love of Martha Ivers , which was produced by Wallis own company . However , Rossen turned down Wallis 's next two films . Both Wallis as producer and Rossen as writer @-@ director wanted to operate as independents , rather than under the control of a studio . 
 All the King 's Men was one of the last of the social " message " films , as they were eclipsed as America turned conservative . Thomas Schatz ' regarded All the King 's Men as possibly the best of the genre , as it examined alcoholism , adultery , political corruption and the influence of journalism . In 2001 the United States National Film Registry preserved the film as " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . " 
 Rossen produced , directed and co @-@ wrote The Hustler in 1961 . At the time Variety praised the cast , complained about the " sordid aspects " of the story and felt the film was far too long . The New Republic praised the cast and Rossen 's " sure , economical " direction , but thought the script " strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality . " The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for another seven , was nominated in four of the Golden Globes ' categories , and gained many other awards and nominations . 
 In 1997 the National Film Registry preserved The Hustler as " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . " In 2002 Roger Ebert described the film as one " where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories " and praised Rossen 's decision to develop all four main characters , and James Berardinelli listed the film in his All Time Top 100 for similar reasons . Ebert also praised Rossen 's decision to shoot the film in the " <unk> gloom of the billiard parlor " created by black @-@ and @-@ white . Other accolades appeared in the 2000s ( decade ) . 
 In 1966 Stephen Farber used " Gothic " to describe Lilith and a few other American films of the early 1960s based on psychological horror , and regarded Lilith 's female protagonist as a demonic temptress . Nina <unk> regarded Lilith as the most extreme of the American film industry 's applications , or rather misapplications , of psychoanalytic concepts , as the patient is already psychotic and has a track record of previous conquests . In The New Biographical Dictionary of Film David Thomson describes Lilith as " an oddity , the only one of [ Rossen 's ] films that seems passionate , mysterious and truly personal . The other films will look increasingly dated and self @-@ contained , but Lilith may grow . "

 " Lisa 's Wedding " is the 19th episode of The Simpsons ' sixth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19 , 1995 . The plot focuses around Lisa visiting a carnival fortune teller and learning about her future love . It was written by Greg Daniels and directed by Jim Reardon . Mandy Patinkin guest stars as Hugh Parkfield and Phil Hartman guest stars as Troy McClure . The episode won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program , becoming the third episode of The Simpsons to win the award . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins with the Simpson family visiting a renaissance fair . Homer eats eight different kinds of meat , and an embarrassed Lisa wanders off and eventually finds a fortune @-@ telling booth . Although Lisa is at first skeptical , the fortune teller gets her attention by telling Lisa the names of everyone in her family . She then uses tarot cards to predict Lisa 's future , and says she will tell Lisa the story of her true love . 
 The story then shifts to an Eastern University in 2010 ( at the time of the episode 's broadcast , fifteen years in the future ) , where a now 23 @-@ year @-@ old Lisa meets a English student named Hugh Parkfield . At first , the two quarrel over a book in the library and their respective academic talents , but the pair eventually fall madly in love . Hugh invites Lisa to come back to his home in England so she can meet his parents . While there , Hugh asks Lisa to marry him ; she immediately accepts . 
 The next day , Lisa calls home to tell Marge of the news ; Marge promises that she will prevent Homer from ruining the wedding . Marge is still a housewife , Bart ( now 25 ) works as a successful building demolition expert , Maggie is a teenager who wears a necklace with her pacifier attached and apparently never shuts up ( although each time she opens her mouth in the episode , she is interrupted ) and Homer still works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G , with Milhouse as his supervisor . Lisa and Hugh travel to Springfield , where Lisa is worried that her family will embarrass her . Things get off to a bad start when Bart and Homer accidentally set the British flag on fire , which they extinguish by throwing it on the ground and pouring compost on it . 
 At dinner , Lisa plans on going for a wedding dress fitting and Homer decides to take Hugh out to Moe 's Tavern . While there , Homer presents Hugh with a pair of cuff links ( a bride and groom pig ) that all Simpsons men have worn on their wedding day , asking him to continue the tradition ; Hugh reluctantly agrees to wear them during the wedding . Later that night , Lisa apologizes profusely for her family 's behavior ; although Hugh says it does not bother him , he appears worried . On the day of the wedding , Homer talks with Lisa and she discovers that Hugh did not wear Homer 's cufflinks . She finds Hugh and asks him to wear them . He agrees . The only condition however , is that after the wedding Lisa must leave her family behind because Hugh has felt embarrassed by them all along . Lisa is outraged , stating that she cannot marry him if he cannot understand that she still loves her family despite their shortcomings , and calls off the wedding , running off in anger and sorrow . 
 Back in the present , the fortune teller says that Hugh went back to England and never saw Lisa again , and that there is nothing Lisa can do to prevent it — although she should " try to look surprised " . Lisa questions the fortune teller about her " true love " and the fortune teller reveals that although Lisa will have a true love , she " specializes in foretelling relationships where you get jerked around " . Lisa leaves the booth and finds her father , who is excited to tell her about his day at the fair . They walk off , hand in hand , as Lisa listens , happy and content .

 The idea for the episode came from James L. Brooks , who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as traveling to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy , who in turn cannot stand her family . Believing that it would be a tough episode to write , Brooks gave the job to Greg Daniels , who was enthusiastic about it and has said that was a lot easier and more fun to write than expected . The part involving Homer 's cuff links was not in the original draft , it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh 's disdain for the Simpson family . The end theme was redone by Alf Clausen as a " Renaissance version " , including a harp . 
 Everything in the episode had to be redesigned , which included new sets and all of the characters had to be remodeled for their age . In most cases , the adults were made heavier , had a few lines added to the face and less hair . On Homer , the redesign was minimal , making him a bit heavier , removing one hair and placing an extra line under the eye . Homer also wears a shirt like George Jetson 's . Krusty 's design is based on Groucho Marx . The night sky was intentionally made a more reddish color in a subtle joke about how the producers thought the world would be much more polluted in 2010 . Nancy Cartwright 's Bart voice was electronically lowered a couple of notches . 
 This is the first of five future @-@ themed episodes . The others were " Bart to the Future " in season 11 , " Future @-@ Drama " in season 16 , " Holidays of Future Passed " from season 23 , and " Days of Future Future " from season 25 . While both " Lisa 's Wedding " and " Future @-@ Drama " were nominated for an Emmy , in 2003 Entertainment Weekly named " Bart to the Future " the worst episode in the history of the series . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode makes mention of " 40 classic films starring Jim Carrey " , which include The Mask and " Ace Ventura VI " . According to David Mirkin , this is a joke about how " huge " Carrey 's movies were at the time , and how he was not garnering much respect as an actor . The sounds of the car are the same as the ones used in The Jetsons . Wrist communicators are using same sounds as communicators in Star Trek . In this episode 's version of the future , apparently three of the major American television networks have been bought by ABC and merged into <unk> . At the same time , Fox has gradually become a hardcore sex channel . Hugh Parkfield is a parody of English actor Hugh Grant . The beginning of Lisa and Hugh 's romance is similar to the one in Love Story . Martin Prince 's fate is a parody of The Phantom of the Opera . The song that he plays on the organ is a variation of " A Fifth of Beethoven " by Walter Murphy , a disco version of Beethoven 's " Symphony No. 5 " in C Minor .

 In its original broadcast , " Lisa 's Wedding " finished 52nd in ratings for the week of March 13 – 19 , 1995 , with a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 8 @.@ 7 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following Beverly Hills , 90210 and Melrose Place . 
 " Lisa 's Wedding " won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Animated Program , becoming the third episode of The Simpsons to win in the category . This episode is a favorite of James L. Brooks , who believes that it is one of the best written episodes and ranks near the top of Simpsons episodes . The emotion of " Lisa 's Wedding " is often compared with season 2 's " Lisa 's Substitute " . The Quindecim , a college newspaper , made their own top 25 list , ranking " Lisa 's Wedding " as the greatest episode of The Simpsons . They also criticized Entertainment Weekly for leaving this episode and " Lisa 's Substitute " off their top 25 list , saying it was the " equivalent of leaving the Sistine Chapel off a list of Michelangelo 's best work ... Serving well as bookends , these episodes are not only brilliantly funny , they 're among the most genuinely touching stories in the show 's entire run . " 
 Mandy Patinkin as Hugh is considered one of the best Simpsons guest spots by Chris Turner in his book Planet Simpson , who says that many of the best Simpsons guest stars have been lesser known celebrities . In a 2008 article , Entertainment Weekly named Patinkin one of the 16 best Simpsons guest stars . The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of " The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes . " 
 On August 1 , 2010 , the day of Lisa 's wedding in the episode , the name " Lisa Simpson " was a trending topic on Twitter , a microblogging website . Most of the Twitter users that tweeted her name wished her a happy wedding day . 
 = Cowes Castle = 
 Cowes Castle , also known as West Cowes Castle , is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight . Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , it comprised a circular bastion , flanking wings and a keep , and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery . With its companion fortification at East Cowes , the castle overlooked the entrance to the River Medina , an important anchorage . The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use until the middle of the 19th century , very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War . 
 Decommissioned in 1854 , the castle was first leased , and later bought outright , by the Royal Yacht Squadron to form their new clubhouse . The Squadron then employed the architect Anthony Salvin to rebuild large parts of it between 1856 and 1858 . It became the headquarters for part of the D @-@ Day invasion force during the Second World War , but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in yacht races along the Isle of Wight . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Cowes Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , augmented by a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon , and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and he took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 The Solent , a stretch of water that gave access to the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth , was considered vulnerable to attack . Two castles were built on the west and east sides of the River Medina , the entrance to the principal harbour of the adjacent Isle of Wight , and were intended to attack any enemy ships that might approach . The castles took their names from the traditional term for this location , " the Cowes " . Constructed in 1539 , the western fortification , which became known as West Cowes Castle , had a D @-@ shaped bastion at the front , a round , two @-@ storey keep at the rear and two low buildings on either side , all of which mounted artillery guns . The landward side was protected by a ditch 4 metres ( 13 ft ) wide and a stone wall at least 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 ft 10 in ) wide at the top . It was built from limestone ashlar stone , which may have been recycled from the demolition of nearby Beaulieu Abbey , a consequence of Henry 's recent dissolution of the monasteries . 
 Settlements grew up around both castles on the Medina , but East Cowes Castle was rapidly abandoned and ultimately destroyed by coastal erosion ; as a result , today West Cowes Castle is often simply referred to as Cowes Castle . Inspections in 1547 showed that there were 17 iron and brass artillery pieces at the fort , but that nine of these were inoperable ; nonetheless it continued in use as a fortification after the original invasion scare had ended , staffed with a garrison of a captain , porter and three gunners during Queen Elizabeth 's reign . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 Cowes Castle was used to house important visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison ; the captain of the castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels . When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament , the castle was initially held for the King by its captain , Humphrey Turney . On 12 August , as tensions between the rival factions on the island increased , Turney personally fired one of the castle 's guns at the nearby Parliamentary naval vessel Lion . An unidentified Scottish naval captain then came ashore on 16 August and captured Turney , before landing more men and taking the castle for Parliament , who held it for the rest of the war . 
 During the Interregnum , the castle continued to be used as a prison . Charles I could not be housed in the castle while en route to his imprisonment by Parliament at Carisbrooke Castle in 1647 because the facility was full , and he stayed at a local alehouse instead . The Royalist Sir William Davenant was imprisoned in Cowes during 1650 , writing the poem <unk> while incarcerated . As with East Cowes Castle , coastal erosion proved a particular problem for the fortification . An inspection in 1692 reported that the walls were cracked and at risk of collapse , and the antiquarian Francis Grose observed in 1785 that the castle was " strongly fenced with piles and planks " to prevent erosion from the sea . 
 During the course of the 18th century , Cowes became a fashionable location for visitors , with several bathhouses , one of them located beside the castle , and by the early 19th century the town had become a noted resort . Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation . Most of the front of the keep was demolished and rebuilt with new windows , a turret for a spiral staircase was erected , new three- and two @-@ storey residential wings were added , and a garden was created over the landward defences . In 1795 , the writer Richard Warner noted that the garrison consisted of the captain , a porter , two soldiers , a master gunner and five regular gunners , their wages coming to £ 103 a year . The castle remained in use during the Napoleonic Wars , and in 1825 was equipped with eleven 9 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 1 kg ) guns . Warner had already complained , though , that the castle was " utterly useless " in military terms and a guidebook in 1824 echoed this judgement , describing Cowes as " useless as a place of defence " and ridiculing the sentries on duty there . 
 Lord Anglesey became the captain of Cowes Castle in 1826 , by now a sinecure rather than a regular military appointment , and spent part of each year at the castle , making further , lavish improvements to the interiors . Anglesey was also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron , first established in 1815 , which then operated from the Gloster Hotel in Cowes . By this time yachting had become a prestigious local event ; the painter J. M. W. Turner sketched the yachts sailing off the castle when he visited in 1827 . When Anglesey died in 1854 the government decommissioned the castle and leased the property initially to Anglesey 's son @-@ in @-@ law Lord Conyngham , and then to the Squadron in 1855 . 
 The architect Anthony Salvin , an expert on adapting medieval buildings , was employed by the Squadron to remodel the building between 1856 and 1858 . He enlarged the house , altered its profile and built a new tower , platform and a gatehouse , along with a service wing , a ballroom and more accommodation for the members , at a cost of around £ 6 @,@ 000 . Prince Albert and Edward , the Prince of Wales , visited the castle before it was formally reopened in 1858 ; the work received mixed reviews , one local newspaper likening the result to " a discipline establishment " . Cowes became a major centre for yachting . After the destruction of William IV 's miniature frigate the Royal Adelaide in 1877 , its 21 brass cannons were donated to the castle by the Prince of Wales . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 Cowes Castle was bought outright from the Crown by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1917 . Further development work was carried out on the property in the 1920s , and a ballroom in an adjacent hotel was purchased for use as an annexe for female members . 
 The Isle of Wight became an important staging location for the Allied efforts to invade France during the Second World War . By October 1942 , the castle was occupied by the British Admiralty and became the senior officer 's headquarters of the HQ Naval Commander Force " J " Landing Craft base , known as HMS Vectis . The force 's vessels docked in the nearby Solent , and took part in the D @-@ Day landings . The castle was damaged during the German bombing raids on the island . 
 After the war , the architect A. G. Biggs carried out substantial additions to the castle between 1962 and 1968 , including remodelling the western range to provide for more female accommodation , using stone from the second East Cowes Castle , an 18th and 19th @-@ century stately home , which had been demolished the previous year . A prefabricated conservatory extension followed in 1988 , and a new pavilion designed by Sir Thomas Croft was added in 2000 . 
 Archaeological excavations in the winter of 2010 – 11 rediscovered the remains of the old castle wall and ditch , and more than 400 artefacts were removed for storage at the Isle of Wight County Museum . Cowes Castle is a distinctive landmark in yachting and powerboat events , particularly at the start and finish of local races . It is protected under UK law as a 2 * Listed Building . 
 = Merseyside Skeptics Society = 
 The Merseyside Skeptics Society ( MSS ) is a nonprofit organisation that promotes scientific skepticism in Merseyside and the United Kingdom . Founded in 2009 , the society has campaigned against the use of homeopathy , challenged the claims of psychics , and hosts regular events in Liverpool , podcasts , and an annual conference in Manchester , QED : Question . Explore . Discover . 
 As part of their Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub events the society hosts guest speakers , who have included Simon Singh , David Nutt , and Robert Llewellyn . It also organises the awareness and protest against homeopathy campaign , 10 : 23 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Merseyside Skeptics Society was founded in February 2009 to develop and support the skeptical community in Merseyside . The Society held its first speaker 's meeting on 17 September 2009 at the Crown Hotel in Liverpool , England . Professor Chris French , editor of The Skeptic magazine gave a talk entitled " The Psychology of Anomalous Experiences " . Merseyside Skeptics Society Limited was registered in the United Kingdom as a private , limited by guarantee , no share capital company on 20 August 2010 . 
 According to co @-@ founder Michael Marshall , the group chose to use the American spelling of ' skeptic ' because " in the States , the word isn ’ t as strongly linked to cynicism . It 's not seen as being as negative as it is over here . " 
 When climate change deniers began identifying as skeptics , vice president Michael Marshall made a clear distinction , stating : " In our view , climate change sceptics are not sceptics . A sceptic looks at the available evidence and makes a decision , and for homeopathy the evidence is that it doesn 't work . But the sceptical position on climate change is that it is happening . " 
 = = Activities = = 
 = = = Meetings = = = 
 The Society holds several regular meetings in the Liverpool area , including the Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub , Skeptic Dinners , and Women 's Socials . Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub holds two meetings a month , one of which is a social event and the other of which features a guest speaker . Guest speakers have included Ariane Sherine , Simon Singh , David Aaronovitch , Evan Harris , Elizabeth Pisani , Brian Deer , Jon Ronson , Stephen Law , David Nutt , Mark Stevenson , Mark Lynas and Robert Llewellyn , among others . Topics covered vary widely and include health care , science , atheism , the paranormal and supernatural , psychics , politics and psychology . 
 = = = Homeopathy = = = 
 In 2009 , the society wrote an open letter to pharmacy chain Boots in which they denounced the sales of homeopathic products in their store . In the letter they wrote that " We trust brands such as Boots to check the facts for us ... We don 't expect to find products on the shelf at our local pharmacy which do not work " , calling for them to remove the " bogus therapy " from their shelves . 
 The Society organised the 10 : 23 campaign to raise awareness of , and campaign against , homeopathy . This campaign included protests in 2010 against Boots for selling homeopathic preparations as equivalent to mainstream , scientifically @-@ based medicine and involved mass homeopathic overdoses outside Boots stores to mock what the protesters asserted to be the lack of efficacy in homeopathic products . 
 Following the overdose , Boots responded by saying " We know that many people believe in the benefits of complementary medicines and we aim to offer the products we know our customers want . " These protests took place in 70 cities in 30 countries around the world , including Australia and New Zealand , and resulted in no ill effects to those taking the products . 
 In addition , the Society has complained about GPs who have advocated alternative medicine including homeopathy .

 In 2012 , Merseyside Skeptics Society investigated claims that the Shuzi Qi sports wristbands – bands supposed to improve athletic performance similar to Power Balance bands – had any effect . These bands were promoted in marketing materials as containing a computer chip programmed to " resonate with blood cells ' natural frequencies " , improving circulation by causing them to " <unk> " , and were claimed to " bring your whole being into a state of balance where ... your endurance levels are increased . " The study cited by Shuzi UK used a technique called live blood cell analysis which has been discredited , and Merseyside Skeptics Society characterized the claims as " nonsensical techno @-@ babble " . 
 After the society conducted tests with a rugby player , it was reported that the bands had made " no discernable difference " and that when subject to double blind trials , the product failed to have any effect on the rugby player 's performance . Following the test , a spokesman for Shuzi UK stated that the claims made on its UK website would be updated ; however , the director of the company claimed that the tests were biased and unfair . 
 = = = Challenging psychic claims = = = 
 In 2011 , celebrity psychic Sally Morgan was accused of having an off @-@ stage assistant at her shows who passed information to her via radio . Merseyside Skeptics Society subsequently challenged her to participate in a test of her supposed powers , designed by psychologist Chris French . Around the same time , Simon Singh received emails from Sally Morgan 's solicitor , stating that she had instructed the solicitor to " take libel proceedings , if necessary , in relation to allegations that she is a cheat " following the campaign encouraging her to take the test . 
 The Society turned the initial challenge into an annual event titled the " Halloween Challenge " ; a scientific test to investigate if professional mediums could demonstrate psychic abilities in a controlled setting . In 2012 , researchers at Goldsmiths , University of London conducted the challenge with two professional mediums , who both agreed beforehand that it was a fair test of their abilities , asking them to attempt to identify information about five volunteers they had not previously met and could not see . The experiment involved the mediums writing details about the volunteers , who then had to identify themselves from the descriptions . With a success rate of one in five , the results showed little evidence of the mediums ' claimed psychic ability . One of the mediums described the test as " designed to confirm the researchers ' preconceptions " , saying that she had to work face @-@ to @-@ face to make a connection . 
 Vice @-@ president Michael Marshall supported the ban of the sale of tarot readings and spells on eBay in 2012 , stating he thought it was " solid consumer protection " . He continued that " tarot , spells and curses are all highly unproven " , noting that although many tarot readers are sincere and believe they have psychic abilities , " that doesn 't make it any more real . " 
 When the owner of a missing cat in Lincolnshire enlisted the help of a psychic , who said that it had been adopted by another family and would be found in an area children play , the society said : " Both of these are incredibly obvious scenarios to suggest for a missing cat , and would likely be the suggestions you 'd get from someone without psychic powers – and without the need for a fee , too . " 
 In June 2010 , Liverpudlian psychic Joe Power made allegations to the police that threats of violence had been directed towards him from members of the society on social media site Facebook . After police contacted the society in regards to the claims , a member was able to explain that the allegations were unfounded . In a statement on their website following the incident , they wrote " nobody involved with the Merseyside Skeptics Society – or anyone that I even know of – has ever made threats to Joe or his family , and we absolutely never will .

 = Mount Redoubt = 
 Redoubt Volcano , or Mount Redoubt , is an active stratovolcano in the largely volcanic Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska . Located at the head of the <unk> Mountains subrange in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve , the mountain is just west of Cook Inlet , in the Kenai Peninsula Borough about 180 km ( 110 mi ) southwest of Anchorage . At 10 @,@ 197 feet ( 3 @,@ 108 m ) , in just over 5 miles ( 8 km ) Mount Redoubt attains 9 @,@ 150 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) of prominence over its surrounding terrain . It is the highest summit in the Aleutian Range . 
 Active for millennia , Mount Redoubt has erupted four times since it was first observed : in 1902 , 1966 , 1989 and 2009 , with two questionable eruptions in 1881 and 1933 . The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45 @,@ 000 ft ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . It caught KLM Flight 867 , a Boeing 747 aircraft , in its plume . After the plane descended 13 @,@ 000 feet , the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage . The ash blanketed an area of about 7 @,@ 700 sq mi ( 20 @,@ 000 km2 ) . The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long @-@ period seismic events developed by Swiss / American volcanologist Bernard Chouet . As of August 2015 , the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal . 
 = = Name = = 
 The official name of the mountain is Redoubt Volcano , a translation of the Russian name " <unk> <unk> " , referring to , as does the word " redoubt " , " a fortified place " . A local name , " <unk> " , also means " fortified place " , but it is difficult to determine if one name is derived from the other . The Board on Geographic Names decided on the name " Redoubt Volcano " in 1891 . 
 The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution refers to the mountain simply as " Redoubt " , and lists the following as alternate names : Burnt Mountain , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The Alaska Volcano Observatory also uses simply " Redoubt " ; it lists the same alternate names in addition to the following : <unk> ; Redoute <unk> . ; and <unk> , <unk> . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The volcano is about 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) in diameter at its base with a rough volume of 7 @.@ 2 to 8 @.@ 4 cu mi ( 30 – 35 km3 ) . The sides of the upper cone are relatively steep ( in comparison to volcanoes in general ) . Made up of pyroclastic flow deposits and lava flows , and resting on Mesozoic era rocks of the Aleutian Mountain Range batholith , the mountain has been somewhat weathered by movement of several glaciers that reside on it . The current main vent is on the north side of the crater by the head of the Drift glacier . Also present on the mountain are Holocene lahar deposits that extend as far as the Cook Inlet . This mountain has produced andesite , basalt and dacite , with relatively silicic andesite dominant in recent eruptions .

 = = = Early reports = = = 
 Captain James Cook saw Mt . Redoubt during the summer of 1778 , describing it as " emitting a white smoke but no fire " which made some think it was no more than a white thick cloud such as we have frequently seen on the Coast , for the most part appearing on the sides of hills and often extends along a whole range and at different times falls or rises , expands or contracts itself and has a resemblance to Clouds of white smoke . But this besides being too small for one of those clouds , remained as it were fixed in the same spot for the whole time the Mountain was clear which was above 48 hours . " However , several sources call this a " discredited eruption " . There are several other of these activities that are not called eruptions . 
 In 1819 , smoke was observed at the mountain . However , this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such . Similarly , in 2003 , a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by an employee of the ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume . Possible steam @-@ vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain .

 There was apparently an eruption described as " to the eastward , Redoubt Volcano , 11 @,@ 060 feet ( 3 @,@ 370 m ) high , is constantly smoking , with periods of exaggerated activity .

 The volcano erupted rather abruptly in 1902 , spewing out ash from January 18 to June 21 in the year . A local newspaper stated , " Word has just been received that Redoubt , one of the volcanoes at Cook 's Inlet had an eruption on January 18 , and the country for 150 miles ( 240 km ) around was covered with ashes and lava . The news comes from Sunrise , but nothing definite has been ascertained as to whether any damage was done , for no boats have as yet been in the neighborhood of the volcano . " There were many other news reports on the eruption , one describing the eruption as " a terrific earthquake which burst the mountain asunder leaving a large gap , " which could possibly suggest the crack formation in the volcano 's crater , however , it is unlikely . Supposedly , the volcano was ejecting " flames " from its caldera , and the eruption terrified natives in the area . Newspapers seemed to suggest that the ash had traveled for more than 150 miles ( 240 km ) , reaching the opposite side of the Cook Inlet . 
 = = = 1989 – 1990 = = = 
 The volcano erupted on December 14 , 1989 , and continued to erupt for over six months . Sudden melting of snow and ice at the summit caused by pyroclastic flows and dome collapses caused lahars , or mudflows , which flowed down the north flank of the mountain . A majority of the mudflows coursed to Cook Inlet , about 22 miles ( 35 km ) from the volcano . The lahars entered a nearby river , worrying officials that they might destroy an oil storage facility located along it . 
 Since lahars were produced repeatedly , scientists realized that they could use these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed to measure the movement of rocks against each other . This device , now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor , alerts nearby stations to possible lahars . 
 The eruption also caused an airliner to have all four engines fail after a Boeing 747 @-@ 400 jumbo jet operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flew into a cloud of volcanic ash . Damage from the eruption was estimated at $ 160 million , the second costliest volcanic eruption in United States history .

 On January 30 , 2009 , scientists from the Alaska Volcano Observatory ( AVO ) warned that an eruption was imminent , sending experienced Alaskans shopping for protection against a dusty shower of volcanic ash that could descend on south @-@ central Alaska . 
 By January 31 , volcanic earthquakes increased to several per hour , and a large hole in the glacier on the side of the mountain was spotted . Scientists began to monitor seismic data from the mountain twenty @-@ four hours a day in an effort to warn people in nearby communities .

 Seismic activity at Redoubt increased beginning about 13 : 00 <unk> .

 = Battle of Labuan = 
 The Battle of Labuan was an engagement fought between Allied and Japanese forces on the island of Labuan off Borneo during June 1945 . It formed part of the Australian invasion of North Borneo , and was initiated by the Allied forces as part of a plan to capture the Brunei Bay area and develop it into a base to support future offensives . 
 Following several weeks of air attacks and a short naval bombardment , soldiers of the Australian 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June . The Australians quickly captured the island 's harbour and main airfield . The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position in the interior of Labuan , and offered little resistance to the landing . The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese position in the days after the invasion were not successful , and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment . A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June , but was defeated . Later that day , Australian forces assaulted the Japanese position . In the following days , Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island . A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured . Australian casualties included 34 killed . 
 After securing the island , the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base . The 24th Brigade left from the island to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay in late June , and the island 's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units . While occupying Labuan , the Allies had to reconstruct the island 's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre @-@ invasion bombardment . Following the war , a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan . 
 = = Background = = 
 Labuan is a small island in the mouth of Brunei Bay with an area of 35 square miles ( 91 km2 ) . Before the Pacific War , it formed part of the British @-@ administered Straits Settlements and had a population of 8 @,@ 960 . The island had a town , Victoria , on its south coast which fronted onto Victoria Harbour , with a population of 8 @,@ 500 and limited port facilities . Aside from a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ yard ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) beach just to the east of Victoria , the coast was ringed by coral . 
 On 3 January 1942 , Japanese forces captured Labuan unopposed during the Battle of Borneo . The Japanese developed two airfields ( Labuan and Timbalai ) on the island , which were built by labourers who had been conscripted from the Lawas and <unk> regions of mainland Borneo . The island population was also subjected to harsh occupation policies . After Japanese forces suppressed a revolt at the town of Jesselton in late 1943 , which was led by Chinese @-@ ethnic civilians , 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan . Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944 . Until mid @-@ 1944 , few Japanese combat units were stationed in Borneo . 
 In March 1945 the Australian Army 's I Corps , whose main combat elements were the veteran 7th and 9th Divisions , was assigned responsibility for liberating Borneo . Planning for the offensive was undertaken over the following weeks . While invading the Brunei Bay area did not form part of the initial iteration of the plans , it was added in early April after a proposed landing on Java was cancelled . The main purpose of attacking Brunei Bay was to secure it as a base for the British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) , and gain control of oil fields and rubber plantations in the area . Labuan was to be developed as an air base and form part of a string of strategic positions which would allow the Allies to control the seas off the Japanese @-@ occupied coast between Singapore and Shanghai . 
 While the liberation of the Brunei area had been authorised by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff , it was not supported by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee . The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines . In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south @-@ east Asia , the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there , especially as Singapore might have been recaptured by the time they were complete . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 = = = Allied planning = = = 
 The plans for the invasion of Borneo evolved considerably during April . Initially , the offensive was to commence on 23 April with the landing of a brigade from the 6th Division on the island of Tarakan , off the east coast of Borneo . The 9th Division would then assault Balikpapan followed by Banjarmasin in south @-@ east Borneo . These positions would be used to support the invasion of Java by the remainder of I Corps . After the attack on Java was cancelled , it was decided to employ two brigades of the 7th Division at Brunei Bay , and I Corps conducted further preparations on this basis . However , on 17 April General Douglas MacArthur 's General Headquarters ( to which I Corps reported ) swapped the roles of the 7th and 9th Divisions . Accordingly , the final plan for the attack against Borneo specified that one of the 9th Division 's brigades would land on Tarakan island on 29 April ( later postponed to 1 May ) , with the remainder of the division to invade the Brunei Bay area on 23 May . The 7th Division was scheduled to assault Balikpapan on 1 July . The Borneo campaign was designated the " Oboe " phase of the Allied offensive through the southern Philippines towards the Netherlands East Indies , and the landings at Tarakan , Brunei Bay and Balikpapan were designated Operations Oboe One , Six and Two respectively . 
 The 9th Division began to move from Australia to the island of Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies , where the Borneo campaign would be staged , in March 1945 . The division had seen extensive combat in North Africa and New Guinea , and its officers and enlisted men were well trained for amphibious operations and jungle warfare . However , the 9th Division had been out of action since early 1944 , leading to poor morale among its combat units . A large number of support , logistics and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) units were assigned to the division for the operations at Brunei Bay , taking its strength to over 29 @,@ 000 personnel ( including 1 @,@ 097 in United States and British units ) . 
 Final preparations for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945 . After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps ' movement from Australia to Morotai , General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June . The 9th Division 's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May . The 24th Brigade Group was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan , and the 20th Brigade Group was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island . Both brigades were to land simultaneously on the morning of 10 June . The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units , as well as three days of minesweeping operations in the bay itself . 
 The 24th Brigade Group was commanded by Brigadier Selwyn Porter . His main combat units for operations on Labuan were the 2 / 28th and 2 / 43rd Battalions , the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron and the 2 / 12th Field Regiment . In addition , a squadron from the 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment ( equipped with Matilda II tanks ) , a company of the 2 / 2nd Machine Gun Battalion and a range of engineer , signals and logistics units formed part of the brigade group . A party of 13 officers from the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit ( BBCAU ) was also attached to the 24th Brigade and were tasked with restoring the colonial government on the island and distributing supplies to its civilian population . The 24th Brigade 's third infantry battalion , the 2 / 32nd Battalion , was assigned to the 9th Division 's reserve force . Porter and the 2 / 28th Battalion 's commander , Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Norman , had a difficult relationship which generated ill @-@ feeling between the two men and their respective headquarters . Porter considered relieving Norman of command before the landing on Labuan in the belief that he was exhausted and not capable of effectively leading his battalion , but decided against doing so after Norman made an emotional appeal to remain in his position . 
 The plans for the capture of Labuan specified that the 24th Brigade Group 's two infantry battalions were to land simultaneously on the beach near Victoria ( designated Brown Beach ) at 9 : 15 am , with the 2 / 28th Battalion coming ashore on the western side of the beach and the 2 / 43rd to the east . The 2 / 11th Commando Squadron was to be initially held in reserve on board the invasion fleet . The brigade group 's objectives were to secure a beachhead , capture the main airfield ( located north of Victoria and designated " No. 1 Strip " by the Australians ) , destroy the Japanese garrison , and prepare for further operations on the eastern shore of Brunei Bay . Priority was given to rapidly opening the port and airfield so that they could be used to support other operations . 
 Porter expected that fighting for the main objectives would begin soon after the landing , and decided to begin landing his artillery and heavy mortars with the assault waves of infantrymen , just before the tanks came ashore . The 2 / 28th Battalion was initially assigned responsibility for securing Victoria and Flagstaff Hill to its north , while the 2 / 43rd Battalion was tasked with capturing the airfield . Once these areas were in Australian hands , the 2 / 28th Battalion would secure the western part of the island while the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron captured the western shore of Victoria Harbour . Due to the Australian Army 's manpower shortages , all elements of the 9th Division were under orders to minimise their casualties during the Borneo Campaign and unit commanders would rely heavily upon the available air and artillery support during operations . The Australians estimated that the Japanese garrison on Labuan comprised 650 personnel , made up of 400 airfield troops , 100 naval troops and 150 other lines @-@ of @-@ communications personnel . 
 = = = Japanese preparations = = = 
 As the Allies advanced towards Borneo , additional units were dispatched from Japan during the second half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island 's defence . In December 1944 , Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year ( by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines ) . Accordingly , several Japanese units stationed in north @-@ east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo . This movement proceeded slowly , owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks . 
 By June 1945 around 550 Japanese military personnel were stationed on Labuan . The main unit on the island was the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion ( almost in its entirety , save for one company located elsewhere ) with a strength of around 350 . This battalion formed part of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade , which had arrived at Tawao in north @-@ east Borneo from Japan in July 1944 with six infantry battalions . During early 1945 the brigade headquarters , 371st Independent Infantry Battalion and three other battalions marched across the island to assume responsibility for defending the Brunei Bay area . Many of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade 's soldiers fell sick during the march , and all four combat battalions were considerably below their authorised strength by the time they arrived at Brunei Bay . In June 1945 the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion was commanded by Captain <unk> Okuyama . A detachment of about 50 men from the 111th Airfield Battalion was also on Labuan , along with around 150 men assigned to other small units . In line with Japanese doctrine , the Labuan garrison did not make preparations to contest the Allied landing force as it came ashore . Instead , it constructed defensive positions inland from the island 's beaches . Documents captured by Australian soldiers during the fighting on Labuan indicated that Okuyama had instructions to attempt to withdraw his force from the island if the battle went against him .

 Australian and United States air units began their pre @-@ invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May . The first attack on the Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May , and included a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan . A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north @-@ western and north @-@ eastern Borneo . The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan , but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced the scale of the pre @-@ invasion bombardment . 
 United States Navy minesweepers commenced operations in Brunei Bay on 7 June , and a flotilla of four cruisers and seven destroyers ( including an Australian light cruiser and destroyer ) served as a covering force . The minesweeping operation was successful , though USS Salute struck a mine on 8 June and sank with the loss of four lives . Underwater demolition teams investigated all of the landing beaches on 9 June searching for obstacles which could impede the landing craft . The teams assigned to clear obstacles off Labuan were endangered by an unauthorised attack on the island conducted by a force of American B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bombers . Following the landings on 10 June , American Thirteenth Air Force aircraft flying from a base on Palawan Island in the Philippines provided close air support for the forces on Labuan until RAAF units based on the island were ready to take over . 
 The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department ( SRD ) also collected intelligence on Labuan and other parts of the Brunei Bay area during May . On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan . These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews ; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning . On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina , and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu . These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan , and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong <unk> on 19 May . The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan 's geography and infrastructure . In addition , civilians who had been recruited by the SRD 's <unk> 2 team ( which had been parachuted into Borneo during April ) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan 's garrison force . 
 During the last days of May the 9th Division embarked at Morotai onto the ships which would transport it to Brunei Bay , and undertook rehearsals for the landing . Due to a shortage of shipping , the available vessels were heavily loaded and many soldiers were forced to endure cramped and hot conditions during the ten days before the landing . Australian official historian Gavin Long later wrote that for many troops these conditions " were as uncomfortable as any of the experiences that followed " during the campaign . The 24th Brigade Group was carried by a variety of landing ships : the two large Australian LSIs HMAS Manoora and Westralia , as well the attack cargo ship USS Titania , LSD USS Carter Hall , ten LSTs , five LCIs and seven LSMs from the United States Navy . A total of 38 small LCVPs and 26 LCMs were also assigned to land the brigade once it arrived off Labuan . Due to the coral reefs surrounding the island , the assault waves landed in LVTs of the US Army 's <unk> Amphibious Tractor Battalion . The convoy carrying the 9th Division left Morotai on 4 June and arrived in Brunei Bay before dawn on 10 June . The main body of the convoy anchored off Labuan , and the remainder proceeded to the Brunei area . A Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb near two of the transport ships off Labuan at 6 : 51 am , but caused no damage . 
 = = = Landing = = = 
 The landing of the assault troops at Labuan went well . The Allied fleet began bombarding the landing area from 8 : 15 am , and seven Australian B @-@ 24 Liberators dropped anti @-@ personnel bombs in the area behind the intended beachhead . No Japanese forces opposed the two battalions ' assault forces as they came ashore in LVTs , and the landing of later waves of infantry and tanks went smoothly . The 2 / 43rd Battalion rapidly advanced north and captured No. 1 Strip in the evening of 10 June . Some Japanese soldiers attempted to defend the airfield area , and the 2 / 43rd Battalion claimed to have killed 23 Japanese for the loss of four Australians wounded . 
 A company from the 2 / 28th Battalion captured Victoria shortly after coming ashore , and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10 : 45 am . One of the battalion 's companies subsequently captured the hill , while its other companies continued to advance . The 2 / 28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition as the day progressed , particularly to the west of its area of responsibility . During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill ( at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads ) , with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars ; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead by the end of the day , and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting . After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour , a troop from the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition . 
 During the afternoon of 10 June a group of senior officers , including General Douglas MacArthur , his air commander General George Kenney , and Australians Lieutenant General Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock ( head of RAAF Command ) , made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead . MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in action , and the party visited a group of front line infantrymen before departing . The process of unloading supplies from the invasion fleet during 10 June proceeded quickly , and the ships began to depart for Morotai during the afternoon of 11 June . 
 The 24th Brigade 's goal for 11 June was to secure the airfield area . The 2 / 43rd Battalion patrolled to the north and west of the airfield during the day , meeting only light opposition . In contrast , the 2 / 28th Battalion ( which was tasked with advancing into Labuan 's interior ) encountered entrenched Japanese forces , and it became clear that it was facing the main body of the island 's garrison . Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back , but the rate of advance was slow . The airfield engineers of No. 62 Wing RAAF were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 Strip to service ; reconstruction of the airfield began the next day . 
 On the basis of the fighting on 11 June , Porter judged that the Japanese were withdrawing into a stronghold position located to the north of Victoria and about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the west of the airfield . On 12 June he directed the two battalions to patrol around the stronghold area . The 2 / 43rd Battalion patrolled the interior of Labuan to the west of No. 1 Strip , but located only a single Japanese position . This position was attacked and destroyed that day by the 2 / 43rd Battalion 's C Company supported by three tanks . The 2 / 28th Battalion sent patrols towards the stronghold area , with a company supported by a tank troop meeting heavy resistance as it pushed westwards along a track towards MacArthur Road . The 2 / 11th Commando Squadron also advanced north , and linked up with elements of the 2 / 43rd Battalion near the centre of Labuan during the late afternoon . The 371st Independent Infantry Battalion 's main radio was destroyed during an air attack on 12 June , cutting the unit off from the 37th Army 's headquarters . As a result of the patrolling , by the end of 12 June the location of the Japanese position was fairly well known to the Australian force . The 24th Brigade 's casualties to this point in the battle were 18 killed and 42 wounded , and the Australians believed that at least 110 Japanese had been killed . The 2 / 32nd Battalion was also landed on Labuan during 12 June , but remained in divisional reserve . 
 On 13 and 14 June the 24th Brigade Group continued operations aimed at forcing the Japanese garrison into the stronghold — dubbed " the Pocket " by the Australians . The 2 / 43rd Battalion secured the emergency airstrip at Timbalai on Labuan 's west coast on 13 June , and elements of the 2 / 28th Battalion continued to push west into the Pocket along MacArthur Road . A company from the 2 / 28th Battalion made another attack into the Pocket the next day after the 2 / 12th Field Regiment had fired 250 rounds into the area , but was forced to withdraw after being unable to overcome heavy resistance . By the conclusion of 14 June the Australians judged that , aside from the Pocket , the island was now secure . Porter assessed that an attack on this position would need to be made in strength using well @-@ coordinated forces . 
 Following the landing the BBCAU detachment and 24th Brigade were faced with a significant humanitarian challenge . The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed almost all of the buildings on Labuan , rendering large numbers of civilians homeless . Within days of the invasion , about 3 @,@ 000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead . The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians , and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies . 
 = = = Destruction of the Japanese garrison = = = 
 The Japanese stronghold position was about 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) long from north to south , and 600 yards ( 550 m ) wide . The terrain within this area comprised a series of small jungle @-@ covered ridges , and the position was bordered on the western and southern sides by swamps . The main terrain features within the Pocket were three areas of high ground named Lushington Ridge , Norman Ridge and Lyon Ridge by the Australians . There were only two feasible routes into the area . The first was a track which led south into the position along Lyon Ridge and Norman Ridge ; this was passable by tanks but heavily mined . The other route was a track which ran into the eastern side of the Pocket from MacArthur Road along Lushington Ridge and joined the other track at Norman Ridge . It is likely that around 250 Japanese personnel were initially stationed within the Pocket . 
 In order to minimise the casualties to his brigade , Porter decided to isolate the Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days . An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively . As part of this plan , the 2 / 12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June . 
 The 2 / 28th Battalion probed into the Pocket on 16 June . The previous day a 2 / 11th Commando Squadron patrol had reported that the track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled , and on the morning of the 16th A Company from the 2 / 28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it . After the bulldozer filled the crater , the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south @-@ east of the ridge . One of the Australian tanks was damaged . A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2 / 11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back , with two Australians killed and another wounded . A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon , supported by a new troop of tanks . The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry , and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel , but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged . By the end of the day , A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded . Overall , 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade 's attached medical units during 16 June , which stretched their capacity . 
 Due to the losses his brigade suffered on 16 June , Porter decided to continue the bombardment before undertaking further attacks . On 18 and 19 June the bombardment of the Pocket was intensified when the heavy cruiser HMAS Shropshire fired into the area . Infantrymen supported by tanks conducted another probe into the Pocket on 19 June , and killed 10 Japanese ; three Australians were wounded . On 20 June the 2 / 12th Field Regiment fired a particularly heavy bombardment and six Allied bombers attacked the Pocket . Porter judged that this would be sufficient to suppress the Japanese defenders , and ordered that the Pocket be attacked by two companies from the 2 / 28th Battalion supported by tanks ( including " Frog " flamethrower variants of the Matilda II ) the next day . 
 In the early hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops slipped out of the Pocket and attempted to attack Australian positions on Labuan . Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure , dock facilities and No. 1 Strip , but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers . A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria , and another 11 were killed at the airfield . Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements . 
 The Japanese attack did not delay the Australian assault on the Pocket . At 10 am on 21 June , C Company of the 2 / 28th Battalion began to advance to the west along Lushington Ridge , and D Company moved south from Eastman Spur . D Company was supported by a troop of three conventional Matilda tanks and two Frog flamethrowers . C Company advanced about half of the way into the Pocket before being halted by Norman who was concerned that they might be accidentally attacked by D Company , which was also making good progress . The force built around D Company subsequently completed the occupation of the Pocket , with the flamethrower tanks playing a key role . The Japanese soldiers who had survived the artillery bombardment offered little resistance to the Australian forces . The 24th Brigade assessed that 60 Japanese personnel were killed in the final assault on the Pocket , with 117 being killed by the artillery bombardment which had preceded it . 
 From 21 June , the 2 / 12th Commando Squadron conducted patrols of the outlying areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces ; up to this point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division 's reserve . Each troop of the squadron was assigned a different sector of Labuan , and by mid @-@ July had completed its task . During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers , mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June , and captured a single prisoner . The 2 / 12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order to improve the quality of maps of the island . The 24th Brigade 's total combat casualties in its operations on Labuan were 34 killed and 93 wounded . The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The process of bringing No. 1 Strip back into service went well . Nos 4 and 5 Airfield Construction Squadrons were assigned the task . A 4 @,@ 000 @-@ by @-@ 100 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 220 by 30 m ) unsurfaced temporary runway was constructed at a 5 ° angle to the existing strip . The first RAAF aircraft , two P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks from No. 76 Squadron , landed on the strip on 17 June , and commenced operations from this base the next day . No. 457 Squadron , which was equipped with Spitfires , arrived on 18 June though two of its aircraft crashed on the still @-@ unfinished runway and had to be written off . The units based at the airfield took over responsibility for providing air support for the Army units on Labuan that day , and flew their first close air support sorties over the island on 19 June . No. 86 Wing 's two flying squadrons — No. 1 and No. 93 — also arrived on Labuan in late July , but conducted few operations from this base before the end of the war . The wing had originally been scheduled to move to Labuan in late June , but it took longer than expected to extend No. 1 Strip 's runway to the length needed by No. 1 Squadron 's Mosquito light bombers . 
 To reconstruct No. 1 's existing runway as an all @-@ weather strip , the bomb craters had to have the water pumped out of them and then be filled in . Sandstone from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand subbase , and the runway was topped with crushed coral from the west coast of the island , and sealed with bitumen . The 5 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft . With 70 also on the dry weather strip , the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft . The 9th Division 's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan . These included building 356 @,@ 000 square feet ( 33 @,@ 100 m2 ) of storage , new port facilities , bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing 29 miles ( 47 km ) of roads . A wharf for Liberty ships was begun on 18 June , allowing the first ship to berth on 10 July . A fuel jetty was in operation by 20 June , and a fuel tank farm with seven 2 @,@ 300 @-@ US @-@ barrel ( 270 @,@ 000 l ; 72 @,@ 000 US gal ; 60 @,@ 000 imp gal ) tanks was completed on 12 July , as was a 600 @-@ bed hospital . Work then began on a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ bed general hospital . The 2 / 4th and 2 / 6th Australian General Hospitals were transferred from Morotai to Labuan during July , though the later unit 's hospital facilities were not completed until 17 September . 
 Once Labuan was secured , the 24th Brigade was ordered to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay . On 16 June , the 2 / 32nd Battalion was transported from Labuan to <unk> Bay . The battalion captured the town of Weston the next day . The remainder of the 24th Brigade was transported across the bay during the last week of June , and the force advanced inland to capture the town of Beaufort which was defended by between 800 and 1 @,@ 000 Japanese personnel . Following some heavy fighting , the town was secured on 28 June . The brigade then advanced further inland to Papar in early July . Later that month the 9th Division 's commander , Major General George Wootten , relieved Norman from command over an incident in which he had lost control of the 2 / 28th Battalion during the fighting on Labuan . Following the announcement of the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945 and the formal ceremony held in Tokyo Bay on 2 September , the commander of the 37th Army , Major General Masao Baba , surrendered to Wootten on 10 September at a ceremony conducted at the 9th Division 's headquarters on Labuan . 
 After the war , Labuan was one of several locations at which the Australian military conducted trials to prosecute suspected Japanese war criminals . A total of 16 trials were held on the island between 3 December 1945 and 31 January 1946 , during which 128 men were convicted and 17 acquitted . Labuan War Cemetery was also established as the burial place for all of the Commonwealth personnel killed on or near Borneo . It includes 3 @,@ 900 graves , most of which are for prisoners of war who died while being held by the Japanese . 
 Memorials have also been erected on Labuan to mark its wartime history . These include the Australian Battle Exploit Memorial at Brown Beach , a plaque marking the location of the 37th Army 's surrender ceremony and a Japanese peace park .

 = Frog Fractions = 
 Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game developed by Twinbeard Studios , a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford . The game , released on October 25 , 2012 , has been described as a spoof of the edutainment game genre . In the game , the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit . Later on , the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog 's abilities . The game does not actually teach the player about fractions ; the player 's score is given in fractions , but no knowledge of them is necessary to play . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Frog Fractions begins with a frog sitting on a lily pad . The player controls the frog , and must use its tongue to attack insects , while collecting and protecting fruit . The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase , including lock @-@ on targeting , a cybernetic brain , and a flying dragon . When the player collects enough fruit , they can buy a warp drive , which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars , where the player then battles an alien robot squid . The player is then sent to Bug Court , where they sign their work visa . The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars , while listening to a narrated history of the creation of boxing . At the end of the maze , the player activates a spaceship , and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars , where the game appears to end ( actually fake credits ) . Upon returning , the player runs for president in a music simulator game . Regardless of how well they perform , they succeed in being elected president , and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades . Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes . The game takes about one hour to complete . 
 = = Development = = 
 Crawford originally created Frog Fractions to entertain his friends , and to see their reactions when they first played it . Later on , he felt that with the indie genre taking off , Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers . Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games , he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind . Instead , Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name 's alliteration , and because he considered educational games a part of his youth . 
 Originally , Frog Fractions included tutorials to teach the player how to progress through the game . However , after Crawford asked his friend Tim Ambrogi to play test the game , Ambrogi stated that he did not want to read any of the informational <unk> that appeared throughout the game because he was too busy focusing on the gameplay . Crawford added transitions that made the game feel like a " dream @-@ like progression " , which he believed would better appeal to players . For transitions in the game 's latter half , Crawford wanted the transitions to entertain players more , rather than attempt to make any sense of the game 's story . PC World complimented Frog Fractions for using the transitions to draw connections between each scene to add a feeling of consistency , despite the often strange transitions that take place . 
 In order to make money from Frog Fractions , Crawford first sold the game 's soundtrack , with part of the proceeds going to the game 's music team . He later decided to sell T @-@ shirts containing jokes from the game in order to benefit its art team . While developing Frog Fractions , Crawford said that he came up with a lot of other video game ideas , but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project , due to the game 's unpredictable nature . 
 = = Release = = 
 Crawford released Frog Fractions earlier than he wanted , when he sent an incomplete version to the 2013 Independent Games Festival as a " Main Competition <unk> " but was told that he needed to increase the game 's popularity before it would be accepted . Subsequently , he let Gamasutra editor and popular Twitter user Brandon Sheffield play the game , who enjoyed it so much that he shared it with his more than 3 @,@ 000 Twitter followers . Within a day , tens of thousands of people had played the game . 
 After the game 's release , players began requesting new features , such as more updates , a high definition version for tablets and smartphones , and a sequel . Crawford is interested in developing a high definition version in which he could include some leftover ideas , but admits that he is unsure if this will ever materialize . He notes that he created Frog Fractions to gain visibility for himself rather than to profit from it . Frog Fractions has been described as being possibly the " greatest game of all time " by Rock Paper Shotgun , who credit the wild range of gameplay mechanics . It has also been called " the most deranged thing you 'll play this year " by Eurogamer , and " either the best or worst piece of math <unk> @-@ <unk> in history " by the <unk> Society . The game won Giant Bomb 's " URL of the Year " award for 2012 . In March 2014 , Twinbeard launched a Kickstarter campaign to <unk> the development of a sequel entitled Frog Fractions 2 . 
 = = Sequel = = 
 Frog Fractions 2 is a sequel to the free , browser @-@ based game Frog Fractions , which was developed by the game studio Twinbeard , founded by Jim Crawford . In the style of the original , Frog Fractions 2 is intended to have hidden elements that will reveal themselves to careful players . Crawford stated that Frog Fractions 2 would be released publicly without any announcement from himself or Twinbeard , and it will be the players ' job to find it . The lead @-@ up to discovering the game is the subject of a multiple @-@ year ARG , or Alternate Reality Game , and the subject of much media attention . Eventually , the game will be available as a downloadable standalone program for Windows , OS X , and Linux . 
 = = = Funding and development = = = 
 The potential future existence of Frog Fractions 2 was announced as part of a Kickstarter campaign . The campaign was started in March 2014 and was funded and complete on April 11 , 2014 , exceeding its original goal of $ 60 @,@ 000 , for a total funded amount of $ 72 @,@ 107 with 2 @,@ 571 backers . 
 A video accompanying the Kickstarter page held a series of clues that led interested participants to find out more information about where Frog Fractions 2 would eventually appear on the internet . These clues have been discussed and analyzed in online forums , and there have been a few attempts to summarize early puzzle in the ARG . Although the ARG is a critical part of the eventual revelation of Frog Fractions 2 's release , it is a large , collaborative effort to solve the puzzles written for it , and is functionally a different game than the downloadable version promised in the Kickstarter campaign . 
 = Dan Brouthers = 
 Dennis Joseph " Dan " Brouthers ( / <unk> / ; May 8 , 1858 – August 2 , 1932 ) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball whose career spanned the period from 1879 to 1896 , with a brief return in 1904 . Nicknamed " Big Dan " for his size , he was 6 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) and weighed 207 pounds ( 94 kg ) , which was large for 19th @-@ century standards . 
 Recognized as the first great slugger in baseball history , and among the greatest sluggers of his era , he held the record for career home runs from 1887 to 1889 , with his final total of 106 tying for the fourth most of the 19th century . His career slugging percentage of .519 remained the Major League record for a player with at least 4 @,@ 000 at bats until Ty Cobb edged ahead of him in 1922 . At the time of his initial retirement , he also ranked second in career triples ( 205 ) , and third in runs batted in ( 1 @,@ 296 ) and hits . 
 A dominating hitter during the prime of his career , he led ( or was in the top of ) the league in most offensive categories , including batting average , runs scored , runs batted in ( RBI ) , on @-@ base percentage and hits . He led the league in batting average five times , the most by a 19th @-@ century player , and his career .342 batting average still ranks ninth all @-@ time . Brouthers is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have appeared in Major League games in four decades . 
 He was also an active players ' union member , and was elected vice president of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players . Brouthers was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 by the Veterans Committee . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Born in Sylvan Lake , New York , he played organized baseball from the time that he was a child , from playing in the local <unk> to the semi @-@ professional <unk> of Wappingers Falls , New York . On July 7 , 1877 , while running the bases , he collided at home plate with a catcher , named Johnny Quigley , of the Clippers of Harlem . Quigley was knocked unconscious , having suffered a traumatic head injury , and later died from these injuries on August 12 . The 19 @-@ year @-@ old Brouthers was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities . 
 = = Major League career = = 
 = = = Troy = = = 
 Brouthers made his Major League debut on June 23 , 1879 , for the Troy Trojans , and contributed a single in a come @-@ from @-@ behind victory against the Syracuse Stars . Although he was a first baseman , he was called upon to pitch that season with the Trojans in three games , one of which was on August 21 against Tommy Bond and the Boston Red Caps . Brouthers lost 16 – 0 , and within two weeks he was released from the club . He hit .274 that first season , with four home runs , and had 17 RBIs in 39 games played . 
 After his release , Brouthers played for a minor league team in Rochester , New York , and on one occasion in 1880 , he hit a game @-@ winning home run in an exhibition game versus the Buffalo Bisons , off future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin . He hit well enough in the minors to get another shot with the Trojans , which lasted just three games when he had only two hits in 12 at bats , and he was released again . 
 = = = Buffalo = = = 
 He got his first chance to be an everyday player in 1881 , when he was signed by the Bisons , the team that he did well against the previous year . That season he batted .319 , and played with them until the team folded after the 1885 season . In his first season with the Bisons , he led the National League ( NL ) in home runs and slugging percentage . Brouthers , along with teammates Jack Rowe , Hardy Richardson and Deacon White , became known as the " Big Four " . In 1882 and 1883 he won his first two batting titles , posting .368 and .374 averages , respectively . Along with his two batting titles , during his time in Buffalo he also led the NL in slugging five times , hits and total bases twice each , and triples and RBIs once each , with his 1883 total of 97 RBIs setting a new Major League record ; Cap Anson had set the previous mark of 83 the year before , and retook the record the following year with a total of 102 . On July 19 , 1883 , Brouthers went 6 @-@ for @-@ 6 with two doubles in a 25 – 5 defeat of the Philadelphia Quakers . 
 = = = Detroit and The Brotherhood = = = 
 At the end of the 1885 season , Buffalo was going through financial trouble and were forced to sell off their players , so " The Big Four " were sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL for US $ 7 @,@ 000 . In 1886 , his first season in Detroit , he again led the league in slugging percentage , the sixth year in a row , and led the league in total bases and doubles and claimed his first home run title . He finished within the top 10 in most offensive categories , including a third @-@ place finish in the batting race with a lofty .370 average . On September 10 , 1886 , Brouthers hit three home runs ‚ along with a double and a single , to set the NL record with 15 total bases in one game . This mark tied the Major League record at the time , as Guy Hecker of the Louisville Colonels totaled 15 the previous month in the American Association . 
 The Detroit team was filled with stars from the era , including future Hall of Famers Sam Thompson and Ned Hanlon , as well as second baseman Fred Dunlap , the " Big Four " , and the pitching of Lady Baldwin and Charlie Getzien . The team finished with a record of 87 wins and 36 losses , but finished in second place behind the Chicago White Stockings by 2 1 ⁄ 2 games . 
 During the off @-@ season , on November 11 , 1886 , The Executive Council of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players ‚ formed in 1885 as the first organized players ' union , met and re @-@ elected John Montgomery Ward as president , and elected Brouthers as vice president . 
 In 1887 , with the 1886 roster intact , the Wolverines finished in first place , besting the Quakers by 3 1 ⁄ 2 games . Brouthers batted .338 , and led the league in runs scored with 153 , doubles with 36 , and on @-@ base percentage , while again finishing in the top 10 in most offensive categories . The Wolverines , behind the bats of Brouthers , Thompson and Richardson , led the League in batting , runs scored and slugging , and went on to face the St. Louis Browns in a best @-@ of @-@ 15 post @-@ season tournament , the " World 's Series " . The Wolverines sealed a series championship with their eighth victory in 11 games ; however , the two teams finished the series anyway , with Detroit winning 10 games to the Browns ' five . Brouthers only played in one of those games , getting two hits in three at bats . 
 Following the season , on November 17 , 1887 , members of the NL officially recognized the Brotherhood and met with a Brotherhood committee that consisted of three players – Ward ‚ Hanlon and Brouthers . 
 The 1888 Detroit team did not fare as well , finishing in fifth place with a record of 68 – 63 , which was a full 16 games behind the first @-@ place New York Giants . Brouthers ' numbers declined as well , as he did not produce at the same level of his previous seasons . Even with the lower numbers , he still led the league in runs scored with 118 , and doubles for the third year in a row . The team 's decline is attributed to prolonged injuries sustained by key players , while turmoil that unfolded concerning veteran stars ' salary demands , and with falling attendance numbers , the club was forced to fold at the season 's end . Brouthers was then purchased by the Boston Beaneaters of the NL on October 16 . 
 = = = Boston = = = 
 In 1889 , his only season with the Beaneaters , he batted a league @-@ leading .373 , along with 105 runs scored and 118 runs batted in ; he struck out only six times . The first strikeout occurred on June 11 , when he fell victim to Mickey Welch of the Giants . 
 After the season , he – along with many Major League players – jumped to the Players ' League , a league established by the Brotherhood which competed against the two other Major Leagues already in existence . Brouthers signed with the Boston Reds , and batted .330 while leading the league in on @-@ base percentage and slugging . The Reds , behind the talents of Brouthers , Harry Stovey , Hardy Richardson , Charles Radbourn and player @-@ manager King Kelly , finished in first place , 6 1 ⁄ 2 games ahead of the Brooklyn Ward 's Wonders . 
 The Players ' League lasted just the one season , and the Reds merged into the American Association , carrying many of the championship team 's previous players . Again , the team won the league 's championship , finishing 8 1 ⁄ 2 games ahead of the St. Louis Browns . Brouthers led the league in batting average ( .350 ) , on @-@ base percentage and slugging , while finishing second in triples with 19 , sixth in doubles with 26 , and third in RBIs with 109 . 
 = = = Late career = = = 
 After the American Association folded following the 1891 season , Brouthers was sent to the Brooklyn Grooms of the NL , where he played two seasons . Most of his success came in that first season , when he led the league in batting average , hits , RBIs and total bases . For the 1893 season , he played in only 77 of the team 's games , but did well , hitting .337 . After the season , Brouthers was traded along with Willie Keeler to the Baltimore Orioles for Billy <unk> and George Treadway . 
 This trade brought in two future Hall of Fame players , which added to the already established Orioles core of players including third baseman John McGraw , catcher Wilbert Robinson , shortstop Hughie Jennings , and center fielder Joe Kelley , all future Hall of Fame members . The Orioles won the league 's championship that season , and it was Brouthers ' last full season in the majors , as he again produced great numbers , batting .347 , finishing seventh in total bases , fifth in RBIs ( 128 ) , fourth in doubles ( 39 ) , and fifth in triples ( 23 ) . 
 During his career , and most notably during his time in Baltimore , he was known to always have his dog , an Irish setter named Kelly , and had him sit in the players ' area . It is claimed that the players never minded much , as he was very well @-@ behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise . 
 Early in the 1895 season , Baltimore sold Brouthers to the Louisville Colonels for $ 500 , as his skills seemed to have diminished , and he only played in 24 of Louisville 's games that season ; he came back to hit .309 for them , ending the year with a .300 overall mark . Following the season , Louisville sold him to the Philadelphia Phillies for $ 500 , where he played in 57 games in 1896 , batting .344 . It was his last season in the majors until he appeared for the 1904 New York Giants , where he was hitless in a two @-@ game stint before retiring . 
 Brouthers is still among the all @-@ time leaders in many offensive categories . His .342 batting average ranks ninth , 205 triples ranks eighth , and his .423 on @-@ base percentage ranks 15th . He is tied with Mike Tiernan for fourth among 19th @-@ century home run hitters with a total of 106 , behind Roger Connor ( 138 ) , Sam Thompson ( 127 ) and Stovey ( 122 ) . 
 = = Post @-@ career = = 
 Brouthers played minor league baseball for the 1898 Toronto Maple Leafs of the Eastern League , where he won a batting title with a .415 average . Later he played for the Poughkeepsie , New York , team of the Hudson River League , batting a league @-@ leading .373 at age 46 . 
 He remained near baseball for many years , working for his former teammate and New York Giants manager John McGraw , who placed him in charge of the Polo Grounds press gate . He was with the Giants for nearly 20 years in this and other capacities . 
 Brouthers died at the age of 74 of a heart attack in East Orange , New Jersey , and is interred at Saint Mary 's Cemetery in Wappingers Falls , New York . There is a statue dedicated to him located in Veteran 's Park in this small village . In 1945 , Brouthers and several other stars of the era prior to 1910 were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee . In honor of his achievements in Buffalo , he was inducted into the newly formed Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985 . In 1999 , a survey of the Society for American Baseball Research ranked him as the sixth @-@ greatest player of the 19th century . 
 = Russian battleship Slava = 
 Slava ( Russian : <unk> " Glory " ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy , the last of the five Borodino @-@ class battleships . Commissioned too late to participate in the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo @-@ Japanese War , she survived while all of her sister ships were either sunk during the battle or surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Navy . 
 Serving in the Baltic Sea during World War I , Slava was the largest ship of the Russian Gulf of Riga Squadron that fought the German High Seas Fleet in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . She repeatedly bombarded German positions and troops for the rest of 1915 and during 1916 . During the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917 , Slava was badly damaged by the German dreadnought SMS König , significantly increasing her draft . The shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was scuttled in the Moon Sound Strait between the island of Muhu ( Moon ) and the mainland . The Estonians scrapped her during the 1930s . 
 = = Description = = 
 Slava was 389 feet 5 inches ( 118 @.@ 69 m ) long at the waterline and 397 feet 3 inches ( 121 @.@ 1 m ) long overall , with a beam of 76 feet 1 inch ( 23 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 29 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) , 38 inches ( 965 mm ) more than designed . Her normal displacement was 14 @,@ 415 long tons ( 14 @,@ 646 t ) , almost 900 long tons ( 914 t ) more than her designed displacement of 13 @,@ 516 long tons ( 13 @,@ 733 t ) . 
 The ship was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines , each driving one 4 @-@ bladed propeller , with twenty Belleville water @-@ tube boilers providing steam to the engines at a pressure of 21 standard atmospheres ( 2 @,@ 128 kPa ; 309 psi ) . The engines and boilers were both built by the Baltic Works . The engines had a total designed output of 15 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 782 kW ) , but they produced 16 @,@ 378 ihp ( 12 @,@ 213 kW ) on trials and gave a top speed of 17 @.@ 64 knots ( 32 @.@ 67 km / h ; 20 @.@ 30 mph ) . At full load she carried 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 372 t ) of coal that provided her a range of 2 @,@ 590 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 2 @,@ 980 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had four steam @-@ driven dynamos , each with a capacity of 150 kW , and two auxiliary generators with a capacity of 64 kW each . 
 Slava 's 40 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch guns were mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . They had a rate of fire of about one round per minute . Sixty rounds per gun were carried . The twelve 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets carried on the sides of the ship . They had a practical rate of fire of about three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun . Four of the twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns used against torpedo boats were mounted in casemates just below the forward main gun turret , two on each side . These guns were placed well above the waterline for use in any weather , unlike the remaining sixteen guns , which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over the length of the ship , close to the water . This was graphically demonstrated when Slava 's sister ship Imperator Aleksandr III made a high @-@ speed turn during her trials , heeling 15 ° , and began taking water through the lower casemates . Each gun had 300 rounds available . All but four of her 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns were removed before she was completed and the remaining guns were used as saluting guns . She carried four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one above water in the bow and one in the stern with two torpedoes each , and a submerged tube on each side forward with three torpedoes each . Two of these were removed before 1914 , although it is not known which ones were retained . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 She was reportedly fitted with two 47 mm anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns during the war , but carried only four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) AA guns in early 1917 . Her light armament had been reduced to twelve 75 mm guns by that same date . While she was laid up over the winter of 1916 at Helsinki , the elevation of her main guns was increased to a maximum of 25 ° which increased their range to 23 @,@ 000 yards ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 = = Service = = 
 Slava was built by the Baltic Works at Saint Petersburg . She was laid down on 1 November 1902 , launched on 29 August 1903 , and completed in October 1905 , too late to participate in the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Together with the battleship Tsesarevich , she helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906 . Slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post @-@ Tsushima naval reforms . On one of her training cruises to the Mediterranean , her crewmen rescued survivors during the 1908 Messina earthquake and the ship took casualties to Naples for medical care . She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by Tsesarevich to Gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete . Upon her return to Kronstadt she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the Baltic Fleet . 
 The Baltic Fleet only had four pre @-@ dreadnoughts in service , as the Second Brigade of Battleships , when World War I began , although the four dreadnoughts of the Gangut class were almost finished . After they were completed and could defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland , Slava sailed through the Irbe Strait on 31 July 1915 to assist Russian forces defending the Gulf of Riga . More specifically she was to support the Imperial Russian Army with her guns and to defend the gulf against German naval forces . 
 = = = Battle of the Gulf of Riga = = = 
 Barely a week later , on 8 August , the Germans began to sweep the mines defending the Irbe Strait , and Slava , accompanied by the gunboats <unk> and <unk> , sortied to fire on the minesweepers . The German pre @-@ dreadnoughts Elsass and Braunschweig attempted to drive the Russians off , but Slava remained in position despite sustaining splinter damage from near misses . She did not open fire , as her captain did not want to reveal the fact that she was out @-@ ranged by the German battleships . The Germans were not prepared for the number of mines laid by the Russians and withdrew to reconsider their plans . 
 They tried again on 16 August , this time with the dreadnoughts Nassau and Posen defending the minesweepers . Slava flooded her side compartments to give herself a 3 ° list which increased her maximum range to about 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 459 m ) . She did not engage the German battleships , but only fired on the minesweepers and any German ships such as the armored cruiser Prinz Adalbert when they approached the other Russian ships . When the Germans returned the next day Slava was hit three times by 283 @-@ millimeter ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) shells in quick succession . The first hit penetrated her upper belt armor and exploded in a coal bunker ; the second hit penetrated her upper deck , hit the supporting tube of the aft port side six @-@ inch turret and started a fire in the ammunition hoist which caused the magazine to be flooded . The third shell passed through a pair of the ship 's boats , but exploded in the water off to one side . These hits did not seriously damage Slava and she remained in place until ordered to retreat . The Germans entered the Gulf the next day , but they were forced to withdraw shortly afterward when the British submarine HMS E1 torpedoed the battlecruiser Moltke on 19 August and the Russian coastal artillery that still commanded the Irbe Strait made it very risky to enter the Gulf of Riga . 
 The German withdrawal allowed Slava , after repairs , to switch to her other task and support the army with gunfire . During one of these missions , as she was bombarding German positions near Tukums on 25 September 1915 , she was hit in the conning tower while at anchor , killing her captain and five others . McLaughlin attributes the hit to German field artillery , but Nekrasov quotes German accounts that attribute it to a 10 @-@ kilogram ( 22 lb ) bomb dropped by one of a pair of German seaplanes . Slava remained in position and resumed her bombardment . She continued to support the Army until the water in the Gulf of Riga threatened to freeze over at which time she retired to the port of <unk> to winter over . While still in port she was hit by three light bombs dropped by a seaplane on 12 April 1916 ; these did little material damage , but killed seven sailors . On 2 July she resumed her support of the army with a bombardment of advancing German troops despite sustaining one hit by an 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) shell on her waterline armor that caused no damage . She repeated these missions a number of times in July and August . These annoyed the Germans enough that they attempted to sink Slava with a coordinated ambush by the submarine UB @-@ 31 and low @-@ flying torpedo bombers as she responded to a feint by German cruisers on 12 September , but all their torpedoes missed . This was the first attack by torpedo bombers against a moving battleship . 
 = = = Battle of Moon Sound = = = 
 Slava was held back during the initial stages of the German landings ( Operation Albion ) on Saaremaa ( <unk> ) Island guarding the mouth of the Gulf of Riga in October 1917 to defend Kassar Wiek ( Inlet ) , which separates the outer islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa ( Dagö ) . She intermittently fired at German torpedo boats as they fought Russian light forces in Kassar Wiek on 15 and 16 October , but scored no hits from her position near <unk> ( <unk> ) Island in Moon Sound Strait . On the morning of 17 October the Germans attempted to sweep the Russian mines placed at the southern entrance to Moon Sound Strait . Slava , the pre @-@ dreadnought Grazhdanin and the armored cruiser Bayan were ordered south to meet them by Vice Admiral Mikhail Bakhirev , opening fire on the minesweepers at 8 : 05 a.m. The dreadnoughts König and Kronprinz were to provide cover for the minesweepers , but Slava , sailing further south , opened fire on them at 8 : 12 at nearly her maximum range . Grazhdanin , whose turrets had not been modified for extra elevation , remained behind with Bayan and continued to engage the minesweepers . The German ships returned fire , but their shells fell short at a range of 20 @,@ 400 meters ( 22 @,@ 300 yd ) . Slava continued to fire on the Germans , but scored no hits , although some shells impacted only 50 meters ( 160 ft ) from König . The German ships were at a severe disadvantage as they were sailing in a narrow swept channel and could not maneuver , so they reversed course to get out of range . 
 The German minesweepers made good progress , despite minor damage from shell splinters and numerous near misses by Slava , Grazhdanin , Bayan , and the Russian shore batteries . During this period Slava 's front turret became inoperable when a bronze rack and pinion gear bent so that the gear wheel could not be moved . Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown . Slava and her consorts were ordered north to allow the crews to eat lunch , but returned to the fray and opened fire on the minesweepers again at 10 : 04 with her rear turret at an approximate range of 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 10 @,@ 973 m ) . The minesweepers had cleared a channel to the north while the Russians were eating and the dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage the Russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts . König opened fire on Slava at 10 : 14 and hit her with three shells from her third salvo . The first hit Slava 's bow , 10 – 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 7 m ) below the waterline , and exploded in the bow dynamo room , flooding that room , the forward 12 @-@ inch magazine and other bow compartments , while the second penetrated the capstan flat . The ship took on 1 @,@ 130 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 112 long tons ) of water which gave her a list of 8 ° , later reduced to 4 ° by counter @-@ flooding . This also increased her forward draft to about 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) . The third shell hit the port side armor abreast the engine room , but failed to penetrate . Two more shells struck her at 10 : 24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel . They damaged a six @-@ inch magazine and the forward stokehold ( boiler room ) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes . However , the forward left six @-@ inch magazine was flooded as a precaution . At 10 : 39 two more shells hit her , killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker . Around this time Slava and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while Bayan trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships . 
 Slava 's draft had increased too much to allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi ( Worms ) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep @-@ draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance . However , the Sailors ' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking , and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because there was no one to obey the captain 's order to stop . A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12 @-@ inch magazine exploded at 11 : 58 . However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her . Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel . She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians . 
 = Temptations ( song ) = 
 " Temptations " is a song by rap artist Tupac Shakur ( 2Pac ) from the album Me Against the World . It was released as a single on June 4 , 1996 , and was released as a CD , cassette , and 12 " promo . While rapping is solely performed by Shakur , Erick Sermon and producer Easy Mo Bee are also featured in the song , primarily as background vocalists . The song uses the bassline from the " Computer Love " , and the theme focuses on relationship and infidelity issues . Debuting at number sixty @-@ eight on the Billboard Hot 100 , the song did fairly well in the United States . It was also well received by critics , with many writers commenting on its romantic tone . 
 The song 's music video does not have any shots of Shakur , since he was incarcerated at the time . Instead , the video features many celebrities such as Coolio , Ice @-@ T , Warren G , Adina Howard and Kenya Moore . Taking place in a hotel , the video opens and closes with the concierge ( Ice @-@ T ) complaining about Coolio ( a bellboy ) . The main plot of the video follows Coolio while he is working in the hotel . 
 = = Writing and composition = = 
 The idea for " Temptations " began in late 1993 when record producer Easy Mo Bee came to Shakur while he was on the set of Above the Rim ( 1994 ) . At Rucker Park in New York City , Mo Bee approached Shakur with several different songs they could sample from in the Me Against the World album . Out of the pieces he showed the rapper , Shakur favored the Zapp song " Computer Love . " Despite being frequently sampled in the past by other artists , Shakur proposed that they simply speed up the tempo of " Computer Love " and use a low frequency automatic filter to retrieve the song 's bassline . 
 After adding new beats and synth pads / leads , Mo Bee decided to add a sample of the Redman and Erick Sermon song " Watch Yo Nuggets " , which contributes to much of the song 's tenor section with the repeated line of " Hey . " The song 's hook samples " Sing a Simple Song " by Sly & the Family Stone . The song also features Mo Bee and some of his friends singing harmonies . 
 " Temptations " deals with a male @-@ female relationship , where Shakur is — in Mo Bee 's word 's — basically saying to his significant other , " I like the time I 'm <unk> ' with [ you ] , but baby , I 'm busy . " Other than the theme of the relationship issues , the song also focuses on the ability for anyone to feel lonely . The lines " ' cause even thugs get lonely , understand . Even the hardest of my homies need attention ; catch you blowin ' up the telephone , reminiscing . " from the third verse , are explained by William <unk> in his 2011 book , Understand Rap : Explanations of Confusing Rap Lyrics You and Your Grandma Can Understand . He states that despite having a " tough " attitude and exterior , thugs are not emotionless . <unk> goes on to say that there are times where everyone longs for the company of someone — be a friend or significant other — so they can share feelings and troubles with .

 Despite being the only rapper to perform in the song 's musical composition , the music video neglects an appearance by Shakur because of his incarceration for alleged sexual abuse . Directed by David Nelson , the video features celebrity guest appearances by Adina Howard , B @-@ Real , Bill Bellamy , Cheryl James , Coolio , Crystal Waters , DJ <unk> , Ice @-@ T , Isaac Hayes , Jada Pinkett Smith , Jasmine Guy , Kenya Moore , Shock G , Joe Torry , <unk> , Warren G , and Yo @-@ Yo . 
 Nelson said the video 's production was ambitious , stating : " It 's an incredible challenge to make a creative clip of a song without the artist . " He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously because he was the first to commit to his role as the bellboy . Nelson says that Coolio 's role " provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video . " Yvette Lang , who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks , described the filming to be like a " big party " to show their support for Shakur . Ice @-@ T 's role as the hotel concierge was not originally intended . At first , there was a comedian set to play his role , but he ended up cancelling at the last minute . Since Ice @-@ T was only available to shoot in the morning , Nelson decided to make him the concierge . The director called it a " strange blessing " since he is more memorable as a concierge , rather than his intended role . 
 " I shot the clip as if it were a movie , and the preview edit is the equivalent of a film trailer . We both wanted the video to be sexy and erotic , but not sleazy . It definitely pushes the envelope , but then it throws comedy to keep things from getting too serious . " 
 The music video opens with Ice @-@ T , the concierge , and Coolio , the bellboy , in a hotel lobby . Ice @-@ T is getting onto Coolio about how he does not put forth enough effort in his work and does not deserve the job . The song begins to play after this scene ends , and the plot follows Coolio who , while on the job , sees acts of strip poker , lesbian affairs , and several sexual scenarios . The bellboy eventually is invited into one of the rooms and the music comes to an end . The video ends with a scene of Ice @-@ T continuing to complain about the bellboy 's work ethics .

 The Los Angeles Times inquires that the video deals with acts which lead to Shakur 's imprisonment , commenting : " The clip itself practically invites that kind of scrutiny . The hotel setting and explicit sex echo Shakur 's own crimes , which involved sodomy occurring in a hotel . " Nelson denies these claims , insisting that it is purely coincidental that Shakur was imprisoned for similar occurrences .

 Steve Huey at AllMusic described the piece as a romance , and said that it gave a " new meaning as an escape from the hellish pressure of everyday life . " Cheo Coker of the Rolling Stone said the song is based on a slow beat and " avoids formulaic , radio @-@ friendly material , " and instead focuses on rhymes and confessions from the heart . Music critic Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that Shakur is describing himself as a " touring rap star " with the song line : " Even though I 'm known for my one @-@ night stands , I want to be an honest man .

 Who 's Your City ? : How the Creative Economy Is Making Where You Live the Most Important Decision of Your Life is a non @-@ fiction book written by Richard Florida . The book advances Florida 's previous work on the locational choices of people and businesses . He adds a dimension of environmental psychology by assigning psychological profiles to urban regions according to the dominant personality traits of the people who live there . For example , the New York metropolitan area and the <unk> area have the highest concentration in the United States of people whose dominant personality trait is neuroticism . The book ends with a ten step guide to choosing a location best suited to the reader 's personality and life situation . Since the 2002 publication of The Rise of the Creative Class , Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success in his study and promotion of the concept of a creative class , or a cohort of highly innovative , highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses . Who 's Your City ? , Florida 's fourth book on the subject , combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self @-@ help tone . Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience , those easily able to move , would consult the book for advice on moving , but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world . 
 = = Background = = 
 Economic geographer Richard Florida came to prominence when he popularized the concept of a creative class , or a subset of individuals whose work involves creativity and innovation . Florida 's previous three books , The Rise of the Creative Class ( 2002 ) , Cities and the Creative Class ( 2005 ) , and The Flight of the Creative Class ( 2005 ) , link the creative class with wealth generation and argue that the individuals in the creative class choose to locate in places with strong cultural and recreational activities , as well as an interesting nightlife . Cities that have offered those activities have attracted innovative people , and despite high land and labor costs , businesses have chosen to re @-@ locate to those areas in order to access them . With the success of his creative class theories , Florida founded a consulting firm , called the Creative Class Group , to advise local governments and other organizations about how to attract creative and innovative people . Florida , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University 's Heinz College in Pittsburgh until 2005 , wrote his next book , Who 's Your City ? , after moving to George Mason University 's School of Public Policy . By the time he agreed to move to the University of Toronto he was deemed an " academic pop star " . Upon his arrival , he was personally greeted by the mayor of Toronto and the premier of Ontario . Articles in the National Post and Toronto Star heralded his move , an article appeared in the magazine Style at Home featuring his new house , and he was given a regular column in the Globe & Mail . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Part 1 : Why Place Matters = = = 
 Who 's Your City ? is divided into four parts with a total of 16 chapters . The first part presents data that suggests the world 's population and economy are becoming increasingly geographically concentrated into few mega @-@ regions , such as <unk> and the San Francisco Bay Area . Thomas Friedman 's Flat World Theory , or his assertion that distance and place is becoming irrelevant , is countered by Florida with maps of population growth , economic activity , innovation ( as demonstrated by patent registration ) , and scientific discovery ( as demonstrated by residence of the most heavily cited scientists ) . Florida 's maps show " spiky " concentrations in these mega @-@ regions , although each region does not necessarily rank high in each category . For example , the <unk> Belt ranks high in innovation but low in scientific discovery , and Indian and Pakistani cities show high population concentrations but low economic activity . Florida explains the existence of these geographical spikes by insisting that talented individuals tend to cluster to one another , creating a ( non @-@ linear ) multiplier effect that attracts additional talented individuals to that geographical area . 
 = = = Part 2 : The Wealth of Place = = = 
 The second part of the book presents evidence that globalization is creating a new class divide : those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted . This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values , culture , economic specialization , and other factors , and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs . Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class . Finally , globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate . 
 = = = Part III : The Geography of Happiness = = = 
 The third part of Who 's Your City ? examines the role of " where someone lives " as a factor of happiness . Florida 's " Place and Happiness Survey " , which he conducted with The Gallup Organization , shows that higher incomes and levels of education produces more community satisfaction , married people tend to be more satisfied with their community than singles , as older people as compared to younger people . In addition , renters are slightly more satisfied with their living arrangements than home owners , and people are generally satisfied with where they live . 
 Adding psychological profiles to his previous work , Florida was able to find strong connections between the Big Five personality traits and regions in the United States . For example , neuroticism is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area and the <unk> area , agreeableness and conscientiousness in the eastern Sunbelt area , <unk> in the Chicago metropolitan area , the St. Louis / Nashville / Atlanta area , and the South Florida area . Openness seems to be concentrated in the <unk> and the San Francisco Bay Area . Florida explains the results by linking the dominant forms of employment in the areas with the personality traits : manufacturing regions require people who are agreeable ( i.e. , they follow rules ) and conscientious ( they work with dangerous machinery ) , areas with high immigrant populations require that their residents exhibit openness , and management and sales @-@ related jobs need workers with extroversion . Florida was also able to find that his " Gay and Bohemian Index " , which connects gay and artistic communities to high growth and wealth generation areas , is a proxy for regions with large concentrations of the openness personality trait . 
 = = = Part IV : Where We Live Now = = = 
 The final part of the book suggests that most people have three significant moves : when leaving their parents ' home , when starting a family , and when retiring ( or when their own adult children move out ) . When young people leave their home ( or when they complete college ) , they tend to locate to areas that offer attractive job markets , cultural or recreational amenities , and rank high in quality of life factors . When they get married or have children , people choose areas that are perceived as safe and family @-@ friendly . Florida suggests using a " Trick @-@ or @-@ <unk> Index " to gauge if parents feel safe allowing their children to go door @-@ to @-@ door on Halloween . He also cites Catherine Austin Fitts ' " Popsicle Index " , which gauges how far are parents willing to allow their children to walk to buy a treat . Once retired , or when their adult children move away , people tend to gravitate towards similar areas as young people , if it is close to their grandchildren , but in quieter neighborhoods that provide opportunities for hobbies or for a second career . 
 = = Style = = 
 Who 's Your City ? was intended to be a self @-@ help book , based on scholarly research and an academic theory , that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside . Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class , as well as theories and opinions of other academics , like Jane Jacobs , and even those who have been critical of Florida 's work , like Tim Harford . New research included a psychological aspect to his theory . Maps , graphs , tables , and indices illustrate the text . The book has been described as having a " lighthearted tone ... [ that ] doesn 't always work " , " earnest ... [ with ] forced exuberance " , and wandering from a broad " discussion of the world economy to home @-@ buying advice " . Doron Taussig of Washington Monthly described the book as a hybrid between " academic form " and " professional @-@ advice @-@ giving " . Several reviewers noted that while a popular audience is the target , the book is also of interest to professionals or students of the topic . 
 = = Publication = = 
 Who 's Your City ? was published as a hardcover in March 2008 by Basic Books in the United States and Random House Canada in Canada . A year later , the trade paperback version was published in the United States . After Canadian reviewers commented on the US @-@ focus of the book , a revised Canadian version , with some studies and maps expanded to include Canada , was published by Vintage Canada as a trade paperback . An international version was published overseas . Excerpts were published in The Globe and Mail newspaper and Fast Company magazine . 
 = = Reception = = 
 While critics recognize the value in Florida 's work , many found the premise behind Who 's Your City ? flawed . The reviewer for Salon.com wrote it was questionable that " anyone , least of all a member of the creative class , would need such a self @-@ help book . ...

 In 2000 , the two video game publishers LucasArts and THQ announced an agreement that would allow THQ to turn LucasArts licenses into games for the hand held console Game Boy Color . THQ had previously published the Game Boy Color game Star Wars : Yoda Stories , and began work on their second Star Wars @-@ licensed product , Obi @-@ Wan 's Adventures , thereafter as part of the agreement with LucasArts . It was a port of the then upcoming game Star Wars : Obi @-@ Wan , which was planned to be released for personal computers ( PC ) but was later canceled . Obi @-@ Wan 's Adventures was first announced to the public in September 2000 . 
 THQ hired the third @-@ party Game Boy developer HotGen to develop the game , which they described as " the most authentic Star Wars adventure on the Game Boy Color system . " Mark Fisher , director of product development at HotGen , commented on the game : " THQ has a solid hold on the Game Boy Color market , and we look forward to collaborating with them on Star Wars : Obi @-@ Wan 's Adventures . Millions of Star Wars fans will have the opportunity to interact with their favorite characters in a brand new Star Wars adventure just in time for the holidays .

 The game has received mixed reviews from critics , with an aggregate score of 62 @.@ 33 % on GameRankings . Marc Nix of IGN gave it a 5 / 10 rating and commented that " murky visuals and slothful control destroy any hope of greatness in this game . " The visuals were also criticized by an editor of 1UP.com , who stated that " you couldn 't even see what the hell you were doing half the time in the game . " Matt Paddock of Game Vortex commented that Obi Wan 's Adventures " will be a must @-@ buy for Star Wars freaks ( and there 's more than a few ) , but flawed control and lack of depth make for a generally average experience . " 
 Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald said the game " loses out badly in the graphics department " , commenting that on the " tiny LCD screen the characters look like a garbled confusion of black pixels . It takes a healthy imagination to see the lasers bouncing off one 's <unk> . What 's worse is that it 's not always obvious where the exit passage is , which is frustrating after a slog through a tough level . " In addition , Tim <unk> of The Times said that " despite some rather good storyline screens , the graphics generally lack colour and the music is repetitive and tedious . " 
 Nix praised the game 's sound design , describing it as " far and away above what would be expected on the Game Boy Color . " He noted , for example , that " there are individual sounds of the lightsaber swinging back and forth — cutting left will sound differently than the backswing or upswing of the third stroke against an enemy . " Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi @-@ Wan 's Adventures for its interesting gameplay and the use of the lightsaber . She commented : " There are quite a few things to like about this game . For one thing , you can 't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber . Also , the levels are interesting . [ ... ] In [ one level ] , Obi @-@ Wan is actually in a boat , going through the Naboo swamp , while battle droids shoot at him from the banks . While you 're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner , there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing . " 
 = Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) = 
 The Battle of Bloody Creek was fought on 10 / 21 June 1711 during Queen Anne 's War . An Abenaki militia successfully ambushed British and New England soldiers at a place that became known as Bloody Creek after the battles fought there . The creek empties into the Annapolis River at present day Carleton Corner , Nova Scotia , and was also the location of a battle in 1757 . 
 The battle was part of an orchestrated attempt by the leaders of New France to weaken the British hold on Annapolis Royal . The British had only captured the fort the previous year and they only had a very tenuous control of the area . The battle , in which the entire British force was captured or killed , emboldened the French and their native allies to blockade Annapolis Royal . Without heavy weapons , the force was unable to effectively attack the fort , and abandoned the siege when British reinforcements arrived by sea . 
 = = Background = = 
 Port Royal , the capital of the French colony of Acadia , was settled in 1604 , one year after Acadia 's founding , and served as the colonial capital for much of the next hundred years . It consequently became a focal point for conflict between the English colonists of New England and the Acadian inhabitants . It was destroyed in 1613 by English raiders led by Samuel Argall , but eventually rebuilt . In 1690 it was captured by forces from the Province of Massachusetts Bay , although it was restored to France on 20 September 1697 by the Treaty of Ryswick . 
 In the 1710 Siege of Port Royal an expedition of New England militia and British marines under Francis Nicholson again captured Port Royal . The town was renamed Annapolis Royal , with Samuel Vetch as the British Governor of Nova Scotia , and the fort was renamed Fort Anne . This expedition left a garrison numbering about 450 men , that was composed of a combination of British marines and New England provincial militia . The garrison was reinforced with regular troops in the following months , however the British only had effective control of the fort and the nearby town . The terms of capitulation had included a provision in which the French residents within 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of the fort were to be protected , provided they took an appropriate oath to the British crown . A total of 481 Acadians were covered by this provision , but by mid @-@ January 1711 only 57 had actually taken an oath . 
 When word of Port Royal 's fall reached France , the marine minister Pontchartrain ordered Antoine Gaulin , the French Catholic missionary priest to the loosely allied Indian tribes of present @-@ day Maine and New Brunswick , to harass the British at Annapolis Royal so that they could not establish a firm foothold in the territory . Bernard @-@ Anselme d 'Abbadie de Saint @-@ Castin , the métis Acadian ( French father and a Penobscot mother ) , was given military command of Acadia , and received similar orders . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The first winter was a particularly difficult one for the British garrison , which was reduced by early 1711 to about 240 " effective men Officers included " due to death , disease , and desertion . They had ongoing difficulty getting provisions and materials needed to repair the fort because of the reluctance of the Acadians to help . This reluctance was fueled in part by the activities of Saint @-@ Castin and Gaulin — the Acadians in Annapolis Royal refused to do the necessary logging , citing the danger of Indian attacks . To counter this , the British began sending out armed parties to protect the loggers . These logging parties were sent into the woodlands up the Annapolis River , and the cut wood was floated down the river . In May 1711 Governor Vetch received reports that these work crews and others who supported the British were being harassed by Mi 'kmaq and Abenakis opposed to British rule . In his reports he noted that the fort was " every day more and more Infested with skulking Indians " , and that villagers within the <unk> ( the three @-@ mile protection area ) were being harassed . Desperate for timbers to repair the fort , Vetch organized a force of 70 New England militia under Captain David Pigeon to accompany the fort 's engineer on an expedition up the river . Pigeon 's instructions were to assure the loggers that they would be paid and protected if they brought the timber down to the fort , but that there would be " severity " if they did not . 
 Not long before Pigeon 's party set out , an Indian force organized by Gaulin and Saint @-@ Castin arrived in the area north of Annapolis Royal , with instructions to harass and ambush the British when the opportunity presented itself . The exact size and composition of this force is not known with precision . Vetch reported it to be 150 , but other sources reported it to be as low as 50 men . Many historians report that the force was composed of Abenakis , although Geoffrey Plank and others claim that the force also included some Mi 'kmaq . British Lieutenant Paul Mascarene for a time thought that some local Acadians might have been involved , but thought this unlikely after learning of its recent arrival ( literally the day before , according to one account ) in the area . The identity and ethnicity of its leader is also uncertain ; Governor Vaudreuil reported that it was led by someone named l <unk> . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The New Englanders departed Annapolis Royal on 10 / 21 June in a whaleboat and two flatboats , heading up the Annapolis River . Because they were delayed by the tide , word of the force 's departure preceded them , giving the Indians time to set up an ambush near the mouth of what later became known as Bloody Creek . The whaleboat was faster on the water , and was about a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) ahead of the flatboats when it reached the ambush site . The surprise was complete : all but one of the whaleboat 's men were killed . Hearing the gunfire , the flatboats hurried to catch up , and carelessly made directly for the whaleboat . This exposed them to fire from Indians on the shore , and they suffered further significant casualties before they were surrounded and the survivors surrendered . Sixteen were killed , nine wounded , and the rest were captured . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The victory at Bloody Creek rallied the local resistance , and prompted many of the Acadians who were nominally under British protection to withdraw to the north . Soon thereafter a force of some 600 warriors , including Acadians , Abenaki , and Mi 'kmaq , gathered and blockaded Fort Anne under the leadership of Gaulin and Saint @-@ Castin . The defending garrison was small , but the attackers had no artillery and were thus unable to make an impression on the fort , and the fort was still accessible by sea . Gaulin went to Plaisance in Newfoundland for supplies and equipment to advance the siege ; Governor Philippe Pastour de Costebelle provided supplies , but the ship had the misfortune to encounter a major British fleet and was captured . That same expedition abandoned its goal of attacking Quebec when eight of its ships were lost on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River ; Governor Vetch , who had accompanied the expedition as a leader of the provincial militia , returned to Annapolis Royal with 200 provincial militia , after which the besiegers withdrew . 
 Annapolis Royal remained in British hands for the remainder of the war , but Acadians and Indians continued to resist the British after peace was reached and Acadia was formally ceded to Britain with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . This resistance was motivated by a French desire to recover Acadia and by the concerns of the Abenaki and Mi 'kmaq , who had not been parties to Utrecht , to British encroachment on their lands and liberties after the war ended . The Indian disputes led to Dummer 's War in the 1720s ; it was fought primarily in northern New England , but British settlements in Nova Scotia were also attacked . The disputes between the French and British over Acadia / Nova Scotia were not resolved until the British conquests of the Seven Years ' War and the expulsion of the Acadians in the 1750s . The site was again the scene of battle during the Seven Years ' War , and has been designated by the Canadian government as a National Historic Site of Canada . 
 = Satyajit Ray = 
 Satyajit Ray ( listen ; 2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992 ) was an Indian Bengali filmmaker , widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century . Ray was born in the city of Calcutta into a Bengali family prominent in the world of arts and literature . Starting his career as a commercial artist , Ray was drawn into independent filmmaking after meeting French filmmaker Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica 's Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves ( 1948 ) during a visit to London . 
 Ray directed 36 films , including feature films , documentaries and shorts . He was also a fiction writer , publisher , illustrator , calligrapher , music composer , graphic designer and film critic . He authored several short stories and novels , primarily aimed at children and adolescents . Feluda , the sleuth , and Professor Shonku , the scientist in his science fiction stories , are popular fictional characters created by him . He was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University . 
 Ray 's first film , Pather Panchali ( 1955 ) , won eleven international prizes , including the inaugural Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival . This film , along with Aparajito ( 1956 ) , and Apur Sansar ( The World of Apu ) ( 1959 ) form The Apu Trilogy . Ray did the scripting , casting , scoring , and editing , and designed his own credit titles and publicity material . Ray received many major awards in his career , including 32 Indian National Film Awards , a number of awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies , and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 . The Government of India honored him with the Bharat Ratna in 1992 .

 = = = Early life and background = = = 
 Satyajit Ray 's ancestry can be traced back for at least ten generations . Ray 's grandfather , <unk> Ray Chowdhury was a writer , illustrator , philosopher , publisher , amateur astronomer and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj , a religious and social movement in nineteenth century Bengal . He also set up a printing press by the name of U. Ray and Sons , which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit 's life . Sukumar Ray , <unk> 's son and father of Satyajit , was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme ( <unk> <unk> ) and children 's literature , an illustrator and a critic . Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta . 
 Sukumar Ray died when Satyajit was barely three , and the family survived on Suprabha Ray 's meager income . Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School , Calcutta , and completed his BA in economics at Presidency College , Calcutta then affiliated with the University of Calcutta , though his interest was always in fine arts . In 1940 , his mother insisted that he study at the Visva @-@ Bharati University at Santiniketan , founded by Rabindranath Tagore . Ray was reluctant due to his love of Calcutta , and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan His mother 's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to try . In Santiniketan , Ray came to appreciate Oriental art . He later admitted that he learned much from the famous painters Nandalal Bose and <unk> Behari Mukherjee . Later he produced a documentary film , The Inner Eye , about Mukherjee . His visits to Ajanta , Ellora and Elephanta stimulated his admiration for Indian art . 
 In 1943 , Ray started work at D.J. Keymer , a British @-@ run advertising agency , as a " junior <unk> , " earning eighty rupees a month . Although he liked visual design ( graphic design ) and he was mostly treated well , there was tension between the British and Indian employees of the firm . The British were better paid , and Ray felt that " the clients were generally stupid . " Later , Ray also worked for Signet Press , a new publishing house started by D. K. Gupta . Gupta asked Ray to create cover designs for books to be published by Signet Press and gave him complete artistic freedom . Ray designed covers for many books , including <unk> Das 's <unk> Sen , and <unk> Bangla , Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay 's Chander Pahar , Jim Corbett 's <unk> of Kumaon , and Jawaharlal Nehru 's Discovery of India . He worked on a children 's version of Pather Panchali , a classic Bengali novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay , renamed as Aam <unk> <unk> ( The mango @-@ seed whistle ) . Designing the cover and illustrating the book , Ray was deeply influenced by the work . He used it as the subject of his first film , and featured his illustrations as shots in his ground @-@ breaking film . 
 Along with Chidananda Dasgupta and others , Ray founded the Calcutta Film Society in 1947 . They screened many foreign films , many of which Ray watched and seriously studied . He befriended the American GIs stationed in Calcutta during World War II , who kept him informed about the latest American films showing in the city . He came to know a RAF employee , Norman Clare , who shared Ray 's passion for films , chess and western classical music . 
 In 1949 , Ray married <unk> Das , his first cousin and long @-@ time sweetheart . The couple had a son , Sandip , who is now a film director . In the same year , French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River . Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside . Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali , which had long been on his mind , and Renoir encouraged him in the project . In 1950 , D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office . During his three months in London , Ray watched 99 films . Among these was the neorealist film <unk> di <unk> ( Bicycle Thieves ) ( 1948 ) by Vittorio De Sica , which had a profound impact on him . Ray later said that he came out of the theatre determined to become a film @-@ maker . 
 = = = The Apu years ( 1950 – 59 ) = = = 
 Ray decided to use Pather Panchali ( 1928 ) , the classic Bildungsroman of Bengali literature , as the basis for his first film . The semi @-@ autobiographical novel describes the maturation of Apu , a small boy in a Bengal village . 
 Ray gathered an inexperienced crew , although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta went on to achieve great acclaim . The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors . He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot , but did not succeed on his terms . As a result , Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years , an unusually long period , based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds . He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production . He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending , but he did receive funding that allowed him to complete the film . Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston , who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King . The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside , the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget . Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art ( <unk> ) that a major talent was on the horizon . 
 With a loan from the West Bengal government , Ray finally completed the film . It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success . It earned numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad . In India , the reaction to the film was enthusiastic ; The Times of India wrote that " It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [ ... ] Pather Panchali is pure cinema . " In the United Kingdom , Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film . But , the reaction was not uniformly positive . After watching the movie , François Truffaut is reported to have said , " I don 't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands . " Bosley Crowther , then the most influential critic of The New York Times , wrote a scathing review of the film . Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther 's review would dissuade audiences , but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in the United States . 
 Ray 's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film , Aparajito ( The Unvanquished ) . This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of a young man , Apu , and the mother who loves him . Critics such as Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray 's first film . Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival , bringing Ray considerable acclaim . Before completing The Apu Trilogy , Ray directed and released two other films : the comic <unk> <unk> ( The Philosopher 's Stone ) , and <unk> ( The Music Room ) , a film about the decadence of the Zamindars , considered one of his most important works . 
 While making Aparajito , Ray had not planned a trilogy , but after he was asked about the idea in Venice , it appealed to him . He finished the last of the trilogy , Apur Sansar ( The World of Apu ) in 1959 . Critics Robin Wood and Aparna Sen found this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy . Ray introduced two of his favourite actors , <unk> Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore , in this film . It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in near @-@ poverty . He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna . The scenes of their life together form " one of the cinema 's classic affirmative depictions of married life . " They suffer tragedy . After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic , Ray wrote an article defending it . He rarely responded to critics during his filmmaking career , but also later defended his film Charulata , his personal favourite . 
 Ray wrote his memoirs during his filming of the Apu Trilogy which has been published as My Years with Apu : A Memoir . 
 Ray 's film successes had little influence on his personal life in the years to come . He continued to live with his wife and children in a rented house , with his mother , uncle and other members of his extended family . 
 = = = From Devi to Charulata ( 1959 – 64 ) = = = 
 During this period , Ray composed films on the British Raj period ( such as Devi ) , a documentary on Tagore , a comic film ( Mahapurush ) and his first film from an original screenplay ( Kanchenjungha ) . He also made a series of films that , taken together , are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayals of Indian women on screen . 
 Ray followed Apur Sansar with Devi ( The Goddess ) , a film in which he examined the superstitions in Hindu society . Sharmila Tagore starred as <unk> , a young wife who is deified by her father @-@ in @-@ law . Ray was worried that the censor board might block his film , or at least make him re @-@ cut it , but Devi was spared . In 1961 , on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru , Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore , on the occasion of the poet 's birth centennial , a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray . Due to limited footage of Tagore , Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material . He said that it took as much work as three feature films .
