 The station is equipped with a shed , but no other amenities , and also lacks a ticket machine . The platform ( but not necessarily the train ) is wheelchair accessible . There are about ten parking spaces at the station . A shuttle bus corresponds to all trains during the opening hours of the airport , and a bus trip takes four minutes to the airport terminal . The shuttle bus leaves the airport ten minutes before each train 's scheduled departure . The bus is operated by NSB , and is included in the price of the train ticket . There are 42 bus departures each day . The train supplements a coach service , Torp Expressen operated by <unk> , to Oslo , and a local bus service to Sandefjord , operated by <unk> <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 The station was originally named Raastad , and opened as part of the Vestfold Line on 7 December 1881 . It was located in the former municipality of Sandar , that was also served by <unk> Station . Raastad was equipped with a wooden station building designed by Balthazar Lange , and cargo expedition . There was initially only one track , but on 1 July 1910 , a passing loop was installed at the station , allowing trains to pass . The station was renamed Råstad in April 1921 . In 1969 – 70 the passing loop was extended , but already on 15 September 1971 it was disabled , and subsequently removed , with the automation of the signaling . The station became unmanned on 1 October 1971 and was closed on 28 May 1978 . The following day , the new InterCity Express services started on the Vestfold Line . 
 Sandefjord Airport experienced a rapid growth as an airport for low @-@ cost carriers serving Eastern Norway since the late 1990s . Along with the success of the Airport Express Train that connects Oslo with Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , and the decision to provide a shuttle service to the competing Moss Airport , Rygge from Rygge Station , local politicians took initiative to open a dedicated stop for the airport . During the planning of high @-@ speed upgrade of the line , plans called to move the line to create a station integrated in the airport terminal , as had been done with Oslo Airport Station and Trondheim Airport Station . However , as the construction of a new Vestfold Line was put on hold , an intermediate solution was found to reopen Råstad Station , and offer a shuttle bus to the airport . On 16 May 2007 , Vestfold County Municipality announced that they would forward the investment costs of NOK 7 million for the new station , with a payback from the National Rail Administration by 2012 . The latter would build , own and operate the station . The station opened on 21 January 2008 , and the new platform is located on the east side of the tracks . The old station building , location in the west side , has been converted into a museum . During the first year , 80 @,@ 000 passengers used the station , sufficient to make the NOK 4 @.@ 5 million used by NSB on the shuttle bus profitable . 
 = 2003 Afro @-@ Asian Games = 
 The 2003 Afro @-@ Asian Games , officially known as the First Afro @-@ Asian Games or I Afro @-@ Asian Games and unofficially known as the Inaugural Afro @-@ Asian Games , was a major international multi @-@ sport event held in Hyderabad , India , from October 24 ( excluding football and hockey , which began on October 22 and October 23 respectively ) to November 1 , 2003 . 
 The Afro @-@ Asian Games was the largest sporting event ever to be held in Hyderabad , and one of the largest in India , second only to the 2010 Commonwealth Games by athletes ' volume . The scale of these Games exceeds even the two Asian Games held in Delhi in 1951 ( both by athletes ' volume and by number of participating nations ) and 1982 ( by number of participating nations ) . More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games . A total of 131 sporting events in eight disciplines were conducted . Also , 120 countries sent 1 @,@ 565 official representatives to these Games . 
 The First Afro @-@ Asian Games were held after nearly two decades of delays , shifts and cancellations . The prolonged amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them . After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games , the venue was shuttled between New Delhi and Kuwait City . At the last moment , New Delhi was <unk> by Hyderabad , which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002 . 
 These Games , however , had lesser scope than the Asian Games or Commonwealth Games , since 96 nations participated in only eight disciplines . The Games witnessed only one new world record . Thirty @-@ seven countries - an unprecedented 39 % of the participating nations - won at least one medal in these Games . 
 = = History = = 
 The idea to hold an inter @-@ continental sporting event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983 , with New Delhi as the proposed venue . However , for unknown circumstances , the venue was shifted to Kuwait and the Games were proposed to be held in 1985 . Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games . In 1989 , the proposal was reconsidered , with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games . The Games were then scheduled for 1991 . The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members , and so could not come into force . 
 In 1999 , a proposal for the renewal of the Games was accepted . Subsequently , Pune and then New Delhi were proposed as venues . However , they were postponed till November 2001 . Slow preparations led to indefinite postponement again . After the occurrence of 9 / 11 , Delhi pulled out . This led to the circulation of rumours that the games were " jinxed " . Later , the IOA announced that the Olympic Council of Asia ( OCA ) and the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa ( ANOCA ) had sanctioned 2003 as the new date for the Games . Also , the venue was changed to Hyderabad after Delhi pulled out . Most critics point to the successful hosting of the 32nd National Games of India , which were held at Hyderabad , as the main reason for Hyderabad being chosen . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 The Indian Government spent ₹ 1 @.@ 03 billion ( US $ 22 @.@ 92 million ) , for the Afro @-@ Asian Games , making these Games one of the most expensive sporting events held in Hyderabad . All preparations were completed within 60 days before the events began . 
 = = = General Preparation = = = 
 The Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) decided to set up a central head of the development for the Games . Thus , the Afro @-@ Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the Greenlands Guest House to organize , monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games . 17 functional organizing sub @-@ committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure . The various functions were divided within these committees . The special officer @-@ in @-@ charge of the Games was Sabyasachi Ghosh , while the Secretary @-@ General of the Games was Ali <unk> . 
 A large development Planning Association meant a great amount of inter @-@ connectivity and communication requirements . A 24 @-@ hour call centre with interpreters was set up , using a Closed User Group ( CUG ) circuit . 
 A large " web " of networking facilities was built to connect all the hotels , media centres , stadia and Transportation Committees . This would help in easing pressure on any one committee . Since the African continent is not very well @-@ connected , an Accreditation Committee was dispatched to Abuja - in Nigeria - the host city of the 2003 All @-@ Africa Games . The Accreditation committee brought all sports @-@ persons and officials from Africa to Hyderabad . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 The software company CMC Limited had developed a Games and Event Management System ( GEMS ) , which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues . It worked closely with Doordarshan , the official television broadcasters of the Games , to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information . Additionally , cutting @-@ edge technology like the implementation of geo @-@ referenced maps and Geographic Information System ( GIS ) was implemented , so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 In the month of September , less than a month away from the Afro @-@ Asian Games , the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad released a large number of luxury vehicles , to be used in the Games . It was the second time in the span of one year that the Transport Ministry had done so - the first time being for the 32nd National Games of India . In an effort to spruce up the city in time for the Games , the organizers arranged several buses , vans and cars to ferry the athletes and the guests . 
 = = = Accommodation = = = 
 Accommodation of the athletes and foreign officials posed a serious problem to the organisers . Contrary to what the Olympics and related multi @-@ sport events provide , no actual Games Village was available for the athletes to stay . The Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh ( <unk> ) had initially wanted to have a separate Games Village for the Games , but could not arrange for it . Even though Hyderabad had hosted the 32nd National Games of India in 2002 , for which a Games Village had been built , the organizers could not utilise it due to severe financial problems . It was estimated that about ₹ 800 million ( US $ 16 million ) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village . The Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh ( <unk> ) instead opted to obtain bulk bookings from all the major hotels in the city so as to provide accommodation for the athletes , foreign dignitaries and the media . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 About 1400 police personnel were drawn from various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security . In addition to this , over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places , including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city . Strict anti @-@ sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels . Also , a 24 @-@ hour access control system was placed , with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area . 
 To facilitate foreign athletes and officials , four immigration counters were set up at the airport . A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official . To improve security speed , six interpreters of Russian , Japanese , Mandarin Chinese , Korean , French and Arabic were present at the airport . In addition , 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the clock in the airport . 
 = = Pressure on Organizing Committee = = 
 There was a lot of pressure upon the Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games , as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro @-@ Asian Games , in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games at Delhi , India . Also , officials from Beijing , China - the venue of 2008 Summer Olympics - and Doha , Qatar - the host of 2006 Asian Games - would attend the Afro @-@ Asian Games , and keenly observe the way the Games functioned . 
 However , hosting of the Games was not the only major issue for the Committee . The Afro @-@ Asian Games would see the participation of various nations which are not in good terms with some other nations . The then Prime Minister of India , Atal Behari Vajpayee , had hinted that " some nations might withdraw from the Games , rather than get embroiled in international conflicts " .

 Logo 
 The logo of the Afro @-@ Asian Games was the Charminar - Hyderabad 's most famous landmark - surrounded by a string of pearls . Hyderabad is also famous for its pearls . The official logo of the Games was unveiled , along with the official website , by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on September 3 , 2003 . 
 Mascot 
 The Mascot for these Games was Sheroo , also spelt <unk> , a cartoon lion . Subsequently , a variation of the name ' Sheroo ' , called ' <unk> ' , would be given for the mascot of the 2010 Commonwealth Games . 
 Sponsorships 
 Several Indian corporates such as Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ) , <unk> Group and State Bank of Hyderabad provided sponsorships worth INR 10 million each towards the staging of several events of the inaugural Games . Several other corporates such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation ( ONGC ) , Videocon and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited ( <unk> ) also contributed to the Games . Also , Florida @-@ based IMG Academy assisted in the conduct of the Games .

 The Opening ceremony of the Games were held in the GMC <unk> Stadium - the main stadium of the events - at 5 : 30 pm IST . The organisers considered it as " a benchmark of the Games " . The Opening ceremony of the Games showcased the cultural heritage of both the attending continents - Asia and Africa . 30 @,@ 000 people came to watch the beginning of the gala sporting event . The ceremony , which was hosted by Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra , was spread over a time period of two hours and forty minutes . Many celebrities , like actor Sanjay Dutt and tennis player Leander Paes graced the occasion . Also , six @-@ time pole vault winner Sergey Bubka , along with his wife , attended the ceremony . 
 Around 12 @,@ 000 schoolchildren and college students came up with a show depicting the vast and vibrant culture of the two continents . 
 Chief Guest L K Advani declared the Games open . Shooter Anjali Bhagwat took the Athlete 's Oath . This was followed by a laser show , fireworks and a space cannon show . The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the <unk> - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa . There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the Chinese monks , and the peace prayers by thousands of schoolchildren . Singer Shankar Mahadevan sang the theme song . Bollywood divas Shilpa Shetty , Simran and Urmila <unk> did dance performances . 
 Unlike the Olympic Games , there was no individual march past for the countries . The countries came in batches of two - Asian countries in one batch and African countries in another .

 The closing ceremony of the Games was marked by lights , colour and technology . 
 The closing ceremony was hosted by <unk> <unk> . President APJ Abdul Kalam officially closed the Games , in front of a near capacity crowd . His closing words were : " I congratulate all the athletes and officials who were part of the Games . When I see thousands of sportspersons I am sure the combined power of youth through sport will be the most powerful resource on earth . " As he did so , the Stadium was lit up in a pyrotechnics display , and fireworks burst in the sky . A " daredevil " act was done by a few service personnel , who came riding on motorcycles . A fly @-@ past of the Indian Army airplanes , trailing smoke in the colours of the Indian flag took place as the dignitaries took their seats . 
 The expected " high @-@ point " of the closing ceremony was the show of camaraderie between the sportspersons of the two continents . However , few athletes <unk> into the Stadium for that purpose . The " camaraderie ceremony " was followed by speeches of various important people , among them being IOA President Suresh <unk> , IOA and OCA Secretary @-@ General Raja Randhir Singh , ANOCA President Alfa Ibrahim <unk> , Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Vikram Verma .

 The success of the Games was a point in favor of India being able to host a major international sporting event . Subsequently , this success was used in the bidding of the 2010 Commonwealth Games , which was ultimately awarded to Delhi . 
 In addition , the hospitality sector received a major boost due to the games , as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media @-@ persons , delegates , officials , visitors , sports @-@ persons , etc . Tourism also benefited from the Games , and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city . Many famous places such as the Charminar and the <unk> Palace saw record number of visitors . 
 Also , famous local markets witnessed exceptional growth in sales and business , as demand peaked during the Games . Business of the world @-@ renowned pearls of Hyderabad increased by about 50 % , generating revenue of ₹ 50 million in one week . The rise in buyers was mainly driven by African visitors , who prefer pearls as jewellery . Also , sale of gold jewellery increased substantially , being driven by a large number of Muslim visitors who looked for traditional and intricate designs . In addition , bangles became the center of attraction for Chinese and African athletes . 
 = Hugh Bradner = 
 Hugh Bradner ( November 5 , 1915 – May 5 , 2008 ) was an American physicist at the University of California who is credited with inventing the neoprene wetsuit , which helped to revolutionize scuba diving . 
 A graduate of Ohio 's Miami University , he received his doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , California , in 1941 . He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II , where he researched naval mines . In 1943 , he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory . There , he worked with scientists including Luis Alvarez , John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky on the development of the high explosives and exploding @-@ bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs . 
 After the war , Bradner took a position studying high @-@ energy physics at the University of California , Berkeley , under Luis Alvarez . Bradner investigated the problems encountered by frogmen staying in cold water for long periods of time . He developed a neoprene suit which could trap the water between the body and the neoprene , and thereby keep them warm . He became known as the " father of the wetsuit . " 
 Bradner worked on the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear test series on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands . He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a geophysicist in 1961 . He remained there for the rest of his career , becoming a full professor in 1963 , and retiring in 1980 . In retirement , continued to work both on oceanographic research , as well as on the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project .

 Hugh Bradner was born in Tonopah , Nevada , on November 5 , 1915 , but he was raised in Findlay , Ohio . His father , Donald <unk> Bradner , was briefly director of the Chemical Warfare Service at Maryland 's Edgewood Arsenal . His mother was Agnes Claire Bradner née Mead . He had an older brother , Mead Bradner . Bradner graduated from Ohio 's Miami University in 1936 and later received his doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , California , in 1941 , writing his thesis on " Electron @-@ optical studies of the photoelectric effect " under the supervision of William Vermillion Houston .

 After receiving his doctorate from Caltech , Bradner worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory where he researched naval mines until 1943 . He was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project in 1943 at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico , which helped to develop the first atomic bomb . Bradner helped to develop a wide range of technology needed for the bomb , including research on the high explosives and exploding @-@ bridgewire detonators needed to implode the atomic bomb , developed the bomb 's triggering mechanism , and even helped design the new town around the laboratory . He worked closely with some of the most scientists including Luis Alvarez , John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky . He witnessed the Trinity test , the first nuclear weapons test , at Alamogordo on July 16 , 1945 . 
 Bradner met his future wife , Marjorie Hall Bradner , who was also working as a secretary on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory . The couple were married in Los Alamos in 1943 . Security at the top secret facility was so tight that neither Bradner 's nor Hall 's parents were allowed to attend the ceremony , though Oppenheimer was among the wedding guests . The couple remained together for over 65 years until she died on April 10 , 2008 at the age of 89 . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 After the war , Bradner took a position studying high @-@ energy physics at the University of California , Berkeley under Luis Alvarez , whom he had worked with at the Manhattan Project . He remained at the University until 1961 . He worked on the 1951 atomic bombing test on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands , which was part of the Operation Greenhouse nuclear test series . 
 Bradner 's job at Berkeley required him to do a number of underwater dives . He had previously talked to United States Navy frogmen during World War II concerning the problems of staying in cold water for long periods of time , which causes the diver to lose large amounts of body heat quickly . He worked on developing a new suit that would counter this in the basement of his family 's home on Scenic Avenue in Berkeley , California , and researched the new wetsuit at a conference in Coronado , California , in December 1951 . According to the San Francisco Chronicle , the wetsuit was invented in 1952 . Bradner and other engineers founded the Engineering Development Company ( <unk> ) in order to develop it . He and his colleagues tested several versions and prototypes of the wetsuit at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California . Scripps scientist and engineer Willard Bascom advised Bradner to use neoprene for the suit material , which proved successful . He found that it " would trap the water between the body and the neoprene , and the water would heat up to body temperature and keep you warm " . 
 A 1951 letter showed that Bradner clearly understood that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin , but rather that this layer of water next to the skin , if trapped , would quickly heat to skin temperature , if the material in the suit were insulative . Thus , the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water , and it did not need to be dry to work . He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit , but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit . The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and , thus , could not exclusively profit from his invention . 
 Bradner and his company , <unk> , tried to sell his wetsuits in the consumer market . However , he failed to successfully penetrate the wetsuit market the way others have done - including Bob Meistrell and Bill Meistrell , the founders of Body Glove , and Jack O 'Neill . Various claims have been made over the years that it was the O 'Neill or the Meistrell brothers who actually invented the wetsuit instead of Bradner , but recent researchers have concluded that it was Bradner who created the original wetsuit , and not his competitors . In 2005 the Los Angeles Times concluded that Bradner was the " father of the wetsuit " , and a research paper published by Carolyn Rainey at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1998 provided corroborating evidence .

 Hugh Bradner died at the age of 92 at his home in San Diego , California , on May 5 , 2008 , from complications of pneumonia . He was survived by his daughter , Bari Cornet , three grandchildren and one great @-@ granddaughter . 
 = Tropical Storm Delia ( 1973 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Delia was the first tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the same city twice . Forming out of a tropical wave on September 1 , 1973 , Delia gradually strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved north by September 3 . After reaching this strength , the storm turned more westward and further intensified , nearly attaining hurricane status the next day . The storm peaked with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 11 inHg ) . Several hours later , Delia made landfall near Freeport , Texas ; however , the storm began to execute a counterclockwise loop , causing it to move back over the Gulf of Mexico . On September 5 , the storm made another landfall in Freeport before weakening to a depression . The remnants of Delia eventually dissipated early on September 7 over northern Mexico . 
 Due to the erratic movement of the storm along the Texas coastline , significant rainfall fell in areas near the center and in parts of Louisiana . This led to widespread flooding , especially of farmland , that left $ 6 million in damages . Five people were killed during the storm . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Delia originated from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973 . Tracking towards the west @-@ northwest , convective activity increased and the overall structure of the system improved . By August 31 , a weak area of low pressure formed over the Gulf of Honduras . This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on September 1 . Gradually intensifying , the depression became a tropical storm on September 3 as it turned towards the west . In accordance with its upgrade , it was given the name Delia . This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . A complex steering patter formed later that day , resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone . 
 As Delia neared the Texas coastline , it managed to intensify into a strong tropical storm with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and reconnaissance reported winds well in excess of hurricane @-@ force in numerous squalls associated with the storm . The lowest pressure was recorded at 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 11 inHg ) . However , Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation . Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport , Texas late on September 4 . After executing a counterclockwise loop , the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September 5 . After moving inland , the storm quickly weakened , becoming a depression on September 6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On September 3 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) issued gale warnings and hurricane watches for areas between Lake Charles , Louisiana and the mouth of the Mississippi . Later that day , they were extended westward to Palacios , Texas and eventually , warnings for areas east of Morgan City , Louisiana were canceled . Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia , gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay , Texas . By September 6 , the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm . Around this time , the National Weather Service issued flood warnings , and warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone . In Cameron , Louisiana , an estimated 6 @,@ 000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey , a storm that killed 575 in the city , still fresh . 
 Due to the erratic track of the storm along the Texas coastline , widespread heavy rains fell in areas near the storm and in Louisiana . Tides up to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , in addition to rainfall up to 13 @.@ 9 in ( 350 mm ) , caused significant flooding in the Galveston @-@ Freeport area . Up to $ 3 million was reported in damages to homes due to the flooding . In southern Louisiana , numerous areas received more than 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rain and most of the state recorded at least 3 in ( 76 mm ) . This rainfall led to widespread flooding , particularly in agricultural areas . Damages to crops amounted to $ 3 million . In addition to the flooding rains produced by Delia , eight tornadoes also touched down due to the storm , injuring four people . Five people were killed during Delia , two of which were directly related to the storm . Two of the other deaths resulted from a car crash , triggered by slick roads , with the two occupants of a pickup truck being killed . The fifth death resulted occurred while a man was boarding up his home and suffered a stress @-@ induced heart attack . The outer bands of the storm also produced significant rainfall in Arkansas and Oklahoma , peaking at 9 @.@ 72 in ( 247 mm ) and 8 @.@ 22 in ( 209 mm ) respectively .

Historians consider the " Big Four " to be one of the greatest starting pitching rotations in baseball history . During those six seasons with the " Big Four " , Garcia compiled a record of 104 wins against 57 losses . He had two 20 @-@ win seasons and led the American League ( AL ) in earned run average ( ERA ) and shutouts twice each . 
 Garcia 's best season came in 1954 when the Indians won a league record 111 games . Baseball historian Stephen Lombardi said that Garcia may have been the best AL pitcher that year . Garcia remained with the Indians until 1959 , but never duplicated the success he had achieved in 1954 . In his last five seasons with Cleveland , he finished with losing records three times . After leaving the Indians , Garcia spent a season with the Chicago White Sox and a season with the Washington Senators . 
 Garcia retired from baseball in 1961 . He developed diabetes within a few years and suffered from kidney disease and heart problems until his death . Garcia died outside of Cleveland at the age of 62 and was buried in his home state of California . He was the only member of the " Big Four " not elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame , but he has been included on a list of the 100 Greatest Indians and has been inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame . Baseball experts and former teammates have commented on Garcia 's overpowering pitching , his fine control and his low ERA .

 Garcia was born in San Gabriel , California . He grew up on a ranch in Orosi , California , where his Mexican father , Merced Garcia , moved the family when Mike was two years old . Mike 's father raised horses , and Mike aspired to race them . He participated in one race and was thrown from the horse . Garcia played four years of high school baseball , the first three years at Orosi High School and the last at Visalia High School . 
 Garcia was pitching in semipro baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler noticed him in Tulare , California . In 1942 Butler signed him as an amateur free agent to the organization 's Class D farm team , the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League . Garcia earned a 10 – 10 win – loss record with Appleton . He spent the next three years as a signalman in the United States Army during World War II . 
 Garcia was discharged from the military at the age of 22 and returned to the Cleveland organization . He played for the Class C Bakersfield Indians of the California League . With Bakersfield , Garcia 's ERA and strikeouts led the league and he earned 22 wins . In 1947 he joined the Cleveland Indians during spring training , but he was assigned to the Class A Wilkes @-@ Barre Barons of the Eastern League by Cleveland coach Bill McKechnie . He finished the season with 17 wins and a 3 @.@ 24 ERA . In 1948 , he pitched for the Double @-@ A Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League and earned 19 wins .

 Garcia debuted with the Indians on October 8 , 1948 , just before the Indians played in the 1948 World Series . He allowed three hits and no runs in two innings , and he struck out one batter . The Indians won the World Series in six games . It was the franchise 's second World Series victory , but Garcia did not make a World Series appearance . 
 Nicknamed " The Big Bear " by teammate Joe Gordon for his large frame , Garcia was listed at 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) , 200 lb ( 91 kg ) during his career . Garcia said that his actual playing weight was between 215 – 220 lb ( 97 – 100 kg ) . Garcia also acquired the nickname " Mexican Mike " in the press . However , Garcia 's minority status was not a novelty . The Indians had signed Larry Doby , the first black player in the American League , in 1947 . The 1951 team would add manager Al López and Latino players Minnie Miñoso and Jesse Flores to a squad that already included Garcia and Mexican player Bobby Ávila . Early on , Garcia was paired to room with Avila , who had just signed with the team and did not speak English . Garcia served as a translator for Avila well beyond their first season together . 
 Garcia returned to the Indians in 1949 . A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen . Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year , starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances . He finished his rookie season with a 14 – 5 record , a league @-@ leading 2 @.@ 36 ERA , 94 strikeouts and five shutouts . Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said , " From the beginning , Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher . For a big guy , he was certainly mobile . " One year removed from his rookie season , expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians ' rotation . " Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher . I see no reason he should not reach greatness this season " , Greenberg said . Garcia finished the 1950 season 11 – 11 . 
 By the 1951 season , media sources had given the nickname " Big Four " to the pitching combination of Garcia , Bob Feller , Bob Lemon and Early Wynn . Garcia had learned to control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949 . Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball , but that he became a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control . Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote , " Garcia , until the day he died , would tell me how much of the success he owed to Harder . " Garcia also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball , an illegal pitch . " Maybe a dozen in my life . I 'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did " , he said . 
 Garcia pitched a 10 @-@ hit complete game on June 4 , 1951 in an 8 – 2 Cleveland win , helping the Indians beat New York Yankees pitcher Ed Lopat for the first time in two years . Before the game , Lopat 's record was 8 – 0 on the season . Garcia improved his season mark to 5 – 3 . On August 7 against the St. Louis Browns , Garcia reached a career @-@ high 15 wins . In a 5 – 1 victory , he also recorded his second career home run . Garcia won 20 games in 1951 and finished fifth in the AL with six saves .

 In 1952 , Garcia made his first of three consecutive All @-@ Star teams . As the Indians battled for the 1952 American League pennant heading into September , he began the month with three consecutive shutouts during an eight @-@ game Indian win streak . The Indians faced Ed Lopat and the Yankees again on September 14 in what Associated Press columnist Jack Hand labeled " one BIG game . " In a 7 – 1 loss , Garcia gave up four earned runs on five hits in three innings . He finished the 1952 season with a 22 – 11 record , 143 strikeouts , an AL @-@ best six shutouts and four saves . He was second in the league in ERA ( 2 @.@ 37 ) , games ( 46 ) and innings pitched ( 292 @.@ 1 , behind Lemon ) . Only Wynn had more wins ( 23 ) among right @-@ handers ; Garcia and Lemon had 22 each , and the pair tied for the league lead with 36 starts . Garcia finished ninth in the 1952 MVP voting . 
 In 1953 , Garcia and Lemon were named pitchers on the AL All @-@ Star squad . Doby and Al Rosen were also on the team , with Rosen selected as the game 's MVP . Garcia finished the season 18 – 9 ; he pitched a career @-@ high 29 complete games with 134 strikeouts and a 3 @.@ 25 ERA . Like the previous season , Lemon and Garcia finished first and second in the American League in innings pitched . Garcia was labeled " one of the hardest @-@ throwing pitchers in the game " by The Cleveland Press Guide . As Feller 's dominance faded in the latter part of his career , Garcia , Lemon , and Wynn were increasingly referred to as the " Big Three " . 
 On May 16 , 1954 , Garcia pitched a one @-@ hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics in a 6 – 0 Indians win . Garcia called it the finest game of his career . He was selected for his third and final All @-@ Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added him , Lemon , and Doby to an American League roster that already featured Avila and top vote @-@ getter Al Rosen . During a late July exhibition game , Garcia learned that his father had died at the age of 65 ; Garcia 's son Michael was born the same day . He missed several games that year with a broken blood vessel in his throwing hand , but he managed 45 appearances on the season . 
 Entering the final regular season game in 1954 , Garcia had 19 wins ; he would have received a bonus if he collected 20 wins . After pitching 12 innings , he left with the score tied at 6 – 6 . The Tigers won after 13 innings , 8 – 7 . Earning a no @-@ decision , Garcia failed to reach the 20 @-@ win mark . However , Greenberg had assured Garcia he would receive a bonus whether he won 20 games or not . Garcia pitched six innings or more in six out of his seven August appearances . He earned wins in three out of his last four appearances , and pitched seven innings or more in all four appearances . The team finished 111 – 43 . The win total broke a 154 @-@ game season record , and the team had the lowest team ERA ( 2 @.@ 78 ) in the AL since the Dead @-@ ball era season of 1919 . Garcia was 19 – 8 with 129 strikeouts , again leading the AL in both ERA ( 2 @.@ 64 ) and shutouts ( 5 ) . 
 In the 1954 World Series , the heavily favored Indians were defeated by the New York Giants . Garcia started game three , but was replaced by a pinch hitter in the bottom of the third inning , already trailing 4 – 0 . Author Jonathan Knight described the progression of the game : " ... a throwing error by George Strickland , and Mike Garcia had struggled in the opening frame , allowing three baserunners , as panic began to creep into Municipal Stadium . For the first time all year , it was warranted . " The Giants won the game , 6 – 2 , and would win game four to claim the Series .

 From 1955 – 1959 , Garcia finished with losing records in three of five seasons . The 1955 season represented Garcia 's first losing record ( 11 – 13 ) and his first season ERA over 4 @.@ 00 . The 1954 ERA leader finished 1955 with a 4 @.@ 02 ERA . The Indians finished in second place in the AL at 93 – 61 , three games behind the Yankees . Garcia repeated a losing mark on the 1956 season ( 11 – 12 ) , the only time in his career he finished with consecutive losing seasons . He and Wynn were among those who tied for second place in shutouts on the season ( 4 ) behind fellow Indian Herb Score . Cleveland finished 88 – 66 and nine games behind first place , which went to the Yankees again . Lopez was replaced as manager by Kerby Farrell . In spring training before the 1957 season , Farrell observed that the league 's best pitching staff could not carry the team alone . Garcia ended the season 12 – 8 with a 3 @.@ 75 ERA , but the Indians finished sixth in the American League . Their 76 – 77 finish was the club 's first losing record since 1946 . 
 Bobby Bragan replaced Farrell as manager to begin the 1958 season . During a spring training game in March , Garcia slipped on a wet pitcher 's mound and injured his back . He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc . He finished the season with a 1 – 0 record in six appearances and eight innings of work . That same month , Bragan was fired as manager . He was replaced by former Indians player Joe Gordon , and the Indians finished 77 – 76 . 
 Garcia elected to become a free agent in the offseason , but he returned to the Indians , saying that his home and his dry cleaning business were in Cleveland . " Everything being equal , I 'll sign with the Indians if I decide I 'm able to pitch ... This is a friendly city and I like it " , he said . During a spring training game in March 1959 , Garcia was hit in the knee by a Billy <unk> line drive and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken to a Tucson hospital . He did not make his first season start until May 3 , when he allowed four hits and no earned runs in a complete game loss . He finished with a 3 – 6 record , a 4 @.@ 00 ERA and 72 innings pitched in his twelfth and final season with the Indians .

 Garcia was not selected a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame . His normal window of eligibility has closed , and he would only be elected by decision of the Hall 's Veterans Committee . Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia 's low ERA due to the " cold , cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium , which at that time had a pitcher 's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover " . Referring to Garcia 's great seasons of 1949 to 1954 , baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered , " Garcia 's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home @-@ field advantage , but it was Garcia who recorded the staff 's lowest ERA in four of those six seasons . " Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote , " It is a shame that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded . A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public . " Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote , " If Garcia had pitched long enough , he probably would be in the Hall of Fame . " 
 Teammates have recalled the difficulty that Garcia presented for opposing hitters . George Strickland , who roomed with Garcia on road trips for several seasons , described Garcia as " a big , strong , powerful pitcher " who threw a " very heavy ball . " Bob Lemon describes his pitches similarly . " Hitting a Garcia pitch was like hitting a shotput " , Lemon said . Lemon also commented on his deceptive control . " Mike was a sneak . His physical size belied really fine control " , said Lemon . 
 Garcia was named one of the 100 Greatest Indians in March 2001 and inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame on August 11 , 2007 . Each year , the Indians organization gives the Mike Garcia Award to an area high school student who demonstrates " outstanding success in the classroom , on the field , and in their community . " 
 = Aphrodite ( album ) = 
 Aphrodite is the eleventh studio album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue , released on 30 June 2010 . Beginning in early 2009 , the singer met with British singer @-@ songwriter Nerina Pallot to begin recording sessions for a new album . Although successful at first , the sessions later became unproductive ; Minogue then began working with British electronic music producer Stuart Price , who became the executive producer of the album . The two collaborated with various producers and writers on the album , including Jake Shears , Calvin Harris , Sebastian Ingrosso and Pascal Gabriel . Aphrodite follows a musical approach largely similar to Minogue 's previous albums and is primarily a dance @-@ pop and disco record . It draws influences from various dance @-@ based genres including electropop , hi @-@ NRG , club and rave music . 
 Upon its release , Aphrodite was met with generally positive reviews from music critics , many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue . However , critics were divided on its production ; many felt Price 's production helped make the album cohesive , while some felt it made the album sound too similar to Minogue 's previous work and lacked innovation . Commercially , Aphrodite was a success . In Minogue 's native country Australia , it peaked at number two on the Australian Albums chart , and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association . In the United Kingdom , the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums chart , a feat accomplished by Minogue 's debut studio album Kylie ( 1988 ) during the same week 22 years prior . Aphrodite was the fourth studio album by Minogue to peak atop the UK albums chart and made her the first solo artist to have a number one album in four different decades in the region , achieving this in the 1980s , 1990s , 2000s and 2010s . She also became a Guinness World Record @-@ holder for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the United Kingdom . The British Phonographic Industry certified Aphrodite platinum . The album also achieved strong charting internationally , reaching the top @-@ five in countries like Belgium , France , Greece , Spain and Switzerland . It became Minogue 's second highest @-@ charting album in the United States by peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart . 
 Four singles were released from Aphrodite . Its lead single " All the Lovers " was a commercial success , peaking at number three in the United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in numerous countries like France , Italy , Scotland and Spain . In Australia , it narrowly missed the top ten by peaking at number 13 on the singles chart . " Get Outta My Way " was released as the second single and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom , but underperformed in Australia after failing to peak inside the top 50 . Similarly , the third single " Better than Today " missed the top 50 in Australia , and additionally missed the top 20 in the United Kingdom . In response to their poor chart performances , Minogue expressed disappointment in her label and stated that no further singles would be released . Despite this statement , " Put Your Hands Up ( If You Feel Love ) " was released as the fourth and final single from Aphrodite and peaked at number 50 in Australia . In the United States , all four singles released from the album peaked atop the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart . To further promote the album , Minogue embarked on the successful Aphrodite : Les Folies Tour in 2011 .

 Following her recovery from breast cancer , Minogue released her tenth studio album X in 2007 . Slated to be released as Minogue 's comeback album , X went platinum in her native country Australia after it debuted at number one on the Australian Albums chart . In the United Kingdom , the album entered and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was eventually certified platinum . Critical reception towards X was generally favourable , although many critics felt that it lacked introspection from Minogue 's side due to its lack of consistency and high amount of " filler " tracks . In retrospect , critics argued that the album did not serve as a worthy comeback for Minogue . 
 Soon , Minogue began working on her eleventh studio album Aphrodite . The initial recording sessions began in April 2009 when Minogue met with British singer @-@ songwriter Nerina Pallot , with whom she readied the track " Better than Today " . Its live instrumentation , along with the fact that X had been burdened by contributions from too many producers , prompted Minogue 's record label Parlophone to decide on a more natural and less convoluted production style for Aphrodite . Later sessions with Pallot proved to be less successful , as her suggested songs were " rapidly supplemented with tracks from a wide range " of contributors . Minogue felt her sessions with Pallot did not yield any dance @-@ pop tracks ; fearing that she was " going down the same road , doing the rounds of all the pop dynamos but lacking any cohesive quality , " she approached her close friend Jake Shears , male lead singer of American pop group Scissor Sisters , for advice . Shears encouraged her to work with Stuart Price , a Grammy award @-@ winning British electronic music producer who had collaborated with Scissor Sisters on their third studio album Night Work ( 2010 ) . Miles Leonard , chairman of Parlophone , enlisted Price as the executive producer of the album . He had previously served as the executive producer of American recording artist Madonna 's tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) , and international news agency Reuters regarded him as " one of the most in @-@ demand pop producers " . In an interview with a writer for Popjustice , Price revealed that he got involved in the production of Aphrodite after he met Minogue for a writing session in October 2009 . 
 As executive producer , Price was responsible for " shaping the album 's sound " , deciding its track listing , and mixing the songs in order to ensure that they " feel like they 're part of the same album " . Popjustice commented that every song on the album has " gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn 't sound like some dickhead [ sic ] A & R has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf " . Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer ; discussing the process , she said " It was just the best experience , and funnily enough I think it 's the most cohesive album I 've had since the beginning of my career , back in the PWL days , where by its very nature made it cohesive . There 's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [ ... ] so that it existed as a real body of work " . Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a " Parton Test " , as they " knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton " . Shears also contributed to the album , while two of Pallot 's collaborations with Minogue were kept . Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris , Swedish disc jockey Sebastien Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Billed by her record label Parlophone as her comeback album , Aphrodite is a celebration of Minogue 's " dance @-@ floor roots " , and is primarily a dance @-@ pop and disco album . Its title alludes to the Greek goddess of love , beauty , pleasure , and procreation . " All the Lovers " , one of the last tracks to be recorded for the album , is a " squiggly " electropop @-@ influenced disco song written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell , who had previously collaborated with Minogue on " 2 Hearts " , the lead single from X. It is similar to Minogue 's 2004 single " I Believe in You " , but has a " more danceable edge " , and features a " gauzy , heartbeat rhythm " and 1980s @-@ stylised synthesiser riffs . The song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus . The second track " Get Outta My Way " combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements . The song focuses on a " frustrated and furious " Minogue delivering " wispy " vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner , indicating that she may leave him and start " grinding away with another chap " . Its lyrical content is suggestive in nature . The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter . " Put Your Hands Up ( If You Feel Love ) " is a hi @-@ NRG @-@ influenced club song . Receiving mixed critical reviews , its lyrics were criticised for being clichéd although one critic named it a " concert hit waiting to happen . " " Closer " takes a darker and more atmospheric approach , featuring " sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord @-@ esque synths . " Critics felt that it was one of the more interesting and experimental songs of the album . 
 Although Price said that no ballads were included in the album , critics opined that the downtempo pop song " Everything is Beautiful " was penned like one . " Aphrodite " , the title track of the album , is a nineties @-@ influenced dance @-@ pop song which features a " foot @-@ stomping " beat and " military drummed " instrumentation , similar to that of a marching band . Stuart Price likened the song to Janet Jackson for its " ' Rhythm Nation ' -esque qualities . " The song , one of Minogue 's two collaborations with Pallot that were kept on the track list , is penned like a dance anthem through which Minogue " brags " about her sexual prowess . It was met with critical acclaim by most music critics , and was declared to be one of the strongest tracks on the album . Minogue wrote the melancholic seventh track " Illusion " with Price . " Better Than Today " , the first track to be recorded for the album and the second collaboration with Pallot , is a " breezy summertime " pop song with influences of electropop and country music . It was complimented as likeable and a stand @-@ out , but criticised for its monotony . 
 Rave music acts as a significant influence on " Too Much " , a disco and synthpop track written by Minogue , Jake Shears , and Calvin Harris . Critics were divided on the track , with its energy being praised but Harris ' production being disapproved of . The dance @-@ rock song " Cupid Boy " finds inspiration from English alternative rock band New Order and features Minogue delivering " lusty " vocals over a retro bass line . Its intro , New Order @-@ influenced bass line , and rock guitar instrumentation positively surprised critics . " Looking for an Angel " , one of the first songs Minogue and Price wrote together , is composed of " celestial synth strings " and contains an extended breakdown . Price 's production of the song received mixed opinions from critic . The set closes with the electropop track " Can 't Beat the Feeling " , which is similar to the work of French electronic music duo Daft Punk . Its energetic composition and placement as the closing track was appreciated by critics .

 Four singles were released to promote Aphrodite . " All the Lovers " was released as its lead single in June 2010 . Explaining her decision to release it as the lead single , Minogue said that " as I was recording it I knew that " All The Lovers " had to be the first single ; it sums up the euphoria of the album perfectly . It gives me goose @-@ bumps , so I 'm really excited to hear what everyone thinks of it " . Commercially , " All the Lovers " performed well , particularly in Europe . It peaked at number three on the UK Singles chart , where it was later certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for shipments of 200 @,@ 000 units . The single also reached the top ten in France , Italy , where it was later certified gold , Scotland , and Spain , where it peaked atop the physical singles chart . In Australia , " All the Lovers " missed peaking inside the top ten by reaching number 13 on the singles chart . In this region , it was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) for shipments of 35 @,@ 000 units . In the United States , the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart . An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features Minogue singing the song , dressed in a white cobweb @-@ style T @-@ shirt worn over a black bra and knickers , while standing atop a mountain of lingerie @-@ clad couples caressing each other . 
 " Get Outta My Way " was released as the second single , on 27 September 2010 . While it was moderately successful in the United Kingdom , and reached number 14 on the UK Singles chart , it was a commercial disappointment in Australia and only managed to peak at number 69 on the singles chart . In the United States , the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart . The accompanying music video , directed by <unk> , features Minogue , and a number of male models , performing various dance routines wearing a gold chain mini dress , a red silk mini trench and an <unk> . 
 " Better than Today " was released as the third single from the album , on 3 December 2010 . Although critics were generally favourable towards the song as a track on the album , some dismissed its release as a single due to its overly sweet @-@ sounding composition . The single was less successful than " All the Lovers " and " Get Outta My Way " . It peaked at number 55 on the Australian singles chart , and thus became the second single release from Aphrodite to miss charting inside the top 50 . In the United Kingdom , it missed charting inside the top 20 by peaking at number 32 on the UK singles chart . In the United States , the song became the third consecutive single release from the album to peak at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart . An old school arcade game @-@ inspired music video was directed for the song by Minogue and her stylist William Baker . Following the poor chart performance of " Get Outta My Way " and " Better Than Today " , Minogue expressed disappointment in her record label Parlophone , saying : 
 " It 's confusing . I felt a little let down with my releases from Aphrodite . I was caught out like a lot of artists were , with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days . I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old @-@ fashioned . I 'm pretty computer @-@ savvy , something didn 't feel right , but no one said anything to me . You get Britney releasing " Hold It Against Me " and Gaga 's " Born This Way " available on iTunes the day you hear it first . That 's how it should be . And there 's me waiting for a mid @-@ week chart figure like it 's 1989 . " 
 Although Minogue mentioned that " Better Than Today " would be the last single to be released from Aphrodite , " Put Your Hands Up ( If You Feel Love ) " was released as the fourth and final single from the album , on 29 May 2011 . The single managed to reach the top 50 in Australia , peaking at number 50 on the singles chart . It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart , thus becoming the fourth single from Aphrodite to peak atop the chart . No official music video for the single was commissioned , although a lyric video for a remixed version of the song by Pete Hammond was released .

The tour was a commercial success , and ranked at number 21 on Pollstar 's year @-@ end " Top 25 Worldwide Tours " list , with a total gross of $ 52 @.@ 8 million and ticket sales of 527 @,@ 683 units . A live album of the concert show held at the O2 Arena in London , was released as Aphrodite Les Folies : Live in London , on 7 June 2011 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The album received generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , Aphrodite received an average score of 67 based on 21 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Ben Norman from About.com appreciated Price 's production , noting Aphrodite to be more consistent than X. Although the critic mentioned that the songs do not provide the " immediate appeal " , like those in X did , he labelled Aphrodite " another knockout hit album " from Minogue and the " Do Not Miss album of 2010 " . Tim Sendra from AllMusic commended Minogue 's choice of collaborators and producers , commenting that the album is the " work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection " . He also appreciated the album 's cohesion and commercial prospect , and named it " one of her best " . The Billboard review of the album complimented Price 's " ability to create consistent sound without sacrificing each track 's individuality " , and termed Aphrodite a " journey cohesive , fun and fitting for a goddess " . Ian Wade from BBC Music gave the album an extremely positive review and found it to be an " astonishing return to form " for Minogue . Wade commended her for returning to her roots and becoming the " Kylie of Fever and Light Years " ; he concluded the review by calling Aphrodite an " all @-@ killer , flags @-@ aloft amazing triumph " and that " not liking this ( album ) would be like not being keen on breathing " . Nick Levine from Digital Spy felt that it was her best album since Fever and admitted that while Aphrodite isn 't " deep " , it " sure ain 't dumb either " , opining that it is meant to be heard for relaxation and enjoyment . Mikael Wood praised the tracks ' danceability and concluded that " The diminutive Australian diva is still delivering disco thunder from Down Under " . Priya Elan from NME felt that Price was the " perfect choice of musical partner " and complimented him for producing Minogue 's " most unified work in ages " . Christel Loar from PopMatters found the album similar to Light Years and Fever and commended the production , opining that while " dance pop with this much gloss and unabashed glee is relegated to the realms of guilty pleasure " , Aphrodite is " that rare representation of perfect production that is just pleasure , pure and simple " . Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue 's " finest work since 1997 's underrated Impossible Princess " . Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph complimented Price for enlisting a " top notch " team of collaborators and termed Aphrodite a " mainstream pop blast " . Barry Walters from Spin commended Minogue for returning to her original style of music , saying " Finally even the suits realize that no one wants ersatz hip @-@ hop or Americanized AOR from Australia 's ultimate pop tart " . 
 However , many critics were displeased with Minogue 's lack of innovation on Aphrodite . Helen Clarke from MusicOMH gave the album an overall positive review and appreciated Minogue for " just what she does , and somehow it works " , but did mention that it " fails to quite hit the spot " . Jon Parales from The New York Times found the album too similar to the work of Madonna , especially her studio albums Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) and Ray of Light ( 1998 ) , and commented that " No one 's asking for reality in this ( Minogue 's ) pop bubble — just a little bit more innovation " . Kitty Empire from The Observer enjoyed the album and complimented Price for " lending a sleek cohesion to the whole ( album ) " , but opined that Aphrodite " lacks the depth and chutzpah of some of her rivals ' efforts " . Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani noted it to be " more stylistically coherent than the abovementioned albums " and predicted that it would " no doubt please longtime fans " , but also criticized Price 's shallow " antiseptic " production which he felt was not able to complement Minogue 's voice . 
 James Reed from The Boston Globe gave the album a negative review and criticized it for being too dated , commenting that its " release date is 2010 , but its freshness seal is clearly stamped 2000 ( circa Minogue 's Light Years ) [ sic ] " . He called the album Minogue 's " least interesting work she 's made in a decade " and a " letdown " , and concluded by saying that " simply being fabulous isn 't enough " . Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian acknowledged the album 's " sharp production " , but commented that the album is " only as good as Kylie herself " and criticized it for being uninteresting ; she concluded by saying that " Perhaps thinking outside the box – an acoustic album ? – is what 's needed next " . Margaret Wappler from the Los Angeles Times commented on the album 's dependency on " old reliable " music and concluded " Our midnight bird ( Minogue ) has been in the club for a long time , however , and it shows " . Sophia Money @-@ Coutts from The National was not impressed with Minogue for bringing " the usual stuff about being completely herself on this album and how happy that has made her " and also criticized Price for not producing anything inventive . The critic was specifically negative towards billing Aphrodite as a comeback similar to Fever , because she felt it lacked new and diverse material from Minogue 's previous efforts ; she summed up by saying that " Criticising Kylie feels like swearing at the Dalai Lama , but this is a princess that needs a slight prod " .

 = Hurricane Bonnie ( 1992 ) = 
 Hurricane Bonnie was a long @-@ lived storm in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season . It was the third tropical storm ( including the April subtropical storm ) and second hurricane of the 1992 season . Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17 . Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan , it was nearly stationary for over a week in the central Atlantic Ocean . On September 27 , it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores . Just before becoming extratropical , it affected the Azores on September 30 , although no damage was reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the system was a cold front that moved off the U.S. East Coast on September 11 . The front moved gradually off the coast and into the subtropical Atlantic Ocean before becoming stationary just east of Bermuda on September 15 . Over the next two days , the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right . On the afternoon of September 17 , the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four . 
 The depression organized steadily that evening and into the morning of September 18 . Later that day , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast . Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes , Bonnie was embedded in a larger @-@ scale cyclonic circulation at first , which minimized shear ( allowing it to develop ) and provided weak steering currents . The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well @-@ defined eye formed late that morning . The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean . The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane . In addition , Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September 19 as steering currents slowly developed . Bonnie strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale that morning as well , peaking at 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) with a 970 mbar central pressure . The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September 20 , when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly , although remaining a Category 2 hurricane . Early on September 21 , the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion . That afternoon , the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a central pressure of 965 mbar , just under Category 3 intensity . Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22 , when it began to weaken very gradually and level off . Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid @-@ latitude ridge of high pressure , which stalled the motion . 
 Bonnie remained virtually stationary until the morning of September 23 when it drifted very slowly to the west @-@ southwest in response to the ridge . It also began to gradually weaken as the low @-@ level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized . Convection also diminished , and on the afternoon of September 24 , Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters . Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September 25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south . That evening , Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression . 
 The weakening trend ended early on September 26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re @-@ established itself . Bonnie continued its change in direction , turning to the southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high @-@ shear environment . It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September 27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm , and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September 28 . During that period , Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high @-@ end tropical storm . Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley 's path towards the Azores thereafter . The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear , although it only weakened slightly on September 29 as it accelerated towards the northeast . The storm crossed over the Azores on September 30 as a strong tropical storm with 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) winds . After that , Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon , just east of the Azores . The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop , actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating . It dissipated on October 2 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 When Bonnie passed over the Azores only four days after Charley , it resulted in tropical storm @-@ force winds across much of the island chain . Lajes Air Base reported sustained winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) with gusts to 59 mph ( 94 km / h ) . In addition , one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of São Miguel . No damage was reported in the Azores . 
 = Mary Martha Sherwood = 
 Mary Martha Sherwood ( née Butt ; 6 May 1775 – 22 September 1851 ) was a prolific and influential writer of children 's literature in 19th @-@ century Britain . She composed over 400 books , tracts , magazine articles , and chapbooks . Among her best known works are The History of Little Henry and his Bearer ( 1814 ) , The History of Henry Milner ( 1822 – 37 ) , and The History of the Fairchild Family ( 1818 – 47 ) . While Sherwood is known primarily for the strong evangelicalism that coloured her early writings , her later works are characterized by common Victorian themes , such as domesticity . 
 Sherwood 's childhood was uneventful , although she recalled it as the happiest part of her life . After she married Captain Henry Sherwood and moved to India , she converted to evangelical Christianity and began to write for children . Although her books were initially intended only for the children of the military encampments in India , the British public also received them enthusiastically . The Sherwoods returned to England after a decade in India and , building upon her popularity , Sherwood opened a boarding school and published scores of texts for children and the poor . 
 Many of Sherwood 's books were bestsellers and she has been described as " one of the most significant authors of children 's literature of the nineteenth century " . Her depictions of domesticity and Britain 's relationship with India may have played a part in shaping the opinions of many young British readers . However , her works fell from favor as a different style of children 's literature came into fashion during the late nineteenth century , one exemplified by Lewis Carroll 's playful and nonsensical Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sherwood was born on 6 May 1775 , in Stanford @-@ on @-@ Teme , Worcestershire , as the eldest daughter and second child of Martha Butt and Reverend George Butt , the chaplain in ordinary to George III . In her autobiography , Sherwood describes herself as an imaginative and playful child . She composed stories in her head before she could write and begged her mother to copy them down . Sherwood remembered her childhood as a delightful time filled with exciting " adventures " undertaken with her brother . She even makes the best of the " stocks " that she was forced to stand in while she did her lessons : 
 It was the fashion then for children to wear iron collars round the neck , with back @-@ boards strapped over the shoulders . To one of these I was subjected from my sixth to my thirteenth year . I generally did all my lessons standing in stocks , with this same collar round my neck ; it was put on in the morning , and seldom taken off till late in the evening . . . And yet I was a very happy child , and when relieved from my collars I not <unk> manifested my delight by starting from our hall @-@ door and taking a run for half a mile through the woods . 
 Sherwood and her sister , Lucy Lyttelton 's education was wide @-@ ranging for girls during the late eighteenth century : Sherwood learned Latin and Greek and was permitted to read freely in her father 's library . 
 Sherwood states in her autobiography that she was tall and ungainly for her age and that she hid in the woods with her doll to escape visitors . But she seems to have enjoyed attending Madame St. Quentin 's School for Girls at Reading Abbey , which was run by French émigrés and was the same school Jane Austen had attended . Sherwood seems to have had a generally happy childhood , marred only by the intrusion of the French Revolution and the upheavals it caused throughout Europe . 
 Sherwood spent some of her teenage years in Lichfield , where she enjoyed the company of the eminent naturalist Erasmus Darwin , the educational reformer Richard Lovell Edgeworth , his daughter Maria Edgeworth — who later became a famous writer in her own right — and the celebrated poet Anna Seward . Although she was intellectually stimulated by this group of gifted writers , she was distressed by their lack of faith and later described Richard Edgeworth as an " infidel . " She also criticized Seward 's persona of the female author , writing in her autobiography that she would never model herself after a woman who wore a wig and accumulated male flatterers . Despite what she viewed as the pitfalls of fame , she was determined to become a writer and when she was seventeen her father , who encouraged her writing , helped her publish her first story , Traditions ( 1795 ) . 
 When Sherwood 's father died in 1795 , her family retired from its active social life , since her mother preferred seclusion , and moved to Bridgnorth , Shropshire . At Bridgnorth Sherwood began writing sentimental novels ; in 1802 she sold Margarita for £ 40 to Mr. Hazard of Bath , and The History of Susan Grey , a Pamela @-@ like novel , for £ 10 . During this time she also taught at a local Sunday school . 
 = = Marriage and India = = 
 On 30 June 1803 , Sherwood became an army wife by marrying her cousin , Captain Henry Sherwood ( 1776 – 1849 ) ( cousin marriage was a common practice before the twentieth century ) . For several years , she accompanied her husband and his regiment , the 53rd Foot , on numerous postings throughout Britain . In 1804 , Capt. Sherwood was promoted to paymaster , which slightly improved the couple 's finances . In 1805 the regiment was ordered to India and the Sherwoods were forced to leave their first child , Mary Henrietta , with Sherwood 's mother and sister in England . 
 Sherwood 's four @-@ month sea voyage to India was difficult ; she was again pregnant and the regiment 's ship was attacked by French warships . The Sherwoods stayed in India for eleven years , moving with the army and an ever @-@ increasing family from Calcutta ( Kolkata ) to <unk> ( <unk> ) to <unk> ( Baharampur ) to Cawnpore ( Kanpur ) to Meerut ( Meerut ) . They had six children in India : Henry ( 1805 – 1807 ) , Lucy Martha ( 1807 – 1808 ) , Lucy Elizabeth ( 1809 – 1835 ) , Emily ( 1811 – 1833 ) , Henry Martyn ( 1813 – ? ) , and Sophia ( 1815 – ? ) . The deaths of the infants Henry and Lucy Martha and later of young Emily and Lucy Elizabeth affected Sherwood deeply ; she frequently named the heroes and heroines of her books ( many of whom die ) after her late children . 
 Following the agonizing death of her second child , Henry , of whooping cough , Sherwood began to consider converting to evangelical Christianity . The famous missionary Henry Martyn ( for whom she named her sixth child ) finally convinced her ; but it was the chaplain to the company , Mr. Parson , who first made her aware of her " human depravity " and her need for redemption . After her conversion , she was anxious to pursue evangelical missionary work in India , but she first had to persuade the East India Company that its policy of religious neutrality was ill @-@ conceived . Because there was social and political support for missionary programs in Britain , the Company eventually approved her endeavors . Sherwood established schools for both the children of army officers and the local Indian children attached to the camp . The children were often taught in her home , as no buildings were available . The first school began with 13 children and grew to over 40 , with pupils ranging from the very young to adolescents ; uneducated soldiers also attended at times . Sherwood discovered that traditional British teaching materials did not appeal to children raised in India , and therefore wrote her own <unk> and army @-@ themed stories , such as The History of Little Henry and his Bearer ( 1814 ) and The Memoirs of Sergeant Dale , his Daughter and the Orphan Mary ( 1815 ) . 
 Sherwood also adopted neglected or orphaned children from the camp . In 1807 she adopted Annie Child , a three @-@ year @-@ old who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two @-@ year @-@ old Sally Pownal . She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage . In 1816 , on the advice of doctors , she and her family returned to Britain ; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she nor any of her children could survive in a tropical climate . 
 = = Return to Britain and death = = 
 When the Sherwoods returned to Britain , they were financially strapped . Captain Sherwood , having been put on half @-@ pay , opened a school in <unk> , Worcestershire . Relying on her fame as an author and her teaching experience in India , Sherwood also decided to establish a boarding school for girls in Wick ; it remained in operation for eight years . She taught English , French , astronomy , history , geography , grammar , writing and arithmetic . At the same time , she wrote hundreds of tracts , novels and other works for children and the poor , increasing her popularity in both the United States and Britain . The History of Henry Milner ( 1822 ) was one of Sherwood 's most successful books ; children sent her fan mail , begging her to write a sequel — one sent her " ornamental pens " with which to do so . Babies were named after the hero . Sherwood published much of what she wrote in The Youth 's Magazine , a children 's periodical that she edited for over two decades . 
 By the 1830s , the Sherwoods had become more prosperous and the family decided to travel to the continent . The texts that Sherwood wrote following this trip reflect her exposure to French culture in particular . She also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project at this time , for which she learned Hebrew . To assist her , her husband assembled , over the course of ten years , a large Hebrew @-@ English concordance . Unfortunately , Sherwood 's autobiography provides scant details regarding the last forty @-@ odd years of her life . However , we do know that even in her seventies , Sherwood wrote for four or five hours a day ; many of these books were co @-@ authored with Sherwood 's daughter , Sophia . According to M. Nancy Cutt , a Sherwood scholar , this joint authorship led to a " watery sentimentality " not evident in Sherwood 's earlier works as well as a greater emphasis on issues of class . 
 In 1849 , the Sherwoods moved to Twickenham , Middlesex , and in December of that year Captain Sherwood died . Sherwood herself died almost two years later on 20 September 1851 . 
 = = Literary analysis = = 
 Sherwood scholar M. Nancy Cutt has argued that Sherwood 's career can be usefully divided into three periods : ( 1 ) her romantic period ( 1795 – 1805 ) , during which she wrote a few sentimental novels ; ( 2 ) her evangelical period ( 1810 – c . 1830 ) , during which she produced her most popular and influential works ; and ( 3 ) her post @-@ evangelical period ( c . 1830 – 1851 ) . Several underlying themes pervade most of Sherwood 's works throughout these periods : " her conviction of inherent human corruption " ; her belief that literature " had a catechetical utility " for every rank of society ; her belief that " the dynamics of family life " should reflect central Christian principles ; and her " virulent " anti @-@ Catholicism . 
 = = = Early writings : sentimental novels = = = 
 Sherwood 's earliest works are the sentimental novels Traditions ( 1795 ) and Margarita ( 1795 ) ; although both are more worldly than her later works , neither received much recognition . By contrast , The History of Susan Gray , which was written for the girls of her Sunday school class in Bridgnorth , made Sherwood a famous author . Like Hannah More 's tracts , the novel is designed to teach middle @-@ class morality to the poor . This novel — which Patricia Demers , a children 's literature scholar , describes as a " purified Pamela " — tells the story of Susan , an orphaned servant girl , who " resists the advances of a philandering soldier ; though trembling with emotion at the man 's declaration of love and promise of marriage . " The reader is regularly reminded of the " wages of sin " since Susan 's story is told from her deathbed . A separate narrator , seemingly Sherwood , often interrupts the tale to warn readers against particular actions , such as becoming a " bad woman . " Despite a didactic tone that is often distasteful to modern readers , Susan Gray was so popular at the time of its release that it was pirated by multiple publishers . In 1816 , Sherwood published a revised and " improved " version , which Sarah Trimmer positively reviewed in The Guardian of Education . Sherwood wrote a companion story , The History of Lucy Clare , which was published in 1810 . 
 = = = French literary influences = = = 
 Although Sherwood disagreed with the principles espoused by French revolutionaries , her own works are modeled on French children 's literature , much of which is infused with <unk> ideals . For example , in The History of Henry Milner , Part I ( 1822 ) and The History of the Fairchild Family , Part I ( 1818 ) Sherwood adopts Arnaud <unk> 's " habitual pattern of small domestic situations acted out by children under the eye of parents or fellows . " Likewise , The Lady of the Manor ( 1823 – 29 ) shares similar themes and structures with Madame de Genlis ' Tales of the Castle ( 1785 ) . David Hanson , a scholar of nineteenth @-@ century literature , has questioned this interpretation , however , arguing that the tales told by the maternal figure in The Lady of the Manor demonstrate a " distrust of parents , " and of mothers in particular , because they illustrate the folly of overly permissive parenting . In these inset stories , only outsiders discipline children correctly . 
 One of Sherwood 's aims in her evangelically themed The History of Henry Milner ( 1822 – 37 ) was to challenge what she saw as the irreligion inherent in French pedagogy . Henry Milner was written in direct response to Thomas Day 's The History of Sandford and Merton ( 1783 – 89 ) , a novel founded on the philosophy of Rousseau ( whose writings Sherwood had lambasted as " the well @-@ spring of infidelity " ) . Nevertheless , as children 's literature scholar Janis Dawson points out , the structure and emphasis of Henry greatly resemble Rousseau 's own Emile ( 1762 ) : their <unk> are very similar , even if their underlying assumptions about childhood are diametrically opposed . Both books isolate the child in order to encourage him to learn from the natural world , but Sherwood 's Henry is naturally depraved while Rousseau 's Emile is naturally good . As the series progressed , however , Sherwood 's views of religion changed ( she became a universalist ) , causing her to place greater emphasis on childhood innocence in the later volumes . 
 = = = Evangelicalism = = = 
 The strongest themes in Sherwood 's early evangelical writings are the need to recognize one 's innate " depravity " and the need to prepare oneself for eternity . For Sherwood , the most important lessons emphasize " faith , resignation , and implicit obedience to the will of God . " In her adaptation of John Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress ( 1678 ) — The Infant 's Progress ( 1821 ) — she represents original sin as a child named " In @-@ bred Sin " who tempts the young pilgrims on their way to the Celestial City ( Heaven ) and it is these battles with In @-@ bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text . The allegory is complex and , as Demers admits , " tedious " for even the " willing reader . " Thus , " some young readers may have found [ In @-@ bred Sin 's ] activities more interesting than the spiritual struggles of the little heroes , reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation . " Such religious allegory , although not always so overt , continued to be a favorite literary device of Sherwood 's . 
 Sherwood also infused her works with political and social messages dear to evangelicals during the teens and twenties , such as the crucial role of missions , the value of charity , the evils of slavery and the necessity of Sabbath observance . She wrote Biblically based introductions to astronomy and ancient history so that children would have Christian textbooks . As Cutt argues , " the intent of these ( as indeed of all Evangelical texts ) was to offset the deistic tendency to consider knowledge an end in itself . " Sherwood also revised classic children 's books to make them appropriately religious , such as Sarah Fielding 's The Governess ( 1749 ) . Sherwood 's efforts to make religion more palatable through children 's fiction were not always regarded favorably by the entire evangelical community ; The Evangelical Magazine harshly reviewed her Stories Explanatory of the Church Catechism ( 1817 ) , complaining that it was overly reliant on exciting fictional tales to convey its religious message . 
 = = = = The History of the Fairchild Family ( 1818 – 1847 ) = = = = 
 As Cutt argues , " the great overriding metaphor of all [ Sherwood 's ] work is the representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship ( inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden ) . . . No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in the sight of God ; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God . " Demers has referred to this " consciously double vision " as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood 's writing . Nowhere is this theme more evident than in Sherwood 's The History of the Fairchild Family , the first part of which was published in 1818 . 
 Of all of Sherwood 's evangelically themed books , The History of the Fairchild Family was the most popular . When she published it with John Hatchard of Piccadilly , she assured it and the ten other books she published with him a " social distinction " not attached to her other publications . The Fairchild Family tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children ( Emily , Lucy and Henry ) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality ( envy , greed , lying , disobedience , and fighting are immoral ) . The overarching narrative of the tale also includes a series of tract @-@ like stories which illustrate these moral lessons . For example , stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children , Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble , help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to look to the state of their own hearts . The faithful and " true " Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience , suggesting that he was saved ; by contrast , the heedless and disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned . Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes , such as Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , Sherwood domesticated her story — actions in the children 's day @-@ to @-@ day lives , such as stealing fruit , are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation . Each chapter also includes prayers and hymns ( by Philip Doddridge , Isaac Watts , Charles Wesley , William Cowper and Ann and Jane Taylor , among others ) that are thematically linked to it . 
 The Fairchild Family continued to be a bestseller ( remaining in print until 1913 ) despite the increasingly popular <unk> image of childhood innocence . In fact , one scholar has even suggested that it " influenced Dickens 's depictions of Pip 's fears of the convict , the gibbet , and ' the horrible young man ' at the close of Chapter 1 " in Great Expectations ( 1860 – 61 ) . Children 's literature scholar Gillian Avery has argued that The Fairchild Family was " as much a part of English childhood as Alice was later to become . " Although the book was popular , some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as Sherwood would have wanted . Lord Frederic Hamilton writes , for instance , that " there was plenty about eating and drinking ; one could always skip the prayers , and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it . " Although The Fairchild Family has gained a reputation in the twentieth century as an oppressively didactic book , in the early nineteenth century it was viewed as delightfully realistic . Charlotte Yonge ( 1823 – 1901 ) , a critic who also wrote children 's literature , praised " the gusto with which [ Sherwood ] dwells on new dolls " and " the absolutely sensational naughtiness " of the children . Most twentieth @-@ century critics , including George Orwell , who called it " an evil book " , have condemned the book 's harshness , pointing to the <unk> ' moral @-@ filled visit to a gibbet with a rotting corpse swinging from it ; but Cutt and others argue that the positive depiction of the nuclear family in the text , particularly Sherwood 's emphasis on parents ' responsibility to educate their own children , was an important part of the book 's appeal . She argues that Sherwood 's " influence , " via books such as the Fairchild Family , " upon the domestic pattern of Victorian life can hardly be overestimated . " 
 The Fairchild Family was so successful that Sherwood wrote two sequels , one in 1842 and one in 1847 . These reflected her changing values as well as those of the Victorian period . Significantly , the servants in Part I , " who are almost part of the family , are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping , flattering counterparts in the fine manor @-@ house . " But the most extensive thematic change in the series was the disappearance of evangelicalism . Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children 's " human depravity " and encourage the reader to think in terms of the afterlife , in Parts II and III , other Victorian values such as " respectability " and filial obedience come to the fore . Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence ; in Parts II and III , the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I. 
 = = = = Evangelical tract literature in the 1820s and 1830s = = = = 
 During the 1820s and 1830s , Sherwood wrote a great many tracts for the poor ; like her novels for the middle class , they " taught the lessons of personal endurance , reliance on Providence , and acceptance of one 's earthly status . " Emphasizing individual experience and one 's personal relationship with God , they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to " larger economic and political forces . " In this , they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts , many of which were written by Hannah More . As Linda Peterson , a scholar of nineteenth @-@ century women 's literature , argues , Sherwood 's tracts use a Biblical " interpretative frame " in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things . For example , in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London ( 1819 ) , Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will " behave wisely in the streets " and " not give [ her ] mind to self @-@ pleasing . " Of course , she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees . Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop . Julia , ecstatic , chooses , among other things , blue satin boots , a penknife , and a new hat with flowers , until the pair reach the undertaker 's shop . There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson , recited by her mother , as she picks out a coffin : " but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth " ( 1 Timothy 5 : 6 ) . 
 = = = = Anti @-@ Catholicism in the 1830s = = = = 
 Sherwood 's vigorous anti @-@ Catholicism appears most obviously in her works from the 1820s and 1830s . During the 1820s in Britain , Catholics were agitating for greater civil rights and it was at this time that Sherwood wrote her most sustained attacks against them . When the Catholic Emancipation Act was passed in 1829 , Sherwood and many like her were frightened of the influence that Catholics might gain in the government . Therefore , she wrote Victoria ( 1833 ) , The Nun ( 1833 ) and The Monk of Cimies ( 1834 ) in order to illustrate some of the dangers of Catholicism . The Monk narrates , in the first person , Edmund Etherington 's decision to renounce the Church of England and join the Catholic church . While a monk , he ridicules his fellow brothers , plans a murder and <unk> a young woman . But evangelicals were not all in agreement on the issue of Catholic Emancipation and some were uncomfortable with these books ; one evangelical reviewer called The Monk of Cimies " unfair and unconvincing . " 
 = = = Colonialism = = = 
 While in India , Sherwood wrote a series of texts based on colonial life . Her most popular work , The History of Little Henry and his Bearer ( 1814 ) , tells the story of a young British boy who , on his deathbed , converts Boosy , the Indian man who has taken care of him throughout his childhood . The book was enormously successful ; it reached 37 editions by 1850 and was translated into French , German , Spanish , Hindustani , Chinese , and Sinhalese . Sherwood 's tale blends the realistic with the sentimental and introduces her readers to Hindustani words and descriptions of what she felt was authentic Indian life . As Cutt explains , " with this work , the obituary tract ( which invariably stressed conversion and a Christian death ) had assumed the colouring of romance . " Sherwood also wrote a companion story titled Little Lucy and her <unk> ( 1825 ) that told a similar tale but from a little girl 's perspective . 
 In The Indian Pilgrim ( 1818 ) Sherwood tried to adapt Pilgrim 's Progress for the Indian context ; the work focused on " the supposed depravity and pagan idolatry of Brahmans , fakirs , nautch ( dance ) girls , and soldiers ' temporary wives . " This text demonstrates Sherwood 's religious biases : " Muslims and Jews receive better treatment than Hindus because of their belief in one God , but Roman Catholics fare little better than the Hindu idolaters . " The Indian Pilgrim , although never published in India , was popular in Britain and America . Sherwood also wrote texts for Indian servants of British families in the style of British writings for the poor . One of these was The <unk> and Lady ( 1813 ) in which the <unk> , or maid , is " portrayed as sly , selfish , lazy , and untrustworthy . Her employers are well aware of her faults , yet they tolerate her . " A more culturally sensitive and realistic portrayal of Indians appears in The Last Days of Boosy ( 1842 ) , a sequel to The History of Little Henry and his Bearer , in which the converted Boosy is cast out of his family and community because of his conversion to Christianity . 
 Colonial themes were a constant thread in Sherwood 's texts ; The History of Henry Milner ( 1822 – 37 ) , its sequel John Marten ( 1844 ) , and The Indian Orphans ( 1839 ) all evince Sherwood 's interest in these topics . Her writings on India reveal her strong sense of European , if not specifically British , superiority ; India therefore appears in her works as a morally corrupt land in need of reformation . She wrote The History of George Desmond ( 1821 ) to warn young men of the dangers of emigrating to India . Sherwood 's books shaped the minds of several generations of young Britons . According to Cutt , Sherwood 's depictions of India were among the few available to young British readers ; such children " acquired a strong conviction of the rightness of missions , which , while it inculcated sincere concern for , and a genuine kindness towards an alien people for whom Britain was responsible , quite destroyed any latent respect for Indian tradition . " Cutt attributes the growing paternalism of nineteenth @-@ century British polices on India in part to the widespread popularity of Sherwood 's books . 
 Using a postcolonial analysis , Nandini Bhattacharya emphasizes the complex relationship between Sherwood 's evangelicalism and her colonialism . She argues that Sherwood 's evangelical stories demonstrate the deep colonial " mistrust of feminized agency , " represented by a dying child in Little Henry and his Bearer . Henry " subvert [ s ] the colonialist 's fantasy of universal identity by generating a subaltern identity that mimics and explodes that fantasy . " But , ultimately , Bhattacharya argues , Sherwood creates neither a completely colonialist text nor a subaltern text ; the deaths of children such as Henry eliminate any possibility for an alternative consciousnesses to mature . 
 = = = Later writings : Victorianism = = = 
 By 1830 , Sherwood 's works had drifted away from evangelicalism and her novels and stories reflected more conventional Victorian plots and themes . For example , Gipsy Babes ( 1826 ) , perhaps inspired by Walter Scott 's Guy Mannering ( 1815 ) , emphasizes " human affections . " In 1835 , she published a Gothic novel for adolescents titled Shanty the Blacksmith ; it employs all the tropes of the genre — " lost heir , ruined castle , humble helpers and faithful retainer , sinister and mysterious gypsies , prisoner and plot " in what Cutt calls " a gripping " and " exciting tale . " In 1835 Sherwood published the novel Caroline Mordaunt ; it tells the story of a young woman forced to become a governess . Her parents die when she is young , but luckily her relatives pay to educate her so that she can earn her own living . The novel follows her progress from a flighty , discontented girl to a reliable , content woman ; she learns how to accommodate herself to the whims of the proud nobility , silly literati , and dogmatic evangelicals . She realizes that in her dependent position she must content herself with less than complete happiness . Once she recognizes this , though , she finds God and , in the last chapter , an ideal husband , thus granting her near complete happiness . Cutt suggests that Sherwood drew on the works of Jane Austen and Jane Taylor for a new " lively , humorous , and satirical strain " in works such as this . 
 In both later works such as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts , Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of prescribing gender roles ; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex , her early works such as The Fairchild Family suggested such <unk> as well : Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 As Britain 's education system became more secularized in the second half of the nineteenth century , Sherwood 's evangelical books were used mainly to teach the poor and in Sunday schools . Hence her missionary stories were the most influential of all her works . According to Cutt , " these stories , which in themselves kept alive the missionary spirit and perpetuated that paternal attitude towards India that lasted into the [ twentieth century ] , were widely imitated " and " an unfortunate assumption of racial superiority was fostered by the over @-@ simplification of some of Mrs. Sherwood 's successors . " These books influenced Charlotte Maria Tucker ( " <unk> " ) and even perhaps Rudyard Kipling . In the United States , Sherwood 's early works were very popular and were republished well into the 1840s ; after that , a tradition of specifically American children 's literature began to develop with authors such as Louisa May Alcott . 
 Sherwood was also instrumental in developing the ideology of the Victorian family . Cutt acknowledges that " the omniscient Victorian parent was not the creation of Mrs. Sherwood , but of the Victorians themselves ; nevertheless , by presenting the parent as God 's vicar in the family , she had planted and fostered the idea . " This in turn increased the value placed on childhood innocence . 
 The prevalence of death in Sherwood 's early stories and her vivid portrayal of its worldly and otherworldly consequences have often caused twentieth @-@ century critics to deride her works . Nevertheless , Sherwood 's stories prepared the literary ground for writers such as Charles Kingsley and Charlotte Yonge . It has even been suggested that John Ruskin used Henry Milner as the basis for his imaginative autobiography <unk> ( 1885 – 89 ) . Sherwood 's narrative experiments with a variety of genres allowed other writers to pursue innovative forms of children 's fiction . Furthermore , her imaginative use of tracts domesticated reformist literature and also encouraged radical writers such as Harriet Martineau to employ the same genre , if to opposite ends . Because of the popularity of Sherwood 's works and their impact on later writers , Janis Dawson writes : " though her books are no longer widely read , she is regarded as one of the most significant authors of children 's literature of the nineteenth century .

 = Webster 's Brewery = 
 Webster 's Brewery ( Samuel Webster & Sons Ltd ) , was founded in 1838 by Samuel Webster and operated at the Fountain Head Brewery in Halifax , West Riding of Yorkshire , England . Webster 's Green Label , a light mild , and Yorkshire Bitter gained national distribution after the company was taken over by Watney Mann in 1972 . Throughout the 1970s it was known for the advertising slogan : " Drives out the northern thirst " . 
 The brewery was closed with the loss of 400 jobs in 1996 . The brand had suffered lower sales after marketing support was withdrawn following its acquisition by Courage Brewery in 1990 . After the brewery 's closure , Webster 's beers were initially brewed at the John Smith 's Brewery in Tadcaster before moving to the Thomas Hardy Brewery at Burtonwood in 2004 . Silvan Brands have owned the company since 2003 when they acquired it from Scottish & Newcastle . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins : 1838 – 1900 = = = 
 Samuel Webster ( 1813 – 1872 ) was born in Ovenden , a small village about 2 miles from Halifax town centre . He was the eldest of seven brothers born into a Congregationalist family of the 10 acre @-@ owning farmer James Webster . Webster acquired the small Fountain Head Brewery in Ovenden Wood in 1838 when he was 25 and opened an office in Union Cross Yard , Halifax . The company bought its first public house in 1845 . In 1860 he was joined in partnership by his three sons Isaac , George Henry and Samuel Green , and the firm began trading as Samuel Webster & Sons . Samuel Webster died in 1872 , leaving his sons to continue the business . The firm also imported and sold wines and cigars , in addition to its brewing concerns . 
 By 1880 the company had 100 tied houses . In March 1890 Samuel Webster & Sons became a registered company with £ 175 @,@ 000 ( £ 17 @.@ 5 million in 2010 ) of capital and Isaac Webster , Samuel 's eldest son , its first chairman . In 1892 net profit was £ 20 @,@ 000 ( £ 2 million in 2010 ) . In 1896 the company took over H & T T Ormerod of <unk> , West Yorkshire which could trace its origins back to 1760 . Isaac Webster died in 1899 , leaving an estate of £ 87 @,@ 454 ( £ 9 million ) . By 1900 the company 's office had moved to 57 Northgate , Halifax . 
 = = = 20th @-@ century consolidation = = = 
 The temperance movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers . In 1919 net profit was reported at £ 22 @,@ 325 ( £ 900 @,@ 000 at 2010 prices ) . Samuel Wentworth Webster , a director of the company and grandson of the founder , died in 1928 with a <unk> of £ 45 @,@ 000 ( £ 2 @.@ 2 million in 2010 ) . In 1928 , one of the brewery 's most successful beers was launched ; Webster 's Green Label , a light mild ale . In 1929 the company 's entire stock of properties , land and brewery buildings was valued at £ 468 @,@ 833 ( £ 23 @.@ 2 million in 2010 ) . The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932 , which could trace its origins back to 1790 . In 1957 , Webster 's took over the brewer , John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland , near Halifax , a mineral water manufacturer . The company dray horses , used for local beer deliveries , were retired by the end of the 1950s . In 1961 Webster 's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax , which added 19 public houses to their tied estate . The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company . In return Webster 's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney 's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate . In 1962 , a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope 's North East division which saw Webster 's houses stock lager for the first time . That same year the group won the contract to bottle <unk> for West Yorkshire . 
 In September 1966 , a friendly takeover of the Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate . Webster 's had a market value of £ 3 @.@ 3 million , and J. Hey had a value of £ 1 million . The combined group had assets of over £ 4 @.@ 5 million ( £ 65 million in 2010 prices ) . Webster 's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s . Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s , consolidation , a good product and successful marketing made the company successful , according to The Times , with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover . By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18 @.@ 4 per cent of the company , and Webster 's had a market capitalisation of £ 6 million ( £ 85 million in 2010 prices ) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences . Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27 @.@ 1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover of the rest of the company . Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £ 18 million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own . The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £ 250 million in 2010 prices . The takeover was a friendly one , and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family , who owned 20 per cent of the company . Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate . Following the takeover , Webster 's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire , responsible for Yorkshire , Humberside , north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire . The takeover saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster 's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally . That same year , Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan . 
 In 1979 , Webster 's employed a total of 1 @,@ 500 people across production , distribution and retailing . The early 1980s saw the " gradual transformation " of Webster 's into a national brand . In 1985 , Grand Met merged the Wilson Brewery of Manchester ( which Watney Mann had bought in 1960 ) with Webster 's to form Samuel Webster and Wilsons Ltd . In 1986 , Wilsons Brewery was closed down and production of Wilsons Original Bitter and Wilsons Mild was moved to Halifax . By 1988 Webster 's was supplying around 1000 pubs in the North of England , and as far afield as North Wales . 
 Moving out of the brewing industry , Grand Met sold Webster 's to Courage in 1990 . By that year Webster 's had an annual revenue of around £ 100 million and claimed 7 per cent of the national bitter market . However Courage owned the higher selling John Smith 's ale brand , and Webster 's was <unk> . The brands suffered further after the Scottish & Newcastle takeover of Courage , as S & N , with their own <unk> brand , now owned three major bitter brands from Yorkshire alone . By 1996 Scotland on Sunday described the brand as " staid " and argued that it " never caught on outside its Yorkshire heartland . " By this time John Smith 's was outselling Webster 's three to one . 
 Following the closure of the Fountain Head Brewery in 1996 , Webster 's beers were initially brewed at Scottish Courage 's John Smith 's Brewery in Tadcaster , but were subsequently moved to the Thomas Hardy Brewery at Burtonwood in 2004 . Scottish & Newcastle sold the Webster 's brands to Silvan Brands in 2003 . The chairman Brian Stewart defended the sale , claiming : " Webster 's was a brand that did not have a strong brand franchise . What has happened is that brands [ which ] consumers demand are still here " . In 2011 , H B Clark took over the distribution rights for the Webster 's brands in the north of England . The bitter is now simply known as Webster 's Bitter . In 2015 , Silvan Brands Ltd dissolved and the brand is believed no longer to be sold .

 The brewery site was chosen for its Pennine spring which provided the ready water supply necessary for brewing . The water was rich in magnesium sulphate which added bitterness to the beer and provided it with a dry finish . In 1873 the brewery was extended and redeveloped . In 1890 the brewery was linked to the Halifax High Level Railway network , which facilitated the brewery 's distribution . In 1900 the Château @-@ influenced maltings building was built as part of a £ 10 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 million in 2010 ) development project . By 1958 the company 's existing offices in Northgate , Halifax , were proving too small for the expanding company , and new offices were custom built on the Ovenden Wood site . The landmark maltings building was closed in 1960 as its 12 @,@ 000 stone ( 76 @,@ 000 kg ) per annum capacity proved insufficient for the brewery 's increasing needs , and the building was used for storage . 
 In 1973 , Watney Mann commissioned a new brewhouse . In 1979 a new £ 6 million lager plant was started , initially brewing <unk> . By the early 1980s the brewery had beer production volumes of around 400 @,@ 000 barrels per annum and employed around 600 people . At this time , the brewery was described as " wonderfully traditional " by Roger Protz and had open fermentation vessels , mash tuns and copper brewing vessels . Production of Budweiser began in 1984 . Having previously been used for storage , in 1986 the historic Long Can Hall was converted to function as the brewery 's visitor 's centre . 
 A £ 10 million expansion project was embarked upon at the brewery in 1988 . Construction of a new plant increased brewing capacity from 1 million to 1 @.@ 3 million barrels a year . In 1989 , the derelict former maltings building was converted into brewery offices in a £ 4 million project . Also , a new distribution depot was constructed in Elland . 
 In 1990 , the Old Maltings was categorised as a Grade II listed building . By 1990 , most of the Fountain Head Brewery was dedicated to brewing Webster 's and Wilsons ales . The brewery 's bottling line was closed in 1991 , resulting in the loss of 54 jobs . 
 At the time of the brewery 's closure in November 1996 , it employed 184 people on a ten hectare site . As well as Webster 's and Wilson 's beers , the brewery had been producing the lager brands Foster 's and Molson . The brewery had been running at " well below " 50 per cent of its 1 @.@ 3 million barrel capacity which was deemed " unsustainable " according to Scottish & Newcastle management . Although productivity per employee had been the highest of any of Scottish & Newcastle 's brewing plants it was claimed that it would have required substantial investment if it was to remain competitive . 
 In 2004 , housing was built on the former brewery site . After a period of dormancy , the Old Maltings reopened as a children 's day nursery in 2007 , and a school and community centre was opened alongside the nursery in 2011 . The Maltings College sixth form opened at the site in 2013 . 
 = = Webster 's Yorkshire Bitter = = 
 Webster 's Yorkshire Bitter was launched in the summer of 1982 . Largely a cask product , by 1984 Grand Metropolitan had transformed Yorkshire Bitter into a " massive " national brand , available in the company 's 5 @,@ 000 tied houses and 15 @,@ 000 free houses . It was marketed as their response to the growing popularity of Yorkshire bitter in the south of England , particularly John Smith 's . Yorkshire Bitter was the highest selling off trade bitter by 1985 with 18 per cent of the market . It had become the fifth best selling bitter nationally by 1989 , helped by a competitive pricing policy , and was the highest selling bitter in London . The beer was not without its critics , with the 1990 Good Beer Guide describing it as " weak flavour [ ed ] , reminiscent of a poor quality home brew – <unk> , bland , cloying , with a dirty finish on the tongue " . In 1993 , Yorkshire Bitter was reduced from 3 @.@ 8 per cent to 3 @.@ 5 per cent ABV in order to save money on duty . 
 When Scottish & Newcastle acquired the John Smith 's and Webster 's bitter brands as part of their takeover of Courage in 1995 , the lower selling Webster 's brands were <unk> , and virtually all marketing support ceased . Roger Protz has described the brand as " almost redundant " and production of cask conditioned Webster 's beer was ended in 2010 . 
 = = Advertising = = 
 Webster 's Pennine Bitter was known for its slogan : " Drives out the northern thirst " , first used in 1970 and supported throughout the 1970s by a local television campaign featuring Yorkshire cricketer Fred Trueman . In the advertisements , Trueman would breathe fire after drinking his pint of Pennine Bitter and say " We like things right in Yorkshire – like our beer . Webster 's Pennine Bitter . Drives out the northern thirst " . 
 The comedian Charlie Williams appeared in television advertisements for Yorkshire Bitter in 1984 – 85 . One of the Williams advertisements featured a cameo from Yorkshire cricketers Fred Trueman and Ray Illingworth . The Webster 's Yorkshire Bitter " Talking horses " campaign ran from 1986 until 1992 with the slogan " It 's right tasty is Webster 's " . <unk> horses were used in the 1980s , but replaced by animatronic puppets in the 1990s .

 The company sponsored The Hallé orchestra to appear in Halifax to sell out audiences in 1966 and 1967 . In the summer of 1984 , Webster 's Yorkshire Bitter invested £ 100 @,@ 000 into English cricket , with the aim of finding six fast bowlers by winter . From 1986 to 1992 , Webster 's sponsored Bradford Northern RLFC rugby league team , and Halifax RLFC from 1992 to 1993 , <unk> Colliery Band from 1987 to 1990 , the UK Open darts championship in 1989 and 1990 , and the World Matchplay darts tournament in 1995 and 1996 . 
 = Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception ( Hong Kong ) = 
 The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception ( Chinese : <unk> ) is a late 19th @-@ century English Gothic revival church that serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong . It is located in the Mid @-@ Levels area of the city at 16 Caine Road . 
 Groundbreaking and construction of the cathedral began in 1883 after the previous cathedral , on Wellington Street , was destroyed by fire . Built from brick and stone , the new cathedral was designed by the London @-@ based architectural firm Crawley and Company . The church opened on 7 December 1888 , the day before the Feast of the Immaculate Conception , and was consecrated in 1938 . Three years later , it was damaged during the Battle of Hong Kong , but remained untouched throughout the subsequent Japanese occupation of Hong Kong . At the turn of the century , the cathedral underwent an extensive and costly program of refurbishment , which was completed in 2002 . The cathedral is listed as a Grade I historic building by the Government of Hong Kong .

 After the First Opium War , Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the colony soon became a popular stopover for missionaries travelling onwards to China . The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore <unk> , the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong , and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards . The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street . Construction was completed in 1843 . Within the next few years , the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly , partly due to the emigration of people from neighbouring Macau . The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline , and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong . 
 In 1859 , just sixteen years after it was built , the church was destroyed by fire . This was not uncommon , however , as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony , and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site . It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade . However , the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where the church was situated became more overcrowded with the rapid growth of Hong Kong at the time , and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary . As a result , plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid @-@ Levels , located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens . The original site was redeveloped as a commercial and residential area . A small park along Lok Hing Lane is located nearby . 
 = = = Present @-@ day cathedral = = = 
 A new site for the cathedral was selected above Caine Road by the <unk> Ravine and the cornerstone of the new church was laid on 8 December 1883 . Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects and five years later , construction was completed . The church opened on 7 December 1888 , the vigil of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception , and was blessed one day later . The construction of the cathedral cost US $ 15 @,@ 400 , and since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt , the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938 , exactly fifty years after it first opened . The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico <unk> , the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop Emeritus of Canton ; three of the cathedral 's altars were also consecrated . 
 During the Second World War , the cathedral suffered damage on its anniversary in 1941 , when a Japanese shell was dropped onto it during the Battle of Hong Kong . However , it survived the war relatively unscathed due to a decree made a century before . When the mission in Hong Kong was first established in 1841 , Pope Pius IX ruled that , although the colony was under British rule , the Prefecture Apostolic should remain under the administration of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions ( <unk> ) , a missionary society from Italy . As a result , the Japanese treated the cathedral as being under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Italy , with whom they were not at war . Because of this , the cathedral was spared from being ransacked and plundered by the occupying forces and its archives were preserved better than other churches throughout Hong Kong , having been left " relatively unscathed . " 
 After the conclusion of the war , the cathedral underwent a series of renovations . The roof — which was previously made of timber — was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites . The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council , in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral 's crossing . In 1988 , air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation . 
 Significant leaks in the roof were reported in 1997 and a massive restoration project took place . This entailed fixing the roof , repainting the walls and the niche housing the statue of the Immaculate Conception , replacing tiles , enhancing the lighting and sound system and installing new stained glass windows in the Chapel of Our Lord 's Passion , which was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs . The renovation was completed on 8 December 2002 and cost a total of US $ 1 @.@ 1 million . The project 's success in preserving the building 's heritage resulted in the cathedral being given an honourable mention at the 2003 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation and presented with the award on its anniversary in 2003 . 
 The cathedral holds a Red Mass every other year for the Judiciary of Hong Kong , alternating with St. John 's Cathedral in hosting the annual opening of the Assizes .

 The cathedral , built in an English Gothic style , is cruciform in the shape of the Latin cross . The exterior walls of the church were built from brick and stone , while its base and columns were made of granite . Its dimensions are 82 m ( 269 ft ) long , 40 m ( 131 ft ) wide and 23 @.@ 7 m ( 78 ft ) tall , with the tower at the centre rising to 33 @.@ 7 m ( 111 ft ) .

 Located to the right of the main altar and sanctuary is the side altar of St. Joseph . It was given to the cathedral by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the donation was facilitated by Joseph Mary Sala , an expatriate living in Hong Kong who was from the nobility of Italy . It is adorned by the royal coat of arms of the House of Savoy ; this conspicuous symbol of Italy was said to have helped the cathedral identify itself as Italian rather than British , and thus , remain untouched throughout the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong , as the Kingdom of Italy and Empire of Japan were both signatories to the Tripartite Pact .

 Located to the left of the main altar is the side altar of the Sacred Heart . It was previously used as the high altar of the original cathedral at Wellington Street .

 Located to the right of the cathedral 's sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord 's Passion . Given by J.J. Braga , a parishioner from Portugal , it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997 – 2002 renovation . The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then @-@ newly canonised saints because it was the most thematically similar , in that the martyrs gave up their lives for the faith , emulating Jesus ' sacrifice to save mankind . New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints . 
 = = = Crypt = = = 
 A crypt was constructed beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 to house the remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong . This consists of two Vicar <unk> , Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic <unk> , and all five deceased bishops — Enrico <unk> , Lorenzo Bianchi , Francis Hsu , Peter Lei and John Wu . Bianchi 's remains were interred later than the others due to the fact that he was buried in Milan . Thus , the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong ; the request was eventually granted . 
 The inspiration for the crypt came from the design of a traditional Chinese family house , which would contain the remains of ancestors . The Bishop at the time , Joseph Cardinal Zen , felt that the crypt would be a " symbolic move to inherit the teachings of previous generations in order to inspire future ones . " Because the cathedral is a Grade I historic building , prior approval had to be obtained from the Buildings Department before any construction work could be carried out .

 Shortly after the canonisation of the 120 Chinese Martyrs on 1 October 2000 , the relics of sixteen of them were placed at the Chapel of Our Lord 's Passion . They are stored in a relic box — designed locally by Sister Paola Yue — that is situated at the foot of the side altar .

 In November 2011 , a lock of John Paul II 's hair was brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff . The diocese had earlier requested this , since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope 's longtime dream of visiting China . He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country , but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See . Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong , the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic of John Paul II . It is currently displayed in the same chapel as the bishops ' crypt . 
 = Aransas Bay = 
 Aransas Bay is a bay on the Texas gulf coast , approximately 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of Corpus Christi , and 173 miles ( 278 km ) south of San Antonio . It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by San José Island ( also referred to as St. Joseph Island ) . Aransas Pass is the most direct navigable outlet into the Gulf of Mexico from the bay . The cities of Aransas Pass and Port Aransas are located at the southern end , and Rockport is found on the central western shore . The bay is oriented laterally northeast @-@ southwest , and is extended by Redfish Bay to the southwest , Copano Bay to the west , Saint Charles Bay to the north , and Mesquite Bay to the northeast . Aransas Bay is part of the Mission @-@ Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve . 
 There is a rich history of settlements on the bay , including : ancient Native American campgrounds dating back millennia ; 19th @-@ century European immigrant towns such as Lamar and Aransas ; and the present day cities of Rockport , Fulton and Aransas Pass . Resources such as shrimp , fish , oysters and oil are found in or near the bay , and contribute to the local economies . 
 = = History = = 
 Humans first inhabited the area surrounding Aransas Bay approximately 6 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 years ago . The name derives from a group of indigenous people called the Aransas Indians , whose 4 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old campsites have been found near the bay . The nomadic Aransas , left the area circa 1200 to 1300 CE . According to archeologists , the Karankawa and Coahuiltecan had coalesced as people and migrated into the area by 1400 . They had severe losses and were much reduced by the 1800s due to new infectious diseases contracted from European explorers . Alonso Álvarez de Pineda of Spain is believed to be the first European to sail the bay , circa 1519 . For over a century later , the Spanish had little interest in the area until the French established a colony in Texas in the late 17th century . At this time , Alonso De León was ordered to found a settlement in the area , but no permanent colony on the bay was ever established . 
 During the years of Mexican control , the bay was put off limits to settlement by the authorities . An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration . In 1832 , the settlement of Aransas City on the bay , was founded by James Power . After the development of the nearby port Lamar in 1840 , Aransas City was deserted by 1846 . But Lamar soon met a similar fate , after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War . The city of Aransas , which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar , was also destroyed in the fighting . During the war , the bay was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight , due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands . 
 As a result of the destruction from the war , the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s . At first , Rockport was intended as a deep @-@ water port , but after a series of mishaps , Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879 . By 1912 , a 100 feet wide and 8 ½ feet deep channel was operational . After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast . 
 Later twentieth @-@ century development has been based on the area 's natural beauty . In the 1960s , the affluent resort of Key Allegro , located between Rockport and Fulton , was founded . By 2000 , 24 @,@ 615 people lived in the surrounding Aransas County , including the cities of Rockport , Fulton , Aransas Pass and the unincorporated Key Allegro , Holiday Beach and Estes . The outer Refugio County located on the shore of Copano Bay , had 7 @,@ 828 residents .

 On average , the Aransas Bay system is 3 meters deep , and covers approximately 539 square kilometers . The system is made up of the bay itself and its extensions . The main extensions include : Saint Charles Bay , to the east of the Lamar peninsula ; Copano Bay , to the west of both the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas , Mesquite Bay to the bay 's northeast , and Redfish Bay to the southwest . Redfish Bay is sometimes considered an extension of Corpus Christi Bay . 
 Every second , approximately 28 cubed meters of water flows into the bay . The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass . As a result of the seawater exchange , the bay 's salinity is 15 parts per thousand , compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt . This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions , from Copano Creek , Mission River and Aransas River , forming the Mission @-@ Aransas estuary . Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay . Combined , the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system 's volume , which is judged to be minimal . 
 Texas State Highway 35 runs parallel to the shore of Aransas Bay on its route from Corpus Christi to Houston . The highway includes the 1 @.@ 5 mile long Copano Bay causeway , which connects the Live Oak and Lamar peninsulas at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bays . The first causeway was constructed in 1933 , but was replaced in 1966 with the Lyndon Baines Johnson causeway . The former causeway was transformed into a fishing pier in later years . In 1981 , nearly 10 @,@ 000 vehicles passed over the bridge on a daily basis . 
 = = Ecosystem = = 
 A wide variety of wildlife can be found in and around Aransas Bay . According to Texas Parks and Wildlife , the following fish have been caught in the bay : catfish , black drum , red drum , eel , southern flounder , crevalle jack , yellowtail amberjack , ladyfish , silver perch , <unk> , pinfish , sea trout , blacktip shark , bull shark , sheepshead , mangrove snapper , common snook and toadfish . Shrimp , Oysters and crabs also reside in the waters . The sea grass carpets found at numerous locations , provide a habitat and an ideal place for fish to spawn . The grasses also act as a filter , clearing the bay of environmental contaminants . 
 Many birds migrate to the area around Aransas Bay , most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge . Year @-@ round residents include least grebe , brown pelican , neotropic cormorant , white @-@ faced ibis , roseate spoonbill , black @-@ bellied whistling @-@ duck , mottled duck , white @-@ tailed hawk , crested caracara , <unk> , golden @-@ fronted woodpecker , great <unk> , green jay , long @-@ billed thrasher , olive sparrow , seaside sparrow , and bronzed cowbird . The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay . Despite the fact that there were only 15 in 1900 , over 180 are found in the wild today . The whooping crane 's and other birds ' survival depends on the availability of blue crab . Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population . 
 = = Industry = = 
 Given the location of Aransas bay , shipping has always been a major industry . Following the Civil War , the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay , especially Rockport and Fulton , where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed . In the early years of meatpacking , cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since there was no way to refrigerate the meat . As a result , most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed , were disposed in the bay . This changed in 1871 , when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant . By this time , the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime . Prior to the decline of the industry in the area , in 1880 , 93 % of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport @-@ Fulton . Along with fishing , oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century . Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War . During World War II , the United States Navy took over several shipyards . In 1936 , oil was discovered on the bay . By 1946 , 13 wells were in operation . In 1990 , 498 @,@ 703 barrels were produced , part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990 . Today , tourism is a prosperous industry . Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish , bird or sight @-@ see . A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport , where the bay 's only beach ( Rockport Beach ) is located . 
 = East Washington Avenue Bridge = 
 The East Washington Avenue Bridge refers to the bridges that have connected East Washington Avenue over the Pequonnock River in Bridgeport , Connecticut . Records state that a bridge was first constructed on the site in 1836 , but no description of the bridge has been found . The second bridge was a truss swing design and underwent heavy repair and modernization in 1893 . The third design was a movable Strauss underneath @-@ counter weight deck @-@ girder bascule bridge . The plans were drafted by James A. McElroy , using Joseph B. Strauss 's design in 1916 . However , construction was delayed for years because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds . The bridge was completed by Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging when the State of Connecticut appropriated $ 350 @,@ 000 to erect the bridge . Completed in 1925 , the bridge underwent several modifications throughout its service life . On July 26 , 1983 , the bridge was closed after it was found to be in danger of collapse . It reopened after repair , but was closed in the 1990s before being replaced with a modern bascule bridge in 1998 . In 2010 , the report listed the deck and superstructure conditions as " Good " and the substructure condition as " Satisfactory " .

 The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an area that was previously known as Pembroke , the name stemming from the 1650s , that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community . East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield , which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800 . In 1821 , it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836 . The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright ; with the intention of selling housing lots . The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one quarter of a mile to the south , but it was changed through public opposition , and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836 . The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records .

 The design of the second East Washington Avenue Bridge is unknown , but the survey in 1916 for its replacement documented a cantilever through truss swing that was 184 ft ( 56 m ) long . The bridge was heavily repaired and remodeled in 1893 , around this same period a trolley line was added . Two decades later , the bridge needed to be replaced and restrictions were made to extend the service life of the bridge , with trolleys , then heavy trucks being banned . The bridge 's service life ended in 1917 with its closure .

 The City of Bridgeport appointed a bridge commission to replace the aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7 , 1915 . The commission chose a Joseph B. Strauss 's patented design from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago , Illinois . The city engineer James A. McElroy drew up the plans for the bridge 's specifications and the plans were completed on February 17 , 1916 . The steel for the construction was ordered from the Penn Bridge Company . The project was suspended because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds to erect the bridge , but in 1923 the State of Connecticut appropriated $ 350 @,@ 000 to complete the project . Only two bids for the bridge 's erection were placed , the first by Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging for $ 326 @,@ 575 and the second by C. W.

A 1979 inspection of the bridge found it listed in " poor condition " and recommended repairs totaling $ 820 @,@ 000 to be completed by 1985 . A 1980 report by the Connecticut Department of Transportation listed the East Washington Avenue bridge as 1 of the 127 bridges in " poor condition " ; requiring " immediate " repair . The report defines " poor condition " as serviceable and not in danger of collapse . The Hartford Courant states that the 1979 report went unnoticed for four years and another inspection was carried out in 1982 ; also listing the bridge in " poor condition " .

 = Eighth Army Ranger Company = 
 The Eighth Army Ranger Company , also known as the 8213th Army Unit , was a Ranger light infantry company of the United States Army that was active during the Korean War . As a small special forces unit , it specialized in irregular warfare . Intended to combat the North Korean ( NK ) commandos who had been effective at infiltration and disruption behind United Nations ( UN ) lines , the Eighth Army Ranger Company was formed at the height of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter in September 1950 and was the first U.S. Army Ranger unit created since World War II . The company went into action as a part of the 25th Infantry Division during the UN advance into North Korea in October and November . It was best known for its defense of Hill 205 against an overwhelming Chinese attack during the Battle of the Ch 'ongch 'on River which resulted 41 of the 51 Rangers becoming casualties . 
 The company later undertook a number of other combat missions during late 1950 and early 1951 , conducting infiltration , reconnaissance and raiding . It scouted Chinese positions during Operation Killer and struck behind Chinese lines during Operation Ripper before being deactivated at the end of March 1951 . The company saw 164 days of continuous combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation . Military historians have since studied the economy of force of the company 's organization and utilization . Although the experimental unit led to the creation of 15 more Ranger companies , historians disagree on whether the unit was employed properly as a special forces unit and whether it was adequately equipped for the missions it was designed to conduct . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 , the North Korean People 's Army had invaded the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) with 90 @,@ 000 well @-@ trained and equipped troops who had easily overrun the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army . The United States ( U.S. ) and United Nations ( UN ) subsequently intervened , beginning a campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing . The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan , and were badly defeated by the better @-@ trained North Koreans on 5 July . By August , U.S. and UN forces had been pushed back to the Pusan Perimeter . At the same time , North Korean agents began to infiltrate behind UN lines and attack military targets and cities . UN units , spread out along the Pusan Perimeter , were having a difficult time repelling these units as they were untrained in combating guerrilla warfare . North Korean special forces units like the NK 766th Independent Infantry Regiment had been successful in defeating ROK troops , prompting Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins to order the creation of an elite force which could " infiltrate through enemy lines and attack command posts , artillery , tank parks , and key communications centers or facilities . " All U.S. Army Ranger units had been disbanded after World War II because they required time @-@ consuming training , specialization , and expensive equipment . Yet with the defeat of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong , and the strength of U.S. infantry units in question , U.S. commanders felt recreating Ranger units was essential to beginning a counteroffensive . 
 In early August as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning , the Eighth United States Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee , the head of its G @-@ 3 Operations Miscellaneous Division , to seek volunteers for a new experimental Army Ranger unit . McGee was given only seven weeks to organize and train the unit before it was sent into combat , as commanders felt the need for Rangers was dire , and that existing soldiers could be trained as Rangers in a relatively short period of time . Because of this limitation , volunteers were solicited only from existing Eighth Army combat units in Korea , though subsequent Ranger companies were able to recruit Ranger veterans from World War II . From the Eighth Army replacement pool , McGee recruited Second Lieutenant Ralph Puckett , newly commissioned from West Point and with no combat experience , to serve as the company commander . Second Lieutenants Charles Bunn and Barnard Cummings , Jr . , became Puckett 's two platoon leaders . Several hundred enlisted men volunteered from the Eighth Army , though few had combat experience . Through a quick and informal selection process , Puckett picked the men to fill out the company based on weapons qualifications , athleticism , and duty performance . There was no time to administer physical fitness tests for the applicants , and unmarried men younger than 26 were preferred . Recruits were told they would receive no hazard pay . 
 Once Puckett had selected 73 enlisted men , the Eighth Army Ranger Company was formally organized at Camp Drake , Japan , on 25 August 1950 . Three days later , it sailed from Sasebo to Pusan , South Korea , aboard the ferry Koan Maru . Upon arrival , the company was sent to the newly established Eighth Army Ranger Training Center for seven weeks of specialized training . This took place at " Ranger Hill " near Kijang , where the men became skilled in reconnaissance , navigation , long @-@ range patrolling , motorized scouting , setting up roadblocks , maintaining camouflage and concealment , and adjusting indirect fire . They also undertook frequent live fire exercises , many at night , simulating raids , ambushes and infiltration , using North Korean operatives that were known to be hiding in the area as an opposing force . Adopting techniques that had been established during World War II , they worked 60 hours per week , running 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) each day and frequently undertaking 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) speed marches . The troops also all shaved their hair into mohawks , under orders of the officers who wanted to build esprit de corps . Of the original 76 men who started the course , 12 either dropped out or were injured , and as a result 10 South Korean troops , known as KATUSAs , were attached to the unit to fill its ranks . 
 = = = Organization = = = 
 Established to experiment with the notion of deploying small light infantry units that specialized in infiltration and irregular warfare to Korea , the Eighth Army Ranger Company was created with an organization that was unique to other U.S. Army units . Consisting of three officers and 73 enlisted men , it was organized as a company of two platoons based on the Table of Organization and Equipment documents used to raise Ranger units during World War II . Within each platoon , a headquarters element of five men provided command and control . In addition , both platoons had thirty @-@ six men in three squads – two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad – and were furnished with a 60 mm M2 mortar , two M20 Super Bazookas , and a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle as well as the M1 Garand and M2 Carbines that the majority of the men were armed with . One man from each platoon was designated as a sniper . The company was assigned no vehicles , and no provision was made for mess facilities or to provide medical assets . As no independent battalion @-@ level headquarters existed in Korea , the company had to be attached to a higher formation at all times . 
 Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector theory that assigned non @-@ descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations in order to disguise their role from the enemy , the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit . Upon formation , it was decided that the company would be considered an ad hoc , or provisional unit , which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation , akin to a task force . This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company , as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II , and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations . While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors , the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army , which commanded all UN troops in Korea .

 = = = Advance = = = 
 By the time the Eighth Army Ranger Company completed training on 1 October , UN forces had broken out of the Pusan Perimeter following an amphibious landing at Inchon . The company was subsequently committed to the offensive from Pusan Perimeter . On 8 October it was redesignated the 8213th Army Unit signifying its activation as a unit , and on 14 October Puckett took an advance force to join the US 25th Infantry Division at Taejon , as part of the US IX Corps . The Rangers ' first assignment was to probe north to Poun with the division 's reconnaissance elements in search of pockets of guerrillas which had been isolated during the UN breakout from Pusan . The platoons moved to two villages near Poun and began a northward sweep with the 25th Infantry Division . The troops then rapidly moved 175 miles ( 282 km ) to Kaesong where they eliminated the last North Korean resistance south of the 38th Parallel . In these missions , the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw frequent combat with small groups of North Korean troops . During this time they also scrounged supplies from local units , including commandeering a jeep , and taking rice and other rations from the countryside . 
 With South Korea liberated , the Rangers led the 25th Infantry Division 's advance into North Korea . Acting as a spearhead , they sent out reconnaissance patrols ahead of the divisional main body and set up roadblocks to limit the movement of retreating North Korean forces . The Rangers became a part of " Task Force Johnson " with the 25th Infantry Division Reconnaissance Company and the 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry in November to probe and clear the Uijeongbu , <unk> , and Shiny @-@ ri areas of North Korean elements . On 18 November , the Rangers were detached from Task Force Johnson and returned to Kaesong , where they were attached to the 89th Medium Tank Battalion . On 20 November , the 89th Medium Tank Battalion moved to join the renewed UN offensive north to destroy the remaining North Korean troops and advance to the Yalu River . The battalion was designated " Task Force Dolvin " and ordered to spearhead the drive . At 01 : 00 that morning they advanced to Kunu @-@ ri , reaching the front lines at <unk> by 16 : 00 . 
 = = = Hill 205 = = = 
 On 23 November , the 25th Infantry Division rested in preparation for its final advance to the Yalu , which was to begin the next day at 10 : 00 . As the division spent the day enjoying a Thanksgiving Day meal , the Rangers scouted 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of the planned line of departure but made no contact with North Korean forces . On 24 November , the company moved out on time in the center of Task Force Dolvin 's advance , riding on tanks from B Company , 89th Tank Battalion , including M4A3 Sherman and M26 <unk> . About 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) into their advance , they rescued 30 U.S. prisoners of war from the 8th Cavalry Regiment who had been captured at the Battle of Unsan but abandoned by the retreating Chinese . At 14 : 00 they reached their objective at Hill 222 . As soon as the Rangers dismounted the tanks , the troops came under mortar fire . One Ranger was subsequently killed , the company 's first fatality since its formation . Cummings and 2nd Platoon advanced 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) to the crest of the hill . At that time the tanks of the 89th mistakenly opened fire on the Rangers , causing a number of friendly fire casualties including two killed , before Puckett was able to signal them to stop . The Rangers took up positions on Hill 222 for the night . An additional two men became weather casualties , suffering frostbite that evening as temperatures fell to 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) . 
 The next day , 25 November , Task Force Dolvin resumed its advance , with 51 Rangers of the Eighth Army Ranger Company continuing north on the 89th 's tanks . The troops immediately ran into Chinese resistance as they began to advance . On both flanks , Task Force Dolvin troops encountered sporadic resistance throughout the morning , but were able to capture their objectives . The Eighth Army Ranger Company rode the tanks a further 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north to Hill 205 . As the Rangers and tanks approached the hill they came under mortar and small arms fire , but were able to capture the hill after light Chinese resistance , suffering four wounded in the process . The Rangers then established a perimeter on the position and spent the remainder of the day fortifying it . The Chinese Second Phase Offensive was launched that evening , with the unprepared UN troops hit all along the Korean front as 300 @,@ 000 Chinese troops swarmed into Korea . Several kilometers away on the Rangers ' left flank , the U.S. 27th Infantry Regiment 's E Company was hit with a heavy Chinese attack at 21 : 00 , alerting the Rangers to a pending attack . 
 At 22 : 00 , troops of the Chinese 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205 , signaled by drums and whistles . An estimated platoon @-@ sized force of Chinese made the first attack . The Rangers fought back with heavy small arms fire and several pre @-@ sighted artillery concentrations , repulsing this first attack at 22 : 50 . A number of Rangers were wounded in this attack , including Puckett , who refused evacuation . At 23 : 00 the Chinese launched a second attack which was quickly repelled , as was a third attack several minutes later . Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength . The Rangers inflicted heavy casualties each time as a result of a well @-@ established defensive perimeter , though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite the Chinese attack were unable to assist the Rangers , as the crews had no experience in night operations . By 23 : 50 the Chinese began attacking in greater numbers , with an estimated two companies advancing at a time , moving to within hand grenade range . The Rangers began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount , and Puckett was wounded again . Over the course of several hours the Chinese launched a fourth and a fifth attack , each of which was narrowly pushed back by the Rangers . The Rangers were then ordered to fix bayonets in preparation for the next attack . 
 At 02 : 45 , the Chinese began a sixth and final attack with a heavy mortar barrage which inflicted heavy casualties on the remaining Rangers , including Cummings , who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett , who was severely wounded . The Chinese then sent a reinforced battalion of 600 infantry at the hill , while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin , preventing artillery from providing effective support . Without artillery support of their own , and low on ammunition , they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack . The Chinese forces swarmed the hill in overwhelming numbers , and many of the Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets . The company was destroyed in the fighting , with the survivors retreating from the hill . Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett . The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area at the base of the hill under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts , the highest ranking unwounded member of the company , and withdrew . The Rangers suffered over 80 percent casualties on Hill 205 ; of the 51 who captured the hill , 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded . 
 = = = 1951 raids = = = 
 The heavy casualties on Hill 205 rendered the company ineffective , and for several weeks it was only capable of being used to conduct routine patrols or as a security force for divisional headquarters elements . Puckett was evacuated to recover from his wounds . On 5 December , Captain John P. Vann assumed command of the company , and Captain Bob <unk> , a veteran of Merrill 's Marauders , was also assigned to the unit . Yet with the company 's casualties being replaced by regular soldiers who had no Ranger training it did not return to full combat capability after the Hill 205 battle . The replacements were subsequently given cursory training between missions , but U.S. military historians contend that the inexperienced replacements dramatically decreased the usefulness of the company as a special forces unit . The company participated in a few isolated missions in late 1950 and early 1951 , including the recapture of Ganghwa Island from Chinese forces while attached to the Turkish Brigade . It advanced with the 25th Division during Operation Killer in late February as part of an effort to push Chinese forces north of the Han River . During that operation the company was employed as a scouting force , probing the strength of Chinese formations as they launched raids and attacks on the 25th Infantry Division . The frequent scouting missions were also intended to draw Chinese fire and determine the locations of their units . 
 Returning to action , the company 's 2nd Platoon effected a crossing of the Han River at 22 : 00 on 28 February 1951 for a raid on <unk> @-@ ri to destroy Chinese positions and capture a prisoner . Despite difficulties crossing the icy river the platoon moved into the village after 23 : 00 , finding it deserted . After probing 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north and finding no Chinese , the Rangers returned to UN lines . On 1 March , 1st Platoon conducted a follow @-@ up mission to scout railroad tunnels north of the village but had to turn back as heavy ice blocked its boats from crossing , and several men fell into the freezing water . During the first days of March , the company stepped up its patrols across the Han River , this time with a renewed emphasis on determining the locations of Chinese forces and pinpointing their strongpoints , in preparation for the next major offensive . 
 = = = Operation Ripper = = = 
 Vann was replaced by Captain Charles G. Ross on 5 March 1951 . At the same time , the UN began Operation Ripper to drive the Chinese north of the 38th Parallel . As the 25th Infantry Division attacked forward , the Eighth Army Ranger Company scouted 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) ahead of the general attack , reconnoitering Chinese positions . For much of the month they were utilized as a flank security force for the 25th Infantry Division , holding successive blocking positions as elements of the division advanced . On 18 March , they were sent a further 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of the front lines to set up an ambush at a road and railway line which ran through a defile . Chinese troops were retreating through this defile , and at 15 : 30 on 19 March Ross assembled the men nearby . Through the night they established roadblocks and prepared to attack oncoming Chinese troops , but none passed through the area , and Ross took the company back to UN lines at 05 : 00 . 
 The company 's final mission came on 27 March , an infiltration 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north to <unk> @-@ ri to reconnoiter the size of a Chinese force holding there and to prevent it from setting a rearguard . The 25th Infantry Division would then attack and overwhelm the Chinese concentration more easily . The Rangers began their advance at 22 : 00 and arrived at the village at 01 : 00 . Ross then ordered 2nd Platoon to conduct a stealth attack into the village which destroyed an outpost and a food cache and caught the Chinese troops by surprise . The Rangers temporarily succeeded in pushing the sizable Chinese force out of the village and into a trench , inflicting heavy casualties on it in the process . The Chinese , estimated to be a battalion , subsequently attempted to counterattack but were repulsed by the Rangers . Following this , Ross ordered the company to withdraw back to UN lines , arriving there at 05 : 00 having suffered no casualties in the action . 
 The Eighth Army Ranger Company was deactivated on 31 March 1951 . Some of its equipment was subsequently consolidated with the 5th Ranger Infantry Company , which was newly arrived in Korea and had been assigned to the 25th Infantry Division . The men of the new Ranger company had formally attended Ranger School , though they were inexperienced and less effective in their initial actions with the division . In the meantime , most of the men of the former Eighth Army Ranger Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division , while those who were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other Ranger companies then beginning to arrive in Korea . During its brief existence , the Eighth Army Ranger Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation .

 In September 1950 , on Collins ' orders the Ranger Training Center was moved to Fort Benning , Georgia , and in October the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and 4th Ranger Companies began training . The effective employment of the Eighth Army Ranger Company had demonstrated the viability of the concept to Army planners , and the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units . As a result , the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form . Altogether , another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951 , and six of them would see combat in Korea . 
 Subsequent military science studies of the use of Rangers during the Korean War have focused on analysing their economy of force by looking at how well the U.S. military employed them as special forces . In an analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War , Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that they were misused and ineffective in general , and that in particular the Eighth Army Ranger Company had been poorly employed . Chae noted that the Ranger formations ' lack of support personnel made them a logistic and administrative liability , as they had to be attached to conventional units for support . Furthermore , he argued that the Rangers ' small formation sizes meant that they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers , and their employment with divisional elements did not provide them with the intelligence information necessary for effective infiltration operations . He concluded that these problems were due to a " lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities , limitations inherent in Rangers ' force structure , and basic distrust of elite forces . " 
 However , retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor , a military historian , contended in his 1996 book that in spite of their original purpose of short range infiltration , the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed well for the missions they conducted , most of which were reactionary and borne out of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks . Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions , the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force , a skill that the rest of the U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in . Taylor also believed that the Rangers , who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan , effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed , allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere . Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers , and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company . 
 = Abbas Kiarostami = 
 Abbas Kiarostami ( Persian : <unk> <unk> pronunciation ; 22 June 1940 – 4 July 2016 ) was an Iranian film director , screenwriter , photographer and film producer . An active film @-@ maker from 1970 , Kiarostami had been involved in over forty films , including shorts and documentaries . Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy ( 1987 – 94 ) , Close @-@ Up ( 1990 ) , Taste of Cherry ( 1997 ) – which was awarded the Palme d 'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year – and The Wind Will Carry Us ( 1999 ) . In his later works , Certified Copy ( 2010 ) and Like Someone in Love ( 2012 ) , he filmed for the first time outside Iran : in Italy and Japan , respectively . 
 Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter , film editor , art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material . He was also a poet , photographer , painter , illustrator , and graphic designer . He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave , a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Masoud <unk> , Sohrab Shahid <unk> , Dariush Mehrjui , Bahram <unk> , Nasser <unk> and Parviz <unk> . These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues . 
 Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists , for documentary @-@ style narrative films , for stories that take place in rural villages , and for conversations that unfold inside cars , using stationary mounted cameras . He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue , titles , and themes of his films . Kiarostami 's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity , an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity , and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements . The concepts of change and continuity , in addition to the themes of life and death , play a major role in Kiarostami 's works . 
 = = Early life and background = = 
 Kiarostami was born in Tehran . His first artistic experience was painting , which he continued into his late teens , winning a painting competition at the age of 18 shortly before he left home to study at the University of Tehran School of Fine Arts . He majored in painting and graphic design , and supported his studies by working as a traffic policeman . 
 As a painter , designer , and illustrator , Kiarostami worked in advertising in the 1960s , designing posters and creating commercials . Between 1962 and 1966 , he shot around 150 advertisements for Iranian television . In the late 1960s , he began creating credit titles for films ( including <unk> by Masoud <unk> ) and illustrating children 's books .

 = = = 1970s = = = 
 In 1969 , when the Iranian New Wave began with Dariush Mehrjui 's film <unk> , Kiarostami helped set up a filmmaking department at the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults ( Kanun ) in Tehran . Its debut production and Kiarostami 's first film was the twelve @-@ minute The Bread and Alley ( 1970 ) , a neo @-@ realistic short film about a schoolboy 's confrontation with an aggressive dog . Breaktime followed in 1972 . The department became one of Iran 's most noted film studios , producing not only Kiarostami 's films , but acclaimed Persian films such as The Runner and <unk> , the Little Stranger . 
 In the 1970s , Kiarostami pursued an individualistic style of film making . When discussing his first film , he stated : 
 Bread and Alley was my first experience in cinema and I must say a very difficult one . I had to work with a very young child , a dog , and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer , who was nagging and complaining all the time . Well , the cinematographer , in a sense , was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to . 
 Following The Experience ( 1973 ) , Kiarostami released The Traveler ( <unk> ) in 1974 . The Traveler tells the story of <unk> <unk> , a troubled and troublesome boy from a small Iranian city . Intent on attending a football match in far @-@ off Tehran , he scams his friends and neighbors to raise money , and journeys to the stadium in time for the game , only to meet with an ironic twist of fate . In addressing the boy 's determination to reach his goal , alongside his indifference to the effects of his amoral actions , the film examined human behavior and the balance of right and wrong . It furthered Kiarostami 's reputation for realism , diegetic simplicity , and stylistic complexity , as well as his fascination with physical and spiritual journeys . 
 In 1975 , Kiarostami directed two short films So Can I and Two Solutions for One Problem . In early 1976 , he released Colors , followed by the fifty @-@ four @-@ minute film A Wedding Suit , a story about three teenagers coming into conflict over a suit for a wedding . 
 Kiarostami 's first feature film was the 112 @-@ minute Report ( 1977 ) . It revolved around the life of a tax collector accused of accepting bribes ; suicide was among its themes . In 1979 , he produced and directed First Case , Second Case . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 In the early 1980s , Kiarostami directed several short films including <unk> ( 1980 ) , Orderly or Disorderly ( 1981 ) , and The Chorus ( 1982 ) . In 1983 , he directed Fellow Citizen . It was not until his release of Where Is the Friend 's Home ? that he began to gain recognition outside Iran . 
 The film tells a simple account of a conscientious eight @-@ year @-@ old schoolboy 's quest to return his friend 's notebook in a neighboring village lest his friend be expelled from school . The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are portrayed . The film has been noted for its poetic use of the Iranian rural landscape and its realism , both important elements of Kiarostami 's work . Kiarostami made the film from a child 's point of view . 
 Where Is the Friend 's Home ? , And Life Goes On ( 1992 ) ( also known as Life and Nothing More ) , and Through the Olive Trees ( 1994 ) are described by critics as the Koker trilogy , because all three films feature the village of Koker in northern Iran . The films also relate to the 1990 Manjil – Rudbar earthquake , in which 40 @,@ 000 people died . Kiarostami uses the themes of life , death , change , and continuity to connect the films . The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the Netherlands , Sweden , Germany and Finland . But , Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy . He suggested that the last two titles plus Taste of Cherry ( 1997 ) comprise a trilogy , given their common theme of the preciousness of life . In 1987 , Kiarostami was involved in the screenwriting of The Key , which he edited but did not direct . In 1989 , he released Homework . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 Kiarostami 's first film of the decade was Close @-@ Up ( 1990 ) , which narrates the story of the real @-@ life trial of a man who impersonated film @-@ maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf , conning a family into believing they would star in his new film . The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade , but the impersonator , Hossein <unk> , argues that his motives were more complex . The part @-@ documentary , part @-@ staged film examines <unk> 's moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf 's identity , questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair . Ranked # 42 in British Film Institute 's The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time , Close @-@ Up received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino , Martin Scorsese , Werner Herzog , Jean @-@ Luc Godard , and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe . 
 In 1992 , Kiarostami directed Life , and Nothing More ... , regarded by critics as the second film of the Koker trilogy . The film follows a father and his young son as they drive from Tehran to Koker in search of two young boys who they fear might have perished in the 1990 earthquake . As the father and son travel through the devastated landscape , they meet earthquake survivors forced to carry on with their lives amid disaster . That year Kiarostami won a Prix Roberto Rossellini , the first professional film award of his career , for his direction of the film . The last film of the so @-@ called Koker trilogy was Through the Olive Trees ( 1994 ) , which expands a peripheral scene from Life and Nothing More into the central drama . Critics such as Adrian Martin have called the style of filmmaking in the Koker trilogy as " <unk> " , linking the zig @-@ zagging patterns in the landscape and the geometry of forces of life and the world . A flashback of the zigzag path in Life and Nothing More ... ( 1992 ) in turn triggers the spectator 's memory of the previous film , Where Is the Friend 's Home ? from 1987 , shot before the earthquake . This symbolically links to the post @-@ earthquake reconstruction in Through the Olive Trees in 1994 . In 1995 , Miramax Films released Through the Olive Trees in the US theaters . 
 Kiarostami next wrote the screenplays for The Journey and The White Balloon ( 1995 ) , for his former assistant Jafar <unk> . Between 1995 and 1996 , he was involved in the production of Lumière and Company , a collaboration with 40 other film directors . 
 Kiarostami won the Palme d 'Or ( Golden Palm ) award at the Cannes Film Festival for Taste of Cherry . It is the drama of a man , Mr. Badii , determined to commit suicide . The film involved themes such as morality , the legitimacy of the act of suicide , and the meaning of compassion . 
 Kiarostami directed The Wind Will Carry Us in 1999 , which won the Grand Jury Prize ( Silver Lion ) at the Venice International Film Festival . The film contrasted rural and urban views on the dignity of labor , addressing themes of gender equality and the benefits of progress , by means of a stranger 's sojourn in a remote Kurdish village . An unusual feature of the movie is that many of the characters are heard but not seen ; at least thirteen to fourteen speaking characters in the film are never seen . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 In 2000 , at the San Francisco Film Festival award ceremony , Kiarostami was awarded the Akira Kurosawa Prize for lifetime achievement in directing , but surprised everyone by giving it away to veteran Iranian actor <unk> <unk> for his contribution to Iranian cinema . 
 In 2001 , Kiarostami and his assistant , <unk> <unk> , traveled to Kampala , Uganda at the request of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development , to film a documentary about programs assisting Ugandan orphans . He stayed for ten days and made ABC Africa . The trip was originally intended as a research in preparation for the filming , but Kiarostami ended up editing the entire film from the video footage shot there . The high number of orphans in Uganda has resulted from the deaths of parents in the AIDS epidemic . 
 Time Out editor and National Film Theatre chief programmer , Geoff Andrew , said in referring to the film : " Like his previous four features , this film is not about death but life @-@ and @-@ death : how they 're linked , and what attitude we might adopt with regard to their symbiotic inevitability . " 
 The following year , Kiarostami directed Ten , revealing an unusual method of filmmaking and abandoning many scriptwriting conventions . Kiarostami focused on the socio @-@ political landscape of Iran . The images are seen through the eyes of one woman as she drives through the streets of Tehran over a period of several days . Her journey is composed of ten conversations with various passengers , which include her sister , a hitchhiking prostitute , and a jilted bride and her demanding young son . This style of filmmaking was praised by a number of critics . 
 A. O. Scott in The New York Times wrote that Kiarostami , " in addition to being perhaps the most internationally admired Iranian filmmaker of the past decade , is also among the world masters of automotive cinema ... He understands the automobile as a place of reflection , observation and , above all , talk . " 
 In 2003 , Kiarostami directed Five , a poetic feature with no dialogue or characterization . It consists of five long shots of nature which are single @-@ take sequences , shot with a hand @-@ held DV camera , along the shores of the Caspian Sea . Although the film lacks a clear storyline , Geoff Andrew argues that the film is " more than just pretty pictures " . He adds , " Assembled in order , they comprise a kind of abstract or emotional narrative arc , which moves evocatively from separation and solitude to community , from motion to rest , near @-@ silence to sound and song , light to darkness and back to light again , ending on a note of rebirth and regeneration . " He notes the degree of artifice concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery . 
 Kiarostami produced 10 on Ten ( 2004 ) , a journal documentary that shares ten lessons on movie @-@ making while he drives through the locations of his past films . The movie is shot on digital video with a stationary camera mounted inside the car , in a manner reminiscent of Taste of Cherry and Ten . In 2005 and 2006 , he directed The Roads of Kiarostami , a 32 @-@ minute documentary that reflects on the power of landscape , combining austere black @-@ and @-@ white photographs with poetic observations , engaging music with political subject matter . Also in 2005 , Kiarostami contributed the central section to Tickets , a portmanteau film set on a train traveling through Italy . The other segments were directed by Ken Loach and Ermanno <unk> . 
 In 2008 , Kiarostami directed the feature Shirin , which features close @-@ ups of many notable Iranian actresses and the French actress Juliette Binoche as they watch a film based on a partly mythological Persian romance tale of Khosrow and Shirin , with themes of female self @-@ sacrifice . The film has been described as " a compelling exploration of the relationship between image , sound and female spectatorship . " 
 That summer , he directed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's opera Così fan tutte conducted by Christophe Rousset at Festival d 'Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence starring with William <unk> . But the following year 's performances at the English National Opera was impossible to direct because of refusal of permission to travel abroad from his country .

 Certified Copy ( 2010 ) , again starring Juliette Binoche , was made in Tuscany and was Kiarostami 's first film to be shot and produced outside Iran . The story of an encounter between a British man and a French woman , it was entered in competition for the Palme d 'Or in the 2010 Cannes Film Festival . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian describes the film as an " intriguing oddity " , and said , " Certified Copy is the deconstructed portrait of a marriage , acted with well @-@ intentioned fervour by Juliette Binoche , but persistently baffling , contrived , and often simply bizarre – a highbrow misfire of the most peculiar sort . " He concluded that the film is " unmistakably an example of Kiarostami 's compositional technique , though not a successful example . " Roger Ebert , however , praised the film , noting that " Kiarostami is rather brilliant in the way he creates offscreen spaces . " Binoche won the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance in the film . Kiarostami 's final film , Like Someone in Love , set and shot in Japan , received mostly positive reviews by critics .

 Kiarostami was a jury member at numerous film festivals , most notably the Cannes Film Festival in 1993 , 2002 and 2005 . He was also the president of the Caméra d 'Or Jury in Cannes Film Festival 2005 . He was announced as the president of the <unk> and short film sections of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival . 
 Other representatives include the Venice Film Festival in 1985 , the Locarno International Film Festival in 1990 , the San Sebastian International Film Festival in 1996 , the São Paulo International Film Festival in 2004 , the <unk> Cinema Festival in 2007 ( in which he was president of the jury ) , and the <unk> Film and Music Festival in 2011 . He also made regular appearances at many other film festivals across Europe , including the Estoril Film Festival in Portugal .

 Though Kiarostami has been compared to Satyajit Ray , Vittorio de Sica , Éric Rohmer , and Jacques Tati , his films exhibit a singular style , often employing techniques of his own invention . 
 During the filming of The Bread and Alley in 1970 , Kiarostami had major differences with his experienced cinematographer about how to film the boy and the attacking dog . While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching , a close @-@ up of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door , followed by a shot of the dog , Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation . That one shot took around forty days to complete , until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene . Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film 's structure , preferring to let the scene flow as one . 
 Unlike other directors , Kiarostami showed no interest in staging extravagant combat scenes or complicated chase scenes in large @-@ scale productions , instead attempting to mold the medium of film to his own specifications . Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style with the Koker trilogy , which included a myriad of references to his own film material , connecting common themes and subject matter between each of the films . Stephen Bransford has contended that Kiarostami 's films do not contain references to the work of other directors , but are fashioned in such a manner that they are self @-@ referenced . Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic with one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film . 
 He continued experimenting with new modes of filming , using different directorial methods and techniques . A case in point is Ten , which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present . He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do , and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran . The camera was allowed to roll , capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine , using a series of extreme @-@ close shots . Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director . This new direction towards a digital micro @-@ cinema is defined as a micro @-@ budget filmmaking practice , allied with a digital production basis . 
 Kiarostami 's cinema offers a different definition of film . According to film professors such as <unk> Akrami of William Paterson University , Kiarostami consistently tried to redefine film by forcing the increased involvement of the audience . In his later years , he also progressively trimmed the timespan within his films . Akrami thinks that this reduces the filmmaking from a collective endeavor to a purer , more basic form of artistic expression . 
 = = = Fiction and non @-@ fiction = = = 
 Kiarostami 's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity , an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity , and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements ( docufiction ) . Kiarostami has stated , " We can never get close to the truth except through lying . " 
 The boundary between fiction and non @-@ fiction is significantly reduced in Kiarostami 's cinema . The French philosopher Jean @-@ Luc Nancy , writing about Kiarostami , and in particular Life and Nothing More ... , has argued that his films are neither quite fiction nor quite documentary . Life and Nothing More ... , he argues , is neither representation nor reportage , but rather " evidence " : 
 [ I ] t all looks like reporting , but everything underscores ( <unk> à l <unk> ) that it is the fiction of a documentary ( in fact , Kiarostami shot the film several months after the earthquake ) , and that it is rather a document about " fiction " : not in the sense of imagining the unreal , but in the very specific and precise sense of the technique , of the art of constructing images . For the image by means of which , each time , each opens a world and precedes himself in it ( s 'y <unk> ) is not <unk> ( <unk> toute faite ) ( as are those of dreams , phantasms or bad films ) : it is to be invented , cut and edited . Thus it is evidence , insofar as , if one day I happen to look at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day , I construct for an instant a new evidence of my street . 
 For Jean @-@ Luc Nancy , this notion of cinema as " evidence " , rather than as documentary or imagination , is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life @-@ and @-@ death ( cf. the remark by Geoff Andrew on ABC Africa , cited above , to the effect that Kiarostami 's films are not about death but about life @-@ and @-@ death ) : 
 Existence resists the indifference of life @-@ and @-@ death , it lives beyond mechanical " life , " it is always its own mourning , and its own joy . It becomes figure , image . It does not become alienated in images , but it is presented there : the images are the evidence of its existence , the objectivity of its assertion . This thought — which , for me , is the very thought of this film [ Life and Nothing More ... ] — is a difficult thought , perhaps the most difficult . It 's a slow thought , always under way , fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought . It is that which frays images so that images become this thought , so that they become the evidence of this thought — and not in order to " represent " it . 
 In other words , wanting to accomplish more than just represent life and death as opposing forces , but rather to illustrate the way in which each element of nature is inextricably linked , Kiarostami devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the <unk> " facts , " but neither is it simply a matter of artifice . Because " existence " means more than simply life , it is projective , containing an irreducibly fictive element , but in this " being more than " life , it is therefore contaminated by mortality . Nancy is giving a clue , in other words , toward the interpretation of Kiarostami 's statement that lying is the only way to truth . 
 = = = Themes of life and death = = = 
 The concepts of change and continuity , in addition to the themes of life and death , play a major role in Kiarostami 's works . In the Koker trilogy , these themes play a central role . As illustrated in the aftermath of the 1990 Tehran earthquake disaster , they also represent the power of human resilience to overcome and defy destruction . 
 Unlike the Koker films , which convey an instinctual thirst for survival , Taste of Cherry explores the fragility of life and focuses on how precious it is . 
 Symbols of death abound in The Wind Will Carry Us , with the scenery of the graveyard , the imminence of the old woman 's passing , and the ancestors referred to early in the film by the character Farzad . Such devices prompt the viewer to reflect on the parameters of the afterlife and immaterial existence . The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul , and what happens to it after death . In discussing the film , Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions , rather than answers them . 
 Some film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami 's film grammar , such as in Taste of Cherry and The Wind Will Carry Us , suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities , and death as a factual moment of anyone 's life . 
 = = = Visual and audio techniques = = = 
 Kiarostami 's style is notable for the use of panoramic long shots , such as in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees , where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters in order to stimulate reflection on their fate . Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind , including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii 's car moving across the hills , usually while he is conversing with a passenger . However , the visual distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the sound of the dialog , which always remains in the foreground . Like the coexistence of a private and public space , or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows , this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments . 
 This relationship between distance and intimacy , between imagery and sound , is also present in the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us . Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence , through using such techniques , and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed . Kiarostami 's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and / or audible , which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking of time and space in the modern world of telecommunications . 
 Other commentators such as film critic Ben Zipper believe that Kiarostami 's work as a landscape artist is evident in his compositional distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films directly impacting on his construction on the rural landscapes within his films . 
 = = = Poetry and imagery = = = 
 Ahmad Karimi @-@ Hakkak , of the University of Maryland , argues that one aspect of Kiarostami 's cinematic style is that he is able to capture the essence of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films . In several of his movies such as Where is the Friend 's Home and The Wind Will Carry Us , classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film , highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them . This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present , between continuity and change . 
 The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayyám or modern Persian poets such as Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad . One scene in The Wind Will Carry Us has a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor , accompanied by the filmmaker , is riding his scooter in a twisting road . In response to the comment that the other world is a better place than this one , the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam : 
 However , the aesthetic element involved with the poetry goes much farther back in time and is used more subtly than these examples suggest . Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film , Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image @-@ making techniques in Persian poetry , both classical and modern . This prominently results in enunciating a larger philosophical position , namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film . 
 It has been argued that the creative merit of Kiarostami 's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad 's poems extends the domain of textual transformation . Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior to a new text . Sima <unk> of the University of Washington contends that Kiarostami 's adaptation arrives at the theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter @-@ textual potential to trans @-@ generic potential . 
 = = = Spirituality = = = 
 Kiarostami 's films often reflect upon immaterial concepts such as soul and afterlife . At times , however , the very concept of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium . Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality . The limits of the frame , the material representation of a space in dialog with another that is not represented , physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those which may exist apart from it . By limiting the space of the mise en scène , Kiarostami expands the space of the art . 
 Kiarostami 's " complex " sound @-@ images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with " mystical " filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson . While acknowledging substantial cultural differences , much of Western critical writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors , by virtue of a similarly austere , " spiritual " poetics and moral commitment . Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami 's films with that of Sufi concepts . 
 While most English @-@ language writers , such as David Sterritt and the Spanish film professor Alberto Elena , interpret Kiarostami 's films as spiritual , other critics , including David Walsh and Hamish Ford , have not rated its influence in his films as lower . 
 = = Poetry , art and photography = = 
 Kiarostami , along with Jean Cocteau , Satyajit Ray , Derek Jarman , Alejandro Jodorowsky , and Gulzar , was a filmmaker who expressed himself in other genres , such as poetry , set designs , painting , or photography . They expressed their interpretation of the world and their understanding of our preoccupations and identities . 
 Kiarostami was a noted photographer and poet . A bilingual collection of more than 200 of his poems , Walking with the Wind , was published by Harvard University Press . His photographic work includes Untitled Photographs , a collection of over thirty photographs , mostly of snow landscapes , taken in his hometown Tehran , between 1978 and 2003 . In 1999 , He also published a collection of his poems . Kiarostami also produced Mozart 's opera , Così fan tutte , which premiered in Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence in 2003 before being performed at the English National Opera in London in 2004 . 
 Riccardo Zipoli , from the Ca ' Foscari University of Venice , has studied the relations and interconnections between Kiarostami 's poems and his films . The results of the analysis reveal how Kiarostami 's treatment of " uncertain reality " is similar in his poems and films . Kiarostami 's poetry is reminiscent of the later nature poems of the Persian painter @-@ poet , Sohrab Sepehri . On the other hand , the succinct allusion to philosophical truths without the need for deliberation , the non @-@ judgmental tone of the poetic voice , and the structure of the poem — absence of personal pronouns , adverbs or over reliance on adjectives — as well as the lines containing a kigo ( <unk> , a " season word " ) gives much of this poetry a <unk> characteristic . 
 All of the original poetry books by Kiarostami alongside his selections from Persian classic and contemporary poets including Nima , Hafez , Rumi and Saadi were translated into English by Iman Tavassoly and Paul Cronin in 2015 and were published as bilingual ( Persian / English ) editions in New York City . Kiarostami has two other poetry books which are anthologies entitled Night with his selections from a variety of classical and contemporary Persian poets on the topic of Night which were translated into English as well . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1969 , Kiarostami married Parvin Amir @-@ <unk> . They had two sons , Ahmad ( born 1971 ) and Bahman ( 1978 ) . They divorced in 1982 . 
 Kiarostami was one of the few directors who remained in Iran after the 1979 revolution , when many of his peers fled the country . He believes that it was one of the most important decisions of his career . His permanent base in Iran and his national identity have consolidated his ability as a filmmaker : 
 When you take a tree that is rooted in the ground , and transfer it from one place to another , the tree will no longer bear fruit . And if it does , the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place . This is a rule of nature . I think if I had left my country , I would be the same as the tree . 
 Kiarostami frequently wore dark spectacles or sunglasses , which he required because of a sensitivity to light . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 In March 2016 , Kiarostami was hospitalized due to intestinal bleeding and reportedly went into a coma after undergoing two operations . Sources , including a Ministry of Health and Medical Education spokesman , reported that Kiarostami was suffering from gastrointestinal cancer . On 3 April 2016 , Reza <unk> , the director of Kiarostami 's medical team , made a statement denying that the filmmaker had cancer . However , in late June he left Iran for treatment in a Paris hospital , where he died on 4 July . Just last week before his death , Kiarostami had been invited to join the Academy Awards in Hollywood as part of efforts to increase the diversity of its OSCAR judges . Ali <unk> , Iran 's ambassador to France stated that Kiarostami 's body will be transferred to Iran to be buried at <unk> @-@ e Zahra cemetery . However , it was later announced that his body will be buried in <unk> , a resort town about 40 kilometers northeast of Tehran , based on his own will , after it is flown back to Tehran from Paris . His body was returned to Tehran 's Imam Khomeini International Airport on 8 July , while a crowd of Iranian film directors , actors , actresses and other artists were in Tehran airport to pay their respects . 
 Mohammad Shirvani , a close friend to Kiarostami wrote in his Facebook account a quote from him on 8 June 2016 that he has criticized his medical team : " I do not believe I could stand and direct any more films . They destroyed that [ digestive system ] . " After this comment , a campaign was set by Iranians in twitter and Facebook to follows Kiarostami 's health and possible medical error in his treatment . However , Ahmad Kiarostami , elder son of Kiarostami denied any medical errors in his father 's treatment after Shirvani 's comment and said that his father 's health is not emergency . After Kiarostami 's death , Alireza Zali , Head of Kiarostami 's Medical Council Organization sent a letter to his French counterpart Patrick Bouet urged him to send the medical dossier of Kiarostami to Iran for more researches about possible medical error . He added evaluating the aspects of the death of the Iranian artist is considered as a grave concern of Iran 's Medical Council Organization . He said the Medical Council Organization had established an expert group for evaluating the medical dossier of Kiarostami in Iran . On 13 July 2016 , and nine days after Kiarostami 's death , his family officially complained from Kiarostami 's personal doctor for mistake in his treatment . Dariush Mehrjui , famous Iranian cinema director also criticized Kiarostami 's medical team and demanded them for a trial .

 Martin Scorsese said he was " deeply shocked and saddened " by the news . Oscar @-@ winning Iranian film @-@ maker Asghar Farhadi – who had been due to fly to Paris to visit his friend – said he was " very sad , in total shock " . Mohsen Makhmalbaf echoed the sentiment , saying Iran 's cinema owes its global reputation to his fellow director , but that this visibility did not translate into a greater visibility for his work in his homeland . " Kiarostami gave the Iranian cinema the international credibility that it has today , " he told The Guardian . " But his films were unfortunately not seen as much in Iran . He changed the world 's cinema ; he freshened it and humanised it in contrast with Hollywood 's rough version . " Persian mystic and poet Jalal al @-@ Din Rumi 's 22nd niece <unk> Celebi also expressed her condolences over the demise of Kiarostami in a separate message . Iran 's representative office at the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , UNESCO also opened a memorial book for signature to honour <unk> . 
 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter that the director 's " different and profound attitude towards life and his invitation to peace and friendship " would be a " lasting achievement . " Foreign Minister Mohammad @-@ Javad Zarif also said Kiarostami 's death was a loss for international cinema . In a statement , French President François Hollande praised the director for forging " close artistic ties and deep friendships " with France . 
 <unk> , such as The New York Times , CNN , The Guardian , The Huffington Post , The Independent , Associated Press , <unk> and Le Monde also reacted to Kiarostami 's death . The New York Times wrote : " Abbas Kiarostami , Acclaimed Iranian Filmmaker , Dies at 76 " and Peter Bradshaw <unk> tribute to Kiarostami : " a sophisticated , self @-@ possessed master of cinematic poetry " 
 The crowd that had gathered for this service in Paris held a vigil by the River Seine . They then allowed the Seine waves to take photos of Kiarostami that the crowd had left on the river floating . It was symbolic moment of saying goodbye to a film director that many Iranians have come to passionately appreciate .

 Artists , cultural authorities , government officials and the Iranian people gathered to say goodbye to Kiarostami on 10 July , in an emotional funeral , six days after his passing in France .

Attendees held banners with the titles of his movies and pictures of his most famous posters , as they praised the support Kiarostami contribution to culture , and particularly , to filmmaking in Iran .

 = = Reception and criticism = = 
 Kiarostami has received worldwide acclaim for his work from both audiences and critics , and , in 1999 , he was voted the most important film director of the 1990s by two international critics ' polls . Four of his films were placed in the top six of Cinematheque Ontario 's Best of the ' 90s poll . He has gained recognition from film theorists , critics , as well as peers such as Jean @-@ Luc Godard , Nanni Moretti ( who made a short film about opening one of Kiarostami 's films in his theater in Rome ) , Chris Marker , and Ray Carney . Akira Kurosawa said of Kiarostami 's films : " Words cannot describe my feelings about them ... When Satyajit Ray passed on , I was very depressed . But after seeing Kiarostami 's films , I thanked God for giving us just the right person to take his place . " Critically acclaimed directors such as Martin Scorsese have commented that " Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema . " The Austrian director Michael Haneke has admired the work of Abbas Kiarostami as among the best of any living director . In 2006 , The Guardian 's panel of critics ranked Kiarostami as the best contemporary non @-@ American film director . 
 Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum have argued that " there 's no getting around the fact that the movies of Abbas Kiarostami divide audiences — in this country , in his native Iran , and everywhere else they 're shown . " Rosenbaum argues that disagreements and controversy over Kiarostami 's movies have arisen from his style of film @-@ making because what in Hollywood would count as essential narrative information is frequently missing from Kiarostami 's films . Camera placement , likewise , often defies standard audience expectations : in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees , the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes . In Homework and Close @-@ Up , parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced . Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami 's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis . 
 While Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films , the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his <unk> he responded , " The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years ... I think they don 't understand my films and so prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don 't want to get out " . 
 In the wake of the September 11 attacks , Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival . The festival director , Richard Peña , who had invited him said , " It 's a terrible sign of what 's happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world " . The Finnish film director Aki Kaurismäki boycotted the festival in protest . Kiarostami had been invited by the New York Film Festival , as well as Ohio University and Harvard University . 
 In 2005 , London Film School organized a workshop as well as festival of Kiarostami 's work , titled " Abbas Kiarostami : Visions of the Artist " . Ben Gibson , Director of the London Film School , said , " Very few people have the creative and intellectual clarity to invent cinema from its most basic elements , from the ground up . We are very lucky to have the chance to see a master like Kiarostami thinking on his feet . " 
 In 2007 , the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 <unk> a festival of the Kiarostami 's work titled Abbas Kiarostami : Image Maker . 
 Kiarostami and his cinematic style have been the subject of several books and two films , Opening Day of Close @-@ Up ( 1996 ) , directed by Nanni Moretti and Abbas Kiarostami : The Art of Living ( 2003 ) , directed by Fergus Daly . 
 Kiarostami was a member of the advisory board of World Cinema Foundation . Founded by the director Martin Scorsese , its goal is to find and reconstruct world cinema films that have been long neglected .

 = British Empire = 
 The British Empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom . It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries . At its height , it was the largest empire in history and , for over a century , was the foremost global power . By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people , one @-@ fifth of the world 's population at the time , and covered more than 13 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq mi ( 33 @,@ 670 @,@ 000 km2 ) , almost a quarter of the Earth 's total land area . As a result , its political , legal , linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread . At the peak of its power , the phrase " the empire on which the sun never sets " was often used to describe the British Empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories . 
 During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe , and in the process established large overseas empires . <unk> of the great wealth these empires generated , England , France , and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia . A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England ( and then , following union between England and Scotland in 1707 , Great Britain ) the dominant colonial power in North America and India . 
 The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies . British attention soon turned towards Asia , Africa , and the Pacific . After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ( 1792 – 1815 ) , Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century ( with London the largest city in the world from about 1830 ) . Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica ( " British Peace " ) , a period of relative peace in Europe and the world ( 1815 – 1914 ) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman . In the early 19th century , the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain ; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the " workshop of the world " . The British Empire expanded to include India , large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world . Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies , British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions , such as Asia and Latin America . Domestically , political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez @-@ faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise . During this century , the population increased at a dramatic rate , accompanied by rapid urbanisation , causing significant social and economic stresses . To seek new markets and sources of raw materials , the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt , South Africa , and elsewhere . Canada , Australia , and New Zealand became self @-@ governing dominions . 
 By the start of the 20th century , Germany and the United States challenged Britain 's economic lead . Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War , during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire . The conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of Britain . Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I , Britain was no longer the world 's pre @-@ eminent industrial or military power . In the Second World War , Britain 's colonies in South @-@ East Asia were occupied by Imperial Japan . Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies , the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . India , Britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire . The transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire . Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty . After independence , many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations , a free association of independent states . The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations , a grouping known informally as the Commonwealth realms , that share one monarch — Queen Elizabeth II . 
 = = Origins ( 1497 – 1583 ) = = 
 The foundations of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms . In 1496 King Henry VII of England , following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration , commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic . Cabot sailed in 1497 , five years after the European discovery of America , and although he successfully made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland ( mistakenly believing , like Christopher Columbus , that he had reached Asia ) , there was no attempt to found a colony . Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was heard of his ships again . 
 No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , during the last decades of the 16th century . In the meantime the Protestant Reformation had turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies . In 1562 , the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave @-@ raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic trade system . This effort was rebuffed and later , as the Anglo @-@ Spanish Wars intensified , Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic , laden with treasure from the New World . At the same time , influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee ( who was the first to use the term " British Empire " ) were beginning to press for the establishment of England 's own empire . By this time , Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific ocean , Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and Brazil to China , and France had begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River area , later to become New France . 
 = = = Plantations of Ireland = = = 
 Although England trailed behind other European powers in establishing overseas colonies , it had been engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland , drawing on precedents dating back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 . Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also played a part in the early colonisation of North America , particularly a group known as the West Country men . 
 = = " First " British Empire ( 1583 – 1783 ) = = 
 In 1578 , Elizabeth I granted a patent to Humphrey Gilbert for discovery and overseas exploration . That year , Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America , but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic . In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt , on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England , although no settlers were left behind . Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England , and was succeeded by his half @-@ brother , Walter Raleigh , who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584 . Later that year , Raleigh founded the colony of Roanoke on the coast of present @-@ day North Carolina , but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail . 
 In 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , ascended ( as James I ) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the Treaty of London , ending hostilities with Spain . Now at peace with its main rival , English attention shifted from preying on other nations ' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies . The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century , with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean , and the establishment of private companies , most notably the English East India Company , to administer colonies and overseas trade . This period , until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century , has subsequently been referred to by some historians as the " First British Empire " . 
 = = = Americas , Africa and the slave trade = = = 
 The Caribbean initially provided England 's most important and lucrative colonies , but not before several attempts at colonisation failed . An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years , and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits . Colonies in St Lucia ( 1605 ) and Grenada ( 1609 ) also rapidly folded , but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts ( 1624 ) , Barbados ( 1627 ) and Nevis ( 1628 ) . The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil , which depended on slave labour , and — at first — Dutch ships , to sell the slaves and buy the sugar . To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands , Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies . This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces — a series of Anglo @-@ Dutch Wars — which would eventually strengthen England 's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch . In 1655 , England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish , and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas . 
 England 's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown , led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company . Bermuda was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the Virginia Company 's flagship , and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company . The Virginia Company 's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown , thereby founding the Colony of Virginia . The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland , but was largely unsuccessful . In 1620 , Plymouth was founded as a haven for puritan religious separatists , later known as the Pilgrims . Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would @-@ be colonists to risk the arduous trans @-@ Atlantic voyage : Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics ( 1634 ) , Rhode Island ( 1636 ) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut ( 1639 ) for Congregationalists . The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663 . With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664 , England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland , renaming it New York . This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo @-@ Dutch War , in exchange for Suriname . In 1681 , the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn . The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean , but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates . 
 In 1670 , Charles II incorporated by royal charter the Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) , granting it a monopoly on the fur trade in the area known as Rupert 's Land , which would later form a large proportion of the Dominion of Canada . Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French , who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France . 
 Two years later , the Royal African Company was inaugurated , receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean . From the outset , slavery was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies . Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 , Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3 @.@ 5 million African slaves to the Americas , a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic . To facilitate this trade , forts were established on the coast of West Africa , such as James Island , Accra and Bunce Island . In the British Caribbean , the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780 , and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period ( the majority in the southern colonies ) . For the slave traders , the trade was extremely profitable , and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool , which formed the third corner of the so @-@ called triangular trade with Africa and the Americas . For the transported , harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven . 
 In 1695 , the Scottish Parliament granted a charter to the Company of Scotland , which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of Panama . Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada , and afflicted by malaria , the colony was abandoned two years later . The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland — a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise — and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire . The episode also had major political consequences , persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries , rather than just crowns . This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union , establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain . 
 = = = Rivalry with the Netherlands in Asia = = = 
 At the end of the 16th century , England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal 's monopoly of trade with Asia , forming private joint @-@ stock companies to finance the voyages — the English , later British , East India Company and the Dutch East India Company , chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively . The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade , an effort focused mainly on two regions ; the East Indies archipelago , and an important hub in the trade network , India . There , they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other . Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power , in the short term the Netherlands ' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo @-@ Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia . Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne , bringing peace between the Netherlands and England . A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England , but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability , and by 1720 , in terms of sales , the British company had overtaken the Dutch . 
 = = = Global conflicts with France = = = 
 Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years ' War as allies , but the conflict — waged in Europe and overseas between France , Spain and the Anglo @-@ Dutch alliance — left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch , who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe . The 18th century saw England ( after 1707 , Britain ) rise to be the world 's dominant colonial power , and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage . 
 The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his <unk> of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou , a grandson of the King of France , raised the prospect of the unification of France , Spain and their respective colonies , an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe . In 1701 , England , Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession , which lasted until 1714 . 
 At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht , Philip renounced his and his descendants ' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe . The British Empire was territorially enlarged : from France , Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia , and from Spain , Gibraltar and Minorca . Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean . Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative <unk> ( permission to sell slaves in Spanish America ) to Britain . 
 During the middle decades of the 18th century , there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent , the Carnatic Wars , as the English East India Company ( the Company ) and its French counterpart , the Compagnie française des Indes <unk> , struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire . The Battle of Plassey in 1757 , in which the British , led by Robert Clive , defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies , left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India . France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states , ending French hopes of controlling India . In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control , either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army , the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys . 
 The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years ' War ( 1756 – 1763 ) involving France , Britain and the other major European powers . The signing of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) had important consequences for the future of the British Empire . In North America , France 's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert 's Land , and the ceding of New France to Britain ( leaving a sizeable French @-@ speaking population under British control ) and Louisiana to Spain . Spain ceded Florida to Britain . Along with its victory over France in India , the Seven Years ' War therefore left Britain as the world 's most powerful maritime power . 
 = = = Loss of the Thirteen American Colonies = = = 
 During the 1760s and early 1770s , relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained , primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament 's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent . This was summarised at the time by the slogan " No taxation without representation " , a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen . The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self @-@ government . In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule , leading to the outbreak of war in 1775 . The following year , in 1776 , the United States declared independence . The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans ' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781 , Britain began negotiating peace terms . American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in 1783 . 
 The loss of such a large portion of British America , at the time Britain 's most populous overseas possession , is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the " first " and " second " empires , in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia , the Pacific and later Africa . Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations , published in 1776 , had argued that colonies were redundant , and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion , dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal . The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith 's view that political control was not necessary for economic success . 
 Events in America influenced British policy in Canada , where between 40 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from America following independence . The 14 @,@ 000 Loyalists who went to the Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys , then part of Nova Scotia , felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax , so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784 . The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada ( mainly English @-@ speaking ) and Lower Canada ( mainly French @-@ speaking ) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities , and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain , with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution . 
 Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the Napoleonic Wars , as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy . The US declared war , the War of 1812 , and invaded Canadian territory as Britain invaded American territory , but the pre @-@ war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent , ensuring Canada 's future would be separate from that of the United States .

 = = = Exploration of the Pacific = = = 
 Since 1718 , transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various criminal offences in Britain , with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic . Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia . The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Jansz in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 . The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria , making its capital Melbourne the richest city in the world and the largest city after London in the British Empire . 
 During his voyage , Cook also visited New Zealand , first discovered by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642 , and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively . Initially , interaction between the indigenous Māori population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods . European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century , with numerous trading stations established , especially in the North . In 1839 , the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand . On 6 February 1840 , Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi . This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand 's founding document , but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute . 
 = = = War with Napoleonic France = = = 
 Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon , in a struggle that , unlike previous wars , represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations . It was not only Britain 's position on the world stage that was threatened : Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself , just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe . 
 The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win . French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy , which won a decisive victory over a Franco @-@ Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805 . Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied , including those of the Netherlands , which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810 . France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815 . Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties : France ceded the Ionian Islands , Malta ( which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively ) , Mauritius , St Lucia , and Tobago ; Spain ceded Trinidad ; the Netherlands Guyana , and the Cape Colony . Britain returned Guadeloupe , Martinique , French Guiana , and Réunion to France , and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands , while gaining control of Ceylon ( 1795 – 1815 ) . 
 = = = Abolition of slavery = = = 
 With support from the British abolitionist movement , Parliament enacted the Slave Trade Act in 1807 , which abolished the slave trade in the empire . In 1808 , Sierra Leone was designated an official British colony for freed slaves . The Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 ( with the exception of St. Helena , Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company , though these exclusions were later repealed ) . Under the Act , slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of 4 to 6 years of " apprenticeship " . 
 = = Britain 's imperial century ( 1815 – 1914 ) = = 
 Between 1815 and 1914 , a period referred to as Britain 's " imperial century " by some historians , around 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square miles ( 26 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km2 ) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire . Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival , other than Russia in central Asia . Unchallenged at sea , Britain adopted the role of global policeman , a state of affairs later known as the Pax Britannica , and a foreign policy of " splendid isolation " . Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies , Britain 's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries , such as China , Argentina and Siam , which has been characterised by some historians as " Informal Empire " . 
 British imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph , new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century , allowing it to control and defend the empire . By 1902 , the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables , the so @-@ called All Red Line . 
 = = = East India Company in Asia = = = 
 The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia . The Company 's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years ' War , and the two continued to co @-@ operate in arenas outside India : the eviction of Napoleon from Egypt ( 1799 ) , the capture of Java from the Netherlands ( 1811 ) , the acquisition of Singapore ( 1819 ) and Malacca ( 1824 ) and the defeat of Burma ( 1826 ) . 
 From its base in India , the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s . This trade , illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729 , helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea , which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China . In 1839 , the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20 @,@ 000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War , and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island , at that time a minor settlement . 
 During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company . A series of Acts of Parliament were passed , including the Regulating Act of 1773 , Pitt 's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company 's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired . The Company 's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion , a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys , Indian troops under British officers and discipline . The rebellion took six months to suppress , with heavy loss of life on both sides . The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858 , establishing the British Raj , where an appointed governor @-@ general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India . India became the empire 's most valuable possession , " the Jewel in the Crown " , and was the most important source of Britain 's strength . 
 A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died . The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule . Later , under direct British rule , commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies , which took until the early 1900s to have an effect . 
 = = = Rivalry with Russia = = = 
 During the 19th century , Britain and the Russian Empire vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining Ottoman Empire , Qajar dynasty and Qing Dynasty . This rivalry in Eurasia came to be known as the " Great Game " . As far as Britain was concerned , defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India . In 1839 , Britain moved to pre @-@ empt this by invading Afghanistan , but the First Anglo @-@ Afghan War was a disaster for Britain . 
 When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853 , fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities . The ensuing Crimean War ( 1854 – 56 ) , which involved new techniques of modern warfare , and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica , was a resounding defeat for Russia . The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades , with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing <unk> , Kazakhstan , and Turkmenistan . For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable , but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo @-@ Russian Entente . The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 also limited its threat to the British . 
 = = = Cape to Cairo = = = 
 The Dutch East India Company had founded the Cape Colony on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies . Britain formally acquired the colony , and its large Afrikaner ( or Boer ) population in 1806 , having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands , following the invasion of the Netherlands by France . British immigration began to rise after 1820 , and pushed thousands of Boers , resentful of British rule , northwards to found their own — mostly short @-@ lived — independent republics , during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s . In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British , who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and with several African polities , including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations . Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan : the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic ( 1852 – 77 ; 1881 – 1902 ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 – 1902 ) . In 1902 Britain occupied both republics , concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War ( 1899 – 1902 ) . 
 In 1869 the Suez Canal opened under Napoleon III , linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean . Initially the Canal was opposed by the British ; but once opened , its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the " jugular vein of the Empire " . In 1875 , the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma 'il Pasha 's 44 percent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £ 4 million ( £ 340 million in 2013 ) . Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway , it did give Britain leverage . Joint Anglo @-@ French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882 . The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position , but a compromise was reached with the 1888 Convention of Constantinople , which made the Canal officially neutral territory . 
 With French , Belgian and Portuguese activity in the lower Congo River region undermining orderly incursion of tropical Africa , the Berlin Conference of 1884 – 85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the " Scramble for Africa " by defining " effective occupation " as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims . The scramble continued into the 1890s , and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan . A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in 1896 , and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at <unk> in 1898 . Sudan was nominally made an Anglo @-@ Egyptian Condominium , but a British colony in reality . 
 British gains in southern and East Africa prompted Cecil Rhodes , pioneer of British expansion in Africa , to urge a " Cape to Cairo " railway linking the strategically important Suez Canal to the mineral @-@ rich South . During the 1880s and 1890s , Rhodes , with his privately owned British South Africa Company , occupied and annexed territories subsequently named after him , Rhodesia . 
 = = = Changing status of the white colonies = = = 
 The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 Durham Report , which proposed unification and self @-@ government for Upper and Lower Canada , as a solution to political unrest there . This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840 , which created the Province of Canada . Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848 , and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies . With the passage of the British North America Act , 1867 by the British Parliament , Upper and Lower Canada , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the Dominion of Canada , a confederation enjoying full self @-@ government with the exception of international relations . Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self @-@ government after 1900 , with the Australian colonies <unk> in 1901 . The term " dominion status " was officially introduced at the Colonial Conference of 1907 . 
 The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish home rule . Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852 . Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister , William Gladstone , who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada 's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire , but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament . Although the bill , if passed , would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation , many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break @-@ up of the empire . A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons . A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914 , but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising .

 By the turn of the 20th century , fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the metropole and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of " splendid isolation " . Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war . Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific and threatened at home by the Imperial German Navy , Britain formed an alliance with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies France and Russia in 1904 and 1907 , respectively . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 Britain 's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War . Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany 's overseas colonies in Africa . In the Pacific , Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively . Plans for a post @-@ war division of the Ottoman Empire , which had joined the war on Germany 's side , were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes – Picot Agreement . This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca , who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers , giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state . 
 The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions , which provided invaluable military , financial and material support . Over 2 @.@ 5 million men served in the armies of the Dominions , as well as many thousands of volunteers from the Crown colonies . The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home , and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right . The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on Anzac Day . Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light . The important contribution of the Dominions to the war effort was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an Imperial War Cabinet to co @-@ ordinate imperial policy . 
 Under the terms of the concluding Treaty of Versailles signed in 1919 , the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 square miles ( 4 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 km2 ) and 13 million new subjects . The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates . Britain gained control of Palestine , Transjordan , Iraq , parts of Cameroon and Togoland , and Tanganyika . The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own : the Union of South Africa gained South @-@ West Africa ( modern @-@ day Namibia ) , Australia gained New Guinea , and New Zealand Western Samoa . Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war period = = = 
 The changing world order that the war had brought about , in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers , and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland , caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy . Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan , Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States . This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the Great Depression , for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations . Although the issue of the empire 's security was a serious concern in Britain , at the same time the empire was vital to the British economy . 
 In 1919 , the frustrations caused by delays to Irish home rule led members of Sinn Féin , a pro @-@ independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the 1918 British general election , to establish an Irish assembly in Dublin , at which Irish independence was declared . The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration . The Anglo @-@ Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo @-@ Irish Treaty , creating the Irish Free State , a Dominion within the British Empire , with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown . Northern Ireland , consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act , immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom . 
 A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence . Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war @-@ time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts . This led to tension , particularly in the Punjab region , where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre . In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event , between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy , and those who viewed it with revulsion . The subsequent Non @-@ Co @-@ Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident , and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years . 
 In 1922 , Egypt , which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War , was granted formal independence , though it continued to be a British client state until 1954 . British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Treaty in 1936 , under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone . In return , Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations . Iraq , a British mandate since 1920 , also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932 . In Palestine , Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities . The 1917 Balfour Declaration , which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate , stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine , and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power . This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population , who openly revolted in 1936 . As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s , Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland , and shifted to a pro @-@ Arab stance , limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency . 
 The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy , independent of Britain , was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference . Britain 's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa , and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne . After pressure from Ireland and South Africa , the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration , declaring the Dominions to be " autonomous Communities within the British Empire , equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another " within a " British Commonwealth of Nations " . This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster . The parliaments of Canada , Australia , New Zealand , the Union of South Africa , the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control , they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent . Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933 , suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression . Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937 , making it a republic in all but name .
