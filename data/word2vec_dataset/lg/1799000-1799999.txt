 When Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) learns Pawnee is being sued by the previous owners of the lot where she is seeking to build a park , Ann ( Rashida Jones ) refers her to her lawyer friend Justin Anderson ( Justin Theroux ) , who she calls " the greatest guy ever " . Justin helps Leslie resolve the issue , and the two seem to get along very well together . Having recently broken up with her boyfriend , Leslie asks Ann to set her up on a date , but is surprised when Ann hesitates to set her up with Justin . Instead , she arranges a date with Chris ( Will Arnett ) an MRI technologist Ann works with . The date goes poorly , with Chris appearing annoyed upon learning Leslie attended a rival college , and that she was a director of regular parks , not amusement parks . 
 When Leslie said she has never received an MRI , Chris takes her to the hospital to receive one . Chris makes uncomfortable comments , remarking that Leslie has an excellent uterus ( " could easily have triplets right off the bat " ) and asking whether she is having her period , presumably in anticipation of sex later . Leslie rejects his advances when the date ends , prompting him to make an angry goodbye , even though Leslie still needs to give him a ride home . Meanwhile , Mark ( Paul Schneider ) grows suspicious that Ann harbors romantic feelings for Justin . He eventually confronts Ann and accuses her of trying to " save " Justin for a possible relationship in the future . Mark asks Ann 's ex @-@ boyfriend Andy ( Chris Pratt ) , who also recalls Ann 's infatuation with Justin . Andy scolds Ann for hurting Mark 's feelings , then tries to trick her into thinking she was still dating him , which does not work . Realizing her behavior was inappropriate , Ann sets Leslie up on a date with Justin . 
 Meanwhile , Ron ( Nick Offerman ) deals with complaints from local residents due to a new town policy requiring public officials to deal more directly to the public . Ron calls the policy " my hell " , and seeks a new assistant to protect him from the citizens .

 = Great Storm of 1975 = 
 The Great Storm of 1975 ( also known as the Super Bowl Blizzard , Minnesota 's Storm of the Century , or the Tornado Outbreak of January , 1975 ) was an intense storm system that impacted a large portion of the Central and Southeast United States from January 9 to January 12 , 1975 . The storm produced 45 tornadoes in the Southeast U.S. resulting in 12 fatalities , while later dropping over 2 feet ( 61 cm ) of snow and killing 58 people in the Midwest . This storm remains one of the worst blizzards to ever strike parts of the Midwest , as well as one of the largest January tornado outbreaks on record in the United States . 
 = = Meteorological synopsis = = 
 The storm originated over the Pacific Ocean and crashed into the Northwest Pacific coast with damaging gale @-@ force winds on January 8 , 1975 . By January 9 it had cleared the Rocky Mountains and began to redevelop and strengthen . At the same time , Arctic air was being drawn southward from Canada into the Great Plains , and large amounts of warm tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico were being pulled northward into much of the eastern U.S. The storm was a classic Panhandle Hook which moved from Colorado into Oklahoma before turning northward towards the Upper Midwest . It produced record low barometric pressure readings in the Midwest , with the pressure falling to an estimated 28 @.@ 38 in ( 961 mb ) just north of the Minnesota border in Canada .

 = = = Tornado summary event = = = 
 An unusual feature of this outbreak was that daytime heating , typically a key ingredient in the formation of tornadoes , had very little impact on their development . Rather , as the storm system pulled out into the central plains , strong thunderstorms and tornadoes quickly began to form despite the late hours . The first two tornadoes in the outbreak touched down after 10 : 00 p.m. CST on January 9 in Oklahoma and Louisiana . From there the progression of the twisters shifted eastward through the overnight and early morning hours , setting the stage for what would turn out to be a record setting day on January 10 . Texas saw five tornadoes between 1 : 30 a.m. – 3 : 30 a.m. , one tornado touched down in Arkansas at 6 : 00 a.m. , Louisiana saw seven tornadoes between 5 : 30 a.m. – 8 : 00 a.m. ( killing one person ) , Mississippi had five tornadoes between 8 : 15 a.m. – 10 : 00 a.m. ( killing nine ) , and Illinois and Indiana each experienced three lunch @-@ hour tornadoes . The tornadic line of storms then shifted into Alabama ( killing one ) and Florida during the afternoon and evening hours . 
 Mississippi and Alabama were the two states hardest hit by this outbreak . Alabama saw the most twisters of any state with 13 , but Mississippi saw the largest and deadliest tornado . An F4 tornado that tore through Pike , Lincoln , Lawrence , and Simpson Counties at 8 : 14 a.m. killed nine people and injured over 200 ; severely damaging 38 blocks in the town of McComb . The 39 tornadoes that touched down on January 10 marked the most active tornadic day in January in U.S. history at that time . The 52 tornadoes that touched down during January 1975 also set a U.S. record for the most tornadoes during that month . Both of these records were eventually broken in January of 1999 . 
 After a calm day on January 11 , four more tornadoes touched down in Florida and Georgia on January 12 , killing one person in Florida . By the time the outbreak was done it had produced 45 tornadoes , killed 12 people , injured 377 and caused $ 42 million in damages .

 As the storm system began to move northeastward out of Oklahoma , the cool air behind pulled down behind the system interacted with the moisture being pulled northward to produce snow over a large part of the Midwest . The snow began falling on Friday , January 10 and continued for the next two days . Snowfall of a foot ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) or more was common from Nebraska to Minnesota , with a high amount of 27 inches ( 69 cm ) in Riverton , Minnesota . The heaviest snow fell to the west of the low pressure center , which tracked from northeast Iowa through central Minnesota up to Lake Superior . Sustained winds of 30 – 50 mph ( 48 – 80 km / h ) with gusts from 70 – 90 mph ( 113 – 145 km / h ) produced snowdrifts up to 20 feet ( 6 m ) in some locations . Some roads were closed for up to 11 days . 
 Sioux Falls , South Dakota saw <unk> of below 1 ⁄ 4 mile ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) for 24 straight hours , and just east of Sioux Falls a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 610 m ) broadcast tower collapsed under the storm 's fury . In Willmar , Minnesota , 168 passengers were trapped in a stranded train for hours , unable to walk to shelter because of dangerously low wind chill values . In Omaha , Nebraska a foot ( 31 cm ) of snow fell , Sioux Falls saw 7 inches ( 18 cm ) , Duluth , Minnesota saw 8 inches ( 20 cm ) , and International Falls , Minnesota saw 24 inches ( 61 cm ) . 
 Record low pressures were recorded in communities in Nebraska , Minnesota , Illinois , and Wisconsin , with a low of 28 @.@ 55 in ( 966 @.@ 8 mb ) in Duluth , Minnesota . In all , approximately 58 people died from effects of the blizzard and over 100 @,@ 000 farm animals were lost .

 Poquita Ropa ( English : Few Clothes ) is the twelfth studio album by Guatemalan singer @-@ songwriter Ricardo Arjona . It was released on August 24 , 2010 through Warner Music . It was recorded in Mexico City , New York , and Los Angeles and was produced by Lee Levin and Dan Warner under their production name Los Gringo , with additional works from Matt Rollings and Brian Lang . 
 <unk> different in style from his previous albums , Poquita Ropa was produced using as few musical instruments as possible . Arjona 's goal was to produce the songs " almost as they were born " ; he achieved this by using nonexistent sounds to make the songs sound more acoustic . Arjona achieved a production style that made the songs sound like a capella performances , and he said that " music and women look better with little clothes . " 
 The album was critically and commercially successful , became his third number one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart , and also topped the charts in Argentina and Mexico . It was certified Platinum in Argentina and Mexico , and was certified Gold in Chile , Colombia and the United States . The album was nominated at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Latin Pop Album . Poquita Ropa was given generally positive reviews ; Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic considered the album a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " and said that it was " impressive " . 
 Poquita Ropa spawned three singles . " Puente " , a song with Cuban influences , was released as the lead single from the album and peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart . The other two singles released were " Vida " and " Marta " , both of which failed to appear on the charts . Instead of promoting the album with a worldwide tour , Arjona produced an eponymous film which was broadcast on HBO and A & E. It was directed by Joaquín Cambre , and features Mexican telenovela actress Edith González .

 With Poquita Ropa , Arjona wanted to drastically change his musical style . He tried to use as few instruments as possible , resulting in a production that sounds like a capella performances . Arjona said about the album , " music and women look better with little clothes " , and that " they [ the songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them . " 
 Arjona produced the album with the assistance of Dan Warner , who has worked with Shakira , Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera . Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic commented that Poquita Ropa " finds Arjona at his most naked , backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar , piano , and Hammond B @-@ 3 along with occasional touches of strings , woodwinds , and chorus vocals . " Poquita Ropa was the first album that Arjona recorded without producer Tommy Torres , whose last production was 5to Piso ( 2008 ) . The album is similar in style to Arjona 's work on Galería Caribe ( 2000 ) . 
 " Puente " , the lead single , is eight minutes and thirty seconds long and is divided into three parts . The first part is an a cappella song with a piano accompaniment . The second part is a ballad with Caribbean and Latin sounds , with some salsa and Cuban influences . The third is a mixture of salsa and merengue , with Cuban influences . Mónica <unk> from newspaper La Nación compared it with " Habana " , a 1999 song by Fito Páez . 
 = = Lyrical content = = 
 When asked about " Puente " ' s main theme , Arjona commented , " Although many believe is a threshed topic , it isn 't for a Cuban , be it on the island or Florida . The status of this dispute hasn 't changed since 1959 and I 've never seen something as disgusting as a rivalry between people occasioned from politics . Chávez can fight with Uribe , Fidel with Obama , but what has this to do with two third @-@ generation cousins that inherit an enmity for a politic matter [ ? ] " . In the song , Arjona sings : " Habana / siempre en las <unk> , tan mitad española , tan mitad africana / <unk> bien las <unk> que en cada <unk> siempre hay un <unk> / Habana . " He also said that " Puente " was the only song that was " not allowed to undress " . 
 " Vida " , the second single , is considered by Arjona to be an autobiographical song . He said that it " contains a good dose of the life of my old man " , as a reference to his father , Don Ricardo Arjona , who died in 2010 . In an interview , music video director Joaquín Cambre said that , " ' Vida ' is a sweet song , exciting and bitter nonetheless . I tried to represent that mix of feelings crafting an ambience of hope inside of a story that inevitably has a tragic end . Ricardo Arjona plays the song while listening to the story playing on an old disc . " Arjona said that " Marta " is " one of those songs with <unk> related to something that happened , put on the magnifying glass of the author . " When asked if " <unk> Una Canción " could be considered a guide for songwriters , he stated that " there are no guides to write songs . If any , songwriters would stop writing songs and start writing guides . " 
 Arjona also said that " Mi País " was " the story of anybody who left their land and searched for life in another place , with all that huge dose of nostalgia and memory those moments carries . " , and that he wrote the song when he left Guatemala . " Que Voy A <unk> Conmigo " was originally included as a rock song on his 1991 album Del Otro Lado del Sol , but the lyrics were slightly changed on the new version . Arjona stated that it was a difficult process to leave the songs " almost as they were born " , and that he had to convince the people who worked on the album that " it was the way the songs were to be " , without adding any sounds .

 = 1988 – 89 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1988 – 89 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an active season that featured several storms moving near or over the Mascarene Islands or Madagascar . The eleven tropical storms was two greater than average , of which five became tropical cyclones – a storm with maximum sustained winds over 10 minutes of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) or greater . Storms were monitored by the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion island in an official capacity , as well as the American Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) on an unofficial base . The season began early with Moderate Tropical Storm Adelinina forming in early November , and continued through the middle of April . Adelinina was one of two storms to form in November , the other being Tropical Cyclone Barisaona which crossed from the adjacent Australian basin . 
 After no activity in December , there were four storms in January , including the most notable of the season – Cyclone Firinga . The storm caused ₣ 1 billion ( 1989 francs , $ 157 million 1989 USD ) in damage when it struck Réunion . Tropical Cyclone Calasanjy also formed in the month , causing heavy damage when it struck western Madagascar . Three storms formed in February , the second of which , Hanitra , also crossed from the Australian basin . This storm , as well as later Tropical Cyclone Krisy , were the strongest of the season , attaining peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) . Tropical Cyclone Jinabo was the first of three storms to form in quick succession in late March , the others being Krisy and Tropical Storm Lezissy . Jinabo originated off the east coast of Madagascar and dropped heavy rainfall on Réunion . Krisy took a similar track and passed within 100 km ( 60 mi ) of Rodrigues and Mauritius , causing heavy crop damage . Lastly , Tropical Storm Lezissy merged with Krisy and dissipated on April 11 to end the season . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 During the season , the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin . Using satellite imagery from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique , and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90 ° E , south of the equator . At the time , the World Meteorological Organization recognized the MFR as a Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre , and would later label the agency as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in 1993 . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force , also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean . The season 's 11 named storms is slightly above the long term average , while the five tropical cyclones – a storm attaining maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) – was the same as the long term average . There was an ongoing La Niña event in the middle of the season . The MFR considered the tropical cyclone year to begin on August 1 and continue to July 31 of the following year . 
 In addition to the storms monitored by the MFR , the JTWC tracked a storm in March that formed off the west coast of Madagascar on March 7 . It moved generally to the south or south @-@ southeast , failing to intensify beyond 1 ‑ minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . After passing west of Madagascar , the storm dissipated on March 11 .

 The Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) over the eastern Indian Ocean was the origin of what would become Tropical Storm Adelinina . On October 30 , the JTWC began monitoring the system to the south of Diego Garcia , and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 01S on November 1 . On the next day , the MFR began issuing advisories on the system and quickly upgraded it to Moderate Tropical Storm Adelinina . The agency estimated 10 ‑ minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) as the storm moved to the southeast . By contrast , the JTWC assessed that Adelinina rapidly intensified into the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on November 2 , estimating peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) the next day . Without strengthening further , Adelinina began weakening on November 4 , turning to the east and later turning back to the northwest ; the track was influenced by a ridge to the south . Adelinina completed its five @-@ day loop on November 7 as it crossed westward over its former track . That day , the MFR re @-@ upgraded the system to tropical storm status , but discontinued advisories on November 8 .

 On November 5 , a tropical depression formed in the Australian basin south of Indonesia from a trough . It moved slowly and erratically to the west , only gradually organizing . On November 8 , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S . Before entering the south @-@ west Indian Ocean , the Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) estimated that the system reached 10 ‑ minute winds of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . However , the BoM did not include the system in its annual summary of the season , and at the time it was considered a tropical depression in the Australian region . On November 12 , the system crossed 90 ° E , classified as Moderate Tropical Storm Barisaona by the MFR . By that time , the storm was moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest , steered by a ridge to the south , and it attained tropical cyclone status two days later . Also on November 14 , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) , based on the well @-@ defined eye . Barisaona briefly weakened to tropical storm status on November 15 , only to regain tropical cyclone status the next day . On November 16 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . A passing trough turned the cyclone to the southwest . It gradually weakened thereafter , and JTWC discontinued advisories on November 20 . The MFR tracked Barisaona for a few more days as a ridge steered the system back to the north ; the system dissipated on November 23 . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Calasanjy = = = 
 The origins of Calasanjy were from the ITCZ in the Mozambique Channel off the northwest coast of Madagascar in early January . An area of disturbed weather moved southwestward at first , but gradually curved to the northwest . On January 9 , the MFR classified it as a tropical disturbance , but upgraded it to Moderate Tropical Storm Calasanjy on the next day . Also on January 10 , the JTWC designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone 06S . By that time , Calasanjy was just off the east coast of Mozambique , although it executed a tight loop to the southeast spare a landfall . Moving along its former path , the storm gradually intensified – the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on January 12 , and the MFR upgraded Calasanjy to tropical cyclone status two days later . Both agencies estimated peak winds of around 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Later on January 14 , Calasanjy made landfall in western Madagascar near Morondava , and soon after moving ashore it turned to the southwest , its motion changed due to a ridge to the southeast . It weakened to tropical depression status before re @-@ emerging into the Mozambique Channel on January 16 , becoming extratropical the next day . 
 Cyclone Calasanjy caused heavy damage in western Madagascar , with a peak wind gust of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) in Maintirano . The storm caused the Morondava River to increase to a flow rate of 2 @,@ 702 m3 / s ( 95 @,@ 420 ft3 / s ) , with a peak height of 4 @.@ 08 m ( 13 @.@ 4 ft ) during the storm . Reforms enacted after previous cyclones Kamisy and Honorinina helped facilitate repairs following this storm . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Dona = = = 
 On January 10 , a tropical disturbance formed east @-@ northeast of St. Brandon , which is a small archipelago belonging to Mauritius . It originally consisted of a small , weak vortex , although it gradually organized . The system moved to the southwest and quickly intensified into a tropical depression , reaching peak winds of 50 km / h ( 30 mph ) . Despite it only being a depression , the Mauritius Meteorological Service named the depression Dona due to the threat to the island . The system turned more to the south ahead of a trough , passing east of St. Brandon and later to the west of Rodrigues . Later , Dona turned to the southeast , dissipating on January 14 without affecting land . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Edme = = = 
 On January 20 , a tropical disturbance formed about 240 km ( 150 mi ) west of the Cocos Islands . That day , the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 07S , although it had monitored the system for the preceding three days . The nascent disturbance moved to the south and gradually intensified , becoming Moderate Tropical Storm Edme on January 21 . On the next day , the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , as Edme was aided by favorable upper level conditions beneath an anticyclone . On January 23 , the agency estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) ; however , the MFR only assessed peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) , just shy of tropical cyclone status . By the time of peak intensity , Edme had begun moving southwestward and thereafter weakened due to increasing wind shear , imparted by a trough in the Westerlies . On January 26 , the storm weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the south . Edme dissipated the following day . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Firinga = = = 
 Firinga developed on January 24 well to the northeast of Mauritius . After initially moving to the southeast , it began a southwest motion that it would continue for several days . During that time , the system intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Firinga , and the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on January 28 . Early the next day , it intensified to tropical cyclone status , reaching peak winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Around that time , Firinga passed 50 km ( 30 mi ) west of Mauritius , producing 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) wind gusts . Shortly thereafter , the cyclone struck Réunion , still at peak intensity , producing wind gusts as strong as 216 km / h ( 134 mph ) . Firinga turned more to the south as it weakened , degenerating into a tropical disturbance on January 31 . It fluctuated in intensity after turning to the southeast and executing a loop to the southwest , dissipating on February 7 . 
 On Mauritius , Firinga destroyed 844 homes . Heavy crop damage occurred on the island , and damage nationwide was estimated at $ 60 million ( 1989 USD ) . One person was killed in Mauritius . The storm dropped torrential rainfall in the southern portion of Réunion , including 24 ‑ hour totals of 1 @,@ 309 mm ( 51 @.@ 5 in ) at Pas de Bellecombe and 1 @,@ 199 mm ( 47 @.@ 2 in ) at Casabois , both of which set records for the locations . The rains caused widespread river flooding and resulted in 32 mudslides . Firinga isolated several towns from the flooding and left power and water outages . A total of 2 @,@ 746 houses were damaged or destroyed , leaving 6 @,@ 200 people homeless . Damage was estimated at around ₣ 1 billion ( 1989 francs , $ 157 million 1989 USD ) , and there were 10 deaths on the island . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Gizela = = = 
 A tropical disturbance formed on February 16 to the southeast of Diego Garcia . It moved to the west @-@ southwest , intensifying into Moderate Tropical Storm Gizela on February 18 . That day , the JTWC began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 12S . Due to a passing trough , Gizela turned to the south and southeast , gradually strengthening . On February 20 , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , while the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . Influenced by a ridge , Gizela turned back to the southwest and slowly weakened while remaining far away from any landmasses . On February 22 , it weakened to tropical depression status while turning to the south , and Gizela dissipated two days later . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Leon @-@ Hanitra = = = 
 A weak low pressure area was evident in the Australian basin as early as February 13 between the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island . It meandered for several days , executing a small loop , before beginning a westward motion . After passing south of the Cocos Islands , the system intensified into a tropical storm on February 18 and was named Leon . On the next day , the storm crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean , whereupon the Mauritius Meteorological Service renamed it Hanitra . The storm quickly intensified once it entered the basin . The JTWC , which designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone 11S , upgraded Hanitra to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane late on February 19 . On February 22 , the agency estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) , by which time Hanitra had begun a steady southwest motion . By contrast , the MFR assessed slower strengthening , only upgrading it to tropical cyclone status on February 23 and estimating peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) . The storm gradually accelerated to the south and weakened , becoming extratropical over time . The motion shifted to the southeast on February 28 , and Hanitra dissipated the next day . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Iana = = = 
 Before Iana formed , there was a persistent area of cloudiness across the Mozambique Channel in late February . A low pressure area originated over eastern Mozambique and moved eastward over water , emerging near Beira . On February 25 , a tropical disturbance formed off the west coast of southern Madagascar and moved east @-@ northeastward , steered by a ridge to the south . Shortly thereafter , the center passed just north of Europa Island . By the next day , it intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Iana , reaching peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Late on February 26 , the storm made landfall in western Madagascar near Morombe . Iana weakened slightly while moving east @-@ southeastward through the country , emerging into the Indian Ocean on February 27 near Farafangana . On the next day , the storm weakened to tropical depression status as it curved southward . Iana became extratropical the next day . The storm was not tracked by the JTWC . 
 On Europa Island , Iana produced 86 km / h ( 53 mph ) wind gusts , while on Madagascar , gusts peaked at 80 km / h ( 49 mph ) at Morondava . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Jinabo = = = 
 A tropical disturbance originated just east of St. Brandon on March 23 , initially consisting of a disorganized area of convection without a distinct center . Moving briskly westward , it slowly organized , becoming Moderate Tropical Storm Jinabo on March 25 . That day , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 19S . The storm turned to the southwest due to a trough in the region , bringing it parallel to the east coast of Madagascar . On March 26 , the JTWC upgraded Jinabo to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , and early the next day , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 115 km / h ( 70 mph ) . Around that time , the storm stalled about 110 km ( 70 mi ) east of the coast of Madagascar , later turning to the southeast due to a ridge . Quickly weakening , Jinabo was only a minimal tropical storm by March 29 . On the next day , it turned back to the south . Jinabo weakened to tropical depression status on March 31 and dissipated the next day , having become extratropical and joining the <unk> . 
 The storm brought gusty winds and rainfall to Madagascar and Réunion . On the former island , gusts reached 107 km / h ( 67 mph ) at Mahanoro along the coast . On Réunion , the storm drenched the island for six days , with a peak of 565 mm ( 22 @.@ 2 in ) at Sainte @-@ Rose . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Krisy = = = 
 About a week after Jinabo formed , another tropical disturbance formed in the basin on March 28 south of Diego Garcia . In its formative stages , it moved erratically , although generally to the southwest . On March 30 , it intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Krisy , the same day that the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 21S . Due to a ridge to the south , Krisy 's track shifted to the west that day before turning southward on April 1 . During that time , the JTWC assessed that Krisy intensified to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . The MFR upgraded the storm to cyclone status on April 2 , and on that day the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . On April 3 , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) as the cyclone turned to the west @-@ southwest . Over the next few days , the storm slowly weakened , passing 100 km ( 60 mi ) north of Rodrigues on April 5 as a moderate tropical storm . On the next day , Krisy brushed the east coasts of Mauritius and Réunion , passing just 30 km ( 18 mi ) east of the former island . It weakened to tropical depression status on April 7 while curving to the south and later to the east , becoming extratropical . A ridge turned the remnants of Krisy to the north toward Tropical Depression Lezissy , and the two systems merged on April 11 . 
 Krisy first affected Rodrigues , producing 122 km / h ( 76 mph ) gusts and 97 @.@ 6 mm ( 3 @.@ 84 mm ) of rainfall . Gusts reached 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) on Réunion , and high waves affected the island for several days . However , effects were worst on Mauritius . While passing south of the island , Krisy produced wind gusts of 155 km / h ( 96 mph ) at Plaisance Airport on Mauritius . Rainfall on the island reached 182 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) over a 24 period . On the island , the passages of Firinga and Krisy decreased the output of the sugar crop by 20 @,@ 000 tons , accounting for 15 % of the sugar cane , mostly in the southeastern portion of the island . Several other crops were affected by the two cyclones , resulting in a 50 % decrease of the banana output . As Krisy struck just two months after Firinga , residents heeded alerts and were well @-@ prepared , and 800 people sought shelter . There were no direct deaths , although one farmer committed suicide due to the threat of the storm . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Lezissy = = = 
 The final storm of the season formed on April 6 to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia while Krisy was active near Rodrigues . That same day , the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 24S . It quickly intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Lezissy as it took a westward trajectory , reaching peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) by late on April 6 . Influenced by a broad area of low pressure , Lezissy turned to the southwest , gradually weakening . It approached former Cyclone Krisy , and the two systems merged by April 11 , both losing their circulations and leaving behind a disorganized remnant low . 
 = Instant Karma ! = 
 " Instant Karma ! " – sometimes referred to as " Instant Karma ! ( We All Shine On ) " – is a song written by English musician John Lennon , released as a single on Apple Records in February 1970 . In the UK , the single was credited to " Lennon / Ono with the Plastic Ono Band " . The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts , competing with the Beatles ' " Let It Be " in America , where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million copies . 
 " Instant Karma ! " was written , recorded and released within a period of ten days , making it one of the fastest @-@ released songs in pop music history . The recording was produced by Phil Spector , marking a comeback for the American producer after his self @-@ imposed retirement in 1966 , and leading to him being offered the producer 's role on the Beatles ' Let It Be album ( 1970 ) . Recorded at London 's Abbey Road Studios , " Instant Karma ! " employs Spector 's signature Wall of Sound technique and features contributions from George Harrison , Klaus Voormann , Alan White and Billy Preston . The B @-@ side was a song composed and performed by Yoko Ono , titled " Who Has Seen the Wind ? " Recently shorn of the long hair synonymous with their 1969 campaign for world peace , Lennon and Ono promoted the single with an appearance on Britain 's Top of the Pops . 
 " Instant Karma ! " has appeared on many Lennon compilations , including Shaved Fish ( 1975 ) , Lennon Legend ( 1997 ) and Power to the People : The Hits ( 2010 ) . A version recorded at the " One to One " concerts in August 1972 was included on his posthumously released Live in New York City album ( 1986 ) . The song continues to receive critical praise as one of the finest recordings from Lennon 's solo career . Paul Weller , Duran Duran and U2 are among the acts who have covered " Instant Karma ! " , the chorus of which inspired the title to Stephen King 's 1977 novel The Shining . 
 = = Background = = 
 Together with his wife , Yoko Ono , John Lennon spent New Year 1970 in Aalborg , Denmark , establishing a relationship with Ono 's former husband , artist Tony Cox , and visiting Cox and Ono 's daughter Kyoko . The visit coincided with the start of what Lennon termed " Year 1 AP ( After Peace ) " , following his and Ono 's much @-@ publicised Bed @-@ Ins and other peace @-@ campaign activities throughout 1969 . 
 To mark the new era , on 20 January 1970 , the couple shaved off their shoulder @-@ length hair , an act that Britain 's Daily Mirror described as " the most sensational <unk> since the Red Indians went out of business " . Lennon and Ono pledged to auction the shorn hair for a charitable cause , having similarly announced on 5 January that they would donate all future royalties from their recordings to the peace movement . Also while in Denmark , the Lennons , Cox and the latter 's current partner , <unk> Kendall , discussed the concept of " instant karma " , whereby the causality of one 's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime . Author Philip Norman writes of the concept 's appeal : " The idea was quintessential Lennon – the age @-@ old Buddhist law of cause and effect turned into something as modern and synthetic as instant coffee and , simultaneously , into a bogey under the stairs that can get you if you don 't watch out . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 On 27 January 1970 , two days after returning to the UK , Lennon woke up with the beginnings of a song inspired by his conversations with Cox and Kendall . Working at home on a piano , Lennon developed the idea and came up with a melody for the composition , which he titled " Instant Karma ! " 
 The song employs a similar chord structure to that of " Three Blind Mice " and " Some Other Guy " , after Lennon had used the same progression in his 1967 composition for the Beatles , " All You Need Is Love " . Later in 1970 , he would adopt the melody of " Three Blind Mice " , an English nursery rhyme , for his song " My Mummy 's Dead " . 
 In their book The Words and Music of John Lennon , Ben Urish and Kenneth Bielen suggest that in the first verse of " Instant Karma ! " , Lennon rebukes his listeners with the sarcastic lines : " Get yourself together / Pretty soon you 're gonna be dead . " Norman comments on the " hippie catchphrase of the moment " contained in the first of these two lines , which together provide a warning that is " obviously not to be taken literally " . Author Mark Hertsgaard notes the lyric " Why in the world are we here ? " as a further example of Lennon " asking what purpose his life on earth was to serve " , after his 1966 composition " Strawberry Fields Forever " . 
 As with " Give Peace a Chance " and " Power to the People " – Lennon singles from 1969 and 1971 respectively – the chorus has an anthem @-@ like quality , as he sings : " We all shine on , like the moon and the stars and the sun . " Norman describes the chorus as Lennon restating his message of " peace campaigning and non @-@ violent , optimistic togetherness " . Lennon biographer John Blaney writes that the song is an appeal " for mankind to take responsibility for its fate " and that it was " Lennon developing his own brand of egalitarianism " . 
 Lennon completed the writing of " Instant Karma ! " in an hour . He then telephoned bandmate George Harrison and American producer Phil Spector , who was in London at the invitation of the Beatles ' Apple Corps manager , Allen Klein . According to Lennon 's recollection , he told Spector : " Come over to Apple quick , I 've just written a monster . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 Although still officially a member of the Beatles , Lennon had privately announced his departure from the group in September 1969 . He was now keen to issue " Instant Karma ! " immediately as a single , the third under his and Ono 's Plastic Ono Band moniker . The recording session took place at Abbey Road Studios in north @-@ west London , on the evening of 27 January . Lennon 's fellow musicians at the session were Harrison , Klaus Voormann , Alan White and Billy Preston – all of whom had performed at the December 1969 Peace for Christmas Concert , as part of the Plastic Ono Supergroup . The recording engineer for " Instant Karma ! " was EMI mainstay Phil McDonald . Spector produced the session , arriving late after Harrison had found him at Apple 's office and persuaded him to attend . 
 According to author Bruce Spizer , the line @-@ up for the basic track , before overdubs , was Lennon ( vocals , acoustic guitar ) , Harrison ( electric guitar ) , Preston ( organ ) , Voormann ( bass ) and White ( drums ) . Lennon later recalled of the recording : " Phil ( Spector ) came in and said , ' How do you want it ? ' And I said , ' 1950s ' and he said ' Right ' and BOOM ! ... he played it back and there it was . " The song uses a similar amount of echo to 1950s Sun Records recordings . 
 The musicians recorded ten takes , the last of which was selected for overdubbing . To create what Spector biographer Mark Ribowsky terms a " four @-@ man Wall of Sound " production , Lennon added grand piano onto the basic track , while Harrison and White shared another piano and Voormann played electric piano . In addition , Beatles aide Mal Evans overdubbed chimes ( or tubular bells ) and White added a second , muffled drum part . With Lennon feeling that the chorus was missing something , Preston and Evans were sent to bring in a group of people from a nightclub to provide backing vocals . These newcomers and all the musicians , along with Allen Klein , then added chorus vocals , with Harrison directing the singing . 
 Although Lennon and Spector disagreed over the bass sound , Lennon was " ecstatic " about the producer 's work on " Instant Karma " , author Peter Doggett writes . White 's drums assumed the role of a lead instrument , positioned prominently in the mix , of which Spector biographer Richard Williams would write in 1972 : " No Beatles record had ever possessed such a unique sound ; Spector had used echo to make the drums reverberate like someone slapping a wet fish on a marble slab , and the voices sounded hollow and decayed . " Spector wanted to add a string section to the track in Los Angeles , but Lennon insisted that the recording was complete . 
 Having only recently returned to producing , after the commercial failure of Ike & Tina Turner 's 1966 single " River Deep – Mountain High " in America , Spector had " passed the audition " , according to Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner . " Instant Karma ! " was the first of many Beatles @-@ related recordings that Spector worked on during the early 1970s , starting with the band 's final album release , Let It Be ( 1970 ) . 
 = = = " Who Has Seen the Wind ? " = = = 
 As with the Plastic Ono Band 's previous singles , " Give Peace a Chance " and " Cold Turkey " , Lennon and Ono recorded an Ono composition as a B @-@ side . Produced by Lennon , " Who Has Seen the Wind ? " was recorded at Trident Studios in central London , also in late January 1970 . The opening verse , sung a cappella by Ono , is from a work by nineteenth @-@ century English poet Christina Rossetti . The instrumentation on the recording includes Lennon playing acoustic guitar ; John Barham , Harrison 's regular collaborator and arranger , on harpsichord ; Ono on flute ; and various percussion instruments . Spizer suggests that Harrison may also have participated , on acoustic guitar . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Instant Karma ! " ranks as one of the fastest @-@ released songs in pop music history , arriving in UK record stores just ten days after it was written . Lennon remarked to the press that he " wrote it for breakfast , recorded it for lunch , and we 're putting it out for dinner " . Apple Records issued the single on 6 February 1970 in Britain – credited to the Plastic Ono Band – and on 20 February in America , where the A @-@ side was retitled " Instant Karma ! ( We All Shine On ) " and credited to John Ono Lennon . Spector remixed " Instant Karma ! " for the US release without Lennon 's knowledge . 
 As with " Cold Turkey " , the single 's standard Apple Records A @-@ side face label carried the words " PLAY LOUD " , in both the UK and America . Reflecting the tender sound of " Who Has Seen the Wind ? " , the B @-@ side label read " PLAY <unk> " ( or " PLAY <unk> " in the US ) . The front of the US picture sleeve featured a black @-@ and @-@ white photo of Lennon along with a prominent producer 's credit for Spector , while the reverse had a similar picture of Ono . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 Following a year of highly publicised peace campaigning by the Lennons in 1969 , Apple press officer Derek Taylor was concerned that they had exhausted the media 's interest in their causes . On 4 February 1970 , Lennon and Ono donated a large plastic bag full of their hair , along with Apple 's poster for the new single , to north London @-@ based black power activist Michael X , in return for a pair of Muhammad Ali 's bloodstained boxing shorts . The " final proof " of the Lennons ' " <unk> [ ure ] " , according to Taylor , was that there was a large press turnout for the event yet " nobody printed anything " . 
 On 11 February , Lennon and Ono filmed an appearance on BBC Television 's Top of the Pops to promote " Instant Karma ! " , accompanied by White , Voormann , Evans and BP Fallon . While the other musicians mimed their contributions , Lennon sang a live vocal over a mix of the song 's instrumental track , prepared by EMI engineer Geoff Emerick . This was the first appearance on the program by any member of the Beatles since 1966 , as well as the public unveiling of the Lennons ' new cropped look . Two versions of " Instant Karma ! " – known as " knitting " and " cue card " – were taped for Top of the Pops , and aired on 12 and 19 February , respectively . 
 The clips differ from one another in terms of Lennon 's attire and the nature of Ono 's role as , in author Robert Rodriguez 's description , " an onstage focal point around which all activity was staged " ; in addition , Lennon 's vocal was treated with echo for the 19 February broadcast . In the " knitting " clip , Lennon is wearing a black polo @-@ neck jumper as Ono sits beside his piano , blindfolded , and knitting throughout . In " cue card " , Lennon wears a flower @-@ pattern shirt under a denim jacket , while Ono holds up a series of cryptically worded cue cards , the messages on which include " Smile " , " Hope " and " Peace " , as she speaks into a microphone . Although Ono appears to have a more active role , she is again blindfolded and the words she speaks cannot be heard . Rodriguez describes both clips as " terrifically engaging , providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song " , yet he considers that the " cue card " performance " captures much more of the ambience , with frequent shots of White 's stellar work and the studio dancers " . 
 = = = Commercial success and aftermath = = = 
 " Instant Karma ! " was commercially successful , peaking at number 3 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 chart , number 2 in Canada , and number 5 on the UK Singles Chart . The single also reached the top ten in several other European countries and in Australia . The release took place two months before Paul McCartney announced the break @-@ up of the Beatles , whose penultimate single , the George Martin @-@ produced " Let It Be " , Lennon 's record competed with on the US charts . " Instant Karma ! " went on to become the first single by a solo Beatle to achieve US sales of 1 million , earning gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on 14 December 1970 . Until Lennon 's death in December 1980 , " Instant Karma ! " remained his sole RIAA @-@ certified gold single . 
 Despite the stated intentions for Lennon and Ono 's Year 1 AP , the proceeds from the auctioning of their hair benefited Michael X 's Black House commune rather than the peace movement , and , in the words of Beatles Diary author Barry Miles , the pledge to donate their royalties was also " discreetly forgotten " . In March 1970 , Lennon publicly split with the organisers of the planned Toronto Peace Festival , as he and Ono began treatment under Arthur Janov 's Primal Therapy . Before heading to California in April for intensive therapy through the summer , Lennon accused McCartney of using the Beatles ' break @-@ up to sell his album McCartney , and admitted that he wished that he himself had announced the break @-@ up months before to promote his own solo release . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 On release , Chris Welch of Melody Maker declared : " Instant hit ! John Lennon is singing better than ever . With a beautiful rock ' n ' roll echo chamber on his mean but meaningful vocals and some superb drumming , it makes up the Plastics ' best piece of boogie yet . " Writing in the NME in 1975 , Charles Shaar Murray wrote of the song 's " volcanically desperate optimism " and rated it " a classic " . Shaar Murray added , with reference to " Cold Turkey " also : " I can 't remember anybody else who put out two such utter killers in a row over the same period of time . " 
 Village Voice critic Robert Christgau has described " Instant Karma ! " as Lennon 's " best political song " , while other reviewers consider it his finest post @-@ Beatles recording . In their 1975 book The Beatles : An Illustrated Record , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler describe " Instant Karma ! " as a " snappy little rocker " that " owes as much to the skilful production of Phil Spector as to the vitality of the overall performance " , on which " [ d ] <unk> Alan White excels . " Carr and Tyler remark that " Who Has Seen the Wind ? " " would have made a marvellous soundtrack for the movie of Henry James ' ' The Turn of the Screw ' , being a somewhat sinister ditty sung à la Wunderkind " . Bruce Spizer describes Ono 's song as " evok [ ing ] images of minstrels at a Renaissance fair " and considers the single " a far cry … and welcome relief from the avant @-@ garde discs issued by John and Yoko in 1969 " . 
 Another to highlight White 's drumming amid the " collective genius " of all the participants on " Instant Karma ! " , author Robert Rodriguez concludes of Lennon 's activities on 27 January 1970 : " Not many days in the history of rock and roll proved as everlastingly fruitful . " In 1981 , NME critic Bob Woffinden wrote of the single : " It was excellent . Lennon was characteristically simple and direct , but this time on a song with one of those magically catchy refrains . " 
 Among Lennon 's biographers , Ben Urish and Kenneth Bielen view " Instant Karma ! " as " a chiding though positive message for humanity " , while Jon Wiener praises Lennon 's " rich , deep voice " on a recording where the sound is " irresistible " . Philip Norman describes the song as " similar to ' Cold Turkey ' in tempo but far more relaxed and humorous " , adding that Spector 's production gave Lennon 's voice " a taut expressiveness it had not had since ' Norwegian Wood ' " . While noting the significance of the session for George Harrison 's career , author Simon Leng praises the recording as being " full of urgency and sheer excitement " . 
 In 1989 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked " Instant Karma ! " the 79th best single of the previous 25 years . In NME Originals : Beatles – The Solo Years 1970 – 1980 , David Stubbs lists the song second among Lennon 's " ten solo gems " ( behind " Cold Turkey " ) , with the comment : " ' Instant Karma ! ' epitomises the Lennon paradox , melding hippie idealism and rock 'n'roll primal energy in an exhilarating mix . " Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound placed it third on his 2009 list of " Top Ten Songs by Ex @-@ Beatles " . According to the website Acclaimed Music , " Instant Karma ! " has also appeared in the following critics ' best @-@ songs lists and books , among others : Dave Marsh 's The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made ( 1989 ; at number 638 ) , 1000 Songs that Rock Your World by Dave Thompson ( 2011 ; number 56 ) , the NME 's " The 100 Best Songs of the 1970s " ( 2012 ; number 77 ) , and Q magazine 's " The 1001 Best Songs Ever " ( 2003 ; number 193 ) . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame includes the track among its " 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll " .

 " Instant Karma ! " ' s first appearance on a Lennon album , albeit slightly edited in length , was the 1975 compilation Shaved Fish . Urish and Bielen observe that the " advertising hyperbole " inherent in the song 's title , through the inclusion of an exclamation mark , is given extra emphasis on this album cover . The song has featured – often with the full title " Instant Karma ! ( We All Shine On ) " – on numerous posthumous compilations , including The John Lennon Collection ( 1982 ) , the Lennon box set ( 1990 ) , Lennon Legend ( 1997 ) , Working Class Hero : The Definitive Lennon ( 2005 ) and Power to the People : The Hits ( 2010 ) .

 Scholars believe the name Thanjavur is derived from <unk> , a legendary demon in Hindu mythology . While the early history of Thanjavur remains unclear , the city first rose to prominence during the reign of Medieval Cholas when it served as the capital of the empire . After the fall of Cholas , the city was ruled by various dynasties like Pandyas , Vijayanagar Empire , Madurai Nayaks , Thanjavur Nayaks , Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire . It has been a part of independent India since 1947 . 
 = = History = = 
 According to local legend , the word Thanjavur is derived from " <unk> " , an asura ( giant ) in Hindu mythology who was killed in what is now Thanjavur by the Hindu god <unk> Perumal , a form of Vishnu . The word Thanjavur is indeed a Tamil name . " Than " <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> , " ur " - city , a city surrounded by cold <unk> word " <unk> " has become " Thanjavur " 
 There are no references to Thanjavur in any of the Sangam period ( third century BC to fourth century AD ) Tamil records , though some scholars believe that the city has existed since that time . Kovil <unk> , situated 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the east of the city , was the site of the Battle of <unk> between the Chola king Karikala and a confederacy of the Cheras and the Pandyas . The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the <unk> in the third century AD after which the kingdom faded into obscurity . The region around present day Thanjavur was conquered by the <unk> during sixth century , who ruled it up to 849 . 
 The Cholas came to prominence once more through the rise of the Medieval Chola monarch <unk> ( 841 – 878 ) in about 850 . <unk> conquered Thanjavur from the <unk> king <unk> <unk> and built a temple dedicated to Hindu goddess <unk> . His son Aditya I ( 871 – 901 ) consolidated the hold over the city . The Rashtrakuta king Krishna II ( 878 – 914 ) , a contemporary of the Chola king <unk> I ( 907 – 950 ) , claims to have conquered Thanjavur , but there are no records to support the claim . Gradually , Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda Cholapuram in about 1025 . During the first decade of the eleventh century , the Chola king Raja Raja Chola I ( 985 – 1014 ) constructed the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur . The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of South Indian temple architecture . 
 When the Chola Empire began to decline in the 13th century , the Pandyas from the south invaded and captured Thanjavur twice , first during 1218 – 19 and then during 1230 . During the second invasion , the Chola king Rajaraja III ( 1216 – 56 ) was set in exile and he sought the help of the Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II ( 1220 – 35 ) to regain Thanjavur . Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I ( 1268 – 1308 ) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the suzerainty of the Pandyas . The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311 when their kingdom was raided and annexed by the forces of Malik Kafur ( 1296 – 1306 ) and Delhi Sultanate . The Sultanate extended its authority directly over the conquered regions from 1311 to 1335 and then through the semi @-@ independent Ma 'bar Sultanate from 1335 to 1378 . Starting from the 1350s , the Ma 'bar Sultanate was steadily absorbed into the rising Vijayanagar Empire . 
 Thanjavur is believed to have been conquered by Kampanna <unk> during his invasion of Srirangam between 1365 and 1371 . Deva Raya 's inscription dated 1443 , <unk> 's inscription dated 1455 and <unk> Deva 's land grants dated 1532 and 1539 attest Vijayanagar 's dominance over Thanjavur . <unk> Nayak ( 1532 – 80 ) , the Vijayanagar viceroy of Arcot , established himself as an independent monarch in 1532 ( 1549 , according to some sources ) and founded the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom . <unk> Nayak ( 1560 – 1614 ) , Raghunatha Nayak ( 1600 – 34 ) and Vijaya Raghava Nayak ( 1634 – 73 ) are some of the important rulers of the Nayak dynasty who ruled Thanjavur . Thanjavur Nayaks were notable for their patronage of literature and arts . The rule of the dynasty came to an end when Thanjavur fell to the Madurai Nayak king Chokkanatha Nayak ( 1662 – 82 ) in 1673 . Vijaya Raghunatha Nayak , the son of Chokkanatha , was killed in a battle and Chokkanatha 's brother Alagiri Nayak ( 1673 – 75 ) was crowned as the ruler of the empire . 
 Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by Ekoji I ( 1675 – 84 ) , the Maratha feudatory of the sultan of Bijapur and half @-@ brother of Shivaji ( 1627 / 30 @-@ 80 ) of the Bhonsle dynasty . Ekoji founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855 . The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout the last quarter of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century . The Maratha rulers patronized Carnatic music . In 1787 , Amar Singh , the regent of Thanjavur , deposed the minor Raja , his nephew Serfoji II ( 1787 – 93 ) and captured the throne . Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British , who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas . The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II ( 1832 – 55 ) , the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler , died without a legitimate male heir . The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records . Five years after its annexation , the British replaced Negapatam ( modern @-@ day Nagapattinam ) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration . Under the British , Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre . The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52 @,@ 171 , making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency . After India 's independence , Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters .

 = Order of St Patrick = 
 The Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick is a dormant British order of chivalry associated with Ireland . The Order was created in 1783 by George III at the request of the then Lord @-@ Lieutenant , Lord Buckingham . The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1922 , when most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State . While the Order technically still exists , no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936 , and the last surviving knight , Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , died in 1974 . The Queen , however , remains the Sovereign of the Order , and one officer , the Ulster King of Arms ( now combined with Norroy King of Arms ) , also survives . St Patrick is patron of the order ; its motto is Quis <unk> ? , Latin for " Who will separate [ us ] ? " : an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8 : 35 , " Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? " 
 Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire kingdom , but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent nation only . The Order of St Patrick , which pertains to Ireland , is the most junior of these three in precedence and age . Its equivalent in England , The Most Noble Order of the Garter , is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom , dating to the middle fourteenth century . The Scottish equivalent is The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle , dating in its modern form to 1687 .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 The order was founded in 1783 , a year after the grant of substantial autonomy to Ireland , as a means of rewarding ( or obtaining ) political support in the Irish Parliament . The Order of the Bath , founded in 1725 , was instituted for similar reasons . The statutes of the Order restricted membership to men who were both knights and gentlemen , the latter being defined as having three generations of " noblesse " ( i.e. ancestors bearing coats of arms ) on both their father 's and mother 's side . In practice , however , only Irish Peers ( and occasional foreign princes with tenuous or no Irish connections ) were ever appointed to the Order . The cross of St Patrick ( a red saltire on a white background ) was chosen as one of the symbols of the Order . A flag of this design was later incorporated into the Union Flag . Its association with St. Patrick or with Ireland prior to the foundation of the Order is unclear , however . One of the first knights was The 2nd Duke of Leinster , whose arms carry the same cross . 
 The Order of St Patrick earned international coverage when , in 1907 , its insignia , known generally as the Irish Crown Jewels , were stolen from the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle shortly before a visit by the Order 's Sovereign , King Edward VII . Their whereabouts remain a mystery . 
 = = = Post @-@ 1922 = = = 
 The last non @-@ royal appointed to the order was James Hamilton , 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922 , who served as the first Governor of Northern Ireland . When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom that same year , the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to the Order . The British government continued to entertain hopes for the order 's revival as a pan @-@ Irish institution . Therefore , while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland , it chose not to do so . 
 Since then , only three people have been appointed to the Order , all members of the British Royal Family . The then @-@ Prince of Wales ( the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor ) was appointed in 1927 and his younger brothers , Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , in 1934 and Prince Albert , Duke of York ( later King George VI ) , in 1936 . 
 It is likely that these appointments were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state . In 1937 , however , the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution , rendering the Crown 's position in Irish affairs ambiguous . The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when the Irish Free State formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth . The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made . 
 The Duke of Gloucester at his death in 1974 was the last surviving member of the Order . The last living non @-@ royal member of the Order , the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury , died in 1961 . The Order has , however , never actually been abolished and its resurrection has been discussed in Irish Government circles on a number of occasions and never pursued . 
 = = = Possible revival = = = 
 Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested reviving the Order in 1943 to recognise the services of General The Hon. Sir Harold Alexander in Tunisia , but the opinion of the other ministers and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin . Taoiseach Seán Lemass considered reviving the Order during the 1960s , but did not take a decision . 
 The Constitution of Ireland provides , " Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State " ( Article 40 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 ° ) and " No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government " ( Article 40 @.@ 2 @.@ 2 ° ) . Legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits the awarding of membership of the Order of St Patrick to Irish citizens , but some suggest that the phrase " titles of nobility " implies hereditary peerages and other noble titles , not lifetime honours such as knighthoods . In any case , an Irish citizen would require the approval of the Government of Ireland to receive an award from a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom in this manner . 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = Members = = = 
 The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick . The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , the monarch 's representative in Ireland , served as the Grand Master . The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922 ; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent . Rather oddly , the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order as a matter of right . While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order , this seems to have been the exception rather than the rule . 
 The Order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to the Sovereign . In 1821 , however , George IV appointed six additional knights ; he did not issue a Royal Warrant authorising the change until 1830 . William IV formally changed the statutes in 1833 , increasing the limit to twenty @-@ two knights . 
 The original statutes , based heavily on those of the Order of the Garter , prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the Sovereign upon the nomination of the members . Each Knight was to propose nine candidates , of whom three had to have the rank of Earl or higher , three the rank of Baron or higher , and three the rank of Knight or higher , and a vote taken . In practice this system was never used ; the Grand Master would nominate a Peer , the Sovereign would usually assent , and a chapter meeting held at which the knights " elected " the new member . The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts , the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle , in only ever appointing peers and princes . Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick ; they were not eligible to become members of the other two orders until 1987 . The only woman to be part of the Order was Queen Victoria , in her capacity as Sovereign of the Order . Although it was associated with the established Church of Ireland until 1871 , several Roman Catholics were appointed to the order throughout its history . 
 = = = Officers = = = 
 The Order of St Patrick initially had thirteen officers : the Prelate , the Chancellor , the Registrar , the Usher , the Secretary , the Genealogist , the King of Arms , two heralds and four pursuivants . Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the Church of Ireland , the then @-@ established church . After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871 , the ecclesiastics were allowed to remain in office until their deaths , when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials . All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant . 
 The office of Prelate was held by the Lord Archbishop of Armagh , the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland . The Prelate was not mentioned in the original statutes , but created by a warrant shortly afterwards , apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post . Since the death of the last holder in 1885 , the office of Prelate has remained vacant . 
 The Church of Ireland 's second highest cleric , the Lord Archbishop of Dublin , originally served as the Chancellor of the Order . From 1886 onwards , the office was held instead by the Chief Secretary for Ireland . Since the abolition of the position of Chief Secretary in 1922 , the office of Chancellor has remained vacant . The Dean of St Patrick 's Cathedral was originally the Registrar of the Order . In 1890 , on the death of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment , the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order . This position was held by Ulster King of Arms , Ireland 's chief heraldic official , a post which had been created in 1552 . In 1943 , this post was in effect divided in two , reflecting the partition of Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act , 1920 . The position , insofar as it related to Northern Ireland , was combined with that of Norroy King of Arms ( who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England ) . The post of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms still exists , and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick . The office of Ulster King of Arms , insofar as it related to the Irish Free State ( now officially called Ireland ) , became the position of Chief Herald of Ireland . 
 The Order of St Patrick had six other heraldic officers , many more than any other British order . The two heralds were known as Cork Herald and Dublin Herald . Three of the four <unk> were untitled , the fourth was held by Athlone Pursuivant , an office founded in 1552 . 
 The Usher of the Order was " the Usher at Arms named the Black Rod " . The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland was distinct from the English officer of the same name , though like his counterpart he had some duties in the Irish House of Lords . ( The latter continues to serve as Usher to the Order of the Garter and as Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Arms of the House of Lords . ) The Irish post has been vacant since 1933 . 
 The offices of Secretary and Genealogist were originally held by members of the Irish House of Commons . The office of Secretary has been vacant since 1926 . The position of Genealogist was left vacant in 1885 , restored in 1889 , but left vacant again in 1930 .

 = = Vestments and accoutrements = = 
 For important occasions , such as Coronations and investitures of new members of the Order , Knights of St Patrick wore elaborate vestments : 
 The mantle was a celestial blue robe lined with white silk . The star of the Order ( see below ) was depicted on the left of the mantle . A blue hood was attached to the mantle . 
 The hat of the Order was originally of white satin , lined with blue , but was changed to black velvet by George IV . It was plumed with three falls of feathers , one red , one white and one blue . 
 The collar was made of gold , consisting of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots . The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately enamelled white within red , and red within white . The central harp , from which the badge of the Order was suspended , was surmounted by a crown . 
 On certain " collar days " designated by the Sovereign , members attending formal events wore the Order 's collar over their military uniform , formal day dress , or evening wear . When collars were worn ( either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations ) , the badge was suspended from the collar . 
 Aside from these special occasions , however , much simpler accoutrements were used : 
 The star of the Order was an eight @-@ pointed figure , with the four cardinal points longer than the intermediate points . Each point was shown as a cluster of rays . In the centre was the same motto , year and design that appeared on the badge . The star was worn pinned to the left breast . 
 The broad riband was a celestial blue sash worn across the body , from the right shoulder to the left hip . 
 The badge was pinned to the riband at the left hip . Made of gold , it depicted a shamrock bearing three crowns , on top of a cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majuscules , as well as the date of the Order 's foundation in Roman numerals ( " <unk> " ) . 
 The Grand Master 's insignia were of the same form and design as those of the Knights . In 1831 , however , William IV presented the Grand Master with a star and badge , each composed of rubies , emeralds and Brazilian diamonds . These two insignia were designated " Crown Jewels " in the Order 's 1905 Statutes , and the designation " Irish Crown Jewels " was emphasised by newspapers when they were stolen in 1907 , along with the collars of five Knights ; they have not since been recovered . 
 A number of items pertaining to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . The robes of The 4th Baron <unk> , the 122nd Knight of the Order , are on display in the National Museum of Ireland , Dublin ; the robe belonging to The 3rd Earl of Kilmorey is held by the Newry Museum ; the National Gallery and Genealogical Museum in Dublin both have Stars of the Order ; and the Ulster Museum ( part of the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland ) in <unk> has a large collection on display and two mantles in storage . The Irish Guards take their <unk> and motto from the Order . 
 = = Chapel and Chancery = = 
 The Chapel of the Order was originally in St Patrick 's Cathedral in central Dublin . Each member of the Order , including the Sovereign , was allotted a stall in the choir of the Chapel , above which his ( or her , in the case of Queen Victoria ) heraldic devices were displayed . Perched on the pinnacle of a knight 's stall was a helm , decorated with mantling and topped by his crest . Above the crest , the knight 's heraldic banner was hung , emblazoned with his coat of arms . At a considerably smaller scale , to the back of the stall was affixed a piece of brass ( a " stall plate " ) displaying its occupant 's name , arms and date of admission into the Order . Upon the death of a Knight , the banner and crest were taken down and replaced with those of his successor . After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871 , the Chapel ceased to be used ; the heraldic devices of the knights at the time were left in place at the request of Queen Victoria . 
 The Order was without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners , helms and hatchment plates ( the equivalent of stall plates , in the absence of stalls ) in the Great Hall , officially called St. Patrick 's Hall , in Dublin Castle . On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed . When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners of the members of the Order in 1922 . The existing banners were repaired or new ones made ; it is these banners which can be seen today . The Hall , which was renamed St Patrick 's Hall from its association with the Order , also served as the Chancery of the Order . Installation ceremonies , and later investitures , were held here , often on St Patrick 's Day , until they were discontinued . A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation . St Patrick 's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland . 
 Unlike many of the other British Orders , the stall plates ( or hatchment plates ) do not form a continuous record of the Knights of the Order . There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871 , ( although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940 ) , and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently . In the case of the stall plates this was perhaps due to their size , <unk> cm ( <unk> in ) . 
 = = Precedence and privileges = = 
 Since the members of the Order were required to be knights , and in practice had higher rank , many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot . As knights they could prefix " Sir " to their forenames , but the form was never used in speech , as they were referred to by their peerage dignities . They were assigned positions in the order of precedence , but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities . 
 Knights used the post @-@ nominal letters " KP " . When an individual was entitled to use multiple post @-@ nominal letters , KP appeared before all others , except " Bt " and " Btss " ( Baronet and Baronetess ) , " VC " ( Victoria Cross ) , " GC " ( George Cross ) , " KG " ( Knight of the Garter ) and " KT " ( Knight of the Thistle ) . 
 Knights could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet ( a blue circle bearing the motto ) and the collar ; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter . The badge is depicted suspended from the collar . They were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters . This high privilege was , and is , only shared by members of the Royal Family , peers , Knights and Ladies of the Garter , Knights and Ladies of the Thistle , and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders . ( Of course , Knights of St Patrick , normally all being members of the British Royal Family or peers , were mostly entitled to supporters in any event . ) 
 = Colton Point State Park = 
 Colton Point State Park is a 368 @-@ acre ( 149 ha ) Pennsylvania state park in Tioga County , Pennsylvania , in the United States . It is on the west side of the Pine Creek Gorge , also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania , which is 800 feet ( 240 m ) deep and nearly 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) across at this location . The park extends from the creek in the bottom of the gorge up to the rim and across part of the plateau to the west . Colton Point State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge , and offers opportunities for picnicking , hiking , fishing and hunting , whitewater boating , and camping . Colton Point is surrounded by Tioga State Forest and its sister park , Leonard Harrison State Park , on the east rim . The park is on a state forest road in Shippen Township 5 miles ( 8 km ) south of U.S. Route 6 . 
 Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods . Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek . The path was later used by lumbermen , and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988 . Since 1996 , the 62 @-@ mile ( 100 km ) Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the gorge . The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area , while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River . The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals , some of which have been reintroduced to the area . 
 The park is named for Henry Colton , a Williamsport lumberman who cut timber there starting in 1879 . Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries , it is now covered by second @-@ growth forest , thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) in the 1930s . The CCC built the facilities at Colton Point before and shortly after the park 's 1936 opening . Most of the CCC @-@ built facilities remain in use , and have led to the park 's listing as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places . Since a successful publicity campaign in 1936 , the park and gorge have been a popular tourist destination , attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year . Colton Point State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) Bureau of Parks for its " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " list , which praised its " spectacular vistas and a fabulous view of Pine Creek Gorge " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Native Americans = = = 
 Humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10 @,@ 000 BC . The first settlers were Paleo @-@ Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools . The hunter @-@ gatherers of the Archaic period , which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC , used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts . The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi @-@ permanent villages and horticulture , between 1000 BC and 1500 AD . Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles , burial mounds , pipes , bows and arrows , and ornaments . 
 Colton Point State Park is in the West Branch Susquehanna River drainage basin , the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian @-@ speaking Susquehannocks . They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses , and " occasionally inhabited " the mountains surrounding the Pine Creek Gorge . Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois , and by 1675 they had died out , moved away , or been assimilated into other tribes . 
 After this , the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois . The Iroquois lived in long houses , primarily in what is now New York , and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers . They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge , traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north , and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south . The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there . They used the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it , including one just north of the park near what would later be the village of Ansonia . To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks , the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed , including the Shawnee and Lenape ( or Delaware ) . 
 The French and Indian War ( 1754 – 63 ) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin . On November 5 , 1768 , the British acquired the New Purchase from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix , including what is now the Pine Creek Gorge east of the creek . The Purchase line established by this treaty was disputed , as it was unclear whether the border along " Tiadaghton Creek " referred to Pine Creek or to Lycoming Creek , further to the east . As a result , the land between them was disputed territory until 1784 and the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix . After the American Revolutionary War , Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania ; some isolated bands of natives remained in Pine Creek Gorge until the War of 1812 .

 Prior to the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682 , up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods : more than 31 @,@ 000 square miles ( 80 @,@ 000 km2 ) of eastern white pine , eastern hemlock , and a mix of hardwoods . The forests near the three original counties , Philadelphia , Bucks , and Chester , were the first to be harvested , as the early settlers used the readily available timber and cleared land for agriculture . By the time of the American Revolution , logging had reached the interior and mountainous regions , and became a leading industry in Pennsylvania . Trees furnished fuel to heat homes , tannin for the state 's many tanneries , and wood for construction , furniture , and barrel making . Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces . Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber , as were a wide variety of household utensils , and the first Conestoga wagons . 
 By the early 19th century the demand for lumber reached the Pine Creek Gorge , where the surrounding mountainsides were covered with eastern white pine 3 to 6 feet ( 1 to 2 m ) in diameter and 150 feet ( 50 m ) or more tall , eastern hemlock 9 feet ( 3 m ) in circumference , and huge hardwoods . Each acre ( 0 @.@ 4 ha ) of these virgin forests produced 100 @,@ 000 board feet ( 200 m3 ) of white pine and 200 @,@ 000 board feet ( 500 m3 ) of hemlock and hardwoods . For comparison , the same area of forest today produces a total of only 5 @,@ 000 board feet ( 10 m3 ) on average . According to Steven E. Owlett , environmental lawyer and author , shipbuilders considered pine from Pine Creek the " best timber in the world for making fine ship masts " , so it was the first lumber to be harvested on a large scale . The original title to the land that became Colton Point State Park was sold to the Wilhelm Wilkins Company in 1792 . Pine Creek was declared a public highway by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 16 , 1798 , and rafts of spars were floated down the creek to the Susquehanna River , then to the Chesapeake Bay and the shipbuilders at Baltimore . The lumbermen would then walk home , following the old Pine Creek Path at the end of their journey . 
 As the 19th century progressed , fewer pines were left and more hemlocks and hardwoods were cut and processed locally . By 1810 there were 11 sawmills in the Pine Creek watershed , and by 1840 there were 145 , despite a flood in 1832 which wiped out nearly all the mills along the creek . Selective harvesting of pines was replaced by clearcutting of all lumber in a tract . The first lumbering activity close to what is now Colton Point was in 1838 when William Dodge and partners built a settlement at Big Meadows and formed the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company . Dodge 's company purchased thousands of acres of land in the area , including what is now Colton Point State Park . In 1865 the last pine spar raft floated down the creek , and on March 28 , 1871 the General Assembly passed a law which allowed construction of splash dams and allowed creeks to be cleared to allow loose logs to float better . The earliest spring log drives floated up to 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 board feet ( 50 @,@ 000 m3 ) of logs in Pine Creek at one time . These logs floated to the West Branch Susquehanna River and to sawmills near the Susquehanna Boom at Williamsport . Log drives could be dangerous : just north of the park is Barbour Rock , named for Samuel Barbour , who lost his life on Pine Creek there after breaking up a log jam . Hemlock wood was not widely used until the advent of wire nails , but the bark was used to tan leather . After 1870 the largest tanneries in the world were in the Pine Creek watershed , and required 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 900 kg ) of bark to produce 150 pounds ( 70 kg ) of quality sole leather . 
 In 1879 Henry Colton , who worked for the Williamsport Lumber Company , supervised the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings ; this land would later become the park . Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge . Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century . Fourmile Run flows through the park : its O 'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper 's brothers , who were loggers in the area . 
 In 1883 the Jersey Shore , Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway opened , following the creek through the gorge . The new railroad used the relatively level route along Pine Creek to link the New York Central Railroad ( NYC ) to the north with the Clearfield Coalfield to the southwest , and with NYC @-@ allied lines in Williamsport to the southeast . By 1896 the rail line 's daily traffic included three passenger trains and 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 short tons ( 6 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 t ) of freight . In the surrounding forests , log drives gave way to logging railroads , which transported lumber to local sawmills . There were 13 companies operating logging railroads along Pine Creek and its tributaries between 1886 and 1921 , while the last log drive in the Pine Creek watershed started on Little Pine Creek in 1905 . By 1900 the Leetonia logging railroad was extended to the headwaters of Fourmile Run , which has several high waterfalls that prevented logs from being floated down it . In 1903 the line reached Colton Point and Bear Run , which is the northern border of the park today . Lumber on Fourmile Run that had been previously inaccessible was harvested and transported by train , initially to Leonard Harrison 's mill at Tiadaghton . When that mill burned in 1905 , the lumber went to the Leetonia mill on Cedar Run in Elk Township . 
 The old @-@ growth forests were clearcut by the early 20th century and the gorge was stripped bare . Nothing was left except the dried @-@ out tree tops , which became a fire hazard . As a result , much of the land burned and was left barren . On May 6 , 1903 , the Wellsboro newspaper had the headline " Wild Lands <unk> " and reported landslides through the gorge . The soil was depleted of nutrients , fires baked the ground hard , and jungles of blueberries , blackberries , and mountain laurel covered the clearcut land , which became known as the " Pennsylvania Desert " . Floods swept the area periodically and much of the wildlife was wiped out .

 George Washington Sears , an early conservationist who wrote under the pen name " Nessmuk " , was one of the first to criticize the Pennsylvania lumber industry and its destruction of forests and creeks . In his 1884 book Woodcraft he wrote of the Pine Creek watershed where 
 A huge tannery ... poisons and blackens the stream with chemicals , bark and ooze . ... The once fine covers and thickets are converted into fields thickly dotted with blackened stumps . And , to crown the desolation , heavy laden trains of ' The Pine Creek and Jersey Shore R.R. ' go thundering [ by ] almost hourly ... Of course , this is progress ; but , whether backward or forward , had better be decided sixty years hence . 
 Nessmuk 's words went mostly unheeded in his lifetime and did not prevent the clearcutting of almost all the virgin forests in Pennsylvania . 
 Sears lived in Wellsboro from 1844 until his death in 1890 , and was the first to describe the Pine Creek Gorge . He also described a trip to what became Leonard Harrison State Park and the view west across the gorge to what became Colton Point State Park : after a 6 @-@ mile ( 10 km ) buggy ride , he had to hike 7 miles ( 11 km ) through tangles of fallen trees and branches , down ravines , and over banks for five hours . At last he reached " The Point " , which he wrote was " the jutting terminus of a high ridge which not only commands a capital view of the opposite mountain , but also of the Pine Creek Valley , up and down for miles " . 
 The land on which Colton Point State Park sits was sold to the Commonwealth in the late 19th century for $ 2 @.@ 50 per acre ( $ 6 @.@ 25 per ha ) by the Pennsylvania Joint Land and Lumber Company , which had no further use for it . Elsewhere in the gorge the state bought land abandoned by lumber companies , sometimes for less than $ 2 per acre ( $ 5 per ha ) . These purchases became the Tioga State Forest , which was officially established in 1925 . As of 2015 the state forest encompasses 165 @,@ 052 acres ( 66 @,@ 794 ha ) , mostly in Tioga County , and surrounds Colton Point State Park to the north , west , and south . Leonard Harrison State Park is on the eastern border of Colton Point . In 1922 , Wellsboro lumber baron Leonard Harrison donated his picnic grounds on the eastern rim of the gorge to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , which named it " Leonard Harrison State Forest Park " . 
 Harrison also built two cabins , named " <unk> " and " <unk> " , on the west side of Pine Creek , just north of the mouth of Fourmile Run . Sometime after 1903 , former Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone built a cabin named " Heart 's @-@ ease " just south of the mouth of Fourmile Run . In 1966 these cabins were still standing and were three of " only four man @-@ made structures inside the canyon proper " , but by 1993 only Stone 's cabin and one of Harrison 's cabins remained . As of 2004 , these properties were still owned by the Stone family , and are part of a small parcel of private land within the park .

 The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) started work on the park in June 1935 , and it opened as " Colton Point State Forest Park " in 1936 . The CCC , founded by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression , created jobs for unemployed young men from throughout the United States . Much of the work of the CCC at Colton Point is still visible as of 2015 , and is one of many examples of the work of the CCC throughout northcentral Pennsylvania . 
 In 1936 , the year the park opened , Larry Woodin of Wellsboro and other Tioga County business owners began a tourism campaign to promote the Pine Creek Gorge as " The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania " . Greyhound Bus Lines featured a view of the canyon from a Leonard Harrison lookout on the back cover of its Atlantic Coast timetable . The bus line 's Chicago to New York City tour had an overnight stay in Wellsboro and a morning visit to the canyon for $ 3 . More than 300 @,@ 000 tourists visited the canyon by the autumn of 1936 , and 15 @,@ 000 visited Leonard Harrison over Memorial Day weekend in 1937 . That year more visitors came to the Pine Creek Gorge than to Yellowstone National Park . In response to the heavy use of the local roads , the CCC widened the highways in the area , and guides from the CCC gave tours of the canyon . 
 Colton Point originally opened with only " limited facilities " , but the success of the tourism campaign led to the park 's expansion by the CCC . New facilities were added in 1938 , and included buildings such as picnic pavilions , latrines , and a concession stand , as well as " stone cook stoves , tables , and developed trails and overlooks ... an amazing amount of work in one year " . The CCC also built the road to the park and planted stands of larch , spruce and white pine for reforestation . On February 12 , 1987 , the entire 368 @-@ acre ( 149 ha ) park was listed in the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) , including " eight buildings and nine structures " . 
 The park has five CCC @-@ built picnic shelters : pavilions 1 , 3 , and 4 are made of stone and timber with stone fireplaces , while pavilions 2 and 5 each has log columns that support a pyramidal roof . The CCC also built six rustic latrines with clapboard siding and gable roofs , and an underground reservoir that is covered with a low hipped roof . Additional structures constructed by the CCC include three overlooks and a rectangular gable @-@ roofed maintenance building with wane edge siding and exposed rafters made of logs . The structures built by the CCC are noteworthy in that they exemplify the rustic style of construction that was prevalent at national and state parks built during the Great Depression . Workers used locally found , natural materials in construction that blended with the natural surroundings . Not all of the CCC 's work has survived . A concession stand was built by the CCC and sold food and souvenirs from the late 1930s to at least 1953 , but was not listed on the 1986 NRHP nomination form . The CCC also built a brick and stone incinerator , but it is in ruins now . 
 The Pennsylvania Geographic Board dropped the word " Forest " and officially named it " Colton Point State Park " on November 11 , 1954 . The first major change in the park was in 1970 , when a camping area was established . That same decade saw the completion of a new water system in 1973 , and a holding tank dump station was added to the camping area in 1977 . A park office was built in 1983 , but as of 2009 the park headquarters are in the adjoining Leonard Harrison State Park and the Colton Point office does not appear on the official park map . Pine Creek was named a state scenic river on December 4 , 1992 , which ensured further protection of Pine Creek Gorge in its natural state . In 1997 the park 's Important Bird Area ( IBA ) was one of the first 73 IBAs established in Pennsylvania . In 2000 the park became part of the Hills Creek State Park complex , an administrative grouping of eight state parks in Potter and Tioga counties . As of 2004 , the park does not have telephone or electrical lines , although it uses solar cells for limited electricity needs . 
 The second half of the 20th century also saw significant changes to the rail line through the Pine Creek Gorge . Regular passenger service on the canyon line ended after the Second World War , and in 1960 the second set of train tracks was removed . Conrail abandoned the section of the railroad that passed through the gorge on September 21 , 1988 . The right @-@ of @-@ way eventually became the Pine Creek Rail Trail , which follows the path of the former Pine Creek Path . The first section of the rail trail opened in 1996 and included the 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) section in the park : as of 2015 the Pine Creek Rail Trail is 62 miles ( 100 km ) long . 
 Colton Point State Park continued to attract national attention in the post @-@ war era . The New York Times featured the park and its " breath @-@ taking views of the gorge " as well as its trails and location in the wilds of the state forest in a 1950 article , and in 1966 praised the whitewater boating on Pine Creek and the park 's " outstanding look @-@ out points " . The Pine Creek Gorge , including Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) section of Tioga State Forest , was named a National Natural Landmark ( NNL ) in April 1968 . A 1973 New York Times article on whitewater canoeing noted the damage along Pine Creek done by Hurricane Agnes the year before . Another Times story in 2002 noted the park for its beauty and wildlife , and cited it as a starting point for hiking the West Rim Trail . 
 In the new millennium , the two state parks on either side of the Pine Creek Gorge are frequently treated as one . A 2002 New York Times article called Colton Point and Leonard Harrison state parks " Two State Parks , Divided by a Canyon " and noted their " overlooks offer the most spectacular views " . Colton Point and Leonard Harrison were each included in the list of state parks chosen by the DCNR Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " list . The DCNR describes how they " offer spectacular vistas and a fabulous view of Pine Creek Gorge , also known as Pennsylvania 's Grand Canyon " . It goes on to praise their inclusion in a National Natural Landmark and State Park Natural Area , hiking and trails , and the Pine Creek Rail Trail and bicycling . 
 = = Pine Creek Gorge = = 
 Colton Point State Park lies on the west side of the Pine Creek Gorge , also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania . A sister park , Leonard Harrison State Park , is on the east side , and the two parks combined form essentially one large park that includes parts of the gorge and creek and parts of the plateau dissected by the gorge . Pine Creek has carved the gorge nearly 47 miles ( 76 km ) through the dissected Allegheny Plateau in northcentral Pennsylvania . The canyon begins in southwestern Tioga County , just south of the village of Ansonia , and continues south to near the village of Waterville in Lycoming County . The depth of the gorge in Colton Point State Park is about 800 feet ( 240 m ) and it measures nearly 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) across . 
 The Pine Creek Gorge National Natural Landmark includes Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and parts of the Tioga State Forest along 12 miles ( 19 km ) of Pine Creek between Ansonia and Blackwell . This federal program does not provide any extra protection beyond that offered by the land owner . The National Park Service 's designation of the gorge as a National Natural Landmark notes that it " contains superlative scenery , geological and ecological value , and is one of the finest examples of a deep gorge in the eastern United States . " 
 The gorge is also protected by the state of Pennsylvania as the 12 @,@ 163 @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 922 ha ) Pine Creek Gorge Natural Area , which is the second largest State Natural Area in Pennsylvania . Within this area , 699 acres ( 283 ha ) of Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks are designated a State Park Natural Area . The state Natural Area runs along Pine Creek from Darling Run in the north ( just below Ansonia ) to Jerry Run in the south ( just above Blackwell ) . It is approximately 12 miles ( 19 km ) long and 2 miles ( 3 km ) wide , with state forest roads providing all of the western border and part of the eastern border . 
 Within the park , Pine Creek and the walls of the gorge " visible from the opposite shoreline " are also protected by the state as a Pennsylvania Scenic River . In 1968 Pine Creek was one of only 27 rivers originally designated as eligible to be included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System , and one of only eight specifically mentioned in the law establishing the program . Before Pine Creek could be included in the federal program , the state enacted its State Scenic Rivers Act , then asked that Pine Creek be withdrawn from the national designation . There was much local opposition to its inclusion , based at least partly on mistaken fears that protection would involve seizure of private property and restricted access . Eventually this opposition was overcome , but Pennsylvania did not officially include it as one of its own state Scenic and Wild Rivers until November 25 , 1992 . The state treated Pine Creek as a state scenic river between 1968 and 1992 . It protected the creek from dam @-@ building and water withdrawals for power plants , and added public access points to reduce trespassing on private property by visitors to the creek . 
 = = Geology and climate = = 
 Although the rock formations exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge are at least 300 million years old , the gorge itself formed about 20 @,@ 000 years ago , in the last ice age . Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then , but was dammed by rocks , soil , ice , and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier . The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia , and the lake 's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam , reversing the flow of Pine Creek . The creek flooded to the south and quickly carved a deep channel on its way to the West Branch Susquehanna River . 
 The park is at an elevation of 1 @,@ 637 feet ( 499 m ) on the Allegheny Plateau , which formed in the Alleghenian orogeny some 300 million years ago , when Gondwana ( specifically what became Africa ) and what became North America collided , forming Pangaea . Although the gorge and its surroundings seem to be mountainous , the area is a dissected plateau . Years of erosion have cut away the soft rocks , forming the valleys , and left the hardest of the ancient rocks relatively untouched on the top of sharp ridges , giving them the appearance of " mountains " . 
 The land on which Colton Point State Park sits was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America . The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded , causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay , sand and gravel . Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Pine Creek drainage basin : sandstone , shale , conglomerates , limestone , and coal . 
 Five major rock formations present in Colton Point State Park are from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods . The youngest of these , which forms the highest points in the park and along the gorge , is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation , a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone , siltstone , and shale , as well as anthracite coal . Low @-@ sulfur coal was once mined at three locations within the Pine Creek watershed . Below this is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation , which is formed with grayish @-@ red shale , siltstone , sandstone , and conglomerate . <unk> were once carved from the exposed sections of this conglomerate . Together the Pottsville and Mauch Chunk formations are some 300 feet ( 91 m ) thick . 
 Next below these is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation , which is made of relatively soft grayish @-@ red shale and olive @-@ gray sandstone . This is relatively hard rock and forms many of the ridges . Below this is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation , about 760 feet ( 230 m ) thick and some 375 million years old . This layer is relatively soft and easily eroded , which helped to form the Pine Creek Gorge . Cliffs formed by the Huntley Mountain and Catskill formations are visible north of the park at Barbour Rock . The lowest and oldest layer is the Lock Haven Formation , which is gray to green @-@ brown siltstone and shale over 400 million years old . It forms the base of the gorge , contains marine fossils , and is up to 600 feet ( 180 m ) thick . 
 The Allegheny Plateau has a continental climate , with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges of 20 ° F ( 11 ° C ) in winter and 26 ° F ( 14 ° C ) in summer . The mean annual precipitation for the Pine Creek watershed is 36 to 42 inches ( 914 to 1 @,@ 070 mm ) . The highest recorded temperature at the park was 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) in 1936 , and the record low was − 30 ° F ( − 34 ° C ) in 1934 . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Descriptions from early explorers and settlers give some idea of what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut . The forest was up to 85 percent hemlock and white pine ; hardwoods made up the rest of the forest . The area was inhabited by a large number of animal species , many of which have vanished by the end of the 20th century . A herd of 12 @,@ 000 American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773 . Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves , lynx , wolverines , panthers , fishers , bobcats and foxes ; all are locally extinct except for the last three as of 2007 . The area had herds of elk and deer , and large numbers of black bears , river otters , and beavers . In 1794 , two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe . Further upstream , insects forced them to do the same . 
 The virgin forests cooled the land and streams . The creeks and runs flowed more evenly year @-@ round , since centuries of accumulated organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into them . Pine Creek was home to large numbers of fish , including trout , but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad , salmon , and eels once found here by blocking their migrations . Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests , but there was also a great deal of hunting , with bounties paid for large predators .

 While Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and parts of the surrounding Tioga State Forest are now the Pine Creek Gorge National Natural Landmark , it is their status as part of a Pennsylvania State Natural Area that provides the strongest protection for them . Within this Natural Area , logging , mining , and drilling for oil and gas are prohibited . Furthermore , only foot trail access is allowed . In 1988 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources , precursor to the DCNR , described it as 
 about 95 % State owned , <unk> , and designated the Pine Creek Gorge Natural Area . It is a place of unique geologic history and contains some rare plant communities , an old growth hemlock stand , ... active bald eagle nest [ s ] ... and is a major site of river otter reintroduction . Departmental policy is protection of the natural values of the Canyon from development and overuse , and restoration of the area to as near a natural condition as possible . 
 The gorge has over 225 species of wildflowers , plants and trees , with scattered stands of old growth forest on some of its steepest walls . The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old . Since clearcutting , nearly 90 percent of the forest land has burnt at least once . Typical south @-@ facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees , while north @-@ facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods . Large chestnuts and black cherry can also be found . 
 The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania is known for its fall foliage , and Colton Point State Park is a popular place to observe the colors , with the first three weeks of October as the best time to see the leaves in their full color . Red leaves are found on red maple , black cherry , and red oak , while orange and yellow leaves are on black walnut , sugar maple , tulip poplar , chestnut oak , aspen and birch , and brown leaves are from beech , white oak , and eastern black oak trees . Despite the logging , there are some old @-@ growth hardwoods and hemlocks on Fourmile Run . Plants of " special concern " in Pennsylvania that are found in the gorge include Jacob 's ladder , wild pea , and hemlock parsley . 
 There are over 40 species of mammals in the Pine Creek Gorge . Colton Point State Park 's extensive forest cover makes it a habitat for " big woods " wildlife , including white @-@ tailed deer , black bear , wild turkey , red and gray squirrels . Less common creatures include bobcats , coyote , fishers , river otters , and timber rattlesnakes . There are over 26 species of fish in Pine Creek , including trout , suckers , fallfish , and rock bass . Other aquatic species include crayfish and frogs . 
 Several species have been reintroduced to the gorge . White @-@ tailed deer were imported from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish what had once been a thriving population . The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced since 1906 , after the lumbermen had moved out of the area . The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas . River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge . Despite the otters ' diet of 5 percent trout , some anglers fear the animals would deplete the game fish in the gorge . 
 Fishers , medium @-@ sized weasels , were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as part of an effort to establish a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania . Prior to the lumber era , fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania . They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory , including porcupines . Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon . Coyotes have come back on their own . Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae , which eat all the leaves off trees , especially oaks , and hemlock woolly <unk> , which weaken and kill hemlocks . Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed .

 Colton Point State Park is part of Important Bird Area # 28 , which encompasses 31 @,@ 790 acres ( 12 @,@ 860 ha ) of both publicly and private held land . State managed acreage accounts for 68 percent of the total area and includes Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks and the surrounding Tioga State Forest lands . The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated all 368 acres ( 149 ha ) of Colton Point State Park as part of the IBA , which is an area designated as a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations . 
 Ornithologists and bird watchers have recorded a total of 128 species of birds in the IBA . Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed : there is a large area of forest in the IBA , as well as great habitat diversity , with 343 acres ( 139 ha ) of open water that is used by many of the birds , especially bald eagles . The location of the IBA along the Pine Creek Gorge also contributes to the diverse bird populations . 
 In addition to bald eagles , which live in the IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there , the IBA is home to belted kingfishers , scarlet tanagers , black @-@ throated blue warblers , common mergansers , blue and green herons , hermit thrushes , and wood ducks . Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods . The woodlands are inhabited by wild turkeys and Pennsylvania 's state bird the ruffed grouse . Swainson 's thrush breeds in the IBA and the Northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge . 
 A variety of warblers is found in Colton Point State Park . The Pennsylvania Audubon Society states that Pine Creek Gorge is " especially rich in warbler species , including Pine , Black @-@ throated blue , Black @-@ throated green , Blackburnian , and Black @-@ and @-@ white . " Many of these smaller birds are more often heard than seen as they keep away from the trails and overlooks .

 Colton Point State Park has some challenging hikes in and around the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania , with 4 @.@ 0 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of trails that feature very rugged terrain , pass close to steep cliffs , and can be very slick in some areas . Governor Robert P. Casey took a hiking tour of the park in July 1990 , and in 2003 the DCNR reported that 18 @,@ 239 people used the trails in the park . 
 Rim Trail is a relatively flat 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) loop trail , which follows the perimeter of Colton Point and links all of the canyon viewing areas . 
 Turkey Path is a difficult trail , 3 miles ( 5 km ) long ( down and back within the park ) , that follows Four Mile Run down the side of the canyon , descending over 800 feet ( 240 m ) to Pine Creek and the rail trail at the bottom of the gorge . It was originally a mule drag used to haul timber to the creek . There is a 70 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 21 m ) cascading waterfall about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) down the trail . The park website classifies it as a " down and back trail " since there is no bridge across Pine Creek . The Turkey Path continues in Leonard Harrison State Park , going from a point on Pine Creek just downstream of the end of the trail in Colton Point up to the <unk> Harrison overlook on the east rim of the gorge . According to Owlett , the creek can be forded with care when the water is low , and the Turkey Path connects the two parks . 
 Pine Creek Rail Trail is a 62 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 100 km ) rail trail from Wellsboro Junction , just north of Wellsboro , south through the Pine Creek Gorge to Jersey Shore : 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of this trail is in Colton Point and Leonard Harrison State Parks . A 2001 article in USA Today said the scenic beauty of the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania made the trail one of " 10 great places to take a bike tour " in the world . 
 West Rim Trail is a 30 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 49 @.@ 1 km ) hiking trail that runs along the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge from near the village of Ansonia in the north to Rattlesnake Rock near the village of Blackwell in the south . It is mostly on Tioga State Forest land , but passes through the extreme north of the park and then forms the western border of the park in the south . When the West Rim Trail opened in 1982 , it was 21 miles ( 34 km ) long and ended just south of the park , but it was extended 9 miles ( 14 km ) north in 1985 , passing through Colton Point . It was chosen by Outside Magazine as its " Best Hike in Pennsylvania " in April 1996 .

 Fishing is permitted at Colton Point State Park . Anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek . The species of fish found in Pine Creek are trout , smallmouth bass , and some panfish . There are several small trout streams that are accessible from within the park . Historically , the stretch of Pine Creek in the park has been fished by notable anglers , including President Theodore Roosevelt and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone . 
 Edward Gertler writes in Keystone Canoeing that Pine Creek " is possibly Pennsylvania 's most famous canoe stream " and attributes this partly to the thousands who decide to boat on it after they " peer into Pine Creek 's spectacular abyss from the overlooks of Leonard Harrison and Colton Point state parks " . The park contains 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of Pine Creek , which is classified as Class 1 to Class 2 whitewater .

 " Call the Shots " is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud from their fourth studio album , Tangled Up ( 2007 ) . The song was written by Miranda Cooper , with inspiration from an article about the advance of women in business , and Brian Higgins , Tim Powell , Lisa Cowling , and Giselle Somerville also received songwriting credits . Polydor Records originally intended to release it as a single for The Sound of Girls Aloud : The Greatest Hits ( 2006 ) ; however , " Something Kinda Ooooh " was selected instead . In September 2007 , " Call the Shots " leaked online , and on 26 November of the same year , it was released as the second single from Tangled Up through Fascination Records , a week after the album 's release . 
 Produced by Xenomania , the dance @-@ pop and pop rock song showcases a more mature side from Girls Aloud , and received positive reviews from music critics , with one deeming it as the " greatest pop song of the 21st century " . In 2008 , the song won the award for the Popjustice £ 20 Music Prize , an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer ( s ) of the best British pop single of the past year . " Call the Shots " proved to be commercially successful upon its release , charting at number three on the UK Singles Chart , continuing the band 's string of hits by becoming their sixteenth consecutive single to chart within the top ten , and being later certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry . The song also peaked at number nine on the Irish Singles Chart . 
 The accompanying music video was directed by Sean de Sparengo , and features the girls in purple dresses performing on Malibu Beach at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them . Each member of the band is also shown other locations , following several story lines . " Call the Shots " was promoted through numerous live appearances , including a high @-@ profile performance on The X Factor , and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud 's subsequent concert tours . Several artists and bands including Coldplay and Mark Morriss have covered the song .

 The first part of " Call the Shots " to be composed was the instrumentation , which was done by Xenomania in 2005 . The lyrics of the song were written in 2006 , when songwriter Miranda Cooper was " inspired by an article she read on something called ( coincidentally ) the Miranda Complex , named after the ambitious lawyer in Sex and the City , about how women are earning more than men and pushing ahead . " Polydor Records originally intended to release it as a single for The Sound of Girls Aloud : The Greatest Hits ( 2006 ) the same year , but was deemed " too downbeat , when a greatest hits single needs to be a celebration . " Nicola Roberts , Cheryl Cole , Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh recorded vocals for the song in London , England , while Nadine Coyle recorded her vocals in Los Angeles . Cole deemed the song her favourite from Tangled Up , adding that it gave her " goosebumps " . An early version of " Call the Shots " leaked online in September 2007 . On 16 November 2007 , Tangled Up was released , with " Call the Shots " being released for digital download on 26 November 2007 , through Polydor Records , while it was also made available on two different CD single formats the same day . The first disc included a live cover version of Amy Winehouse 's 2007 single " Rehab " , as performed on the BBC Radio 1 programme Jo Whiley 's Live Lounge . The second CD format featured an original composition entitled " Blow Your Cover " , co @-@ written by Girls Aloud with Xenomania . The Tony <unk> Remix of " Call the Shots " was being included on the CD single also at first , however , the Xenomania Club Mix was selected instead . The Tony <unk> Remix was then included on the Singles Box Set , released in 2009 .

 " Call the Shots " is a dance @-@ pop and pop rock track written in the key of D major and with a moderate tempo of 126 beats per minute . Unlike previous singles released by the band , the song follows the verse – chorus form . The lyrics are concerned with the ending of a relationship , and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing , " Static tone on the phone , I 'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe " . As the chorus begins , the five members of the group trade lines and sing , " Just ' cause you 're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn 't faze me how you spend your time " , with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that " only anterograde amnesia could wipe [ this part ] from your brain " . During the middle @-@ eight , Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud 's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story , released in 2008 : " I 've seen life burn bright , seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer , oh no / I 've seen life flow by like a river / So full of twilight , dreams that glitter " . Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of " Call the Shots " was based on 1990s dance productions , and added that it incorporated " oohs " and " ah ah ahs " that " reverberate around an infectious chorus , " while John Lucas of Allmusic wrote that the song showcased a more mature side from Girls Aloud .

 = Árpád = 
 Árpád ( Hungarian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; c . 845 – c . 907 ) was the head of the confederation of the Hungarian tribes at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries . He may have been either the sacred ruler or kende of the Hungarians , or their military leader or gyula , although most details of his life are debated by historians , because different sources contain contradictory information . Despite this , many Hungarians refer to him as the " founder of our country " , and Árpád 's preeminent role in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin has been emphasized by some later chronicles . The dynasty descending from Árpád ruled the Kingdom of Hungary until 1301 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Árpád was the son of Álmos who is mentioned as the first head of the confederation of the Hungarian tribes by all Hungarian chronicles . His mother 's name and family are unknown . According to historian Gyula Kristó , Árpád was born around 845 . His name derived from the Hungarian word for barley ( <unk> ) . 
 The Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus ( r . 913 – 959 ) states that the Hungarians " had never at any time had any other prince " before Árpád , which is in sharp contrast to the Hungarian chronicles ' report of the position of Árpád 's father . In Porphyrogenitus 's narration , the Khazar khagan initiated the centralization of the command of the Hungarian tribes in order to strengthen his own suzerainty over them . The khagan initially wanted to appoint a chieftain named Levedi to lead the Hungarians . However , Levedi did not accept this offer and suggested that either Álmos or Árpád should be promoted instead of him . The khagan approached the Hungarians with this new proposal . They preferred Árpád to his father , because he was " greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour , and capable of this rule " . Thereafter , Árpád was made " prince according to the custom ... of the Chazars , by lifting him upon a shield . " Constantine Porphyrogenitus refers to Árpád as " great prince of Hungary " ( Greek : μέγας <unk> <unk> ) . 
 The reliability of the Byzantine emperor 's report of Árpád 's election is debated by modern historians : for instance , Victor Spinei states that it is " rather vague and scarcely credible " , but András Róna @-@ Tas writes that its core is reliable . The latter historian adds that Árpád 's election was promoted by Álmos who forced Levedi kende to renounce . Accordingly , in Róna @-@ Tas 's view , Árpád succeeded Levedi as sacred ruler or kende , which enabled his father to preserve his own position of the actual leader of the Hungarians or gyula . 
 = = = Towards the Hungarian Conquest = = = 
 The earliest reliable source of Árpád 's life is an early 10th @-@ century document , the Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk . It narrates that the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise ( r . 886 – 912 ) sent his envoy Nicetas Sclerus to the Hungarians in 894 or 895 " to give presents " and incite them against the Bulgarian Empire . Sclerus met with their two leaders , Árpád and Kurszán , at the Lower Danube . Sclerus 's mission succeeded : a Hungarian army soon crossed the Danube on Byzantine ships against Bulgaria . An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus 's text suggests that the invading Hungarians were under the command of Árpád 's son , Liüntika . 
 The positions held by Árpád and Kurszán at the time of their negotiations with Sclerus are debated by historians . Spinei wrote that Árpád was the gyula , and Kurszán was the kende . In contrast , Kristó said that Kurszán was the gyula and Árpád represented his father , Álmos kende . 
 At that time , the Bulgarians had disregarded the peace treaty and were raiding through the Thracian countryside . Justice pursued them for breaking their oath to Christ our God , the emperor of all , and they quickly met up with their punishment . While our forces were engaged against the Saracens , divine Providence led the [ Hungarians ] , in place of the Romans , to campaign against the Bulgarians . Our Majesty 's fleet of ships supported them and ferried them across the Danube . [ Providence ] sent them out against the army of the Bulgarians that had so wickedly taken up arms against Christians and , as though they were public executioners , they decisively defeated them in three engagements , so that the Christian Romans might not willingly stain themselves with the blood of the Christian Bulgarians . 
 The Hungarian army defeated the Bulgarians , but the latter hired the Pechenegs against them . The Bulgarians and Pechenegs simultaneously invaded the Hungarians ' territories in the western regions of the Pontic steppes in 895 or 896 . The destruction of their dwelling places by the Pechenegs forced the Hungarians to leave for a new homeland across the Carpathian Mountains towards the Pannonian Plain . 
 The Illuminated Chronicle says that Árpád 's father Álmos " could not enter Pannonia , for he was killed in Erdelw " or Transylvania . Engel , Kristó and Molnár , who accept the reliability of this report , wrote that Álmos 's death was a ritual murder , similar to the sacrifice of the Khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people . In contrast with them , Róna @-@ Tas states that even if the report on Álmos 's murder " reflects true event , the only possible explanation would be that Árpád or someone in his entourage " killed the aged prince . Spinei rejects the Illuminated Chronicle 's report on Álmos 's murder in Transylvania , because the last mention of Álmos in the contrasting narration of the Gesta Hungarorum is connected to a siege of Ungvár ( Uzhhorod , Ukraine ) by the Hungarians . The latter chronicle says that Álmos appointed Árpád " as leader and master " of the Hungarians on this occasion . 
 = = = Reign = = = 
 Árpád 's name " is completely unknown " to all sources written in East Francia , which was one of the main powers of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries . These sources , including the Annales Alamannici and the Annales <unk> , only mention an other Hungarian leader , Kurszán . According to Kristó and other historians , these sources suggest that Kurszán must have been the gyula commanding the Hungarian forces , while Árpád succeeded his murdered father as the sacred kende . Proposing a contrasting theory , the Romanian historian Curta wrote that Kurszán was the kende and Árpád gyula only succeeded him when Kurszán was murdered by Bavarians in 902 or 904 . 
 In contrast to nearly contemporaneous sources , Hungarian chronicles written centuries after the events — for instance , the Gesta Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle — emphasize Árpád 's pre @-@ eminent role in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin . The Gesta Hungarorum also highlights Árpád 's military skills and his generosity . This chronicle also emphasizes that Tétény , one of the heads of the seven Hungarian tribes , acquired " the land of Transylvania for himself and his posterity " only after Árpád had authorized him to conquer it . 
 Having crossed the Danube , they encamped beside the Danube as far as <unk> . Hearing this , all the Romans living throughout the land of Pannonia , saved their lives by flight . Next day , Prince Árpád and all his leading men with all the warriors of Hungary entered the city of King Attila and they saw all the royal palaces , some ruined to the foundations , others not , and they admired beyond measure the stone buildings and were happier than can be told that they had deserved to take without fighting the city of King Attila , of whose line Prince Árpád descended . They feasted every day with great joy in the palace of King Attila , sitting alongside one another , and all the melodies and sweet sounds of zithers and pipes along with all the songs of minstrels were presented to them ... Prince Árpád gave great lands and properties to the guests staying with them , and , when they heard this , many guests thronged to him and gladly stayed with him . 
 The Gesta Hungarorum says that Árpád took " an oath of the leading men and warriors of Hungary , " and " had his son , Prince Zoltán elevated " to prince in his life . However , the reliability of this report and the list of the grand princes in the Gesta Hungarorum is dubious . For instance , it ignores Fajsz , who ruled when Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus was completing his De Administrando Imperio around 950 . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 The date of Árpád 's death is debated . The Gesta Hungarorum states that he died in 907 . However , Kristó wrote that he actually died in 900 or later because the Gesta says 903 is the starting date of the Hungarian " land @-@ taking " instead of its actual date around 895 . If the Gesta 's report on his funeral is reliable , Árpád was buried " at the head of a small river that flows through a stone culvert to the city of King Attila " where a village , <unk> , developed near Buda a century later . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Hungarians arrived in their new homeland within the Carpathians under Árpád . Árpád is the principal actor in the Gesta Hungarorum , which attributes " almost all memorable events " of the " Hungarian land @-@ taking " to him . Furthermore , until the extinction of the male line of his dynasty in 1301 , Hungary was ruled by " a single line of princes " , all descending from Árpád . Árpád is still famed among the Hungarians as <unk> or the " founder of our country " . 
 = = Family = = 
 Porphyrogenitus says Árpád " had four sons : first , <unk> ; second , <unk> ; third , <unk> ; fourth , <unk> " . However , he also refers to one " <unk> , son of " Árpád ; Kristó wrote that <unk> ( Liüntika ) was an alternative name of <unk> ( <unk> ) . The name and family of the mother of Árpád 's sons are unknown . The following is a family tree presenting Árpád 's ancestors and his descendants to the end of the 10th century : 
 * Liüntika and <unk> are supposed to have been identical . * * The father of Tas was one of Árpád 's four or five sons , but his name is unknown . * * * All later grand princes and kings of Hungary descended from Taksony . 
 = James B. Longacre = 
 James Barton Longacre ( August 11 , 1794 – January 1 , 1869 ) was an American portraitist and engraver , and from 1844 until his death the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint . Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent , which entered commerce in 1859 , and for the designs of the Shield nickel , Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 Longacre was born in Delaware County , Pennsylvania in 1794 . He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12 , becoming an apprentice in a bookstore . His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm . He struck out on his own in 1819 , making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books . He portrayed the leading men of his day ; support from some of them , such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun , led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844 . 
 In Longacre 's first years as a chief engraver , the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale . Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle , with both to be designed by Longacre . Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired , but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained . Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s , ending the conflict . 
 In 1856 , Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent . When that design proved difficult to strike , Longacre was responsible for the replacement , the Indian Head cent , issued beginning in 1859 . Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three @-@ cent pieces , the Shield nickel , and the two @-@ cent piece . In 1866 – 1867 , he redesigned the coins of Chile . Longacre died suddenly on New Year 's Day 1869 ; he was succeeded by William Barber . Longacre 's coins are generally well @-@ regarded today , although they have been criticized for lack of artistic advancement .

 James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in Delaware County , Pennsylvania on August 11 , 1794 . His mother Sarah ( Barton ) Longacre died early in his life ; his father , Peter Longacre , was the descendent of early Swedish settlers of North America . When Peter Longacre remarried , his son found the home life intolerable , and James Longacre left home at the age of 12 , seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia . He apprenticed himself at a bookstore ; the owner , John E. Watson , took the boy into his family . Over the following years , Longacre worked in the bookstore , but Watson realized that the boy 's skill was in portraiture . Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse , but the two remained close , and Watson would often sell Longacre 's works . 
 Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray , principal in the engraving firm Murray , Draper , Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia . This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint 's first chief engraver , Robert Scot . Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819 ; his major work there was portraits of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns ; the work cost Binns a total of $ 9 @,@ 000 ( equal to $ 139 @,@ 128 today ) . Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre 's predecessor as chief engraver , Christian Gobrecht . Longacre 's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists ' paintings as a printed engraving , and in 1819 , he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia . 
 Longacre 's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford 's Encyclopedia in 1820 ; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales . Longacre then agreed to engrave illustrations for Joseph and John Sanderson 's Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence , published in nine volumes between 1820 and 1827 . Although the venture was marked by criticism of the writing , sales were good enough that the project was completed . Numismatic writer Richard Snow suggests that the books sold on the strength of the quality of Longacre 's illustrations . Longacre also completed a series of studies of actors in their roles in 1826 for The American Theatre . 
 With lessons learned from the Sanderson series , Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects . He was on the point of launching this project , having invested $ 1 @,@ 000 of his own money ( equal to $ 23 @,@ 703 today ) in preparation , when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series . In October 1831 , he wrote to Herring , and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery ( later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans ) , published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839 . Herring was an artist , but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre , who travelled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life . He again sketched Jackson , who was by now president , as well as former president James Madison , both in July 1833 . He met many of the political leaders of the day , who were impressed by his portraits . Among these advocates was the former vice president , South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun . In July 1832 , Niles ' Register described a Longacre engraving , " one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art " . 
 Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827 ; between 1828 , when their daughter Sarah was born , and 1840 , they had three boys and two girls . Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837 ; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states , peddling his books from town to town , with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home . Later in 1837 , he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners , <unk> , Draper , Longacre & Co . With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks , the firm prospered , and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York . According to Snow , Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country .

 = = = Appointment = = = 
 Gobrecht 's death in July 1844 left the United States Bureau of the Mint ( generally , " Mint " ) without a chief engraver . Among those who hoped for appointment were Philadelphia banknote engraver Charles Welsh , and Allen Leonard , who had modeled the Mint 's medal for former president John Quincy Adams . Through the influence of Senator Calhoun , however , Longacre secured the appointment . According to coin historian Don Taxay , Longacre did not attempt to gain the support of Mint Director Robert M. Patterson in seeking the appointment from President John Tyler , and " if Patterson resented the slight , however , he was more annoyed by Leonard 's importunities . " 
 Longacre was commissioned by President Tyler on September 16 , 1844 ; his was a recess appointment as the post of chief engraver required Senate confirmation , and that body was not then sitting . Tyler transmitted Longacre 's nomination to the Senate on December 17 , 1844 , which confirmed Longacre without recorded opposition on January 7 , 1845 . According to numismatist David Lange , Longacre was glad to get the position because engravers were receiving less work due to the advent of daguerrotype photography . 
 According to coin dealer and author Q. David Bowers , upon appointment as chief engraver , Longacre " found that he had entered a hornet 's nest of intrigue , politics , and infighting , dominated by Franklin Peale , chief coiner since 1839 " . Peale sent Mint personnel to work on his private residence , and in addition to his official duties — mostly performed by his predecessor , Adam Eckfeldt , who continued in his work without pay despite his retirement — he had a thriving side business preparing dies for private medals using government resources . Peale controlled access to dies and materials , and was close to Director Patterson ; the two men later proved to have been skimming metal from bullion deposits . The remaining Mint officers were cronies of Patterson , and Longacre found himself a loner among them . Walter Breen , in his comprehensive volume on U.S. coins , suggests that Patterson resented Longacre because of the engraver 's sponsorship by Calhoun , whom the director disliked as a southerner . 
 = = = Patterson / Peale years ( 1844 – 1853 ) = = = 
 In Longacre 's first years as chief engraver , no original designs were required for coins . Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842 , and his successor had time to learn arts necessary for coin production that he had not needed as a maker of print engravings . These arts included coin design , making of punches for design elements , and die sinking . Longacre 's work in the private sector had involved cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions . Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre " is a gentleman of excellent character , highly regarded in this community , and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper ; but he is not a Die @-@ Sinker . Indeed I do not know that he has ever made an attempt in this art . " By December of that year , the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre , stating that the engraver had " more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors . He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings . " Taxay attributed Patterson 's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver . 
 A number of blunders can be seen among the early coins produced at the Mint under Longacre , though it is uncertain to whom these errors should be attributed . These include the 1844 half dollar struck at the New Orleans Mint ( 1844 @-@ O ) with a doubled date , and the 1846 half dollar with the 6 overlying an identical digit , but one which had been placed horizontally . Bowers indicates that Longacre likely delegated such work , although in 1849 he wrote that his daily work was punching dates into working dies . Tom DeLorey , in his 2003 article on Longacre , notes that Peale and his staff often made punches without consulting the Engraver 's Department ( headed by Longacre ) , and believes the chief coiner more likely to be responsible . 
 Despite the charged atmosphere at the Philadelphia Mint , Longacre avoided conflict with Patterson and Peale until March 1849 , when Congress authorized a gold dollar and double eagle or twenty @-@ dollar gold piece , both new coins . By then , Patterson had come to desire Longacre 's departure as he was deemed a threat to Peale 's medal business , and opposed new coins which would require the chief engraver 's skills . According to Richard Snow in his book on Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents , " having an ethical chief engraver threatened their sideline . " The conflict came over the use of the Contamin portrait lathe , necessary in the making of dies both for Longacre in producing the new coins and Peale in his medal business . When Longacre complained that Peale was monopolizing the device , Peale decided to sabotage Longacre 's coin work and have him removed from his position . 
 In early 1849 , according to a letter written by Longacre the following year , the chief engraver was approached by a member of the Mint staff , warning him that another officer ( plainly Peale ) sought to have the engraving work done outside of the Mint , making Longacre redundant . The outside engraver in question was Frenchman Louis Bouvet , whom Patterson had prepare a design for the half eagle , though it was not adopted . Longacre 's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar , at some cost to his health , as he later related . He demanded that Patterson hire assistance for him , but found the director willing only to have work contracted out . Longacre was unwilling to consent to this , as he could not supervise work done outside the Mint ( he did get help within the Mint from assistant engraver Peter <unk> Cross , who worked on the reverse of the gold dollar ) . Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849 , and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale : 
 The plan of operation selected for me was to have an electrotype mould made from my model , in copper , to serve as a pattern for a cast in iron . The operations of the galvanic battery for this purpose were conducted in the apartments of the chief coiner . The galvanic process failed , my model was destroyed in the operation . I had , however , taken the precaution to make a cast in plaster ... From this cast , as the only alternative , I <unk> [ sic ] a metallic one which , however , was not perfect ; but I thought I should be able to correct the imperfections in the engraving of the die ... this was a laborious task , but seasonably completed , entirely by my own hand . The die then had to be hardened in the coining department ; it unluckily split in the process . 
 When Longacre completed the double eagle dies , they were rejected by Peale , who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin , and the pieces would not stack properly . Taxay , however , noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems , and by appearance would be level in a stack . Peale complained to Patterson , who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre 's removal on December 25 , 1849 on the ground he could not make proper dies . Patterson that day promised the position to engraver Charles Cushing Wright , effective when Longacre was ousted . Meredith questioned whether a competent replacement could be found ; Patterson assured him that one could . Longacre objected to Patterson that Peale was delaying acceptance of revised double eagle dies , the director did not reply in writing , but met with Longacre , told him the administration had decided to terminate him , and that he should send in his resignation without delay . Longacre , after thinking the matter over , did not do so , but instead went to Washington on February 12 , 1850 to meet with Meredith . He found that the secretary had been lied to about a number of matters . According to Snow , Longacre did not seek retribution , content to be allowed to continue his work in peace . The double eagle went into production in March 1850 , though Patterson complained that the coins did not strike well . The double eagle quickly became the favored way to hold gold , and in the years to come more gold would be struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined . 
 Patterson wrote again to request Longacre 's ouster on April 1 , 1850 , alleging that President Zachary Taylor had decided that Longacre be dismissed . Despite these attempts , Longacre remained in his position . Also in 1850 , Longacre 's wife Elizabeth ( generally Eliza ) died . The Mint officials clashed again in 1851 , after Congress authorized a silver three @-@ cent piece . Longacre prepared a design showing a star on one side and the Roman numeral III on the other , which initially won Patterson 's approval . Peale , however , persuaded Patterson to change his mind and authorize the chief coiner to propose a version himself , copying design elements Gobrecht had used in 1836 . The issue was submitted to the new Treasury Secretary , Thomas Corwin , who selected Longacre 's proposal — Longacre had taken the precaution of sending the secretary a letter explaining his imagery . 
 In July 1851 , Patterson retired and President Fillmore replaced him with Thomas Eckert . Peale 's medal business suffered a setback when Adam Eckfeldt , who was still performing the duties of chief coiner , died in 1852 . In 1854 , Mint Director James Ross Snowden fired Peale after the extent to which he had used Mint labor for private gain became public . Nevertheless , the firing caused considerable press attention , a Senate investigation , and a large demand for compensation by Peale . With his enemies gone , life at the Mint improved for Longacre .

 Faced with a rise in silver prices , Congress decreased the silver content of the half dime , dime , quarter and half dollar in 1853 . Longacre was asked to alter Gobrecht 's designs so new coins could be distinguished from old . He proposed placing rays around the heraldic eagle on the reverses of the quarter and half dollar , and arrows by the date for all of the affected denominations . As the act requiring the reduction in weight allowed the Mint to hire outside artists to do the work , Snowden allowed for public designs for the new pieces . No public entry was found suitable , and Longacre 's proposal was adopted . The rays tended to shorten die life and were dropped within a year ; the arrows were dispensed with after 1855 . 
 In 1853 , Congress authorized a three @-@ dollar piece . In a note found among his papers , Longacre wrote that his task was to make the coin as easy as possible to distinguish from the quarter eagle , which at $ 2 @.@ 50 was close in value . Longacre produced a design for an Native American princess , which he made different from Gobrecht 's Liberty design on the quarter eagle with a thinner and wider planchet . At the time , a female Native American was often used to represent America in art , and a depiction of Liberty as an Indian princess was in accord with contemporary practices . The chief engraver wrote to Mint Director Snowden that the three @-@ dollar piece , which went into production in 1854 , was the first time he had been allowed artistic freedom in designing a coin . The gold dollar was altered the same year to make the planchet both thinner and wider ; Longacre modified his princess design for the gold dollar . For the reverse of the coins , Longacre created a wreath of wheat , corn , tobacco , and cotton , blending the agricultural products of the North and the South . This wreath would also be used on the reverse of the Flying Eagle cent in 1856 ; reused on the dime beginning in 1860 , the " cereal wreath " would be Longacre 's last surviving design on coinage , remaining with modifications until the 1916 abandonment of the Barber dime . 
 In the mid @-@ 1850s , Longacre was engaged by the Navy Department to design a medal to be presented to Captain Duncan Ingraham . Longacre produced the imagery used for the reverse ; the obverse was by Assistant Engraver Cross . Although Bowers describes Longacre as having been " strictly ethical in the duties of his office " , when the Treasury Department learned that Longacre accepted a $ 2 @,@ 200 payment from the Navy for his work , they required that he repay the money under a federal law barring compensation of this kind . Other than his design for the 1867 Assay Commission medal , and his similar , wreathed reverses for the commission medals in 1860 , 1861 , and 1868 , the Ingraham work was Longacre 's only medal made for the government . 
 After a rise in commodity prices , the Mint to sought to replace the large copper cent with a smaller version . Beginning in 1850 , a number of pattern coins were struck in attempts to find a replacement coin . Designs and formats varied ; at first , Mint authorities considered an annular , or holed , cent . In 1854 and 1855 , much experimentation was done , some with a Liberty Head design as featured on the large cent ; others with a flying eagle design adapted by Longacre from the Gobrecht dollar of 1836 . Gobrecht 's design said to have been modeled on Peter the eagle , a tame bird which frequented the Philadelphia Mint in the 1830s until it was caught up in machinery and killed ; Peter , in stuffed form , was subsequently placed on exhibit at the Philadelphia Mint . 
 The flying eagle design was adopted for a large issue of experimental patterns given to government officials and others in 1856 ; that coin was then used for the regular issue from 1857 . The reverse featured Longacre 's cereal wreath , which led to difficulties in coining ; the head and tail of the eagle on the obverse opposed the wreath , making those design points particularly hard to strike in the tough copper @-@ nickel alloy which was used . Beginning in 1859 , the cent featured a Longacre design of Liberty wearing a Native American headdress . What is called the " laurel wreath " , though actually olive , adorned the reverse of the cent in 1859 ; beginning in 1860 , a reverse with an oak wreath and shield was placed on the cent . The replacement of the wreath is for reasons unknown ; the shield was added because of Snowden 's desire to give the coin a " more national character " . This reverse is generally credited to Longacre ; Snow speculates that it may have been created by Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet . 
 By numismatic legend , Longacre 's Indian Head cent design was based on the features of his daughter Sarah ; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting and her father sketched her . However , Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married , not 12 as in the tale , in 1858 and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican . James Longacre did often sketch his elder daughter , and there are resemblances between the depiction of Sarah Longacre and the various representations of Liberty on Longacre 's coins of the 1850s . These tales were apparently extant at the time , as Snowden , in writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858 , denied that the coin was based " on any human features in the Longacre family " . Lee F. McKenzie , in his 1991 article on Longacre , notes that any artist can be influenced by many things , but calls the story " essentially false " .

 = = = Civil War issues and later career = = = 
 The Civil War brought economic disturbances which resulted in the removal of some coins , including the base @-@ metal cent , from circulation . Paper currency ( valued as low as three cents ) , postage stamps , and private tokens , filled the gap . Many of the tokens were cent @-@ sized , but thinner and made of bronze . Mint authorities took notice that these metal pieces were successfully circulating , and obtained legislation for a bronze cent . Longacre 's Indian head design continued in its place with the new metal ; later in 1864 he engraved his initial " L " in the headdress . The act which authorized the bronze cent also issued a two @-@ cent piece ; Longacre furnished a design , which Lange calls a " particularly attractive composition " with arrows and a laurel wreath flanking a shield . However , art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that elements of the design " need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expressions of Civil War heraldry . " Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase favored placing an expression of the nation 's faith in God in a time of war on the coinage , and wrote to Mint Director Pollock , " You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest <unk> terms possible this national recognition . " Several mottos were considered by Pollock , including " God Our Trust " and " God and Our Country " . Longacre 's two @-@ cent piece was the first coin inscribed with " In God We Trust " . 
 Nickel had been removed from the cent over the objection of Pennsylvania industrialist Joseph Wharton , who had large interests in the metal ; his congressman , Thaddeus Stevens , had fought against the act . In 1864 , Wharton published a pamphlet arguing for a coinage in which all coins less than ten cents would be made of a copper @-@ nickel alloy with 25 % nickel , just over twice the percentage which the cent had contained . In March 1865 , Congress passed legislation for a three @-@ cent coin of that alloy , intended to retire fractional currency of that denomination . Longacre furnished a head of Liberty for the coin resembling his other depictions of the goddess which he had made in the past 16 years ; for the reverse he used the " laurel " wreath from the 1859 cent surrounding the Roman numeral III borrowed from the silver three @-@ cent piece . 
 Wharton and others seeking to promote the use of nickel remained powerful in Congress , and in 1866 secured authorization for a five @-@ cent coin of copper nickel . Longacre prepared a number of designs ; Pollock selected Longacre 's design of a shield ( similar to the two @-@ cent piece ) and a starry circle for the reverse , and the Shield nickel began to be struck that year . Mint Assayer William DuBois wrote to Longacre , " it is truly pleasing to see a man pass the life of three score and ten and yet be able to produce the same artistic works as in earlier days . " 
 In 1865 Congress required the use of " In God We Trust " on all coins large enough to bear the inscription ; in 1866 , Longacre added the motto to all silver coins larger than the dime and all gold coins larger than the three @-@ dollar piece . He also in 1867 made modifications to the design of the copper @-@ nickel five @-@ cent piece , or nickel as it was coming to be known . In 1865 , Longacre engaged British @-@ born engraver William Barber as assistant ; William H. Key was also made an assistant in 1864 and remained at the Mint past Longacre 's death . 
 Some of the coinage which had vanished from circulation during the Civil War and had been exported to South America continued to be used in Chilean trade as nationals found their local coinage valued poorly with the American pieces . In 1866 , the Chilean government instructed its representative in Washington to approach the U.S. State Department for permission to have their coinage dies made in America . The Andrew Johnson administration was happy to oblige ; Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch gave the Chileans a letter of introduction to Longacre in Philadelphia . Longacre was engaged by the Chileans to redesign five silver and four gold coins , and he agreed , so long as permission from McCulloch was obtained for him to accept an outside fee . McCulloch was initially agreeable , but Mint Director Pollock raised objection on the ground that government property should not be used to enable private gain . Eventually , all parties reached agreement that Longacre could do the work at a total cost of $ 10 @,@ 000 provided that he brought in an outside engraver to do some of the work under Longacre 's supervision ; the chief engraver selected Anthony C. Paquet , one of his former assistants . Resistance at the Mint dissolved with Pollock 's resignation over President Johnson 's Reconstruction policies , and the dies and hubs ( from which more dies could be made ) were created beginning in November 1866 , probably in @-@ house at the Philadelphia Mint . Longacre 's designs for Chile were used until new ones were adopted in the 1890s . 
 In 1867 , Longacre proposed the use of aluminum in coins ; this was rejected as the supply and price of the metal fluctuated considerably , and it then had a high intrinsic value . In 1868 , Wharton 's interests proposed making the dime into a copper @-@ nickel piece and to modify the cent , three @-@ cent piece , and nickel . The project was abandoned when it became clear the base @-@ metal dime would be too large to be effectively struck in the tough copper @-@ nickel alloy , but Longacre prepared a number of half dollar @-@ size patterns . He also began work on re @-@ engraving the designs of the gold pieces , and completed the $ 10 piece by year 's end .

 = = Death and assessment = = 
 James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1 , 1869 . A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5 , attended by the facility 's employees . The Director of the Mint , Henry Linderman , delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy , which was given by Longacre 's assistant , William Barber , who would be appointed as Longacre 's successor . Like each of his predecessors , Longacre died in office . 
 Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928 . In 1970 , art historian Cornelius Vermeule , in his volume on U.S. coins , viewed Longacre and his works less favorably , " uniform in their dullness , lack of inspiration , and even quaintness , Longacre 's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [ Thomas ] Sully , [ Titian ] Peale , [ Robert ] Hughes , and Gobrecht " and " whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits , he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint . " However , Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art , far above the mundane . 
 In his 1991 article , McKenzie notes Vermeule 's concerns , but considers Longacre 's work important for its use of American symbols , including the representations of Native Americans . He believes Longacre 's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers , such as George T. Morgan , Victor D. Brenner , and Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens . He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle , calling it " unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest @-@ denomination U.S. coin " , and applauds " the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art " . 
 According to Bowers , " Today , Longacre is widely admired by numismatists . " Lange notes that Longacre 's " artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins " . Snow writes , 
 In view of the admiration that Saint @-@ Gaudens , Vermeule , and others had for Longacre 's " recycled " design borrowed from Gobrecht , and the enthusiasm collectors have for Flying Eagle cents today , perhaps it is all for the best that some other motif was not created in the 1850s at the Mint when experiments to eliminate the cumbersome large copper cent were conducted .

 = Philip Smith ( criminal ) = 
 Philip John Smith ( born 10 July 1965 in Gloucester , England ) is a British spree killer serving a life sentence for the murders of three women in Birmingham . A former fairground worker employed at the Rainbow public house in the Digbeth area of the city , Smith killed his victims over a four @-@ day period in November 2000 , befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes . All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition , but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths . 
 Smith 's first victim was Jodie Hyde , a recovering butane gas addict whom he met at the Rainbow before killing her hours later . He is thought to have strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground . Three days later , he met mother @-@ of @-@ three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location , where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body . Then , as he drove home , he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and , fearing capture , beat her to death . All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out . 
 Smith was apprehended after he contacted West Midlands Police saying that he wished to make a statement about Corcoran 's disappearance . At the time , however , her body had not been positively identified , and inquiries quickly established that some aspects of his account were false . The murder inquiry , named Operation Green , uncovered a large quantity of strong evidence incriminating Smith , but at first he denied responsibility . He maintained his innocence as his trial began in July 2001 , but later in the proceedings he changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment . The motive for his crimes was unclear , but police who arrested him believed that a " lack of permanent sexual relations " was a contributing factor . 
 Detectives also investigated the death of a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow . Patricia Lynott , a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham , had been found dead in her flat in October 2000 . Police had not treated the death as suspicious , but after they discovered her connection to Smith , her body was exhumed for a second post mortem . This proved to be inconclusive , and in January 2003 a coroner 's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined . 
 = = Background = = 
 Philip John Smith was born in 1965 at the City Maternity Hospital in Gloucester and grew up in the city . The son of sawmill labourer Henry John Smith and his wife Rose Smith ( née <unk> ) , he was the oldest of five siblings . The family lived in Midland Road , where they were neighbours of serial killers Fred and Rosemary West , before moving to Hailes Road on the Coney Hill Estate in 1971 . He attended Coney Hill Infants and Junior School and later went to a special school for children with learning difficulties . The family had a modest income , and their situation became worse when Smith 's father was injured in a motoring accident . Smith left school at 14 to join Billy Danter 's <unk> , which toured extensively throughout the United Kingdom and also employed his father . He worked out of season as a farmhand , labourer and security guard . 
 Smith moved from Gloucester to Tewkesbury and then Ross @-@ on @-@ Wye , where he lived with a female partner . They had a son in 1990 and two more children in 1992 , but Smith left the family and moved to Cardiff when the relationship became difficult . He then spent a year in Ireland lodging with a travelling family who took pity on him while he was hitchhiking in Athlone , County Westmeath , Ireland . He told them he was an English gypsy visiting Ireland , and they allowed him to live rent @-@ free in a spare caravan , while he contributed a portion of his unemployment benefit towards food . They asked him to leave because they were uncomfortable about sexual remarks he had made to young female members of the family . He moved to Birmingham towards the end of 1999 and stayed briefly at the Trinity Centre , a hostel for the homeless in Digbeth , before moving to a property managed by a housing association in Braithwaite Road in the Sparkbrook district of Birmingham . He became well @-@ known locally and was a regular patron of the Shamrock Cafe on Stratford Road and of the Rainbow pub in Digbeth , where he was employed on a casual basis as an odd @-@ jobber and served as an unofficial taxi driver for drinkers . 
 Smith received over 30 criminal convictions for minor offences , beginning in May 1984 when he was fined £ 100 for theft . His record also included handling stolen goods , burglary and driving without a licence , but no violence . At 6 ft 4 in and weighing 22 stone , with a dishevelled appearance and a soft West Country accent , he was considered gentle by those he met . In an interview with the Birmingham Evening Mail following Smith 's trial in July 2001 , Jim Smith , proprietor of the Shamrock Cafe , said , " He was a gentle giant who we named ' Bigfoot ' because his boots always used to leave black marks on the floor . Ninety @-@ nine per cent of the time he had a dirty appearance and looked like he had been working on a car . " 
 = = Murder spree = = 
 On 8 November 2000 , Smith met 21 @-@ year @-@ old Jodie Hyde , a recovering butane gas addict from Alum Rock , Birmingham , at the Rainbow public house , and they were seen leaving together . He took her to a hospital appointment and later killed her . Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook , where he set it alight . The still @-@ smouldering remains were discovered at 6 : 15 am next morning ( 9 November ) by two patrolling police officers . The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints . A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire . 
 Three days later , Smith met Rosemary Corcoran , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old mother of three from Castle Vale at the same public house , and again they were seen leaving together . He drove her to Worcestershire before bludgeoning her to death and running over her body near Droitwich Spa . She was found at 8 : 30 am on 12 November by a man walking his dog in a lane near Junction 5 of the M5 motorway . 
 Smith 's third victim was Carol Jordan , a 39 @-@ year @-@ old care home worker and mother of six from Balsall Heath , who was killed as she walked to work . Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire , fracturing her hip . Fearing that he would be caught , Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse . The body was discovered at 8 : 50 am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road , Lee Bank .

 = = = Initial statement = = = 
 When staff at the Rainbow told him of Corcoran 's disappearance on 13 November , Smith telephoned the police station at Castle Vale saying that he wished to give a statement . Significantly , his call came at 4 : 00 pm , before the body found in Worcestershire had been positively identified as Corcoran 's , and within an hour Smith had presented himself at Castle Vale . Detective Constable Ruth Wilkins later recalled Smith 's phone call : " He said he would like to come to the police station to help with the inquiry and that he had seen [ Corcoran ] on Saturday night leave the pub with an unknown man . He insisted he would like to come over to the police station . He said he had been asked to contact the police by someone else and gave his mobile number . " 
 In his subsequent statement Smith admitted to being at the Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend , but claimed they were later separated when they went to another public house , the <unk> , and the male friend was ejected . Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo 's , a nightclub in Handsworth , and that when they left some time later , Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy , with whom she had argued at the <unk> . Smith said that the man became aggressive , so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home . Claiming that she told him she did not , he said he then left her . 
 = = = Evidence and murder charge = = = 
 The murder investigation , named Operation Green , was led by Sir Edward Crewe , Chief Constable of West Midlands Police , and included 100 police officers and 50 support staff from the West Midlands and West Mercia forces . Detectives viewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage , gathered more than 100 separate exhibits and interviewed witnesses . Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service ( FSS ) in Birmingham . Martin Whittaker , the scientist who headed the FSS team , spoke of the huge volume of evidence : " The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of ' spider 's web ' and in the centre of it all ... was Philip Smith . In 20 years of working for the FSS , I have never had to deal with so much evidence in relation to one suspect . It was quite overwhelming . " 
 Although Smith maintained his innocence , detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran 's death and those of the other two women . Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde , and he was the last person to see them both alive . CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation , and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist . Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde 's body was later discovered . Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo 's . CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove , a town close to Droitwich , after killing Corcoran , and later film showed him returning to Birmingham . At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him : a motorist who saw him buying petrol , and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance . Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight , although he had no visible signs of injury . 
 In addition to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras , there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders . Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car , on his clothing and in his flat , all matching the victims . There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan , which he was still wearing at the time of his arrest . Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran , and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside . Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car , which had four different types of tyre , to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran 's body , over which he had driven . <unk> and fragments of glass found on Jordan 's body matched those from Smith 's car , including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car 's boot . 
 Smith was charged with Corcoran 's murder on 17 November 2000 and remanded in custody the following day . By this time her death had been linked to the killing of Hyde . Police interviewed Smith in connection with the deaths of Hyde and Jordan on 28 November and charged him with their murders two days later . While awaiting trial Smith was held as a Category A prisoner in the high @-@ security Woodhill Prison in Buckinghamshire . 
 = = Trial and sentence = = 
 Smith 's trial began at Leicester Crown Court on 3 July 2001 , where he pleaded not guilty to the three murder charges . The case was prosecuted by Tim Raggatt , QC , and Smith was defended by Rachel Brand , QC . On the opening day of the trial Raggatt told the Court there was " powerful and compelling " scientific evidence linking Smith to the killings . Smith 's defence was that traces of blood found on his clothes were there because police had tampered with evidence , while the trousers belonging to Rosemary Corcoran found at his flat had been among a bag of clothes Smith had stolen from outside an Oxfam shop . 
 On 17 July Smith complained of feeling unwell with chest and eye pain while under cross @-@ examination , and proceedings were briefly halted while he was treated for the symptoms of a panic attack . When Smith returned to the witness stand , he said he wished to speak to his barrister . Presiding judge Rafferty told him that he must answer questions , to which Smith replied : " I want to change my plea . I 'm fed up with this . I want to change my plea . " The charges were read to him again the following day , and he pleaded guilty . On 18 July 2001 Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment . In January 2005 Birmingham 's Sunday Mercury newspaper reported that Smith had decided to change his plea after police agreed to return £ 400 confiscated from him during a raid on his flat after his arrest , and that he wanted the money to buy Mars bars in prison . 
 Passing sentence , Rafferty said : " You robbed three innocent ladies of their lives . I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don 't understand why you did . The brutality of these ladies ' deaths , designed by you to evade discovery , showing the coldness with which you dispatched them , is appalling . You should clearly have faced up like a man at the overwhelming nature of the Crown 's case against you but you chose to put the victims ' families through misery which you compounded by this trial . " The motive for Smith 's actions remained unclear after the trial , but police believed a " lack of permanent sexual relations " had been a contributing factor . 
 = = Further inquiries = = 
 As a result of their inquiries into Smith 's background , police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him . Patricia Lynott , a 47 @-@ year @-@ old divorced mother of two , had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid @-@ 1990s . On 23 October 2000 , while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner and to look after the licensee 's children , she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on <unk> Street , Bordesley Green . Police believed at first that she had died of natural causes . An autopsy failed to establish a cause of death , and her body was returned to Ireland for burial . 
 Because Lynott had worked alongside Smith at the Rainbow Pub , West Midlands Police wished to re @-@ examine the cause of her death . In early 2001 , investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new post mortem , and on 8 March Lynott 's body was exhumed by <unk> from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland 's State Pathologist , Dr John Harbison . However , the results of this autopsy also proved inconclusive . 
 An inquest into Lynott 's death was held at Birmingham Coroner 's Court in January 2003 . The hearing was told that marks found on her back and an arm may have been bruising , but the pathologist who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died , because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days . It was also said that , despite her connection with Smith , police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered . The inquest jury returned an open verdict . 
 Police also conducted a routine re @-@ examination of other unsolved murder cases dating back 20 years in areas where Smith had lived . Officers from West Midlands Police held a conference in October 2001 with representatives from several other forces , including Gloucestershire and West Mercia , to share information about unsolved murder cases in their areas . Detectives interviewed Smith three times , but he refused to answer their questions , and no further charges were brought .

 = Sri Temasek = 
 Sri Temasek is a two @-@ storey detached house built in 1869 which is sited within the grounds of the Istana in Singapore . During the island 's colonial era , it served as the residence of the Colonial Secretary or Chief Secretary . Since the establishment of the State of Singapore in 1959 , it has been the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore , though none of Singapore 's Prime Ministers has ever lived there . Together with the Istana , it was gazetted a national monument on 14 February 1992 . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name of the house , Sri Temasek , means " splendour of Temasek " in the Malay language . The Malay word <unk> or sri means " charm ; quintessence ; splendour ; glory " or a " cynosure " ( something that attracts attention by its brilliancy or beauty ; a centre of attraction , interest , or admiration ) Temasek , which means " sea town " in Javanese , was the name of an early city on the site of modern Singapore . Today , it is used as an epithet for Singapore . The house was originally merely known as the official residence of the Chief Secretary of Singapore ( or the Colonial Secretary of Singapore / the Straits Settlements ) and did not have its own name . The State of Singapore was proclaimed and the first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew assumed office in June 1959 , after which the house , which has become the official residence of the Prime Minister , has been officially named Sri Temasek , while the Government House has been officially renamed as the Istana , which means palace . 
 = = Design = = 
 The construction of the Istana Singapore ( then called Government House ) and Sri Temasek was ordered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements , Sir Harry St. George Ord , after the original governor 's residence had to be demolished in 1859 to make way for Fort Canning on the hill that bears its name . Sri Temasek was designed by John Frederick Adolphus McNair ( 1829 – 1910 ) , a civil engineer who was appointed Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts of the Straits Settlements , and built largely using Indian convict labour from Bencoolen . It was completed in 1869 . 
 A 1 @,@ 600 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 17 @,@ 000 sq ft ) two @-@ storey detached house – often called a bungalow in Singapore – with European and Asian features , Sri Temasek has a symmetrical layout consisting of deep verandahs surrounding central living spaces . Notable architectural features include arches on its upper level , an intricate timber arcade with a mixture of eastern and western decorative motifs , and a Chinese moon gate ( a circular gateway ) on the building 's second floor . Although few records exist concerning the moon gate 's construction and usage , it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William <unk> , a pre @-@ World War II Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer . It is constructed of <unk> , teak and meranti wood . In the middle of the driveway in front of the house , there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse @-@ drawn carriages . The house was gazetted together with the Istana as a national monument on 14 February 1992 . 
 Sri Temasek was not used for a number of years and fell into disrepair . It then underwent restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh . As the original hand @-@ crafted timber arches and railings on the first @-@ storey verandah had been damaged by termites , replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium @-@ cast alloy were used . Details on railings , doors and windows were restored , and several <unk> <unk> ( traditional wooden half @-@ doors ) and wooden flooring reinstated . The former servants ' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery . The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority 's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A ( national monuments and fully conserved buildings ) in 2008 . 
 = = Use = = 
 When first built in 1869 , Sri Temasek was the residence of the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements ( later Colonial Secretary / Chief Secretary of Singapore ) . All holders of the position had resided in Sri Temasek from 1869 to 1959 . It is currently designated as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore since 1959 , though none of the past and present holders of the post , Lee Kuan Yew , Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong , have lived in it as a family home . In the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew : The Man and His Ideas , Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children , who were then aged seven , five and two , because the couple " did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs " . The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore separated from Malaysia . Apart from that , according to a 2000 Straits Times interview with Kwa , the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played golf or made use of the practice tee and putting green . 
 Sri Temasek has been used mostly for official functions , particularly in the 1960s and 1970s . Prominent visitors included Tunku Abdul Rahman , the founding Prime Minister of Malaysia ; Spiro Agnew , the Vice @-@ President of the United States ; Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ; Denis Healey , British Defence Secretary ; and King Hussein of Jordan . Sri Temasek was the venue for a party hosted in 1962 by Lee Kuan Yew to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore joining Malaysia , and in 1983 the body of the late Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen lay in state there . On 8 August 2008 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message from Sri Temasek for the first time . The wake for Madam Kwa Geok Choo , mother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the wife of Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew , was held at Sri Temasek in October 2010 . In March 2015 , a private family wake for Lee Kuan Yew was held there . 
 = St Nidan 's Church , Llanidan = 
 St Nidan 's Church , Llanidan is a 19th @-@ century parish church near the village of Brynsiencyn , in Anglesey , north Wales . Built between 1839 and 1843 , it replaced the Old Church of St Nidan , Llanidan , which needed significant repair , providing a place of Anglican worship nearer to the village than the old church . Some items were moved here from the old church , including the 13th @-@ century font , two bells from the 14th and 15th century , and a reliquary thought to hold the remains of St Nidan . The tower at the west end has been described as " top heavy " and looking like " a water tower " . 
 The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of five in a group of parishes in the south of Anglesey . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is regarded as " a distinctive example of pre @-@ archaeological gothic revival work . " The 19th @-@ century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that it had been built in a " debased barbarous style , showing neither architectural science nor taste " . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Nidan 's Church was built between 1839 and 1843 , replacing its medieval predecessor . The architect was John Welch , who also designed St Ffinan 's Church , Llanffinan , in central Anglesey , which was built in 1841 . St Nidan 's was originally intended to have a spire on the west tower , but this was not added . The chancel was built in 1882 , and a vestry and organ chamber added later . The battlements on the tower were added in 1933 , replacing the original <unk> . St Nidan 's is set within a walled churchyard on the north of the <unk> road , in the south of Anglesey , Wales . The village of Brynsiencyn is about 500 metres ( about one @-@ third of a mile ) to the south @-@ west , and the old church of St Nidan is about 750 metres ( about half a mile ) to the south @-@ east . 
 A new church was needed because the old church needed significant repair and also because the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself . Like its predecessor , it is dedicated to Nidan , a 7th @-@ century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon , on the eastern tip of Anglesey . 
 St Nidan 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of five churches in the combined benefice ( parishes combined under one priest ) of Newborough with Llanidan with Llangeinwen and Llanfair @-@ yn @-@ y @-@ <unk> . The parish is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the priest in charge is E. Roberts .
