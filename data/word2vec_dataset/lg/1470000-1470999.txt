 Some estimates include 220 @,@ 000 Croats and 300 @,@ 000 Serbs internally displaced for the duration of the war in Croatia . In many areas , large numbers of civilians were forced out by the military . It was at this time that the term ethnic cleansing — the meaning of which ranged from eviction to murder — first entered the English lexicon . 
 On October 3 , the Yugoslav Navy renewed its blockade of the main ports of Croatia . This move followed months of standoff for JNA positions in Dalmatia and elsewhere now known as the Battle of the barracks . It also coincided with the end of Operation Coast @-@ 91 , in which the JNA failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia 's access to the rest of Croatia . 
 On October 5 , President Tuđman made a speech in which he called upon the whole population to mobilize and defend against " Greater Serbian imperialism " pursued by the Serb @-@ led JNA , Serbian paramilitary formations , and rebel Serb forces . On 7 October , the Yugoslav air force attacked the main government building in Zagreb , an incident referred to as the bombing of Banski dvori . The next day , as a previously agreed three @-@ month moratorium on implementation of the declaration of independence expired , the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia . 8 October is now celebrated as Independence Day in Croatia . The bombing of the government offices and the Siege of Dubrovnik that started in October were contributing factors that led to European Union ( EU ) sanctions against Serbia . After the capture of Cavtat by the JNA , on 15 October local Serbs led by Aco <unk> proclaimed the Dubrovnik Republic . The international media focused on the damage to Dubrovnik 's cultural heritage ; concerns about civilian casualties and pivotal battles such as the one in Vukovar were pushed out of public view . Nonetheless , artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56 % of its buildings to some degree , as the historic walled city , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds .

 In response to the 5th JNA Corps advance across the Sava River towards Pakrac and further north into western Slavonia , the Croatian army began a successful counterattack in early November 1991 , its first major offensive operation of the war . Operation Otkos 10 ( 31 October to 4 November ) resulted in Croatia recapturing an area between the Bilogora and Papuk mountains . The Croatian Army recaptured approximately 270 square kilometers ( 100 sq mi ) of territory in this operation . 
 The Vukovar massacre took place in November ; the survivors were transported to prison camps such as Ovčara and Velepromet , with the majority ending up in Sremska Mitrovica prison camp . The sustained siege of Vukovar attracted heavy international media attention . Many international journalists were in or near Vukovar , as was UN peace mediator Cyrus Vance , who had been Secretary of State to former US President Carter . 
 Also in eastern Slavonia , the Lovas massacre occurred in October and the Erdut massacre in November 1991 , before and after the fall of Vukovar . At the same time , the Škabrnja massacre occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland ; it was largely overshadowed by the events at Vukovar . 
 On 14 November , the Navy blockade of Dalmatian ports was challenged by civilian ships . The confrontation culminated in the Battle of the Dalmatian channels , when Croatian coastal and island based artillery damaged , sank , or captured a number of Yugoslav navy vessels , including Mukos PČ 176 , later rechristened PB 62 Šolta . After the battle , the Yugoslav naval operations were effectively limited to the southern Adriatic . 
 Croatian forces made further advances in the second half of December , including Operation Orkan 91 . In the course of Orkan ' 91 , the Croatian army recaptured approximately 1 @,@ 440 square kilometers ( 560 sq mi ) of territory . The end of the operation marked the end of a six @-@ month @-@ long phase of intense fighting ; 10 @,@ 000 people had died , hundreds of thousands had fled , and tens of thousands of homes had been destroyed . 
 On December 19 , as the intensity of the fighting increased , Croatia won its first diplomatic recognition by a western nation — Iceland — while the Serbian Autonomous Oblasts in Krajina and western Slavonia officially declared themselves the Republic of Serbian Krajina . Four days later , Germany recognized Croatian independence . On December 26 , 1991 , the Serb @-@ dominated federal presidency announced plans for a smaller Yugoslavia that could include the territory captured from Croatia during the war . 
 However , on December 21 , 1991 for the first time in the war Istria was under attack . The Serbian Forces attacked the airport near the city of Vrsar , situated in the south @-@ western of the peninsula between the city of Poreč and Rovinj , with two MiG @-@ 21 and two Galeb G @-@ 2 . Afterwards , Yugoslav airplanes carpet bombed Vrsar 's " <unk> " airport , resulting in two deaths . <unk> by foreign diplomats , ceasefires were frequently signed and frequently broken . Croatia lost much territory , but expanded the Croatian Army from the seven brigades it had at the time of the first ceasefire to 60 brigades and 37 independent battalions by December 31 , 1991 . 
 The Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia , also referred to as Badinter Arbitration Committee , was set up by the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) on August 27 , 1991 , to provide the Conference on Yugoslavia with legal advice . The five @-@ member Commission consisted of presidents of Constitutional Courts in the EEC . Starting in late November 1991 , the committee rendered ten opinions . The Commission stated , among other things , that SFR Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics may not be altered unless freely agreed upon . 
 Factors in Croatia 's preservation of its pre @-@ war borders were the Yugoslav Federal Constitution Amendments of 1971 , and the Yugoslav Federal Constitution of 1974 . The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units , and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution . The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971 . The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947 , pursuant to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organization of Yugoslavia . 
 = = = 1992 : Ceasefire = = = 
 A new UN @-@ sponsored ceasefire , the fifteenth one in just six months , was agreed on January 2 , 1992 , and came into force the next day . This so @-@ called Sarajevo Agreement became a lasting ceasefire . Croatia was officially recognized by the European Community on January 15 , 1992 . Even though the JNA began to withdraw from Croatia , including Krajina , the RSK clearly retained the upper hand in the occupied territories due to support from Serbia . By that time , the RSK encompassed 13 @,@ 913 square kilometers ( 5 @,@ 372 sq mi ) of territory . The area size did not encompass another 680 square kilometers ( 260 sq mi ) of occupied territory near Dubrovnik , as that area was not considered part of the RSK . 
 Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires , the UN deployed a protection force in Serbian @-@ held Croatia — the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) — to supervise and maintain the agreement . The UNPROFOR was officially created by UN Security Council Resolution 743 on February 21 , 1992 . The warring parties mostly moved to entrenched positions , and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina , where a new conflict was anticipated . Croatia became a member of the UN on May 22 , 1992 , which was conditional upon Croatia amending its constitution to protect the human rights of minority groups and dissidents . <unk> of the non @-@ Serb civilian population remaining in the occupied territories continued despite the presence of the UNPROFOR peacekeeping troops , and in some cases , with UN troops being virtually enlisted as accomplices . 
 The Yugoslav People 's Army took thousands of prisoners during the war in Croatia , and interned them in camps in Serbia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and Montenegro . The Croatian forces also captured some Serbian prisoners , and the two sides agreed to several prisoner exchanges ; most prisoners were freed by the end of 1992 . Some infamous prisons included the Sremska Mitrovica camp , the Stajićevo camp , and the Begejci camp in Serbia , and the Morinj camp in Montenegro . The Croatian Army also established detention camps , such as the Lora prison camp in Split . 
 Armed conflict in Croatia continued intermittently on a smaller scale . There were several smaller operations undertaken by Croatian forces to relieve the siege of Dubrovnik , and other Croatian cities ( Šibenik , Zadar and Gospić ) from Krajina forces . Battles included the Miljevci plateau incident ( between Krka and Drniš ) , on June 21 – 22 , 1992 , Operation Jaguar at Križ Hill near <unk> and Zadar , on May 22 , 1992 , and a series of military actions in the Dubrovnik hinterland : Operation Tigar , on 1 – 13 July 1992 , in Konavle , on 20 – 24 September 1992 , and at Vlaštica on September 22 – 25 , 1992 . Combat near Dubrovnik was followed by the withdrawal of JNA from Konavle , between September 30 and October 20 , 1992 . The Prevlaka peninsula guarding entrance to the Bay of Kotor was demilitarized and turned over to the UNPROFOR , while the remainder of Konavle was restored to the Croatian authorities . 
 = = = 1993 : Croatian military advances = = = 
 Fighting was renewed at the beginning of 1993 , as the Croatian army launched Operation Maslenica , an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22 . The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area , as it targeted the city airport and the Maslenica Bridge , the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991 . The attack proved successful as it met its declared objectives , but at a high cost , as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers were killed in a relatively limited theater of operations . 
 While Operation Maslenica was in progress , Croatian forces attacked Serb positions 130 kilometers ( 81 mi ) to the east . They advanced towards the <unk> Hydroelectric Dam and captured it by January 28 , 1993 , shortly after Serb militiamen chased away the UN peacekeepers protecting the dam . UN forces had been present at the site since the summer of 1992 . They discovered that the Serbs had planted 35 to 37 tons of explosives spread over seven different sites on the dam in a way that prevented the explosives ' removal ; the charges were left in place . Retreating Serb forces detonated three of explosive charges totaling 5 tons within the 65 @-@ meter ( 213 ft ) high dam in an attempt to cause it to fail and flood the area downstream . The disaster was prevented by Mark Nicholas Gray , a colonel in the British Royal Marines , a lieutenant at the time , who was a UN military observer at the site . He risked being disciplined for acting beyond his authority by lowering the reservoir level , which held 0 @.@ 54 cubic kilometers ( 0 @.@ 13 cu mi ) of water , before the dam was blown up . His action saved the lives of 20 @,@ 000 people who would otherwise have drowned or become homeless . 
 Operation Medak Pocket took place in a salient south of Gospić , from September 9 – 17 . The offensive was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić . The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat , as Croatian troops overran the salient , but it was marred by war crimes . The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes . The operation was halted amid international pressure , and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9 , while UN troops were to occupy the salient alone . The events that followed remain controversial , as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities . The Croatian ministry of defense and UN officer 's testimonies given during the Ademi @-@ Norac trial deny that the battle occurred . 
 On February 18 , 1993 , Croatian authorities signed the Daruvar Agreement with local Serb leaders in Western Slavonia . The aim of the secret agreement was normalizing life for local populations near the frontline . However , authorities in Knin learned of this and arrested the Serb leaders responsible . In June 1993 , Serbs began voting in a referendum on merging Krajina territory with Republika Srpska . Milan Martić , acting as the RSK interior minister , advocated a merger of the " two Serbian states as the first stage in the establishment of a state of all Serbs " in his April 3 letter to the Assembly of the Republika Srpska . On January 21 , 1994 , Martić stated that he would " speed up the process of unification and pass on the baton to all Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević " if elected president of the RSK . " These intentions were countered by the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) Resolution 871 in October 1993 , when the UNSC affirmed for the first time that the United Nations Protected Areas , i.e. the RSK held areas , were an integral part of the Republic of Croatia . 
 During 1992 and 1993 , an estimated 225 @,@ 000 Croats , as well as refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia , settled in Croatia . Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In September 1992 , Croatia had accepted 335 @,@ 985 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina , most of whom were Bosniak civilians ( excluding men of drafting age ) . The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure . The American Ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993 . He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 refugees . 
 = = = 1994 : Erosion of support for Krajina = = = 
 In 1992 , the Croat @-@ Bosniak conflict erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina , just as each was fighting with the Bosnian Serbs . The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops on one side and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) on the other , but by 1994 , the Croatian Army had an estimated 3 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 troops involved in the fighting . Under pressure from the United States , the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February , followed by a meeting of Croatian , Bosnian , and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington , D.C. on February 26 , 1994 . On March 4 , Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces . This led to the dismantling of Herzeg @-@ Bosnia and reduced the number of warring factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina from three to two . 
 In late 1994 , the Croatian Army intervened several times in Bosnia : from November 1 – 3 , in Operation Cincar near Kupres , and on November 29 – December 24 in the Winter ' 94 operation near Dinara and Livno . These operations were undertaken to detract from the siege of the Bihać region and to approach the RSK capital of Knin from the north , isolating it on three sides . 
 During this time , unsuccessful negotiations mediated by the UN were under way between the Croatian and RSK governments . The matters under discussion included opening the Serb @-@ occupied part of the Zagreb – Slavonski Brod motorway near Okučani to transit traffic , as well as the putative status of Serbian @-@ majority areas within Croatia . The motorway initially reopened at the end of 1994 , but it was soon closed again due to security issues . Repeated failures to resolve the two disputes would serve as triggers for major Croatian offensives in 1995 . 
 At the same time , the Krajina army continued the Siege of Bihać , together with the Army of Republika Srpska from Bosnia . Michael Williams , an official of the UN peacekeeping force , said that when the village of <unk> Polje west of Bihać had fallen to a RSK unit in late November 1994 , the siege entered the final stage . He added that heavy tank and artillery fire against the town of Velika Kladuša in the north of the Bihać enclave was coming from the RSK . Western military analysts said that among the array of Serbian surface @-@ to @-@ air missile systems that surround the Bihać pocket on Croatian territory , there was a modern SAM @-@ 2 system probably brought there from Belgrade . In response to the situation , the Security Council passed Resolution 958 , which allowed NATO aircraft deployed as a part of the Operation Deny Flight to operate in Croatia . On November 21 , NATO attacked the Udbina airfield controlled by the RSK , temporarily disabling runways . Following the Udbina strike , NATO continued to launch strikes in the area , and on November 23 , after a NATO reconnaissance plane was illuminated by the radar of a surface @-@ to @-@ air missile ( SAM ) system , NATO planes attacked a SAM site near Dvor with AGM @-@ 88 HARM anti @-@ radiation missiles . 
 In later campaigns , the Croatian army would pursue a variant of blitzkrieg tactics , with the Guard brigades punching through the enemy lines while the other units simply held the lines at other points and completed an encirclement of the enemy units . In a further attempt to bolster its armed forces , Croatia hired Military Professional Resources Inc . ( MPRI ) in September 1994 to train some of its officers and NCOs . Begun in January 1995 , MPRI 's assignment involved fifteen advisors who taught basic officer leadership skills and training management . MPRI activities were reviewed in advance by the US State Department to ensure they did not involve tactical training or violate the UN arms embargo still in place . 
 = = = 1995 : End of the war = = = 
 Tensions were renewed at the beginning of 1995 as Croatia sought to put increasing pressure on the RSK . In a five @-@ page letter on 12 January Franjo Tuđman formally told the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros @-@ Ghali that Croatia was ending the agreement permitting the stationing of UNPROFOR in Croatia , effective 31 March . The move was purportedly motivated by actions by Serbia and the Serb @-@ dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to provide assistance to the Serb occupation of Croatia and allegedly integrate the occupied areas into Yugoslav territory . The situation was noted and addressed by the UN General Assembly . 
 " ... regarding the situation in Croatia , and to respect strictly its territorial integrity , and in this regard concludes that their activities aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately . " 
 International peacemaking efforts continued , and a new peace plan called the Z @-@ 4 plan was presented to Croatian and Krajina authorities . There was no initial Croatian response , and the Serbs flatly refused the proposal . As the deadline for UNPROFOR to pull out neared , a new UN peacekeeping mission was proposed with an increased mandate to patrol Croatia 's internationally recognized borders . Initially the Serbs opposed the move , and tanks were moved from Serbia into eastern Croatia . A settlement was finally reached , and the new UN peacekeeping mission was approved by United Nations Security Council Resolution 981 on March 31 . The name of the mission was the subject of a last @-@ minute dispute , as Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granić insisted that the word Croatia be added to the force 's name . The name United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) was approved . 
 Violence erupted again in early May 1995 . The RSK lost support from the Serbian government in Belgrade , partly as a result of international pressure . At the same time , the Croatian Operation Flash reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia . In retaliation , Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets , killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians . The Yugoslav army responded to the offensive with a show of force , moving tanks towards the Croatian border , in an apparent effort to stave off a possible attack on the occupied area in Eastern Slavonia . 
 During the following months , international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas set up in Bosnia and Herzegovina and trying to set up a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia . The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened . In 1994 , Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured , and a new confidence in the Croatian military 's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated ; the occupied territories would be re @-@ integrated into Croatia . These developments and the Washington Agreement , a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater , led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July , when the Split Agreement was adopted . In it , Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance , particularly in the Bihać area . Croatia accepted , committing itself to an armed intervention . 
 From 25 – 30 July , the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) troops attacked Serb @-@ held territory north of Mount Dinara , capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč during Operation Summer ' 95 . That offensive paved the way for the military recapture of occupied territory around Knin , as it severed the last efficient resupply route between Banja Luka and Knin . On 4 August , Croatia started Operation Storm , with the aim of recapturing almost all of the occupied territory in Croatia , except for a comparatively small strip of land , located along the Danube , at a considerable distance from the bulk of the contested land . The offensive , involving 100 @,@ 000 Croatian soldiers , was the largest single land battle fought in Europe since World War II . Operation Storm achieved its goals and was declared completed on 8 August . 
 Many of the civilian population of the occupied areas fled during the offensive or immediately after its completion , in what was later described in various terms ranging from expulsion to planned evacuation . Krajina Serb sources ( Documents of HQ of Civilian Protection of RSK , Supreme Council of Defense published by Kovačević , <unk> , and <unk> ) confirm that the evacuation of Serbs was organized and planned beforehand . According to Amnesty International , the operation led to the ethnic cleansing of up to 200 @,@ 000 Croatian Serbs , the murder and torture of Serbs — both soldiers and civilians — as well as the plunder of Serb civilian property . The ICTY , on the other hand , concluded that only about 20 @,@ 000 people were deported . The BBC noted 200 @,@ 000 Serb refugees at one point . Croatian refugees exiled in 1991 were finally allowed to return to their homes . In 1996 alone , about 85 @,@ 000 displaced Croats returned to the former Krajina and western Slavonia , according to the estimates of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants . 
 In the months that followed , there were still some intermittent , mainly artillery , attacks from Serb @-@ held areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Dubrovnik area and elsewhere . The remaining Serb @-@ held area in Croatia , in Eastern Slavonia , was faced with the possibility of military confrontation with Croatia . Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm . The threat was underlined by the movement of troops to the region in mid @-@ October , as well as a repeat of an earlier threat to intervene militarily — specifically saying that the Croatian Army could intervene if no peace agreement was reached by the end of the month . 
 = = = = Reintegration of Eastern Slavonia = = = = 
 Further combat was averted on 12 November when the Erdut Agreement was signed by the RSK acting defense minister Milan Milanović , on instructions received from Slobodan Milošević and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officials . The agreement stated that the remaining occupied area was to be returned to Croatia , with a two @-@ year transitional period . The new UN mission was established as the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037 of 15 January 1996 . The agreement guarantees also right of establishment of Joint Council of Municipalities for local Serbian community . 
 The transitional period was subsequently extended by a year . On 15 January 1998 , the UNTAES mandate ended and Croatia regained full control of the area . As the UNTAES replaced the UNCRO mission , Prevlaka peninsula , previously under UNCRO control , was put under control of United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka ( UNMOP ) . The UNMOP was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996 , and terminated on 15 December 2002 .

 Though the standard term applied to the war as directly translated from the Croatian language is Homeland war ( Croatian : <unk> rat ) , the Croatian War of Independence gradually became the standard term for the war . Early English language sources also called it the War in Croatia , the Serbo @-@ Croatian War , and the Conflict in Yugoslavia . 
 Different translations of the Croatian name for the war are also sometimes used , such as Patriotic War , although such use by native speakers of English is rare . The official term used in the Croatian language is the most widespread name used in Croatia but other terms are also used . Another is Greater @-@ Serbian Aggression ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) . The term was widely used by the media during the war , and is still sometimes used by the Croatian media , politicians and others . 
 Two conflicting views exist as to whether the war was a civil or an international war . The prevailing view in Serbia is that there were two civil wars in the area : one between Croats and Serbs living in Croatia , and another between SFR Yugoslavia and Croatia , a part of the federation . The prevailing view in Croatia and of most international law experts , including both international courts ICTY and ICJ , is that the war was an international conflict , a war of aggression waged by the rump Yugoslavia and Serbia against Croatia , supported by Serbs in Croatia . Neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia ever formally declared war on each other . Unlike the Serbian position that the conflict need not be declared as it was a civil war , the Croatian motivation for not declaring war was that Tuđman believed that Croatia could not confront the JNA directly and did everything to avoid an all @-@ out war . 
 All acts and omissions charged as Grave Breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 occurred during the international armed conflict and partial occupation of Croatia . ... Displaced persons were not allowed to return to their homes and those few Croats and other non @-@ Serbs who had remained in the Serb @-@ occupied areas were expelled in the following months . The territory of the RSK remained under Serb occupation until large portions of it were retaken by Croatian forces in two operations in 1995 . The remaining area of Serb control in Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re @-@ integrated into Croatia in 1998 .

In 2010 , the number of war @-@ related PTSD @-@ diagnosed persons was 32 @,@ 000 . 
 In total , the war caused 500 @,@ 000 refugees and displaced persons . Around 196 @,@ 000 to 247 @,@ 000 ( in 1993 ) Croats and other non @-@ Serbs were displaced during the war from or around the RSK . The Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) said that 221 @,@ 000 were displaced in 2006 , of which 218 @,@ 000 had returned . The majority were displaced during the initial fighting and during the JNA offensives of 1991 and 1992 . Some 150 @,@ 000 Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbia have obtained Croatian citizenship since 1991 , many due to incidents like the expulsions in <unk> . 
 The Belgrade @-@ based non @-@ government organization Veritas lists 6 @,@ 827 killed and missing from the Republic of Serbian Krajina , including 4 @,@ 177 combatants and 2 @,@ 650 civilians , and 307 JNA members who were from Croatia . Most of them were killed or went missing in 1991 ( 2 @,@ 729 ) and 1995 ( 2 @,@ 348 ) . The most deaths occurred in Northern Dalmatia ( 1 @,@ 605 ) . The JNA has officially acknowledged 1 @,@ 279 killed in action . The actual number was probably considerably greater , since casualties were consistently underreported . In one example , official reports spoke of two slightly wounded soldiers after an engagement , however , according to the unit 's intelligence officer , the actual number was 50 killed and 150 wounded . 
 According to Serbian sources , some 120 @,@ 000 Serbs were displaced from 1991 – 93 , and 250 @,@ 000 were displaced after Operation Storm . The number of displaced Serbs was 254 @,@ 000 in 1993 , dropping to 97 @,@ 000 in the early 1995 and then increasing again to 200 @,@ 000 by the end of the year .

 = = = Wartime damage and minefields = = = 
 Official figures on wartime damage published in Croatia in 1996 specify 180 @,@ 000 destroyed housing units , 25 % of the Croatian economy destroyed , and US $ 27 billion of material damage . Europe Review 2003 / 04 estimated the war damage at US $ 37 billion in damaged infrastructure , lost economic output , and refugee @-@ related costs , while GDP dropped 21 % in the period . 15 percent of housing units and 2 @,@ 423 cultural heritage structures , including 495 sacral structures , were destroyed or damaged . The war imposed an additional economic burden of very high military expenditures . By 1994 , as Croatia rapidly developed into a de facto war economy , the military consumed as much as 60 percent of total government spending . 
 Yugoslav and Serbian expenditures during the war were even more disproportionate . The federal budget proposal for 1992 earmarked 81 percent of funds to be diverted into the Serbian war effort . Since a substantial part of the federal budgets prior to 1992 was provided by Slovenia and Croatia , the most developed republics of Yugoslavia , a lack of federal income quickly led to desperate printing of money to finance government operations . That in turn produced the worst episode of hyperinflation in history : Between October 1993 and January 1995 , Yugoslavia , which then consisted of Serbia and Montenegro , suffered through a hyperinflation of five quadrillion percent . 
 Many Croatian cities were attacked by artillery , missiles , and aircraft bombs by RSK or JNA forces from RSK or Serb @-@ controlled areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as Montenegro and Serbia . The most shelled cities were Vukovar , Slavonski Brod ( from the mountain of Vučjak ) , and Županja ( for more than 1 @,@ 000 days ) , Vinkovci , Osijek , Nova Gradiška , Novska , Daruvar , Pakrac , Šibenik , Sisak , Dubrovnik , Zadar , Gospić , Karlovac , Biograd na <unk> , Slavonski Šamac , Ogulin , Duga Resa , Otočac , Ilok , Beli Manastir , Lučko , Zagreb , and others Slavonski Brod was never directly attacked by tanks or infantry , but the city and its surrounding villages were hit by more than 11 @,@ 600 artillery shells and 130 aircraft bombs in 1991 and 1992 . 
 Approximately 2 million mines were laid in various areas of Croatia during the war . Most of the minefields were laid with no pattern or any type of record being made of the position of the mines . A decade after the war , in 2005 , there were still about 250 @,@ 000 mines buried along the former front lines , along some segments of the international borders , especially near Bihać , and around some former JNA facilities . As of 2007 , the area still containing or suspected of containing mines encompassed approximately 1 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 390 sq mi ) . More than 1 @,@ 900 people were killed or injured by land mines in Croatia since the beginning of the war , including more than 500 killed or injured by mines after the end of the war . Between 1998 and 2005 , Croatia spent € 214 million on various mine action programs . As of 2009 , all remaining minefields are clearly marked . During the 2015 European migrant crisis , there existed concerns over areas where mines could affect the flow of refugees coming from Serbia to Croatia . 
 = = = War crimes and the ICTY = = = 
 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) was established by UN Security Council Resolution 827 , which was passed on 25 May 1993 . The court has power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law , breaches of the Geneva Conventions , violating the laws or customs of war , committing genocide , and crimes against humanity committed in the territory of the former SFR Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 . 
 The indictees by ICTY ranged from common soldiers to Prime Ministers and Presidents . Some high @-@ level indictees included Slobodan Milošević ( President of Serbia ) , Milan Babić ( president of the RSK ) , and Ante Gotovina ( general of the Croatian Army ) . Franjo Tuđman ( President of Croatia ) died in 1999 of cancer while the ICTY 's prosecutors were still investigating him . According to Marko Attila Hoare , a former employee at the ICTY , an investigative team worked on indictments of senior members of the " joint criminal enterprise " , including not only Milošević , but Veljko Kadijević , Blagoje Adžić , Borisav Jović , Branko Kostić , Momir <unk> and others . These drafts were rejected , reportedly upon the intervention of Carla del Ponte and the indictment limited to Milošević . 
 Between 1991 and 1995 , Martić held positions of minister of interior , minister of defense and president of the self @-@ proclaimed " Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina " ( SAO Krajina ) , which was later renamed " Republic of Serbian Krajina " ( RSK ) . He was found to have participated during this period in a joint criminal enterprise which included Slobodan Milošević , whose aim was to create a unified Serbian state through commission of a widespread and systematic campaign of crimes against non @-@ Serbs inhabiting areas in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina envisaged to become parts of such a state . 
 As of 2013 , the ICTY has convicted six officials from the Serb / Montenegrin side and two from the Croatian side . Milan Martić received the largest sentence : 35 years in prison . Babić received 13 years . He expressed remorse for his role in the war , asking his " Croat brothers to forgive him " . In 2007 , two former Yugoslav army officers were sentenced for the Vukovar massacre at the ICTY in The Hague . Veselin Šljivančanin was sentenced to 10 years and Mile Mrkšić to 20 years in prison . Prosecutors stated that following the capture of Vukovar , the JNA handed over several hundred Croats to Serbian forces . Of these , at least 264 ( mostly injured soldiers , but also two women and a 16 @-@ year @-@ old child ) were murdered and buried in mass graves in the neighborhood of Ovčara , on the outskirts of Vukovar . The city 's mayor , Slavko Dokmanović , was brought to trial at the ICTY , but committed suicide in 1998 in captivity before proceedings began . 
 Generals Pavle Strugar and Miodrag Jokić were sentenced by the ICTY to 8 and 7 years , respectively , for shelling Dubrovnik . A third <unk> , Vladimir Kovačević , was declared mentally unfit to stand trial . The Yugoslav Army 's Chief of the General Staff , Momčilo Perišić , was charged with aiding and abetting war crimes but eventually acquitted on all charges . The trials of Jovica Stanišić , Franko Simatović , Vojislav Šešelj and Goran Hadžić are still pending . 
 A number of Croat civilians in hospitals and shelters marked with a red cross were targeted by Serb forces . There were numerous well @-@ documented war crimes against civilians and prisoners of war perpetrated by Serb and Yugoslav forces in Croatia : the Dalj killings , the Lovas massacre , the Široka Kula massacre , the Baćin massacre , the Saborsko massacre , the Škabrnja massacre , the Voćin massacre , and the Zagreb rocket attacks . 
 There were a number of prison camps where Croatian POWs and civilians were detained , including the Sremska Mitrovica camp , the Stajićevo camp , and the Begejci camp in Serbia , and the Morinj camp in Montenegro . The Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps was later founded in order to help the victims of prison abuse . The Croatian Army established detention camps , like Lora prison camp in Split . 
 Croatian war crimes included the Gospić massacre , the killings in Sisak in 1991 and 1992 , and others , which were likewise prosecuted by Croatian courts or the ICTY . Another infamous instance of war crimes , in what would later become known as the " <unk> <unk> " case , committed by a reserve police unit commanded by Tomislav Merčep , involved the killing of prisoners , mostly ethnic Serbs , near Pakrac in late 1991 and early 1992 . The events were initially investigated by the ICTY , but the case was eventually transferred to the Croatian judiciary . More than a decade later , five members of this unit , although not its commander , were indicted on criminal charges related to these events , and convicted . Merčep was arrested for these crimes in December 2010 . In 2009 , Branimir Glavaš , a Croatian incumbent MP at the time , was convicted of war crimes committed in Osijek in 1991 and sentenced to jail by a Croatian court . 
 The ICTY indicted Croatian officers Janko Bobetko , Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac , for crimes committed during Operation Medak Pocket , but that case was also transferred to Croatian courts . Norac was found guilty and jailed for 7 years ; Ademi was acquitted . Bobetko was declared unfit to stand trial due to poor health . The ICTY 's indictment against General Ante Gotovina cited at least 150 Serb civilians killed in the aftermath of Operation Storm . The Croatian Helsinki Committee registered 677 Serb civilians killed in the operation . Louise Arbour , a prosecutor of the ICTY , stated that the legality and legitimacy of the Operation itself was not the issue , but that the ICTY was required to investigate whether crimes were committed during the campaign . The Trial Chamber reiterated that the legality of Operation Storm is " irrelevant " for the case at hand , since the ICTY 's remit is processing war crimes . In 2011 , Gotovina was sentenced to 24 and Markač to 18 years in prison . In 2012 , their convictions were overturned and both were immediately released . Čermak was acquitted of all charges . 
 In the first @-@ degree verdict , the trial chamber found that " certain members of the Croatian political and military leadership shared the common objective of the permanent removal of the Serb civilian population from the Krajina by force or threat of force " , implicating Franjo Tuđman , Gojko Šušak , who was the Minister of Defence and a close associate of Tuđman 's , and Zvonimir Červenko , the Chief of the Croatian army Main Staff . Nevertheless , in the second @-@ degree verdict , the appeals chamber dismissed the notion of such a joint criminal enterprise . The verdict meant the ICTY convicted no Croats for their role in the Croatian War of Independence . 
 = = Serbia 's role = = 
 = = = During the war = = = 
 While Serbia and Croatia never declared war on each other , Serbia was directly and indirectly involved in the war through a number of activities . Its foremost involvement entailed material support of the JNA . Following the independence of various republics from SFR Yugoslavia , Serbia provided the bulk of manpower and funding that was channeled to the war effort through Serbian control of the Yugoslav presidency and the federal defense ministry . Serbia actively supported various paramilitary volunteer units from Serbia that were fighting in Croatia . Even though no actual fighting occurred on Serbian or Montenegrin soil , involvement of the two was evident through the maintenance of prison camps in Serbia and Montenegro , which became places where a number of war crimes were committed . 
 Milošević 's trial at the ICTY revealed numerous declassified documents of Belgrade 's involvement in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia . Evidence introduced at trial showed exactly how Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia financed the war , that they provided weapons and material support to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs , and demonstrated the administrative and personnel structures set up to support the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies . It was established that Belgrade , through the federal government , financed more than 90 percent of the Krajina budget in 1993 ; that the Supreme Defense Council decided to hide aid to Republika Srpska and Krajina from the public ; that the National Bank of Krajina operated as a branch office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia ; and that by March 1994 FR Yugoslavia , Krajina , and Republika Srpska used a single currency . Numerous documents demonstrated that branches of the Krajina Public Accountancy Service were incorporated into Serbia 's accountancy system in May 1991 , and that the financing of Krajina and Republika Srpska caused hyperinflation in FR Yugoslavia . The trial revealed that the JNA , the Serbian Ministry of Interior , and other entities ( including Serb civilian groups and police ) armed Serb civilians and local territorial defense groups in the RSK before the conflict escalated . 
 In 1993 , the US State Department reported that right after the Maslenica and Medak pocket operations , authorities in Serbia dispatched substantial numbers of " volunteers " to Serb @-@ held territories in Croatia to fight . A former secretary of Serbian criminal Željko Ražnatović Arkan testified at the Hague , confirming that the paramilitary leader took his orders , and his money , directly from the secret police run by Milošević . 
 This degree of control was reflected in negotiations held at various times between Croatian authorities and the RSK , as the Serbian leadership under Milošević was regularly consulted and frequently made decisions on behalf of the RSK . The Erdut Agreement that ended the war was signed by a RSK minister on instructions from Milošević . The degree of control Serbia held over SFR Yugoslavia and later the RSK was evidenced through testimonies during the Milošević trial at the ICTY . 
 Serbia 's state @-@ run media were reportedly used to incite the conflict and further inflame the <unk> and dismissing independent media reports of fires burning in Dubrovnik due to JNA artillery bombardment as being a purported ruse created by Croats burning tires in the city . 
 = = = After the war = = = 
 After the successful implementation of the Erdut Agreement which ended armed conflict in 1995 , the relations between Croatia and Serbia gradually improved and the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1996 . 
 In a case before the International Court of Justice , Croatia filed a suit against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 2 July 1999 , citing Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . With the transformation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro and the dissolution of that country in 2006 , Serbia is considered its legal successor . The application was filed for Croatia by a U.S. lawyer , David B. Rivkin . Serbia reciprocated with the genocide lawsuit against the Republic of Croatia on 4 January 2010 . The Serbian application covers missing people , killed people , refugees , expelled people , and all military actions and concentration camps with a historical account of World War II persecution of Serbs committed by the Independent State of Croatia during World War II . 
 By 2010 , Croatia and Serbia further improved their relations through an agreement to resolve remaining refugee issues , and visits of Croatian President Ivo Josipović to Belgrade , and of the Serbian President Boris Tadić to Zagreb and Vukovar . During their meeting in Vukovar , President Tadić gave a statement expressing his " apology and regret " , while President Josipović said " that no crimes committed at the time would go unpunished . " The statements were made during a joint visit to the Ovčara memorial center , site of the Vukovar massacre . 
 = = Role of the international community = = 
 The war developed at a time when the attention of the United States and the world was on Iraq , and the Gulf War in 1991 , along with a sharp rise in oil prices and a slowdown in the growth of the world economy . 
 Between 19 – 23 December , several other European countries , beginning with Germany and the Vatican City , followed by Sweden and Italy , announced their recognition of Croatia 's ( and Slovenia 's ) independence . The European Union as a whole recognized the independence of the two republics on 15 January 1992 . 
 Each of the major foreign governments acted somewhat differently : 
 United Kingdom – John Major 's government favoured neutrality . 
 United States – The United States , under George H. W. Bush , tended to favour non @-@ intervention at first , just like the United Kingdom . In contrast , from 1993 , the administration led by Bill Clinton tended to engage itself in order to end the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia . Cyrus Vance supported the ' integrity of Yugoslavia ' . 
 Germany – up until 1991 , Germany supported a ' status quo ' . According to diplomat Gerhard Almer , the Yugoslav disintegration was feared as " a bad example for the dissolution of the Soviet Union " . During the war , this policy changed , when Helmut Kohl announced that Germany recognized Slovenia and Croatia as independent countries . 
 Russia – Russia tended to oppose recognition of Croatia ( Russia recognized Croatia on February 17 , 1992 , United States on April 7th 1992 )

 = SMS Kronprinz ( 1867 ) = 
 For the German battleship that served during World War I , see SMS Kronprinz 
 SMS Kronprinz was a unique German ironclad warship built for the Prussian Navy in 1866 – 1867 . Kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at the Samuda Brothers shipyard at Cubitt Town in London . She was launched in May 1867 and commissioned into the Prussian Navy that September . The ship was the fourth ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy , after Arminius , Prinz Adalbert , and Friedrich Carl , though she entered service before Friedrich Carl . Kronprinz was built as an armored frigate , armed with a main battery of sixteen 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns ; several smaller guns were added later in her career . 
 Kronprinz saw limited duty during the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 1871 . Engine troubles aboard the ship , along with the two other armored frigates in her squadron , prevented operations against the French blockade . Only two sorties in which Kronprinz participated were conducted , both of which did not result in combat . The ship served in the subsequent Imperial Navy until she was converted into a training ship for boiler room personnel in 1901 . The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics and propulsion = = = 
 Kronprinz was 88 @.@ 20 meters ( 289 @.@ 4 ft ) long at the waterline and 89 @.@ 44 m ( 293 @.@ 4 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 15 @.@ 20 m ( 49 @.@ 9 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 85 m ( 25 @.@ 8 ft ) forward and 7 @.@ 45 m ( 24 @.@ 4 ft ) aft . The ship was designed to displace 5 @,@ 767 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 676 long tons ; 6 @,@ 357 short tons ) at a normal loading , and up to 6 @,@ 760 t ( 6 @,@ 650 long tons ; 7 @,@ 450 short tons ) with a combat load . The ship 's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames . It contained nine watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 43 percent of the length of the vessel . The ship was an excellent sea boat ; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm but had a large turning radius . The ship 's crew numbered 33 officers and 508 enlisted men . Kronprinz carried a number of smaller boats , including a large tender , two launches , a pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy . 
 The ship 's propulsion system was built by John Penn and Sons of Greenwich , England . A horizontal two @-@ cylinder single expansion steam engine powered the ship . It drove a two @-@ bladed screw 6 @.@ 50 m ( 21 @.@ 3 ft ) in diameter . Eight trunk boilers , with four fireboxes in each , were divided into two boiler rooms . The boilers supplied steam to the engine at 2 standard atmospheres ( 200 kPa ) . The propulsion system was rated at 4 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 400 kW ) and a top speed of 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) , though on trials Kronprinz managed to make 4 @,@ 870 ihp ( 3 @,@ 630 kW ) and 14 @.@ 7 knots ( 27 @.@ 2 km / h ; 16 @.@ 9 mph ) . The ship carried up to 646 t ( 636 long tons ; 712 short tons ) of coal , which enabled a maximum range of 3 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 900 km ; 3 @,@ 700 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and a range of 1 @,@ 730 nmi ( 3 @,@ 200 km ; 1 @,@ 990 mi ) at 14 knots . A barque rig with a surface area of 1 @,@ 980 square meters supplemented the steam engine . Steering was controlled with a single rudder . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 As built , Kronprinz was equipped with thirty @-@ two rifled 72 @-@ pounder cannon . After her delivery to Germany , these guns were replaced with a pair of 21 @-@ centimeter ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) L / 22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L / 19 guns . The L / 22 gun could depress to − 5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees , which provided a range of 5 @,@ 900 m ( 6 @,@ 500 yd ) . The shorter barreled L / 19 guns had a wider range of elevation , from − 8 to 14 @.@ 5 degrees , but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity , which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to 5 @,@ 200 m ( 5 @,@ 700 yd ) . The two types of gun fired the same shell , of which the total supply numbered 1 @,@ 656 rounds of ammunition . The fourteen L / 19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships , seven on either broadside . The L / 22 guns were placed on either end of the ship . Later in her career , six revolver cannon and five 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes were added . Two of the tubes were placed in the bow , two on the ship 's sides , and one in the stern on the port side . All were placed above water , and were supplied with 12 torpedoes . 
 Kronprinz 's armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking . The iron component of the waterline armored belt ranged in thickness from 76 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) in the stern to 124 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) amidships and 114 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) toward the bow . The entire belt was backed with 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) of teak . The central battery was protected by 114 to 121 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 8 in ) of sloped iron plating on 254 mm of timber . The battery 's roof was protected by 9 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 35 in ) thick iron plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London . The British naval architect Edward Reed designed the ship , and resulted in a vessel similar to the contemporary , French @-@ built Prussian ironclad Friedrich Carl . The ship was launched on 6 May 1867 and commissioned into the Prussian Navy four months later on 19 September 1867 . On the voyage from England to Prussia , the ship lost her main mast in a storm . The ship immediately went into dock for refitting upon arrival in Prussia ; the mast was repaired and the ship 's armament was converted from the initial arrangement . 
 At the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1870 , the greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy . Kronprinz and the broadside ironclads Friedrich Carl and König Wilhelm , along with the small ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert , had been steaming in the English Channel before the French declared war ; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the intention of steaming to Fayal in the Azores . On the 13th , however , they put into port and learned of the rising tension between France and Prussia . The ships therefore returned to Wilhelmshaven immediately , arriving on 16 July . France declared war on Prussia three days later on 19 July . Kronprinz , Friedrich Carl , and König Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of <unk> were subsequently joined there by the turret ship Arminius , which had been stationed in Kiel . For the duration of the conflict , Kronprinz was commanded by Captain Reinhold von Werner . 
 Despite the great French naval superiority , the French had conducted insufficient pre @-@ war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations , and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance , which was not forthcoming . The four ships , under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann , made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank , though they encountered no French warships . Kronprinz and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble , which left Arminius alone to conduct operations . Kronprinz , Friedrich Carl , and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict , while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river . On 11 September , the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action ; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea . It too did not encounter French opposition , as the French Navy had by this time returned to France . 
 Engine problems plagued the ship throughout her career ; Kronprinz 's engines broke down during the fleet maneuvers in May 1883 . Two of the three other armored frigates also broke down , which forced the cancellation of the maneuvers . Kronprinz had anti @-@ torpedo nets installed in 1885 ; these were removed in 1897 . The ship served on active duty with the fleet until 22 August 1901 , when she was stricken from the naval register . She was reconstructed at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel that year . The propulsion system was overhauled and the eight J Penn & Sons boilers were removed . Two Dürr and two Thornycroft boilers were installed in their place . Her barque rig was cut down to 1 @,@ 409 square meters ( 15 @,@ 170 sq ft ) . After emerging from the reconstruction , Kronprinz served as a training ship for engine @-@ room personnel , based in Kiel . The ship was ultimately sold to Bonn , a German ship @-@ breaking firm , on 3 October 1921 for 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 marks . Kronprinz was broken up for scrap in Rendsburg @-@ Audorf later that year .

It was Sega 's first entry into the home video game hardware business , and provided the basis for the more successful Master System . Introduced in 1983 , the SG @-@ 1000 was released on the same day that Nintendo released the Family Computer ( Famicom for short ) in Japan .

 Developed in response to a downturn in arcades in 1982 , the SG @-@ 1000 was created on the advice of Hayao Nakayama , president of Sega Enterprises , Ltd . Shortly after the release , Sega Enterprises was sold to CSK Corporation , which was followed by the release of the SG @-@ 1000 II . Due to the release of the Famicom , and the number of consoles present in the market at the time , the SG @-@ 1000 was not commercially successful . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early 1980s , Sega Enterprises , Inc . , then a subsidiary of Gulf and Western , was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States , as company revenues rose to $ 214 million . A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company , leading Gulf & Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing . The company retained Sega 's North American R & D operation , as well as its Japanese subsidiary , Sega Enterprises , Ltd . With its arcade business in decline , Gulf & Western executives turned to Sega Enterprises , Ltd . ' s president , Hayao Nakayama , for advice on how to proceed . Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years working in the arcade industry to move into the home console market in Japan , which was in its infancy at the time . Nakayama received permission to proceed , leading to the release of Sega 's first home video game system , the SG @-@ 1000 . 
 The SG @-@ 1000 was first released in Japan on July 15 , 1983 , at JP ¥ 15 @,@ 000 . It was released on the same day as Nintendo launched the Family Computer in Japan . A computer version with a built @-@ in keyboard was released simultaneously by Sega as the SC @-@ 3000 , also known as the Sega Personal Computer SC @-@ 3000 , as well as the upgraded SC @-@ <unk> . The SG @-@ 1000 was released in Australia through John Sands Electronics , and in Italy , Spain , and other countries . An unauthorized clone system known as the <unk> Personal Arcade was produced , and is able to play SG @-@ 1000 and ColecoVision games . 
 The SG @-@ 1000 's launch did not prove to be successful . Reasons for this include the Famicom 's more advanced hardware , the number of available game consoles at the time from companies including Tomy and Bandai , and the North American video game crash of 1983 . Shortly after launch , Gulf & Western began to divest itself of its non @-@ core businesses after the death of company founder Charles Bluhdorn , so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation , a prominent Japanese software company . Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises , Ltd . 
 Following the buyout , Sega released another console , the SG @-@ 1000 II , on July 31 , 1984 at ¥ 15 @,@ 000 . It featured hardware tweaks from the original model , including detachable controllers and the ability to play Sega Card games . The SG @-@ 1000 II did not sell well , leading to Sega 's decision to continue work on its video game hardware . This would result in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985 , which later became the Master System worldwide . The last cartridge released was Portrait of Loretta on February 18 , 1987 . In 2006 , the GameTap subscription gaming service added an emulator of the SG @-@ 1000 , and several playable titles .

Titles for the system include Flicky , Congo Bongo , Sega @-@ Galaga , and Girl 's Garden , the first video game directed by Sonic the Hedgehog creator Yuji Naka . The library included licensed titles , such as Golgo 13 . Packaging and game manuals came with both Japanese and English text until 1984 , when manuals were switched to Japanese only and the size of the cartridge box was reduced . 
 Comparisons have been made to the appearance of SG @-@ 1000 games to those released for the ColecoVision , and the graphics have been criticized in light of the simultaneous release of the Famicom .

During the United States occupation of Veracruz in April 1914 , Washingtonian was chartered by the United States Department of the Navy for service as a non @-@ commissioned refrigerated supply ship for the U.S. fleet stationed off the Mexican coast . 
 In January 1915 , after a little more than one year of service , Washingtonian collided with the schooner Elizabeth Palmer off the Delaware coast and sank in ten minutes with the loss of her $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cargo of 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 200 t ) of raw Hawaiian sugar . In the days after Washingtonian 's sinking , the price of sugar in the United States increased almost 9 % , partly attributed to the loss of Washingtonian 's cargo . Lying under approximately 100 feet ( 30 m ) of water , Washingtonian 's wreck is one of the most popular recreational dive sites on the eastern seaboard . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 In November 1911 , the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point , Maryland , for two new cargo ships — Panaman and Washingtonian . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8 % profit for Maryland Steel , but capped at a maximum cost of $ 640 @,@ 000 each . The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5 % down payment in cash and nine monthly installments for the balance . The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer @-@ term notes or mortgages . The final cost of Washingtonian , including financing costs , was $ 71 @.@ 49 per deadweight ton , which totaled just under $ 733 @,@ 000 . 
 Washingtonian ( Maryland Steel yard no . 131 ) was the second ship built under the contract . The ship was 6 @,@ 649 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 360 feet 11 inches ( 110 @.@ 01 m ) in length ( between perpendiculars ) and 50 feet 2 inches ( 15 @.@ 29 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 10 @,@ 250 LT DWT , and , at the time of her launch , was the largest American @-@ flagged cargo ship . Washingtonian had a speed of 12 @.@ 5 knots ( 23 @.@ 2 km / h ) , and was powered by a single steam engine with oil @-@ fired boilers which drove a single screw propeller . Washingtonian 's cargo holds , providing a storage capacity of 490 @,@ 858 cubic feet ( 13 @,@ 899 @.@ 6 m3 ) , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so she could carry perishable products from the West to the East Coast , such as Pacific Northwest salmon or fresh produce from Southern California farms . 
 = = Service = = 
 When Washingtonian began sailing for American @-@ Hawaiian , the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii , and vice versa . Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports — Salina Cruz , Oaxaca , for eastbound cargo , and Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz , for westbound cargo — and traversed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , while westbound cargoes were more general in nature . Washingtonian sailed in this service , but it is not known whether she sailed on the east or west side of North America . After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 ( which took place while six American @-@ Hawaiian ships were being held in various Mexican ports ) , the Huerta @-@ led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping . This loss of access ( the Panama Canal was not yet open ) caused American @-@ Hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April . During the U.S. occupation , Washingtonian was chartered by the Navy Department to serve as a non @-@ commissioned refrigerator and supply ship for the U.S. fleet off Mexico . She was outfitted for her first voyage at the New York Navy Yard and sailed with 500 @,@ 000 pounds ( 230 @,@ 000 kg ) of fresh meat for the Navy and the United States Army . Washingtonian sailed in a rotation with the commissioned Navy stores ships USS Culgoa and USS Celtic . 
 With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to taking the canal route . In late August , American @-@ Hawaiian announced that Washingtonian — her Navy charter ended by this time — would sail on a San Francisco – Panama Canal – Boston route , sailing opposite Mexican , Honolulan , and sister ship Pennsylvanian . 
 Washingtonian sailed from Los Angeles in early October with a load of California products — including canned and dried fruits , beans , and wine — for New York and Boston . After delivering that load , Washingtonian headed for Honolulu , Hawaii , to take on a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) load of raw sugar valued at about $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Departing Honolulu on 20 December , Washingtonian arrived at Balboa on 17 January 1915 and transited the Panama Canal . Sailing from Cristóbal two days later , she headed for the Delaware Breakwater en route to Philadelphia . 
 = = Collision = = 
 At 3 : 30 a.m. on 26 January , some 20 nautical miles ( 37 km ) from Fenwick Island , Delaware , the American schooner Elizabeth Palmer was under full sail at 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) on a southwest by south course . Elizabeth Palmer 's captain saw a large steam vessel , Washingtonian , on an apparent collision course ahead , but did not change course since navigational rules of the time required steam @-@ powered vessels to yield to vessels under sail power . The captain of Washingtonian , two quartermasters , and a seaman were all on watch and saw Elizabeth Palmer , but misjudged the schooner 's rapid pace . When Washingtonian , underway at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , did not change course or speed , Elizabeth Palmer impacted the starboard side of the steamer , leaving a large hole that sank Washingtonian ten minutes later . Less than a mile ( 2 km ) away , Elizabeth Palmer , with her jib boom and the top of her foremast stripped away by the impact , began taking on water through her split seams . When it became apparent that the big schooner would sink , her captain ordered her abandonment , and she slowly settled and went down about an hour after the collision . After Washingtonian 's crew abandoned ship , one crewman , a water tender , was found to be missing and was presumed drowned . Washingtonian 's 39 survivors and all 13 crew members from Elizabeth Palmer were picked up about an hour after the collision by the passenger liner Hamilton of the Old Dominion Line , which arrived at New York the next day . 
 The collision had repercussions for American @-@ Hawaiian and the world sugar market . The financial impact of the collision on American @-@ Hawaiian , estimated at $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , was devastating . Contemporary news reports in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both told of the collision 's impact on the sugar market . Claus A. Spreckels , president of Federal Sugar Refining , noted that the loss of even such a large cargo would not normally have much effect on the sugar market . However , weather in Cuba , then the largest supplier of sugar for the United States , had reduced that island nation 's crop by more than 200 @,@ 000 tons . Further affecting the situation was World War I , then ongoing in Europe , which had reduced the tonnage of shipping available to transport commodities like sugar . With all of these factors , the asking price for sugar futures contracts for February 1915 delivery was 2 @.@ 90 cents per pound ( 6 @.@ 39 cents per kg ) a week before Washingtonian 's sinking , but had risen to 3 @.@ 16 cents per pound ( 6 @.@ 96 cents per kg ) the day after the sinking . 
 Washingtonian 's wreck , a skeletal framework of hull plates and bulkheads , lies upside down in about 100 feet ( 30 m ) of water , and is one of the most @-@ visited wreck sites along the eastern seaboard . Washingtonian 's wreck is a popular night dive , and also a favorite with sport divers for catching lobster . 
 = Executive magistrates of the Roman Republic = 
 The executive magistrates of the Roman Republic were officials of the ancient Roman Republic ( c . 510 BC – 44 BC ) , elected by the People of Rome . Ordinary magistrates ( magistratus ) were divided into several ranks according to their role and the power they wielded : censors , consuls ( who functioned as the regular head of state ) , praetors , curule aediles , and finally quaestor . Any magistrate could obstruct ( veto ) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers . By definition , plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles were technically not magistrates as they were elected only by the plebeians , but no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions . Dictator was an extraordinary magistrate normally elected in times of emergency ( usually military ) for a short period . During this period , the dictator 's power over the Roman government was absolute , as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate . 
 = = Ranks = = 
 The magistrates ( magistratus ) were elected by the People of Rome , which consisted of plebeians ( commoners ) and patricians ( aristocrats ) . Each magistrate was vested with a degree of power , called " major powers " or maior <unk> dictators had more " major powers " than any other magistrate , and thus they outranked all other magistrates ; but were originally intended only to be a temporary tool for times of state emergency . Thereafter in descending order came the censor ( who , while the highest @-@ ranking ordinary magistrate by virtue of his prestige , held little real power ) , the consul , the praetor , the curule aedile , and the quaestor . Any magistrate could obstruct ( veto ) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers . If this obstruction occurred between two magistrates of equal rank , such as two praetors , then it was called par potestas ( negation of powers ) . To prevent this , magistrates used a principle of alteration , assigned responsibilities by lot or seniority , or gave certain magistrates control over certain functions . If this obstruction occurred against a magistrate of a lower rank , then it was called intercessio , where the magistrate literally interposed his higher rank to obstruct the lower @-@ ranking magistrate . By definition , plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles were technically not magistrates since they were elected only by the plebeians . As such , no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions . 
 = = Powers = = 
 Only the Roman citizens ( both plebeians and patricians ) had the right to confer magisterial powers ( potestas ) on any individual magistrate . The most important power was imperium , which was held by consuls ( the chief magistrates ) and by praetors ( the second highest @-@ ranking ordinary magistrate ) . Defined narrowly , imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force . Defined more broadly , however , imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands ( military , diplomatic , civil , or otherwise ) . A magistrate 's imperium was at its apex while the magistrate was abroad . While the magistrate was in the city of Rome itself , however , he had to completely surrender his imperium , so that liberty ( libertas ) was maximized . Magistrates with imperium sat in a curule chair , and were attended by lictors ( bodyguards ) who carried axes called fasces which symbolized the power of the state to punish and to execute . Only a magistrate with imperium could wear a bordered toga , or be awarded a triumph . 
 All magistrates had the power of coercion ( <unk> ) , which was used by magistrates to maintain public order . A magistrate had many ways with which to enforce this power . Examples include flogging , imprisonment , fines , mandating pledges and oaths , enslavement , banishment , and sometimes even the destruction of a person 's house . While in Rome , all citizens had an absolute protection against Coercion . This protection was called " Provocatio " ( see below ) , which allowed any citizen to appeal any punishment . However , the power of Coercion outside the city of Rome was absolute . Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens from the Gods ( auspicia ) , which could be used to obstruct political opponents . By claiming to witness an omen , a magistrate could justify the decision to end a legislative or senate meeting , or the decision to veto a colleague . While the magistrates had access to oracular documents , the Sibylline books , they rarely consulted with these books , and even then , only after seeing an omen . All senior magistrates ( consuls , praetors , censors , and plebeian tribunes ) were required to actively look for omens ( auspicia <unk> ) ; simply having omens thrust upon them ( auspicia <unk> ) was generally not adequate . Omens could be discovered while observing the heavens , while studying the flight of birds , or while studying the entrails of sacrificed animals . When a magistrate believed that he had witnessed such an omen , he usually had a priest ( augur ) interpret the omen . A magistrate was required to look for omens while presiding over a legislative or senate meeting , and while preparing for a war . 
 One check over a magistrate 's power was collegiality ( <unk> ) , which required that each magisterial office be held concurrently by at least two people . For example , two consuls always served together . The check on the magistrate 's power of Coercion was Provocatio , which was an early form of due process ( habeas corpus ) . Any Roman citizen had the absolute right to appeal any ruling by a magistrate to a plebeian tribune . In this case , the citizen would cry " <unk> ad <unk> " , which required the magistrate to wait for a tribune to intervene , and make a ruling . Sometimes , the case was brought before the College of tribunes , and sometimes before the Plebeian Council ( popular assembly ) . Since no tribune could retain his powers outside of the city of Rome , the power of Coercion here was absolute . An additional check over a magistrate 's power was that of Provincia , which required a division of responsibilities . 
 Once a magistrate 's annual term in office expired , he had to wait ten years before serving in that office again . Since this did create problems for some magistrates ( in particular , consuls and praetors ) , these magistrates occasionally had their imperium " prorogued " ( <unk> ) , which allowed them to retain the powers of the office as a <unk> . The result was that private citizens ended up with consular and praetorian imperium , without actually holding either office . Often , they used this power to act as provincial governors . 
 = = Ordinary magistrates = = 
 The consul of the Roman Republic was the highest @-@ ranking ordinary magistrate . Two consuls were elected for an annual term ( from January through December ) by the assembly of Roman soldiers , the Centuriate Assembly . After they were elected , they were granted imperium powers by the assembly . If a consul died before his term ended , another consul ( the consul <unk> ) , was elected to complete the original consular term . Throughout the year , one consul was superior in rank to the other consul . This ranking flipped every month , between the two consuls . Once a consul 's term ended , he held the honorary title of <unk> for the rest of his time in the senate , and had to wait for ten years before standing for reelection to the <unk> consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters , which was due , in part , to the fact that they held the highest ordinary grade of imperium ( command ) powers . While in the city of Rome , the consul was the head of the Roman government . While components of public administration were delegated to other magistrates , the management of the government was under the ultimate authority of the consul . The consuls presided over the Roman Senate and the Roman assemblies , and had the ultimate responsibility to enforce policies and laws enacted by both institutions . The consul was the chief diplomat , carried out business with foreign nations , and facilitated interactions between foreign ambassadors and the senate . Upon an order by the senate , the consul was responsible for raising and commanding an army . While the consuls had supreme military authority , they had to be provided with financial resources by the Roman Senate while they were commanding their armies . While abroad , the consul had absolute power over his soldiers , and over any Roman province . 
 The praetors administered civil law and commanded provincial armies , and , eventually , began to act as chief judges over the courts . Praetors usually stood for election with the consuls before the assembly of the soldiers , the Centuriate Assembly . After they were elected , they were granted imperium powers by the assembly . In the absence of both senior and junior consuls from the city , the Urban praetor governed Rome , and presided over the Roman Senate and Roman assemblies . Other praetors had foreign affairs @-@ related responsibilities , and often acted as governors of the provinces . Since praetors held imperium powers , they could command an army . 
 Every five years , two censors were elected for an eighteen @-@ month term . Since the censorship was the most prestigious of all offices , usually only former consuls were elected to it. censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers , the Centuriate Assembly , usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term . After the censors had been elected , the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial <unk> censors did not have imperium powers , and they were not accompanied by any lictors . In addition , they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies . Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates ( including consuls and praetors ) . This ranking , however , was solely a result of their prestige , rather than any real power they had . Since the office could be easily abused ( as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen ) , only former consuls ( usually patrician consuls ) were elected to the office . This is what gave the office its prestige . Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune , or a fellow censor . No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a <unk> tribunes , by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people , could veto anything or <unk> censors usually did not have to act in unison , but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census , he had to act in unison with his colleague . 
 Censors could enroll citizens in the senate , or purge them from the senate . A censor had the ability to fine a citizen , or to sell his property , which was often a punishment for either evading the census or having filed a fraudulent registration . Other actions that could result in a censorial punishment were the poor cultivation of land , cowardice or disobedience in the army , dereliction of civil duties , corruption , or debt . A censor could reassign a citizen to a different tribe ( a civil unit of division ) , or place a punitive mark ( nota ) besides a man 's name on the register . Later , a law ( one of the Leges <unk> or " <unk> Laws " ) allowed a citizen to appeal a censorial nota . Once a census was complete , a purification ceremony ( the <unk> ) was performed by a censor , which typically involved prayers for the upcoming five years . This was a religious ceremony that acted as the certification of the census , and was performed before the Centuriate <unk> censors had several other duties as well , including the management of public contracts and the payment of individuals doing contract work for the state . Any act by the censor that resulted in an expenditure of public money required the approval of the senate . 
 Aediles were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome , and often assisted the higher magistrates . The office was not on the cursus <unk> , and therefore did not mark the beginning of a political career . Every year , two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected . The Tribal Assembly , while under the presidency of a higher magistrate ( either a consul or praetor ) , elected the two curule aediles . While they had a curule chair , they did not have lictors , and thus they had no power of coercion . The Plebeian Council ( principal popular assembly ) , under the presidency of a plebeian tribune , elected the two plebeian <unk> aediles had wide ranging powers over day @-@ to @-@ day affairs inside the city of Rome , and over the maintenance of public order . They had the power over public games and shows , and over the markets . They also had the power to repair and preserve temples , sewers and aqueducts , to maintain public records , and to issue edicts . Any expenditure of public funds , by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile , had to be authorized by the senate . 
 The office of quaestor was considered the lowest @-@ ranking of all major political <unk> quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly , and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot . Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad , and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money , including army pay . Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities , such as the management of the public treasury , ( the aerarium Saturni ) where they monitored all items going into , and coming out of , the treasury . In addition , they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury . The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate . The quaestors were assisted by scribes , who handled the actual accounting for the treasury . The treasury was a repository for documents , as well as for money . The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury under the supervision of the quaestors . 
 = = Plebeian magistrates = = 
 Since the plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles were elected by the plebeians ( commoners ) in the Plebeian Council , rather than by all of the People of Rome ( plebeians and the aristocratic patrician class ) , they were technically not magistrates . While the term " plebeian magistrate " ( magistratus <unk> ) has been used as an approximation , it is technically a contradiction . The plebeian aedile functioned as the tribune 's assistant , and often performed similar duties as did the curule aediles ( discussed above ) . In time , however , the differences between the plebeian aediles and the curule aediles disappeared . 
 Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians , they were sacrosanct . Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge , taken by the plebeians , to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office . All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity . One obvious consequence of this sacrosanctity was the fact that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune , to disregard his veto , or to interfere with a tribune . The sacrosanctity of a tribune ( and thus all of his legal powers ) were only in effect so long as that tribune was within the city of Rome . If the tribune was abroad , the plebeians in Rome could not enforce their oath to kill any individual who harmed or interfered with the tribune . Since tribunes were technically not magistrates , they had no magisterial powers ( " major powers " or maior potestas ) , and thus could not rely on such powers to veto . Instead , they relied on the sacrosanctity of their person to obstruct . If a magistrate , an assembly or the senate did not comply with the orders of a tribune , the tribune could ' interpose the sacrosanctity of his person ' ( intercessio ) to physically stop that particular action . Any resistance against the tribune was tantamount to a violation of his sacrosanctity , and thus was considered a capital offense . Their lack of magisterial powers made them independent of all other magistrates , which also meant that no magistrate could veto a tribune . 
 tribunes could use their sacrosanctity to order the use of capital punishment against any person who interfered with their <unk> tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual , such as when arresting someone . On a couple of rare occasions ( such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus ) , a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction , which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions . While a tribune could veto any act of the senate , the assemblies , or the magistrates , he could only veto the act , and not the actual measure . Therefore , he had to physically be present when the act was occurring . As soon as that tribune was no longer present , the act could be completed as if there had never been a veto . 
 tribunes , the only true representatives of the people , had the authority to enforce the right of Provocatio , which was a theoretical guarantee of due process , and a precursor to our own habeas corpus . If a magistrate was threatening to take action against a citizen , that citizen could yell " <unk> ad <unk> " , which would appeal the magistrate 's decision to a tribune . A tribune had to assess the situation , and give the magistrate his approval before the magistrate could carry out the action . Sometimes the tribune brought the case before the College of tribunes or the Plebeian Council for a trial . Any action taken in spite of a valid provocatio was on its face illegal . 
 = = Extraordinary Magistrates = = 
 In times of emergency ( military or otherwise ) , a Roman dictator ( magister populi or " Master of the Nation " ) was appointed for a six @-@ month term . The dictator 's power over the Roman government was absolute , as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate . While the consul Cicero and the contemporary historian Livy do mention the military uses of the dictatorship , others , such as the contemporary historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus , mention its use for the purposes of maintaining order during times of plebeian unrest . For a dictator to be appointed , the Roman Senate had to pass a decree ( a senatus consultum ) , authorizing a Roman consul to nominate a dictator , who then took office immediately . Often the dictator resigned his office as soon as the matter that caused his appointment was resolved . Ordinary magistrates ( such as consuls and praetors ) retained their offices , but lost their independence and became agents of the dictator . If they disobeyed the dictator , they could be forced out of office . While a dictator could ignore the right of Provocatio , that right , as well as the plebeian tribune 's independence , theoretically still existed during a dictator 's term . A dictator 's power was equivalent to that of the power of the two consuls exercised conjointly , without any checks on their power by any other organ of government . Thus , dictatorial appointments were tantamount to a six @-@ month restoration of the monarchy , with the dictator taking the place of the old Roman king . This is why , for example , each consul was accompanied by twelve lictors outside the pomerium or six inside , whereas the dictator ( as the Roman King before him ) was accompanied by twenty four lictors outside the pomerium or twelve inside . 
 Each dictator appointed a Master of the Horse ( magister <unk> or Master of the Knights ) , to serve as his most senior lieutenant . The Master of the Horse had constitutional command authority ( imperium ) equivalent to a praetor , and often , when they authorized the appointment of a dictator , the senate specified who was to be the Master of the Horse . In many respects , he functioned more as a parallel magistrate ( like an inferior co @-@ consul ) than he did as a direct subordinate . Whenever a dictator 's term ended , the term of his Master of the Horse ended as well . Often , the dictator functioned principally as the master of the infantry ( and thus the legions ) , while the Master of the Horse ( as the name implies ) functioned as the master of the cavalry . The dictator , while not elected by the people , was technically a magistrate since he was nominated by an elected consul . The Master of the Horse was also technically a magistrate , since he was nominated by the dictator . Thus , both of these magistrates were referred to as " Extraordinary Magistrates " . 
 The last ordinary dictator was appointed in 202 BC . After 202 BC , extreme emergencies were addressed through the passage of the senatus consultum ultimum ( " ultimate decree of the senate " ) which suspended civil government , and declared something analogous to martial law . It declared " <unk> <unk> ne res publica <unk> <unk> " ( " let the consuls see to it that the state suffer no harm " ) which , in effect , vested the consuls with dictatorial powers . There were several reasons for this change . Up until 202 BC , dictators were often appointed to fight plebeian unrest . In 217 BC , a law was passed that gave the popular assemblies the right to nominate dictators . This , in effect , eliminated the monopoly that the aristocracy had over this power . In addition , a series of laws were passed , which placed additional checks on the power of the dictator . 
 = Peter of Bruys = 
 Peter of Bruys ( also known as Pierre De Bruys or Peter de <unk> ; fl . 1117 – <unk> ) was a popular French religious teacher , who is called a <unk> ( leader of a heretical movement ) by the Roman Catholic Church because he criticized infant baptism , opposed the erecting of churches and the veneration of crosses , opposed the doctrine of transubstantiation , and denied the efficacy of prayers for the dead . An angry mob killed him in or around the year 1131 . Information concerning Peter of Bruys is derived from two extant sources , the treatise of Peter the Venerable against his followers and from a passage written by Peter Abelard . 
 = = Life and teachings = = 
 Sources suggest that Peter was born at <unk> in southeastern France . The history of his early life is unknown , but it is certain that he was a Roman Catholic priest who had been deprived of his office by the Church hierarchy for teaching unorthodox doctrine . He began his preaching in Dauphiné and Provence probably between 1117 and 1120 . The local bishops , who oversaw the dioceses of Embrun , Die , and Gap , suppressed his teachings within their jurisdictions . In spite of the official repression , Peter 's teachings gained adherents at Narbonne , Toulouse , and in Gascony . 
 Peter of Bruys admitted the doctrinal authority of the Gospels in their literal interpretation ; the other New Testament writings he seems to have considered valueless , as he doubted their apostolic origin . He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself . Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy , infant baptism , prayers for the dead , and organ music . 
 = = = Treatise of Peter the Venerable = = = 
 In the preface to his treatise that attacked Peter of Bruys , Peter the Venerable summed up the five teachings he saw as the errors of the Petrobrusians . Peter the Venerable , also known as Peter of <unk> , was an abbot and an important religious writer who became a popular figure in the church , an internationally known scholar , and an associate of many national and religious leaders of his day . 
 The first " error " was their denial " that children , before the age of understanding , can be saved by the baptism ... According to the Petrobrusians not another ’ s , but one ’ s own faith , together with baptism , saves , as the Lord says , ' He who will believe and be baptised will be saved , but he who will not believe will be condemned . ' " This idea ran counter to the medieval Church 's teaching , particularly in the Latin West where , following the theology of Augustine , the baptism of infants and children played an essential role in their salvation from the ancestral guilt of original sin . 
 The second error charged ( with some exaggeration ) was that the Petrobrusians said , “ <unk> for temples and churches should not be erected ... The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying , ' It is unnecessary to build temples , since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together , but in the unity of the believers assembled . ' ” On the other hand , the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God , and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them . 
 The third error enumerated by Peter the Venerable was that the Petrobrusians “ command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned , because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured , so cruelly slain , is not worthy of any adoration , or veneration or supplication , but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor , cut in pieces with swords , burnt in fire . ” This was seen as an iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church , as well as by Catholics to this day . 
 The fourth error , according to Peter the Venerable , was that the Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace , rejecting the rite of Communion entirely , let alone the doctrine of the real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation . “ They deny , not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord , daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament , but declare that it is nothing at all , and ought not to be offered to God . They say , ' Oh , people , do not believe the bishops , priests , or clergy who seduce you ; who , as in many things , so in the office of the altar , deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ , and give it to you for the salvation of your souls . ' " The term " transubstantiation " , used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ , was first used by Hildebert de <unk> in about 1079 . This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys . In less than two centuries , in 1215 , the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary , orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist . 
 The fifth error was that “ they deride sacrifices , prayers , alms , and other good works by the faithful living for the faithful dead , and say that these things cannot aid any of the dead even in the least ... The good deeds of the living cannot profit the dead , because transferred from this life their merits cannot be increased or diminished , because beyond this life there is no longer place for merits , only for retribution . Nor can a dead man hope to gain from anybody that which he did not obtain while alive in the world . Therefore those things are pointless that are done by the living for the dead , because they are mortal and have passed by death beyond the way for all flesh , into the state of the future world , and took with them all their merit , to which nothing can be added . ” 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 As Peter the Venerable recorded , crosses were singled out for special iconoclasm . Peter of Bruys felt that crosses should not deserve veneration . Crosses became for the Petrobrusians objects of desecration and were destroyed in bonfires . In or around the year 1126 , Peter was publicly burning crosses in St Gilles near Nîmes . The local Roman Catholic populace , angered by Peter 's destruction of the crosses , cast him into the flames of his own bonfire . 
 Henry of Lausanne , a former Cluniac monk , adopted the Petrobrusians ' teachings about 1135 and spread them in a modified form after Peter 's death . The teachings of Peter of Bruys continued to be frequently condemned by the Roman Catholic Church , meriting mention at the Second Lateran Council in 1139 . 
 Henry of Lausanne 's followers became known as <unk> . Both the Henrician and the <unk> sects began to die out in 1145 , the year St Bernard of Clairvaux began preaching for a return to Roman orthodoxy in southern France . In a letter to the people of Toulouse , undoubtedly written at the end of 1146 , Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy . As late as 1151 , however , some <unk> still remained active in Languedoc . In that year , the Benedictine monk and English chronicler Matthew Paris related that a young girl who claimed to be miraculously inspired by the Virgin Mary was reputed to have converted a great number of the disciples of Henry of Lausanne . The sects both disappear from the historical record after this reference . 
 There is no evidence that Peter Waldo or any other later religious figures were directly influenced by Peter of Bruys . His low view of the Old Testament and the New Testament epistles was not shared by later Protestant figures such as Martin Luther or John Smyth . In spite of this , Peter of Bruys is considered a prophet of the Reformation by some evangelical Protestants and Anabaptists . 
 = Bob Cousy = 
 Robert Joseph " Bob " Cousy ( born August 9 , 1928 ) is an American retired professional basketball player . Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969 – 70 season . Cousy first demonstrated his basketball abilities while playing for his high school varsity team in his junior year . He obtained a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross , where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All @-@ American for 3 seasons . Cousy was initially drafted as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft by the Tri @-@ Cities Blackhawks , but after he refused to report , he was picked up by Boston . Cousy had a very successful career with the Celtics , playing on six championship teams , being voted into 13 NBA All @-@ Star Games and 12 All @-@ NBA First and Second Teams and winning the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 1957 . 
 In his first 11 seasons in the NBA , Cousy led the league in assists eight straight times and introduced a new blend of ball @-@ handling and passing skills that earned him the nicknames " <unk> , " " The Houdini of the Hardwood , " and — as he was regularly introduced at Boston Garden — " Mr. Basketball . " After his playing career , he coached the Royals for several years , and even made a short comeback for them at age 41 . He then became a broadcaster for Celtics games . He was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 , and in his honor , the Celtics retired his # 14 jersey and hung it in the rafters of Boston Garden . Cousy was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 , the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981 , and the NBA 's 50th Anniversary All @-@ Time Team in 1996 , making him one of only four players that were selected to each of those teams . He was also the first president of National Basketball Players Association . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Cousy was the only son of poor French immigrants living in New York City . He grew up in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan 's East Side , in the midst of the Great Depression . His father Joseph was a cab driver , who earned extra income by moonlighting . The elder Cousy had served in the German Army during World War I. Shortly after the war , his first wife died of pneumonia , leaving behind a young daughter . He married Julie <unk> , a secretary and French teacher from Dijon . At the time of the 1930 census , the family was renting an apartment in Astoria , Queens , for $ 50 per month . The younger Cousy spoke French for the first 5 years of his life , and started to speak English only after entering primary school . He spent his early days playing <unk> in a multicultural environment , regularly playing with African Americans , Jews and other ethnic minority children . These experiences ingrained him with a strong anti @-@ racist sentiment , an attitude he prominently promoted during his professional career . When he was 12 , his family moved to a rented house in St. Albans , Queens . That summer , the elder Cousy put a $ 500 down payment for a $ 4 @,@ 500 house four blocks away . He rented out the bottom two floors of the three @-@ story building to tenants to help make his mortgage payments on time . 
 = = = High school = = = 
 Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 , as a student at St. Pascal 's elementary school , and was " immediately hooked " . The following year , he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans . His basketball success was not immediate , and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year . Later that year , he joined the St. Albans <unk> of the Press League , a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press , where he developed his basketball skills and gained much @-@ needed experience . The next year , however , he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team . 
 That same year , he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand . The injury forced him to play left @-@ handed until his hand healed , making him effectively ambidextrous . In retrospect , he described this accident as " a fortunate event " and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court . During a Press League game , the high school basketball coach saw him play . He was impressed by the budding star 's ability to play with both hands , and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team . He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad . He continued to practice day and night , and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity ; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester . He joined the varsity squad midway through the season , however , scoring 28 points in his first game . He had no intention of attending college , but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college . 
 He again excelled in basketball his senior year , leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player . He was even named captain of the Journal @-@ American All @-@ Scholastic team . He then began to plan for college . His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school , and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City . Boston College recruited him , and he considered accepting the BC offer , but it had no dormitories , and he was not interested in being a commuter student . Soon afterward , he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester , Massachusetts about forty miles ( 64 kilometers ) west of Boston . He was impressed by the school , and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him . He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players .

 He was one of six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders ' varsity basketball team in 1946 – 47 . From the start of the season , coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two @-@ team system , so that each player would get some time on the court . As members of the " second team " , they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game , where they would relieve the " first team " starters . They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game , but even so Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his basketball talents on the court . Early in the season , however , he got into trouble with Julian , who accused him of being a <unk> on court . Even as late as that 1946 – 47 season basketball was a static game , depending on slow , deliberate player movement and flat @-@ footed shots . Far different was Cousy 's up @-@ tempo , <unk> @-@ like game , marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind @-@ the @-@ back dribbling and no @-@ look , behind @-@ the @-@ back and half @-@ court passing . Even so , he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season , finishing with the third @-@ highest total on the team . The team , with stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney , finished the 1946 – 47 basketball season 24 – 3 . 
 On the basis of that record , the Crusaders got into the 1947 NCAA Tournament as the last seed in the then only eight @-@ team tournament . In the first game , Holy Cross defeated Navy 55 @-@ 47 in front of a sell @-@ out crowd at Madison Square Garden . Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points , due mostly in part to Navy coach Ben Carnevale 's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney , who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter . In the semifinal game , the Crusaders faced CCNY , coached by Nat Holman , one of the game 's earliest innovators . The Crusaders , led by Kaftan 's thirty points , easily defeated the Beavers 60 – 45 . In the championship game , Holy Cross faced Oklahoma , coached by Bruce Drake , in another sold @-@ out game at Madison Square Garden . Kaftan followed up his 30 @-@ point semifinal heroics with a mere 18 points in the title game , which was far more than enough for the Crusaders to defeat the Sooners 58 – 47 . Cousy played poorly , however , scoring only four points on 2 @-@ for @-@ 13 shots . Holy Cross became the first New England college to win the NCAA tournament . On their arrival back in Worcester , the team was given a hero 's welcome by about ten thousand cheering fans who met their train at Union Station . 
 The following season Julian limited Cousy 's playing time , to the point that the frustrated sophomore contemplated transferring out of Holy Cross . Cousy wrote a letter to coach Joe Lapchick of St. John 's University in New York , informing him that he was considering a transfer there . Lapchick wrote back to Cousy that he considered Julian " one of the finest basketball coaches in America " and that he believed Julian had no bad intentions in restricting his playing time . He told Cousy that Julian would use him more often during his later years with the team . Lapchick alerted Cousy that transferring was a very risky move : according to NCAA rules , the player would be required to sit out a year before becoming eligible to play for the school to which he transferred . 
 During Cousy 's senior year of 1949 @-@ 1950 , his fate changed in a match against Loyola of Chicago at Boston Garden . With 5 minutes left and Holy Cross trailing , the crowd started to chant " We want Cousy ! " until coach Julian relented . In these few minutes , Cousy scored 11 points and hit a game @-@ winning buzzer @-@ beater coming off a behind @-@ the @-@ back dribble . The performance established him as a team leader , and he then led Holy Cross to 26 straight wins and a Number 4 national ranking , going on to become a three @-@ time All @-@ American . Bob Cousy ended his college career in the 1950 NCAA Tournament , when Holy Cross fell to North Carolina State in an opening round game at Madison Square Garden . CCNY would go on to win the tournament . Cousy ended his college basketball career just in the nick of time . The following year , college basketball would be rocked by the biggest point @-@ shaving scandal in the history of the sport .

 Cousy turned pro and made himself available for the 1950 NBA draft when the Boston Celtics had just concluded the 1949 – 50 NBA season with a poor 22 – 46 win @-@ loss record and had the first draft pick . It was strongly anticipated that they would draft the highly coveted local favorite Cousy . However , coach Red Auerbach snubbed him for center Charlie Share , saying : " Am I supposed to win , or please the local yokels ? " The local press strongly criticized Auerbach , but other scouts were also skeptical about Cousy , viewing him as flamboyant but ineffective . One scout wrote in his report : " The first time he tries that fancy Dan stuff in this league , they 'll cram the ball down his throat . " 
 As a result , the Tri @-@ Cities Blackhawks drafted Cousy , but the point guard was unenthusiastic about his new employer . Cousy was trying to establish a driving school in Worcester , Massachusetts and did not want to move into a left field consisting of three small towns of Moline , Rock Island and Davenport . As compensation for having to give up his driving school , Cousy demanded a salary of $ 10 @,@ 000 from Blackhawks owner Ben Kerner . When Kerner only offered him $ 6 @,@ 000 , Cousy refused to report . The latter was then picked up by the Chicago Stags , but when they folded , league Commissioner Maurice Podoloff declared three Stags available for a dispersal draft : Stags scoring champion Max <unk> , Andy Phillip and Cousy . Walter A. Brown , owner of the Boston Celtics , was one of the three club bosses invited . He later made it clear that he was hoping for <unk> , would have tolerated Phillip , and did not want Cousy . When the Celtics drew Cousy , Brown confessed : " I could have fallen to the floor . " Hence , Cousy became a Celtic , with Brown reluctantly giving him a $ 9 @,@ 000 salary . 
 It was not long before both Auerbach and Brown changed their minds . With an average of 15 @.@ 6 points , 6 @.@ 9 rebounds and 4 @.@ 9 assists a game , Cousy received the first of his 13 consecutive All @-@ NBA Team call @-@ ups , and led a Celtics team with future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Ed Macauley and Bones McKinney to a 39 – 30 record in the 1950 – 51 NBA season . However , in the 1951 NBA Playoffs , the Celtics were beaten by the New York Knicks . The next year , the Celtics added future Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guard Bill Sharman , and by averaging 21 @.@ 7 points , 6 @.@ 4 rebounds and 6 @.@ 7 assists per game , Cousy earned his first All @-@ NBA First Team nomination . Nonetheless , the Celtics lost to the Knicks in the 1952 NBA Playoffs . 
 In the following season , Cousy made further progress . Averaging 7 @.@ 7 assists per game , he won the first of his eight consecutive assists titles . These numbers were made despite the fact that the NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock , making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage . Powered by Auerbach 's quick fastbreak @-@ dominated tactics , the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2 – 0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs . Game 2 ended 111 – 105 in a 4 @-@ overtime thriller , in which Cousy had a much @-@ lauded game . Despite having an injured leg , he scored 25 points after four quarters , scored 6 of his team 's 9 points in the first overtime , hit a clutch free throw in the last seconds , and scored all 4 of Boston 's points in the second overtime . He scored 8 more points in the third overtime , among them a 25 @-@ ft. buzzer beater . In the fourth overtime , he scored 9 of Boston 's 12 points . Cousy played 66 minutes , and scored 50 points after making a still @-@ standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts . This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever , in line with Wilt Chamberlain 's 100 @-@ point game . However , for the third time in a row , the Knicks beat Boston in the next round . 
 In the next three years , Cousy firmly established himself as one of the league 's best point guards . Leading the league in assists all 3 seasons , and averaging 20 points and 7 rebounds , the versatile Cousy earned himself three more All @-@ NBA First Team and All @-@ Star honors , and was also Most Valuable Player of the 1954 NBA All @-@ Star Game . In terms of playing style , Cousy introduced an array of visually attractive street basketball moves , described by the NBA as a mix of ambidextrous , behind @-@ the @-@ back dribbling and " no @-@ look passes , behind @-@ the @-@ back feeds or half @-@ court fastbreak launches " . Cousy 's modus operandi contrasted with the rest of the NBA , which was dominated by muscular low post scorers and deliberate set shooters . Soon , he was called " Houdini of the Hardwood " after the magician Harry Houdini . Cousy 's crowd @-@ pleasing and effective play drew the crowd into the Boston Garden and also won over coach Auerbach , who no longer saw him as a liability , but as an essential building block for the future . 
 The Celtics eventually added two talented forwards , future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff . Along with Celtics colleague Bob <unk> , Loscutoff also became Cousy 's unofficial bodyguard , retaliating against opposing players who would try to hurt him . The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the 1954 NBA Playoffs , 1955 NBA Playoffs , and 1956 NBA Playoffs , where they lost three times in a row against the Nationals . Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue , stating : " We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball " . As a result , Auerbach sought a defensive center who could get easy rebounds , initiate fast breaks and close out games . 
 = = = Dynasty years ( 1957 – 63 ) = = = 
 Before the 1956 – 57 NBA season , Auerbach acquired two future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers : forward Tom Heinsohn , and defensive center Bill Russell . Powered by these new recruits , the Celtics went 44 – 28 in the regular season , and Cousy averaged 20 @.@ 6 points , 4 @.@ 8 rebounds and a league @-@ leading 7 @.@ 5 assists , earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award ; he also won his second NBA All @-@ Star Game MVP award . The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals , and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense , they beat the Hawks 4 – 3 , who were noted for future Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan . Cousy finally won his first title . 
 In the 1957 – 58 NBA season , Cousy had yet another highly productive year , with his 20 @.@ 0 points , 5 @.@ 5 rebounds and 8 @.@ 6 assists per game leading to nominations into the All @-@ NBA First Team and the All @-@ Star team . He again led the NBA in assists . The Celtics reached the 1958 NBA Finals against the Hawks , but when Russell succumbed to a foot injury in Game 3 , the Celtics faded and bowed out four games to two . This was the last losing NBA playoff series in which Cousy would play . 
 In the following 1958 – 59 NBA season , the Celtics got revenge on their opposition , powered by an inspired Cousy , who averaged 20 @.@ 0 points , 5 @.@ 5 rebounds and a league @-@ high 8 @.@ 6 assists a game , won another assists title and another pair of All @-@ NBA First Team and All @-@ Star team nominations . Late in the season , Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists in a game against the Minneapolis Lakers . While that record was broken 19 years later , Cousy also set a record for 19 assists in a half which has never been broken . The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and , behind Cousy 's 51 total assists ( still a record for a four @-@ game NBA Finals series ) , defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4 – 0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals . 
 In the 1959 – 60 NBA season , Cousy was again productive , his 19 @.@ 4 points , 4 @.@ 7 rebounds and 9 @.@ 5 assists per game earning him his eighth consecutive assists title and another joint All @-@ NBA First Team and All @-@ Star team nomination . Again , the Celtics defeated all opposition and won the 1960 NBA Finals 4 – 3 against the Hawks . A year later , the 32 @-@ year @-@ old Cousy scored 18 @.@ 1 points , 4 @.@ 4 rebounds and 7 @.@ 7 assists per game , winning another pair of All @-@ NBA First Team and All @-@ Star nominations , but failing to win the assists crown after eight consecutive seasons . However , the Celtics won the 1961 NBA Finals after convincingly beating the Hawks 4 – 1 . 
 In the 1961 – 62 NBA season , the aging Cousy slowly began to fade statistically , averaging 15 @.@ 7 points , 3 @.@ 5 rebounds and 7 @.@ 8 assists , and was voted into the All @-@ NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations . Still , he enjoyed a satisfying postseason , winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4 – 3 battles against two upcoming teams , the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers . The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic , because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last @-@ second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title . Finally , in the 1962 – 63 NBA season , the last of his career , Cousy averaged 13 @.@ 2 points , 2 @.@ 5 rebounds and 6 @.@ 8 assists , and collected one last All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA Second Team nomination . In the 1963 NBA Finals , the Celtics again won 4 – 2 against the Lakers , and Cousy finished his career on a high note : in the fourth quarter of Game 6 , Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench . He went back in with Boston up 1 . Although he did not score again , his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory , 112 – 109 . The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters . 
 At age 35 , Cousy held his retirement ceremony on March 17 , 1963 in a packed Boston Garden . The event became known as the Boston Tear Party , when the crowd 's response overwhelmed Cousy , left him speechless , and caused his planned 7 @-@ minute farewell to go on for 20 . Joe Dillon , a water worker from South Boston , Massachusetts , and a devoted Celtics fan , screamed " We love ya , <unk> , " breaking the tension and the crowd went into cheers . As a testament to Cousy 's legacy , President John F. Kennedy wired to Cousy : " The game bears an indelible stamp of your rare skills and competitive daring . " 
 = = Post @-@ player career = = 
 After retiring as a player , Cousy published his autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963 , and in the same year became coach at Boston College . In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden , Providence defeated Boston College 91 @-@ 86 in the title game , when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All @-@ American Jimmy Walker . Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney , who was Cousy 's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947 . In his six seasons there , he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969 . Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances , including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments , including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals . 
 Cousy grew bored with college basketball and returned to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals , team of fellow Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame point guard Oscar Robertson . He later said about this engagement , " I did it for the money . I was made an offer I couldn 't refuse . " In 1970 , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old Cousy even made a late @-@ season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales . Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games , ticket sales jumped by 77 percent . He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City / Omaha , but stepped down as the Kings ' coach early in the 1973 – 74 NBA season with a 141 – 209 record . 
 In later life , Cousy was Commissioner of the American Soccer League from 1974 to 1979 . He has been a color analyst on Celtics telecasts since the 1980s . " In addition , Cousy had a role in the basketball film Blue Chips in 1993 , in which he played a college athletic director . Today he is a marketing consultant for the Celtics , and occasionally makes broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman and ex @-@ Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn .

 In 1954 , the NBA had no health benefits , pension plan , minimum salary , and the average player 's salary was $ 8 @,@ 000 a season . To combat this , Cousy organized the National Basketball Players Association , the first trade union among those in the four major North American professional sports leagues . Cousy served as its first president until 1958 . 
 In his 13 @-@ year , 924 @-@ game NBA playing career , Cousy finished with 16 @,@ 960 points , 4 @,@ 786 rebounds and 6 @,@ 955 assists , translating to averages of 18 @.@ 4 points , 5 @.@ 2 rebounds and 7 @.@ 5 assists per game . He was regarded as the first great point guard of the NBA , winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league , all of them en bloc , and had a highly successful career , winning six NBA titles , one MVP award , 13 All @-@ Star and 12 All @-@ NBA First and Second Team call @-@ ups and two All @-@ Star MVP awards . With his eye @-@ catching dribbling and unorthodox passing , Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised the profile of the Boston Celtics and the entire NBA . His fast @-@ paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson . 
 In recognition of his feats , Cousy was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and honored by the Celtics , which retired his # 14 jersey . Celtics owner Walter Brown said : " The Celtics wouldn 't be here without him [ Cousy ] . He made basketball in this town . If he had played in New York he would have been the biggest thing since [ New York Yankees baseball legend ] Babe Ruth . I think he is anyway . " In addition , on May 11 , 2006 , ESPN.com rated Cousy as the fifth greatest point guard of all time , lauding him as " ahead of his time with his ballhandling and passing skills " and pointing out he is one of only five point guards ever to win a NBA Most Valuable Player award . 
 On November 16 , 2008 Cousy 's college # 17 was hoisted to the Hart Center rafters . During halftime of a game between the Holy Cross Crusaders and St. Joseph 's Hawks , Cousy , George Kaftan , Togo Palazzi , and Tommy Heinsohn 's numbers became the first to hang from the gymnasium 's ceiling .

 Cousy married his college sweetheart , <unk> <unk> , in December 1950 , six months after he graduated from Holy Cross . They lived in Worcester , Massachusetts , and had two daughters , <unk> died on September 20 , 2013 , after suffering from dementia for several years . 
 Cousy was well @-@ known , both on and off the court , for his public stance against racism , a result of his upbringing in a multicultural environment . In 1950 , the Celtics played a game in the then @-@ segregated city of Charlotte , North Carolina , and teammate Chuck Cooper — the first African @-@ American in NBA history to be drafted — would have been denied a hotel room . Instead of taking the hotel room , Cousy insisted on travelling with Cooper on an uncomfortable overnight train . He described their visit to a segregated men 's toilet — Cooper was prohibited from using the clean " for whites " bathroom and had to use the shabby " for colored " facility — as one of the most shameful experiences of his life . He also sympathized with the plight of black Celtics star Bill Russell , who was frequently a victim of racism . 
 Cousy was close to his Celtics mentor , head coach Red Auerbach , and was one of the few permitted to call him " Arnold " , his given name , instead of his nickname " Red " . 
 = 1952 Winter Olympics = 
 The 1952 Winter Olympics ( Norwegian : Vinter @-@ OL 1952 ) , officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games ( French : Les <unk> Jeux olympiques d 'hiver ) , took place in Oslo , Norway , from 14 to 25 February . Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935 ; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games , but World War II made that impossible . Instead , Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d 'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States . All of the venues were in Oslo 's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events , which were held at Norefjell , 113 km ( 70 mi ) from the capital . A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries , along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches , creating the first modern athlete 's village . The city of Oslo bore the financial burden of hosting the Games in return for the revenue they generated . 
 The Games attracted 694 athletes representing 30 countries , who participated in four sports and 22 events . Japan and Germany made their returns to winter Olympic competition , after being forced to miss the 1948 Games in the aftermath of World War II . Germany was represented solely by West German athletes because East Germany declined to compete as a unified team . Portugal and New Zealand made their Winter Olympic debuts , and for the first time women were allowed to compete in cross @-@ country skiing . 
 Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen won three out of four speed skating events to become the most decorated athlete at the Games . Germany resumed its former prominence in bobsleigh , with wins in the four- and two @-@ man events . Dick Button of the United States performed the first triple jump in international competition to claim his second consecutive men 's figure skating Olympic title . The 1952 Games featured one demonstration sport , bandy , but only three Nordic countries competed in the tournament . Norway dominated the overall medal count with 16 medals , seven of them gold . The Games closed with the presentation of a flag that would be passed from one Winter Olympics host city to the next . The flag , which became known as the " Oslo flag " , has been displayed in the host city during each subsequent Winter Games . 
 = = Host city selection = = 
 Oslo had unsuccessfully bid to host the 1936 Winter Olympics , losing to Germany , which had hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics . At that time , the nation that hosted the Summer Olympics also hosted the Winter Olympics . After the 1936 Games , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) decided to award the Winter and Summer Games to different countries , but the Games were suspended during World War II . London hosted the first post @-@ war Games , the 1948 Summer Olympics , and recommended Oslo as the host city for the 1948 Winter Games , but the city council declined . Instead , the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in St. Moritz , Switzerland . 
 Norwegians were undecided about hosting a Winter Olympics . Culturally , they were opposed to competitive winter sports , particularly skiing events , despite the success of Norwegian athletes at previous Winter Games . But the organizers believed the 1952 Games could be an opportunity to promote national unity and to show the world that Norway had recovered from the war . Vying with Oslo for the right to host the Games were Cortina d 'Ampezzo , Italy , and Lake Placid , United States . The IOC voted to award the 1952 Winter Games to Oslo on 21 June 1947 at the 40th IOC Session in Stockholm , Sweden . Later , Cortina d 'Ampezzo was awarded the 1956 Games , and Lake Placid — which had hosted the 1932 Winter Olympics — was chosen to host the 1980 Winter Games . Norway became the first Scandinavian country to host a Winter Olympics , and the 1952 Winter Games were the first to be held in a nation 's capital .

 A special committee was assigned to organize the 1952 Games , which consisted of four Norwegian sports officials and four representatives from the municipality of Oslo , including mayor <unk> Bull . The committee was in place by December 1947 . The city of Oslo funded the Games entirely , in exchange for keeping all the revenue generated . To accommodate the influx of athletes and coaches , quarters for competitors and support staff were designed and constructed , with three new facilities ( forerunners of the athlete 's villages of later Games ) built . The city of Oslo paid to have a new hotel constructed , the Viking , used for IOC delegates , out @-@ of @-@ town dignitaries , and as the communication hub of the Games . For the first time in a Winter Games , an indoor ice hockey arena was constructed , which hosted the eight @-@ team tournament . Oslo 's existing central arena , Bislett Stadium , was used for the opening and closing ceremonies , and for speed skating events . Improvements to the arena included better sound and lighting systems , remodeled club house and press rooms , and the addition of a medical center . 
 = = Politics = = 
 In the aftermath of the German occupation of Norway during World War II , anti @-@ German sentiment began to affect preparations for the 1952 Olympics . Discussions were held to consider whether Germany should be allowed to participate in the Games . When in 1950 , the West German Olympic Committee requested recognition by the IOC , it raised the question of whether their participation would cause political boycotts in the upcoming Games . Once the IOC recognized the West German Olympic Committee , West Germany was then formally invited to compete at the 1952 Winter Games . East Germany was invited to participate with West Germany , as a unified team , but they declined . 
 At first Norway was reluctant to welcome German athletes and others considered Nazi sympathizers . For example , Norwegian speed skater Finn <unk> was not allowed to compete in the Norwegian speed skating team because he collaborated with the Nazis during the war . Eventually , despite the concern , Norway agreed to allow German and Japanese athletes to compete . The Soviet Union sent no athletes to Oslo , despite being recognized by the IOC . They had intended to enter a team in the ice hockey tournament , but applied too late to join the International Ice Hockey Federation .

 The opening ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadium on 15 February . King George VI of Great Britain had died on 6 February 1952 , eight days before the start of the Games . As a result , all national flags were flown at half @-@ mast , and Princess Ragnhild opened the Games in place of her grandfather , King Haakon VII , who was in London attending the funeral . This was the first time an Olympic Games had been declared open by a woman . The parade of nations was held according to tradition , with Greece first , the rest of the nations proceeding by Norwegian alphabetical order , with the host nation last . The British , Australian , Canadian and New Zealand teams all wore black arm bands at the opening ceremonies in memory of their monarch . After the parade of nations the Olympic flame was lit . On 13 February , at the start of the inaugural Winter Olympics torch relay , the torch was lit in the hearth of the <unk> House , birthplace of skiing pioneer Sondre Norheim . The torch relay lasted two days and took place entirely on skis . At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer , Eigil Nansen , received the Olympic torch and skied to a flight of stairs where he removed his skis , ascended , and ignited the flame . 
 The bobsleigh and alpine skiing events were held the day before the opening ceremonies . Competitors in these events were unable to attend the festivities in Oslo ; consequently simple opening ceremonies were held at Frognerseteren , site of the bobsleigh events , and Norefjell , site of the alpine skiing events . 
 = = = Bobsleigh = = = 
 After a 16 @-@ year hiatus from the Olympics Germany made a triumphant return to the bobsleigh competition , winning the two- and four @-@ man events . The results for both bobsleigh events were the same , with the United States and Switzerland taking silver and bronze respectively . Fritz <unk> from Switzerland competed in both the two- and four @-@ man competitions . His two bronze medals were the fourth and fifth in an Olympic career that spanned 16 years and three Olympics . There were no weight restrictions on the bobsleigh athletes , and the average weight for each member of the winning German four @-@ man team was 117 kg ( 258 lb ) , which was more than the Olympic heavyweight boxing champion in 1952 . Seeing the undue advantage overweight athletes brought to their teams , the International Federation for Bobsleigh and <unk> instituted a weight limit for future Olympics .

 All of the speed skating events were held at Bislett Stadium . Americans Ken Henry and Don McDermott placed first and second in the 500 @-@ meter race , but Norwegian truck driver Hjalmar Andersen electrified the partisan crowd by winning the 1 @,@ 500 , 5 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 @-@ meter events ; his margins of victory were the largest in Olympic history . Dutchman Wim van der <unk> placed second in the 1 @,@ 500 meters and his countryman Kees <unk> placed second to Andersen in the 5 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 @-@ meter races , becoming the first Olympic speed skating medalists from the Netherlands . Absent from the competition was former world champion <unk> <unk> . The Hungarian @-@ born speed skater had won both long distance races at the World Championships held in Oslo in 1949 and then defected to Sweden , but was unable to obtain Swedish citizenship in time to compete in 1952 . 
 = = = Alpine skiing = = = 
 There were three alpine skiing events on the Olympic program : the slalom , giant slalom and downhill . Both men and women competed in all three events , held at Norefjell and Rødkleiva . The giant slalom made its Olympic debut at the 1952 Games . Austrian skiers dominated the competition , winning seven out of a possible 18 medals , including Othmar Schneider who won gold and silver in the men 's slalom and downhill . Norwegian Stein Eriksen won gold in the men 's giant slalom and silver in the slalom . Greek slalom skier <unk> <unk> fell 18 times on his run and crossed the finish line backwards . American skier Andrea Mead Lawrence was the only double gold medalist , winning the giant slalom and the slalom . She was the first skier from the United States to win two alpine skiing gold medals .

 All the cross @-@ country events were held next to the ski jump hill at Holmenkollbakken . As had been the case in 1948 there were three men 's events : 18 kilometers , 50 kilometers , and a relay . Added to the Olympic program for the first time was a ten @-@ kilometer race for women . All the cross @-@ country medals were won by Nordic countries , and Finnish skiers won eight of the twelve possible . Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross @-@ country skiing ; her teammates <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> won silver and bronze respectively . Veikko Hakulinen won the 50 @-@ kilometer men 's race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals , three of them gold . Hallgeir Brenden won the 18 @-@ kilometer race and helped Norway take the silver in the 4 × 10 @-@ kilometer relay . Brenden went on to win another gold in the men 's 15 @-@ kilometer race in 1956 , and a silver in the relay in 1960 .

 The nordic combined event was held at the cross @-@ country and ski jump venues . For the first time , the ski jump part took place first with competitors taking three jumps from the Holmenkollbakken . The 18 km cross country skiing event took place the next day . Results were tallied by the best two marks were scored , along with the results of the cross @-@ country race , to determine a winner . Norwegians Simon <unk> and Sverre Stenersen won the gold and bronze respectively . Stenersen went on to win the gold at the 1956 Games in the same event . Heikki Hasu from Finland won the silver , preventing a Norwegian sweep of the medals .

 Crowds in excess of 100 @,@ 000 greeted the ski jumpers as they competed at Holmenkollbakken . In 1952 there was only one event , the men 's normal hill , which was held on 24 February . The King , Prince Harald , and Princess Ragnhild were in attendance . The Norwegian athletes did not disappoint the crowd , as Arnfinn Bergmann and Torbjørn <unk> placed first and second ; Swedish jumper Karl <unk> took the bronze . Norwegian athletes won the ski jumping gold medal in every Winter Olympics from 1924 to 1952 . 
 = = = Figure skating = = = 
 There were three events in the Olympic figure skating competition : men 's singles , women 's singles and mixed pairs . The events were held at Bislett Stadium on a rink constructed inside the speed skating track . The collusion of judges to influence results was an emerging trend in the years leading up to the Oslo Games . Between 1949 and 1952 the International Skating Union had banned five judges for attempting to fix scores , although no evidence of wrongdoing was found in the judging of the Olympic competitions . 
 Dick Button of the United States won the men 's singles event . Helmut <unk> of Austria took silver and James Grogan of the United States won bronze . Button became the first figure @-@ skater to land a triple jump in competition when he performed the triple loop in the men 's free skate . British skater Jeannette <unk> won the gold medal in the women 's singles , the silver was awarded to American <unk> Albright , who went on to win gold at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina d 'Ampezzo , and Jacqueline du <unk> of France won the bronze . The German husband and wife pair of Ria and Paul Falk won the mixed pairs competition . They defeated Americans Karol and Peter Kennedy , who placed second , and Hungarian siblings Marianna and László Nagy , who won the bronze medal . 
 = = = Ice hockey = = = 
 A majority of the ice hockey matches took place at Jordal Amfi , a new hockey stadium built for the Olympics . Nine teams played in the tournament and Canada again won the gold medal . Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey tournament thus far , but in 1956 the Soviet team began to compete and ended Canadian dominance . Canada was represented by the Edmonton <unk> , an amateur hockey team sponsored by the owner of a Mercury automobile dealership . Canada played the United States to a three all tie on the final day to clinch the Gold , and assure the Americans of Silver . Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet criticized the result , calling the game , " fixed in advance . " Sweden and Czechoslovakia ended up tied for third and played an extra game for the bronze medal , which went to Sweden . The Czechs believed they had already won the Bronze when they defeated the Swedes on the final day , calling the decision to play a tie @-@ breaking game a , " plot of the capitalist countries . " Teams from North America were criticized for their rough play ; although body checking was legal , it was not often used by European teams , and opponents and spectators alike took a dim view of that style of play . 
 = = = Bandy = = = 
 The IOC lobbied the organizing committee to host either military patrol or curling as a demonstration sport . The committee instead selected bandy , which had never been included in the Winter Games . Bandy which is popular in nordic countries , is played by teams of eleven on an outdoor soccer field @-@ sized ice rink , using a small ball and sticks about 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) long . As it was a demonstration sport , the players were ineligible for medals . Three nations participated : Finland , Norway and Sweden . Each of the three teams won one game and lost one game ; with Sweden winning the competition based on number of goals scored , followed by Norway in second place , and Finland in third place . Two of the games were played at <unk> Stadium and one at Bislett Stadium . 
 = = = Closing ceremonies = = = 
 At the 1952 Winter Games the closing ceremonies were a distinct program listing , unlike previous Winter Games when the closing ceremonies were held directly after the final event . The closing ceremonies were held in Bislett Stadium , on Monday evening , 25 February . The flag bearers entered the stadium in the same order they followed for the opening ceremonies . That evening four medal ceremonies were also held for the women 's cross @-@ country race , the men 's cross @-@ country relay , the ski jumping competition , and the ice hockey tournament . 
 Since 1920 , the " Antwerp flag " has been passed from host city to host city during closing ceremonies for the Summer Games . The city of Oslo gave an Olympic flag to establish the same tradition for the Winter Games . <unk> Bull , Oslo 's mayor , passed the flag to the president of the IOC , Sigfrid Edström , who declared the flag was to pass from host city to host city for future Winter Games . The flag , which came to be known as the " Oslo Flag " , has since been preserved in a display case , with the name of every Winter Olympics host city engraved on brass plaques , and is brought to each Winter Games to be displayed . A replica is used during the closing ceremonies . 
 After the flag ceremony the Olympic flame was extinguished , a special speed skating race was held , and the figure skating competitors gave an exhibition , followed by 40 children dressed in national costumes performing an ice dance . For a finale , to the close the Games , the lights were extinguished and a 20 @-@ minute fireworks display lit up the night sky .

 With a seating capacity of 29 @,@ 000 , Bislett Stadium became the centrepiece of the Games . It was the venue for the speed skating events and the figure skating competition . Bislett was large enough for a 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) speed skating track , and a figure skating ice @-@ rink of 30 by 60 m ( 98 by 197 ft ) ; a snow bank separated the track and the rink . Because Bislett was an outdoor arena , the organizing committee chose Tryvann Stadion and Hamar Stadion as secondary alternative skating venues to be used the case of bad weather . In 1994 Hamar became the venue for the speed skating events at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer . 
 The Oslo Winter Games were the first to feature an Olympic ice hockey tournament held on artificial ice . A new stadium was built for the hockey tournament in a residential area of eastern Oslo , called Jordal Amfi , which accommodated 10 @,@ 000 spectators in stands rising steeply from the rink . Twenty @-@ three of the 36 hockey matches were played at Jordal Amfi , with the remaining matches played at <unk> , Dælenenga idrettspark , Lillestrøm Stadion and Marienlyst Stadion . 
 The cross @-@ country races and ski @-@ jump competition were held at Holmenkollbakken , located roughly 8 km ( 5 mi ) from the center of Oslo . The expected number of spectators caused concerns about traffic , so a new road was constructed and the existing thoroughfare widened . Holmenkollbakken was built in 1892 and improvements were needed to meet international standards . The original wood ski @-@ jump was replaced with a concrete tower and jump that was 87 m ( 285 ft ) long . New stands were built to seat 13 @,@ 000 people , and an area was added at the base of the hill to accommodate 130 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 The hills and terrain in the surrounding area met the competitive demands for an elite cross @-@ country ski event . A notice board was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors . The cross @-@ country and nordic combined races began and ended at the base of the ski jump hill . The stands for the ski jump competition had to be removed during the cross @-@ country races ; spectators had only a small area from which to watch the races but were allowed on the course to cheer on the competitors . 
 The alpine skiing events were split between Norefjell and Rødkleiva . The slalom courses were at Rødkleiva , located on the same mountain as Holmenkollen and Frognerseteren . The course had an elevation difference , from start to finish , of 200 m ( 660 ft ) and was 480 m ( 1 @,@ 570 ft ) in length . A rope tow had to be built to bring the skiers from the bottom to the top of the hill . The downhill race and the giant slalom — which made its Olympic <unk> in 1952 — were held at Norefjell , which was 113 km ( 70 mi ) from Oslo and the only venue located away from the capital city . Work had to be done to make the area suitable for Olympic competition . A bridge across Lake Krøderen was built to help alleviate transportation congestion . A new hotel , two ski lifts , and a new road were also constructed . 
 There was no permanent bobsleigh run in Norway . Instead the organizers built a temporary course out of snow and ice . This is often wrongly assumed to have been built at Korketrekkeren . From Frognerseteren a <unk> m ( 4 @,@ 948 ft ) long , thirteen @-@ turn course was designed and built . The bobsleigh run was first constructed and tested in 1951 , then rebuilt for the Games in 1952 . A car was used to return the bobsleighs to the start of the track .

 William Bradley Pitt was born in Shawnee , Oklahoma , to William Alvin Pitt , who ran a trucking company , and Jane Etta ( née Hillhouse ) , a school counsellor . The family soon moved to Springfield , Missouri , where he lived together with his younger siblings , Doug ( born 1966 ) and Julie Neal ( born 1969 ) .

 Pitt attended Kickapoo High School , where he was a member of the golf , swimming and tennis teams . He participated in the school 's Key and Forensics clubs , in school debates , and in musicals . Following his graduation from high school , Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982 , majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising . As graduation approached , Pitt did not feel ready to settle down . He loved films — " a portal into different worlds for me " — and , since films were not made in Missouri , he decided to go to where they were made . Two weeks before earning his degree , Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles , where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs .

 While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles , Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London . Pitt 's acting career began in 1987 , with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out , No Man 's Land and Less Than Zero . His television debut came in May 1987 with a two @-@ episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World . In November of the same year Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains . He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy , the boyfriend of Charlie Wade ( played by <unk> McCall ) .

 In the same year , the Yugoslavian – U.S. co @-@ production The Dark Side of the Sun ( 1988 ) gave Pitt his first leading film role , as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition . The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence , and was not released until 1997 . Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989 : the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together ; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class , the first of Pitt 's films to reach theaters . He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class , Freddy 's Nightmares , Thirtysomething , and ( for a second time ) Growing Pains . 
 Pitt was cast as Billy Canton , a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway ( played by Juliette Lewis ) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die ? , the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder . Ken Tucker , television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote : " Pitt is a magnificent <unk> as her <unk> boyfriend ; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp , he 's really scary . " The same year , Pitt co @-@ starred in six episodes of the short @-@ lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image . His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks ; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney , a high school runner with a criminal brother , played by Rick Schroder . 
 After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances , Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott 's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise . He played J.D. , a small @-@ time criminal who befriends Thelma ( Geena Davis ) . His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol . After Thelma & Louise , Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede , a low @-@ budget picture about an aspiring rock star , and the 1992 live @-@ action / animated fantasy film Cool World , although neither furthered his career , having poor reviews and box office performance . 
 Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It , directed by Robert Redford . His portrayal of the character was described by People 's Janet Mock as a career @-@ making performance , proving that Pitt could be more than a " cowboy @-@ hatted hunk . " He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his " weakest performances ... It 's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for . " Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew . He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player , saying " when you play with somebody better than you , your game gets better . " 
 In 1993 , Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film <unk> . He played Early <unk> , a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis 's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as " outstanding , all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace .

He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow .

 1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt 's career . Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the romantic horror film Interview with the Vampire , based on Anne Rice 's 1976 novel of the same name , he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise , Kirsten Dunst , Christian Slater , and Antonio Banderas . Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony , his performance was poorly received . According to the Dallas Observer , " Brad Pitt ... is a large part of the problem [ in the film ] . When directors play up his cocky , <unk> , folksy side ... he 's a joy to watch . But there 's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self @-@ awareness , which makes him a boring Louis . " 
 Following the release of Interview with the Vampire , Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall ( 1994 ) , based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison , set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century . Portraying Tristan Ludlow , son of Colonel William Ludlow ( Anthony Hopkins ) a Cornish immigrant , Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination , in the Best Actor category . Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co @-@ starred as Pitt 's brothers . Although the film 's reception was mixed , many film critics praised Pitt 's performance . Janet Maslin of The New York Times said , " Pitt 's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it 's a shame the film 's superficiality gets in his way . " The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt 's reputation as a lead actor . 
 In 1995 , Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow in the crime thriller Seven , playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer . Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons . He expressed his intent to move on from " this ' pretty boy ' thing ... and play someone with flaws . " His performance was critically well received , with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best , further remarking on Pitt 's ability to turn in a " determined , energetic , creditable job " as the detective . Seven earned $ 327 million at the international box office . 
 Following the success of Seven , Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam 's 1995 science @-@ fiction film 12 Monkeys . The movie received predominantly positive reviews , with Pitt praised in particular . Janet Maslin of the New York Times called Twelve Monkeys " fierce and disturbing " and remarked on Pitt 's " startlingly frenzied performance " , concluding that he " electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film . " He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor . 
 The following year he had a role in the legal drama Sleepers ( 1996 ) , based on Lorenzo Carcaterra 's novel of the same name . The film received mixed reviews . In the 1997 film The Devil 's Own Pitt starred , opposite Harrison Ford , as the Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory <unk> , a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent . Critical opinion was divided on his accent ; " Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity , but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it 's hard to understand what he 's saying " , wrote the San Francisco Chronicle . The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt 's accent over the movie . The Devil 's Own grossed $ 140 million worldwide , but was a critical failure . Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich <unk> in the Jean @-@ Jacques <unk> film Seven Years in Tibet . Pitt trained for months for the role , which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice , including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co @-@ star David Thewlis . The film received mostly negative reviews , and was generally considered a disappointment . 
 Pitt had the lead role in 1998 's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black . He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human . The film received mixed reviews , and many were critical of Pitt 's performance . According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle , Pitt was unable to " make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity . " Roger Ebert stated " Pitt is a fine actor , but this performance is a miscalculation . "

 In 1999 , Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club , a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk 's novel of the same name , directed by David Fincher . Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing , taekwondo , and grappling . To look the part , Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended . While promoting Fight Club , Pitt said that the film explored not taking one 's aggressions out on someone else but to " have an experience , take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end . " Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival . Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole , Pitt 's performance was widely praised . Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film , while Variety remarked upon Pitt 's ability to be " cool , charismatic and more dynamically physical , perhaps than ... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise " . In spite of a worse @-@ than @-@ expected box office performance , Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000 . 
 Following Fight Club , Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie 's 2000 gangster film Snatch . Several reviewers were critical of Snatch ; however , most praised Pitt . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was " ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can 't understand him " , going on to say that , before Snatch , Pitt had been " shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection , but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion ; " while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that " Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one @-@ joke role " . 
 The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican , a film that garnered a range of reviews but enjoyed box office success . Pitt 's next role , in 2001 's $ 143 million @-@ grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game , was as Tom Bishop , an operative of the CIA 's Special Activities Division , mentored by Robert Redford 's character . Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film , although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided " much of an emotional connection for the audience " . On November 22 , 2001 , Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends , playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green , played by Jennifer Aniston , to whom Pitt was married at the time . For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series . In December 2001 , Pitt had the role of Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean 's Eleven , a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original . He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney , Matt Damon , Andy García , and Julia Roberts . Well received by critics , Ocean 's Eleven was highly successful at the box office , earning $ 450 million worldwide .

 = NSB El 17 = 
 The NSB El 17 is a class of twelve electric locomotives built by Thyssen @-@ Henschel and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) for the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) . The class was built in two batches , the first delivered in 1982 and numbered 2221 – 2226 , and the second delivered in 1987 and numbered <unk> – <unk> . The traction system of the El 17 was based on the DB Class 120 of Germany ( BBC , AEG and Siemens ) and were among the first in the world to feature three @-@ phase asynchronous motors . The units were ordered to be used on the intercity Bergen , Dovre and Sørland Lines , but were plagued with technical faults ( overheating traction equipment , transient voltages , etc . ) . The unreliability and lack of sufficient power forced NSB to instead use them in the regional Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines . With the delivery of the El 18 , the first series was retired or used as shunters . The second series has been used on the Flåm Line since 1998 . 
 The locomotives have a maximum 3 @,@ 000 kilowatts ( 4 @,@ 000 hp ) power output and a 240 kN ( 54 @,@ 000 lbf ) tractive effort , allowing the locomotive to haul a six @-@ car train . They run on a 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC power supply and are capable of operating at 150 km / h ( 93 mph ) . The units have a Bo 'Bo ' wheel arrangement , have regenerative brakes and weigh 64 tonnes ( 63 long tons ; 71 short tons ) . The series was delivered at the same time as the Di 4 and have some similarities with the class . 
 = = History = = 
 During the late 1970s , NSB was in need of new rolling stock for their intercity trains . At first electric multiple units were considered , but NSB instead chose to order locomotives and waggons , to have greater operational flexibility . The choice fell on the German DB Class 120 , which was the first three @-@ phase asynchronous locomotive in the world in " almost " regular service ( prototype 120 @.@ 0 in test service 1979 , the serial version 120 @.@ 1 from 1986 ) . However , the Norwegian variation was scaled down due to the maximum axle load ( 16 @.@ 0 t or 15 @.@ 7 long tons or 17 @.@ 6 short tons , Class 120 has 21 @.@ 0 t or 20 @.@ 7 long tons or 23 @.@ 1 short tons ) and had a lower power output than the Class 120 . Because of this , the El 17 is less powerful than its three predecessors , El 14 , El 15 and El 16 ( 3 @.@ 0 MW instead of 4 @.@ 4 MW ) . 
 When the order was placed , it was the first Norwegian electric locomotive with the mechanical components built in Germany . At the same time , NSB ordered five six @-@ axle diesel @-@ electric locomotives from Thyssen @-@ Henschel ( Mark Di 4 ) , almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500 . The Di 4 / ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17 . The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors , but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120 . 
 The first six locomotives , numbered 2221 – 2226 , were delivered in 1982 . At the same time , the delivery of the B7 passenger cars from Strømmens Verksted was made , and the first train with an El 17 and <unk> in regular service operated on the Dovre Line on 14 September 1982 . The El 17 was plagued with problems ( overheated components , etc . ) , and NSB quickly decided to operate them in pairs in case one unit should fail . On 6 July 1982 , there was a fire in 2224 , and it was sent to Thyssen @-@ Henschel to be redesigned . NSB initially placed the unit in service with a round trip from Oslo to Trondheim each day . Due to the technical malfunctions , all the six original trains were rebuilt several times ; in the end , they all had different technical solutions . 
 Eventually NSB felt confident that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory , and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre , Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class . Units <unk> – <unk> were delivered in 1987 , and put into regular service on the Sørland Line . Although better than the first series , the second series was also prone to technical problems , and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line . During the 1990s , they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines . The units were never well @-@ liked by NSB , in part because of the bad name the first series had given , and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable . It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently . The locomotives had been designed to haul a six @-@ car train , but NSB regularly needed to haul eight @-@ car trains , and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16 . 
 In the early 1990s , NSB decided that they would replace the intercity trains with the Class 73 tilting multiple unit , and the locomotives for loco @-@ hauled trains with the Swiss @-@ designed El 18 ( also with electric equipment from ABB , former BBC ) . In 1997 , no . 2226 was put aside , and scrapped the following year . From 1998 , the second series of El 17 was put into service on the Flåm Line , a steep tourist line that connects to the Bergen Line . The units were painted green and connected at each end of a train of six B3 passenger cars . From 2003 , the first series was taken out of regular service , and units <unk> , 2224 and <unk> were put into shunting service at <unk> . Unit <unk> was transferred to the Norwegian Railway Museum , where it was put on display .

The units receive 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC power from a pantograph and are the first class of locomotive for NSB that has regenerative brakes . The electrical equipment was designed by the manufacturer BBC ( German plant Mannheim ) but built by the Norwegian manufacturer Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) .

 = Dinheirosaurus = 
 Dinheirosaurus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur that is known from fossils uncovered in modern @-@ day Portugal . It may represent a species of Supersaurus . The only species is Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis , first described by José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus in 1999 for vertebrae and some other material from the Lourinhã Formation . Although the precise age of the formation is not known , it can be dated around the early Tithonian of the Late Jurassic . 
 The known material includes two cervical vertebrae , nine dorsal vertebrae , a few ribs , a fragment of a pubis , and many gastroliths . Of the material , only the vertebrae are diagnostic , with the ribs and pubis being too fragmentary or general to distinguish Dinheirosaurus . This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus , but differences were noticed and in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis . Another specimen , ML 418 , thought to be Dinheirosaurus , is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid . This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods , sauropods , thyreophorans and ornithopods , as well as at least one other diplodocid . 
 Dinheirosaurus is a diplodocid , a relative of Apatosaurus , Diplodocus , Barosaurus , Supersaurus , and Tornieria . Among those , the closest relative to Dinheirosaurus is Supersaurus , and together they form a clade of primitive diplodocids . While they were once considered to be diplodocines they are likely more basal than Apatosaurus . 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 ML 414 was first uncovered in 1987 by Mr. Carlos <unk> . He was associated with the Museu da Lourinhã , and after the excavations which lasted from the time of discovery until 1992 , the specimen was then moved in to the museum , and catalogued under the number 414 . Dantas et al. preliminarily announced ML 414 as soon as the excavations were complete . To remove the fossils from the surrounding rock , a bulldozer and tilt hammer were needed . The fossils were situated at the top of a costal cliff , and once removed , were shipped to Lourinhã in two blocks with the help of a crane . A year before being described as a new taxon , Dantas et al. assigned ML 414 to Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis , previously grouped under Apatosaurus . José Bonaparte and Octávio Mateus studied the material of Lourinhasaurus , concluding one specimen , under the name ML 414 , to be more closely related to diplodocids of the Morrison Formation , and thus warranting a new binomial name . This new species was described as Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis , with a full meaning of " Porto <unk> lizard from Lourinhã " . 
 Dinheirosaurus material included vertebrae , ribs , partial pelvis , and gastroliths . The vertebrae were certainly from the cervical and dorsal regions , and are articulated . The two cervicals are not greatly preserved , although the twelve dorsals are articulated and in good condition . Other vertebral material includes seven centra that are fragmentary and a few neural arches , which are unattached . 12 dorsal ribs are preserved , as well as some appendicular elements . David Weishampel et al. did not recognize all the material as belonging to Dinheirosaurus , and only found 9 dorsals in the holotype , while also misinterpreting the pubis as a limb fragment . They also incorrectly stated that it was found in the <unk> de Alcobaça Formation . Another pair of vertebrae , under collection number ML 418 , was originally assigned to Dinheirosaurus by Bonaparte and Mateus , but is now considered to be a distinct new unnamed genus of diplodocid . 
 = = Description = = 
 Dinheirosaurus is an average sized diplodocid , and had an elongated neck and tail . The main features of the genus are based on its vertebral anatomy , and multiple vertebrae from across the spine have been found . In total , Dinheirosaurus would have had an approximate length of 25 m ( 82 ft ) . 
 Dinheirosaurus is not known well from non @-@ vertebral material , currently only consisting of partial ribs and a fragment of a pelvis . One of the ribs attached to the cervicals , and is quite fragmentary . It is elongated , although that might be a feature of distortion . Also undescribed by Bonaparte & Mateus are a set of <unk> ribs . Two ribs are from the left side of the animal . They are T @-@ shaped in cross section , and display plesiomorphic features , although their incomplete state makes their identification uncertain . Multiple right ribs are preserved , including both the shafts and heads . They are similar to the left ribs , which also show that they lack <unk> . Other appendicular ( non @-@ vertebral ) material includes a very incomplete and fragmentary shaft of the pubis , and over one hundred gastroliths . The pubis displays practically no anatomical features , and the gastroliths were not described in detail by Mannion et al. in 2012 . 
 = = = Vertebrae = = = 
 The most distinguishing material of Dinheirosaurus comes from the vertebrae , which are well represented and described . Of the cervicals , only two of the assumed fifteen are preserved . According to Bonaparte & Mateus ( 1999 ) , the cervicals would number 13 and 14 . Apparently cervical 15 was lost during the excavation and removal of the holotype and only specimen of Dinheirosaurus . As of the original description , the thirteenth cervical was only prepared on the <unk> portion . The length of the centrum is 71 cm ( 28 in ) , and the fourteenth cervical is quite similar overall . 63 cm ( 25 in ) is the total measurement of the 14th cervicals centrum , which is well preserved , complete , and concave along the bottom edge . The neural of the spine , while compressed from above compared to the cervicals of Diplodocus , is massive , and projects upwards towards its posterior end . 
 A relatively complete series of dorsal vertebrae are known , which number one to seven . All of the dorsals , however , are distorted upwards due to their state of preservation . Bonaparte & Mateus ( 1999 ) noted that the position of the dorsals was not certain , and that in fact the first dorsal could have been the last cervical or even the second dorsal . A similar numbering was found in Diplodocus , with the first and second dorsals similar in anatomy to the last and second @-@ last cervical . The dorsal vary in length from the 58 cm ( 23 in ) of the first dorsal to the 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of the seventh , eight and ninth dorsals . Height in the vertebrae is also quite variable , with the shortest height being 51 cm ( 20 in ) tall to 76 cm ( 30 in ) tall , increasing from the first dorsal . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Dinheirosaurus is not extremely well known , and as a consequence , its phylogenetic position is not certain . In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al . , it was recovered , in both cladograms , to be sister species to Supersaurus <unk> and together forming the most basal diplodocines . A 2012 cladogram , published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock ( 2011 ) found that Dinheirosaurus was more primitive than <unk> and more derived than Apatosaurus . However , a cladogram from 2014 found that their group was supported , but in fact more primitive than Apatosaurus , and therefore outside Diplodocinae . In 2015 , Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis was considered a species of Supersaurus in a new combination S. lourinhanensis . Their results are shown below . 
 Previously , Dinheirosaurus was classified within a Diplodocidae excluding Apatosaurus , for the differences anatomically are quite great . Bonaparte & Mateus found that a few features present suggested that Dinheirosaurus was more derived than Diplodocus , but plesiomorphic features also present conclude that they branched separately and Dinheirosaurus is not the descendant of Diplodocus . A 2004 study by Upchurch et al. found that Dinheirosaurus was an intermediate diplodocoid , along with Cetiosauriscus , Amphicoelias , and <unk> . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 As a diplodocid , it is probable that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip @-@ tail . If it did , it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip , with supersonic speed . Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus , Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout . This means that it was probably a non @-@ selective ground @-@ feeding sauropod . 
 = = = Digestion = = = 
 Dinheirosaurus is one of relatively few sauropods for which gastroliths were found obviously alongside the type specimen . In 2007 , an experiment using Dinheirosaurus , Diplodocus ( = Seismosaurus ) , and Cedarosaurus tested if sauropods used their gastroliths in an avian @-@ style gastric mill . The analysis took into account that among the hundreds of sauropods found , gastroliths are only known from a few associated specimens . Authors chose to use the three sauropods with the most associated gastroliths , Dinheirosaurus , Diplodocus , and Cedarosaurus , because of the large amount of gastroliths found in birds . When birds were typically found to have 1 @.@ 05 % of their body weight gastroliths , the sauropod Diplodocus , which had the highest amount of gastroliths , only amassed to 0 @.@ 03 % body weight . This means that since the other sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Cedarosaurus had less gastroliths to body mass , an avian @-@ style gastric mill is unlikely to have evolved in sauropods , and they instead might have used gastroliths to absorb minerals . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 Dinheirosaurus was one of many dinosaurs to have lived in the Lourinhã Formation during the Late Jurassic . Many theropods , sauropods , and especially ornithischians are also from the Lourinhã Formation , which contains a similar fauna to the North American Morrison Formation . Many theropods are known including an unnamed genus of abelisaurid ; the allosaurid Allosaurus europaeus ; the <unk> Ceratosaurus <unk> ; the coelurosaurians Aviatyrannis jurassica , and cf . Richardoestesia ; an intermediate theropod ; and the <unk> Torvosaurus <unk> . Sauropods are less common , with only an intermediate diplodocid as well as Dinheirosaurus ; the <unk> Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis ; the <unk> <unk> atlanticus ; and the brachiosaurid Lusotitan known . Ornithischians are well represented , with identified remains persisting to <unk> cuneatus ; <unk> <unk> ; the stegosaurians Dacentrurus armatus , <unk> <unk> , and Stegosaurus ungulatus ; the ankylosaurid <unk> <unk> ; the ornithopods Draconyx <unk> , Camptosaurus sp . , <unk> <unk> , and cf . Dryosaurus sp . 
 = = = Biogeography = = = 
 Many <unk> , including <unk> have been found in the Late Jurassic of Europe . The sauropods are from around the base of the Tithonian as based on the presence of <unk> <unk> . One sauropod , a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones , is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and <unk> , confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal . This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe , with the only other genera possibly non @-@ diplodocoid ( Cetiosauriscus ) , or classified in Rebbachisauridae . This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods is incomplete , with possible primitive <unk> and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic , potentially until the Berriasian . 
 = On the Art of the Cinema = 
 On the Art of the Cinema ( Korean : <unk> , lit . ' Film Art Theory ' ) is a 1973 treatise by the North Korean leader Kim Jong @-@ il . It is considered the most authoritative work on North Korean filmmaking . 
 The book sets forth several original theories , which can be applied to the practices of filmmaking , the arts , and beyond . Of these the theory of literature as " humanics " and the " seed theory " are the most important ones . Humanics centers on the question of a good and worthy life . In art , it emphasizes truly independent individuals who are capable of transforming society . The seed theory has become essential to North Korean film theory . It seeks to direct all artistic creation through a single ideological foundation , or " seed " . In an individual work , the seed is the synthesis of its subject matter and idea and the basis of its propaganda message . These ideas complement the themes of nationalistic form and socialist content of films . Many ideas presented in the book are justifications for the creation of propaganda supporting the Workers ' Party of Korea 's policies . 
 On the Art of the Cinema had major political implications on Kim Jong @-@ il 's succession of Kim Il @-@ sung . Kim Jong @-@ il gained political and cultural influence in North Korean society and government by authoring the book . 
 The impact of On the Art of the Cinema on North Korean filmmaking is disputed . Films from before and after the publication of the treatise are similar in style and many contemporary films breach various rules laid out in the treatise . 
 = = Background = = 
 After graduating from Kim Il @-@ sung University in 1964 , Kim Jong @-@ il devoted himself to cultural , ideological and propaganda work at the Department of Organization and Guidance of the Central Committee of the party . Although Kim is known to have been privately interested in Hollywood films , he forbade discussion on foreign film concepts at the Aesthetic Review Meeting , an important annual film conference . After he had ordered the entire conference archive to be destroyed , Kim urged participants to be exclusively concerned with the teachings of Kim Il @-@ sung and the party in creative work . Since then , Kim Jong @-@ il 's influence in film and literary administration grew , and he resisted liberal artistic influence from the de @-@ <unk> Soviet Union . From 1968 , Kim began to work on film adaptations of guerilla plays originating from the 1930s . Kim had personally guided the production of films , such as Sea of Blood , ( parts one and two , 1969 ) , The Fate of a Self @-@ Defence Corps Man ( Chosŏn 'gŭl : <unk> <unk> <unk> ; MR : Han <unk> <unk> ŭi <unk> , 1970 ) and The Flower Girl ( 1972 ) . Afterwards , Kim Jong @-@ il began producing revolutionary operas . Kim had worked in the government arts administration for almost ten years by this time . He then wrote a series of essays based on speeches he had given to directors and screenwriters over the preceding five years , and published it as On the Art of the Cinema on April 11 , 1973 . It was his first major work . Through the rest of the 1970s , Kim continued to oversee cultural activities . 
 = = Ideas = = 
 In the treatise , Kim Jong @-@ il seeks to apply the principles of the North Korean Juche ideology to questions of film , literature and art . According to Kim , " revolutionizing " cinema is a means of revolutionizing the whole of art and literature and exposing society to the Workers ' Party 's " monolithic ideology " and Juche . Building upon socialist realist literary theory and Kim Il @-@ sung 's thought , Kim Jong @-@ il constructs what has been described as a " Juche realism " . A key aim of Kim is to employ heroic film fiction to transform man into a socialist man : " Juche @-@ type man " . 
 The book deals comprehensively with aspects of cinema , including film and literary theory , acting , performance , score music , the screen , camerawork , costumes , make @-@ up , and props . Of particular importance are themes of directing and producing as the driving forces of filmmaking . Ideas in the book are elucidated by drawing examples from North Korean films , of which Sea of Blood is the most referred one . On the Art of the Cinema presents two major theories : the theory of literature as " humanics " and the " seed theory " . Both are considered justifications for the party 's control over artistic creation . Other ideas developed by the treatise are the so @-@ called " modeling theory " and " speed campaign " . Compliance with these principles earns an artwork the title of " collective work " . 
 Films should be realistic , which is possible only when the filmmakers have lived with the popular masses , much like the ideal of the revolutionaries of the Korean resistance . However , this " realism " entails unadulterated worship for the leader and Juche , making it incomparable to conventional types of realism in film , like Italian neorealism . Kim builds on the idea that contemporary North Korea has transcended class conflict and no real conflicts exist to be portrayed in cinema , bar historical and external ones . This can be seen as a reassertion of the Stalinist Zhdanov Doctrine . No " negative people " who would disagree with the party 's policies can exist . Depicting conflicts within North Korean society in film could be considered being critical of the regime . When historical themes are depicted , traditions should be portrayed selectively to support present ideological needs , purged of " feudal ideologies " of traditional tales and legends . 
 = = = Literature as humanics = = = 
 The theory of literature as " humanics " ( MR : <unk> ) developed by Kim Jong @-@ il establishes that literature exists within the human domain . A key theme of humanics is the question of good and worthy life , allowing for propagandist and moralistic art . The idea of Chajusŏng ( Korean for " independent spirit " ) is also prominent in the theory of humanics . Chajusŏng is the metaphysical essence of humans struggling against oppression . Philosophically , it depends on the indeterministic view on free will in Juche . The hero of the story , in particular , embodies Chajusŏng . According to Kim , " humanics literature " gives emphasis to the development of truly independent individuals as called for by the Juche era . This brings about a transformation of the society as a whole . In North Korean literature , Chajusŏng is used as a justification of state control on literary creation and a nationalistic policy of socialism in one country . 
 = = = Seed theory = = = 
 The " seed theory " ( Chosŏn 'gŭl : <unk> ; MR : <unk> ) forms the essence of On the Art of the Cinema and , consequently , North Korean film theory in general . It has been called a " strange concept " , a method of coercing artists to follow the party line , and a means of canceling out individual creativity . Kim Jong @-@ il equates a film with a living organism , noting that in this analogy the seed is its kernel . The idea is that , if all artistic interpretation is done through a single ideological foundation , or " seed " , the resulting cinema is whole . This makes all members of a creative teamwork for a single goal , in spite of differences in personalities . The director 's task is to prevent anything foreign to the seed from entering cinema . The seed is the fundamental consciousness underlying artistic creativity . 
 In more concrete terms , the seed is the basis of the propaganda message of the film : " a strong , convincing idea of what to tell " . The seed synthesizes the subject matter and the idea of a work , thus providing both the form and content . In this capacity , it fuses together the Marxist – Leninist literary theory concepts of " material " , " theme " and " thought " . The film should contribute to the ruling ideology and employ aesthetics and storytelling that support the propaganda message . For example , the seed of film The Fate of a Self @-@ Defence Corps Man revolves around the choice facing the main character , Gap <unk> : to perish under oppression or sacrificing one 's self for the revolution . Its seed could be summarized as " whether or not Gap <unk> participates in the revolutionary movement , he dies " . Surplus value , Kim argues , is the seed of Marx 's Capital . 
 The seed theory became influential in the literary circles of North Korea and writers sought to backtrack the seeds in classics preceding Kim 's treatise . In addition to questions of art , the seed theory was adopted to a wider range of industrial and economic activities . 
 = = = Modeling theory and speed campaign = = = 
 According to the " modeling theory " , liberation struggles should be portrayed so as to combine national and class struggle . This is achieved through idolizing portrayal of the North Korean people and by producing role @-@ models . 
 The " speed campaign " ( MR : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) calls for rapid production of films . According to Kim Jong @-@ il , by producing films as fast as possible , the overall revolutionary process is expedited . The origins of the speed campaign are in the shooting of The Fate of a Self @-@ Defence Corps Man in just 40 days when it was anticipated to take a full year . The practice was carried out after publication of On the Art of the Cinema , too . For instance , the eight @-@ part film series Unsung Heroes ( 1979 – 1981 ) was produced by following the speed campaign principle . Each film took just 45 days to produce . Subsequently speed campaigns have been carried out not only in art , but also economic matters . It was thought of as equally important with Kim Il @-@ sung 's <unk> Movement , and remains an influential concept associated with Kim Jong @-@ il 's leadership . 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 While official biographies of Kim Jong @-@ il describe On the Art of the Cinema as comprehensive , original and " supported by impeccable logic " , Whitney Mallett calls it boring and repetitive . Anna <unk> calls On the Art of the Cinema " turgid , whimsical and clunky " . David @-@ West , however , points out that the work shows " some understanding of the constructive elements of the literary text " . 
 The work is considered the most authoritative guide on filmmaking in North Korea . However , the real extent of its influence is doubted . According to Johannes <unk> , the work offers little new to North Korean cinema , and many of the ideas presented are unoriginal and obvious , particularly to the specialist audience of professional filmmakers Kim is writing for . Films from before and after the publication of the treatise are remarkably similar , suggesting that it had little impact on North Korean film industry in practice . Many traits of contemporary North Korean cinema , such as repetitiveness , slow editing style and old theatrical acting , go against the teachings of On the Art of the Cinema . Whatever change there was in North Korean cinema , can be attributed to political and economic pressures . Instead of contributing anything new , the work reformulates Kim Il @-@ sung 's ideas about the importance of film to art and as a propaganda tool . Rather than the theoretical breakthrough it is taught as , it is an account of Kim Jong @-@ il 's personal experiences in the film industry and an attempt to thwart the " sloppiness and thoughtlessness " he had encountered . 
 Kim himself considered his treatise a failure . Films it had contributed to were enjoyed at home , but abroad they were ridiculed . North Korean cinema could not compete with the quality of foreign , and in particular South Korean , films . This directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang @-@ ok , South Korea 's most famous film director , in 1978 . Shin and his wife , actress Choi Eun @-@ hee , were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions . Nevertheless , Shin studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim with the <unk> film <unk> , which credits Kim as the executive producer . Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna , where they were supposed to negotiate a deal for a sequel . The couple used the opportunity to escape , and ended up in America . 
 Politically , the treatise was a success . At the time of writing On the Art of the Cinema , Kim 's father Kim Il @-@ sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession . By authoring the work , Kim Jong @-@ il gained social and political power . He secured his father 's confidence , thus making succession possible . Kim Jong @-@ il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises On the Art of Opera ( 1974 ) , On the Art of the Drama ( 1988 ) , On the Art of Dance ( 1990 ) , On the Art of Music ( 1991 ) , On Fine Art ( 1991 ) , On Architecture ( 1991 ) , On Juche Literature ( 1992 ) , and On <unk> . 
 On the Art of the Cinema is mandatory reading for North Korean students of literature . North Korean filmmakers must also study the work , or even memorize it . On the Art of the Cinema also influenced South Korea 's minjung @-@ oriented People 's Cinema ( MR : minjung <unk> ) movement that was born out of the <unk> Democratization Movement . The work 's influence goes beyond Korea , too . Australian Anna <unk> directed Aim High in Creation ! , a movie about making a propaganda film abiding by Kim 's instructions . Danish <unk> Mads <unk> in his The Red Chapel is shown continuously consulting the treatise for artistic guidance .

 = Boeing 747 = 
 The Boeing 747 is an American wide @-@ body commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft , often referred to by its original nickname , Jumbo Jet , or Queen of the Skies . Its distinctive " hump " upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft makes it among the world 's most recognizable aircraft , and it was the first wide @-@ body produced . Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States , the original version of the 747 had two and a half times greater capacity than the Boeing 707 , one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . First flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . 
 The four @-@ engine 747 uses a double deck configuration for part of its length . It is available in passenger , freighter and other versions . Boeing designed the 747 's hump @-@ like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . Boeing did so because the company expected supersonic airliners ( development of which was announced in the early 1960s ) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete , while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future . The 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , but it exceeded critics ' expectations with production passing the 1 @,@ 000 mark in 1993 . By June 2016 , 1 @,@ 522 aircraft had been built , with 21 of the 747 @-@ 8 variants remaining on order . 
 The 747 @-@ 400 , the most common passenger version in service , has a high @-@ subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0 @.@ 85 – 0 @.@ 855 ( up to 570 mph or 920 km / h ) with an intercontinental range of 7 @,@ 260 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 350 mi or 13 @,@ 450 km ) . The 747 @-@ 400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical three @-@ class layout , 524 passengers in a typical two @-@ class layout , or 660 passengers in a high density one @-@ class configuration . The newest version of the aircraft , the 747 @-@ 8 , is in production and received certification in 2011 . Deliveries of the 747 @-@ 8F freighter version to launch customer Cargolux began in October 2011 ; deliveries of the 747 @-@ <unk> passenger version to Lufthansa began in May 2012 .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 1963 , the United States Air Force started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft . Although the C @-@ 141 <unk> was being introduced , they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed , especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft . These studies led to initial requirements for the CX @-@ Heavy Logistics System ( CX @-@ HLS ) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of 180 @,@ 000 pounds ( 81 @,@ 600 kg ) and a speed of Mach 0 @.@ 75 ( 500 mph or 805 km / h ) , and an unrefueled range of 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 260 km ) with a payload of 115 @,@ 000 pounds ( 52 @,@ 200 kg ) . The payload bay had to be 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 18 m ) wide by 13 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 11 m ) high and 100 feet ( 30 @.@ 5 m ) long with access through doors at the front and rear . 
 Featuring only four engines , the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy . In May 1964 , airframe proposals arrived from Boeing , Douglas , General Dynamics , Lockheed , and Martin Marietta ; engine proposals were submitted by General Electric , Curtiss @-@ Wright , and Pratt & Whitney . After a <unk> , Boeing , Douglas , and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe , along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines . 
 All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features . As the CX @-@ HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front , a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was . All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area ; Douglas had a small " pod " just forward and above the wing , Lockheed used a long " spine " running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it , while Boeing blended the two , with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing . In 1965 Lockheed 's aircraft design and General Electric 's engine design were selected for the new C @-@ 5 Galaxy transport , which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time . The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747 . 
 = = = Airliner proposal = = = 
 The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s . The era of commercial jet transportation , led by the enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC @-@ 8 , had revolutionized long @-@ distance travel . Even before it lost the CX @-@ HLS contract , Boeing was pressed by Juan Trippe , president of Pan American World Airways ( Pan Am ) , one of their most important airline customers , to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707 . During this time , airport congestion , worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft , became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a large new aircraft . 
 In 1965 , Joe Sutter was transferred from Boeing 's 737 development team to manage the design studies for a new airliner , already assigned the model number 747 . Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines , to better understand their requirements . At the time , it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by supersonic transport aircraft . Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined . In the freighter role , the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time . Standard containers are 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) square at the front ( slightly higher due to attachment points ) and available in 20 and 40 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 and 12 m ) lengths . This meant that it would be possible to support a 2 @-@ wide 2 @-@ high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX @-@ HLS project . 
 In April 1966 , Pan Am ordered 25 747 @-@ 100 aircraft for US $ 525 million . During the ceremonial 747 contract @-@ signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing 's 50th Anniversary , Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be " ... a great weapon for peace , competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind 's destiny " . As launch customer , and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order , Pan Am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent unmatched by a single airline before or since . 
 = = = Design effort = = = 
 Ultimately , the high @-@ winged CX @-@ HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747 , although technologies developed for their bid had an influence . The original design included a full @-@ length double @-@ deck fuselage with eight @-@ across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven @-@ across seating and two aisles on the upper deck . However , concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo @-@ carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design . The cockpit was , therefore , placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight @-@ loading door could be included in the nose cone ; this design feature produced the 747 's distinctive " bulge " . In early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit , and this was initially specified as a " lounge " area with no permanent seating . ( A different configuration that had been considered in order to keep the flight deck out of the way for freight loading had the pilots below the passengers , and was dubbed the " anteater " . ) 
 One of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be conceived was the high @-@ bypass turbofan engine . The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel . General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C @-@ 5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later . Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and , by late 1966 , Boeing , Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine , designated the JT9D to power the 747 . 
 The project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis , which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems . To address concerns about safety and <unk> , the 747 's design included structural redundancy , redundant hydraulic systems , quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces . Additionally , some of the most advanced high @-@ lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design , to allow it to operate from existing airports . These included slats running almost the entire length of the wing , as well as complex three @-@ part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing . The wing 's complex three @-@ part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non @-@ deployed configuration . 
 Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969 . The delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft , which was two @-@ thirds of the normal time . The schedule was so fast paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname " The Incredibles " . Developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have " bet the company " when it started the project . 
 = = = Production plant = = = 
 As Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner , they chose to build a new plant . The company considered locations in about 50 cities , and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 miles ( 50 km ) north of Seattle on a site adjoining a military base at Paine Field near Everett , Washington . It bought the 780 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 2 km2 ) site in June 1966 . 
 Developing the 747 had been a major challenge , and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking . Boeing president William M. Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper , then head of the company 's turbine division , to oversee construction of the Everett factory and to start production of the 747 . To level the site , more than four million cubic yards ( three million cubic meters ) of earth had to be moved . Time was so short that the 747 's full @-@ scale mock @-@ up was built before the factory roof above it was finished . The plant is the largest building by volume ever built , and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of Boeing wide @-@ body commercial jets . 
 = = = Development and testing = = = 
 Before the first 747 was fully assembled , testing began on many components and systems . One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock @-@ up via the aircraft 's emergency chutes . The first full @-@ scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , and several volunteers were injured . Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90 @-@ second goal but caused more injuries . Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft 's upper deck ; instead of using a conventional slide , volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel . Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft . Boeing built an unusual training device known as " Waddell 's Wagon " ( named for a 747 test pilot , Jack Waddell ) that consisted of a mock @-@ up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck . While the first 747s were still being built , the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper @-@ deck position . 
 On September 30 , 1968 , the first 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building before the world 's press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airliner . Over the following months , preparations were made for the first flight , which took place on February 9 , 1969 , with test pilots Jack Waddell and Brien <unk> at the controls and Jess Wallick at the flight engineer 's station . Despite a minor problem with one of the flaps , the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well . The 747 was found to be largely immune to " Dutch roll " , a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept @-@ wing jets . 
 During later stages of the flight test program , flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions . This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components . However , a particularly severe high @-@ speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s . This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed , as did China Airlines Flight 358 at Wanli in 1991 and El Al Flight 1862 at Amsterdam in 1992 which had 282 kilograms ( 622 lb ) of uranium in the tailplane . 
 The flight test program was hampered by problems with the 747 's JT9D engines . Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service . The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months , up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation . The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport , site of the company 's Renton factory . On December 13 , 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport 's short runway . The 747 's right , outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged . However , these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid @-@ 1969 , where it was displayed to the public for the first time . The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969 , clearing it for introduction into service . 
 The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate . During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project . Had this been refused , Boeing 's survival would have been threatened . The firm 's debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1 @.@ 2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies . Allen later said , " It was really too large a project for us . " Ultimately , the gamble succeeded , and Boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years .

 On January 15 , 1970 , First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened Pan Am 's first 747 , at Dulles International Airport ( later Washington Dulles International Airport ) in the presence of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby . Instead of champagne , red , white , and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft . The 747 entered service on January 22 , 1970 , on Pan Am 's New York – London route ; the flight had been planned for the evening of January 21 , but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable . Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day . 
 The 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service , overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large . Although technical problems occurred , they were relatively minor and quickly solved . After the aircraft 's introduction with Pan Am , other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service . Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft 's long range rather than its payload capacity . While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined . A moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747 . 
 The recession of 1969 @-@ 1970 greatly affected Boeing . For the year and a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world , and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years . When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic , several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically , and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 and Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies ( and later the 767 and A300 twinjets ) . Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers , American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft ; Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years . Delta later reacquired 747s after it merged with Northwest Airlines . 
 International flights that bypassed traditional hub airports and landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s , and this eroded the 747 's original market . However , many international carriers continued to use the 747 on Pacific routes . In Japan , 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity . 
 = = = Improved 747 versions = = = 
 After the initial 747 @-@ 100 model , Boeing developed the -100B , a higher maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) variant , and the -100SR ( Short Range ) , with higher passenger capacity . Increased maximum takeoff weight allows aircraft to carry more fuel and have longer range . The -200 model followed in 1971 , featuring more powerful engines and a higher MTOW . Passenger , freighter and combination passenger @-@ freighter versions of the -200 were produced . The shortened 747SP ( special performance ) with a longer range was also developed , and entered service in 1976 . 
 The 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747 @-@ 300 in 1980 . The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 , during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected . The first 747 @-@ 300 , completed in 1983 , included a stretched upper deck , increased cruise speed , and increased seating capacity . The -300 variant was previously designated <unk> for stretched upper deck , then 747 @-@ 200 SUD , followed by <unk> , before the 747 @-@ 300 designation was used . Passenger , short range and combination freighter @-@ passenger versions of the 300 series were produced . 
 In 1985 , development of the longer range 747 @-@ 400 began . The variant had a new glass cockpit , which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three , new engines , lighter construction materials , and a redesigned interior . Development cost soared , and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines . Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747 @-@ 400 . The -400 entered service in 1989 . 
 In 1991 , a record @-@ breaking 1 @,@ 087 passengers were airlifted aboard a 747 to Israel as part of Operation Solomon . The 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the Antonov An @-@ 124 Ruslan in 1982 ; variants of the 747 @-@ 400 would surpass the An @-@ 124 's weight in 2000 . The Antonov An @-@ 225 <unk> cargo transport , which debuted in 1988 , remains the world 's largest aircraft by several measures ( including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length ) ; one aircraft has been completed and is in service as of 2012 . The Hughes H @-@ 4 Hercules is the largest aircraft by wingspan , but it only completed a single flight . 
 = = = Further developments = = = 
 Since the arrival of the 747 @-@ 400 , several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed . Boeing announced the larger 747 @-@ 500X and -600X preliminary designs in 1996 . The new variants would have cost more than US $ 5 billion to develop , and interest was not sufficient to launch the program . In 2000 , Boeing offered the more modest 747X and 747X stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus A3XX . However , the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production . A year later , Boeing switched from the 747X studies to pursue the Sonic Cruiser , and after the Sonic Cruiser program was put on hold , the 787 Dreamliner . Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747 @-@ 400ER , a longer range variant of the 747 @-@ 400 . 
 After several variants were proposed but later abandoned , some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from Boeing . However , in early 2004 , Boeing announced tentative plans for the 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted . Similar in nature to the 747 @-@ X , the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems . The 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the Airbus A380 began airline service in 2007 . 
 On November 14 , 2005 , Boeing announced it was launching the 747 Advanced as the Boeing 747 @-@ 8 . The last 747 @-@ 400s were completed in 2009 . As of 2011 , most orders of the 747 @-@ 8 have been for the freighter variant . On February 8 , 2010 , the 747 @-@ 8 Freighter made its maiden flight . The first delivery of the 747 @-@ 8 went to Cargolux in 2011 . The 1,500th produced Boeing 747 was delivered in June 2014 . 
 In January 2016 , Boeing stated it was reducing 747 @-@ 8 production to six a year beginning in September 2016 , incurring a $ 569 million post @-@ tax charge against its fourth @-@ quarter 2015 profits . At the end of 2015 , the company had 20 orders outstanding . On January 29 , 2016 , Boeing announced that it had begun the preliminary work on the modifications to a commercial 747 @-@ 8 for the next Air Force One Presidential aircraft , expected to be operational by 2020 . 
 On 12 July 2016 Boeing announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with Volga @-@ Dnepr Group for 20 747 @-@ 8 freighters , valued at approximately $ 7 @.@ 58 billion at list prices . Four aircraft have already been delivered . Volga @-@ Dnepr Group is the parent of three major Russian air @-@ freight carriers - Volga @-@ Dnepr Airlines , <unk> Airlines and <unk> Airlines - and received its first 747 @-@ 8 freighter in 2012 . The new 747 @-@ 8 freighters will replace <unk> ’ s current 747 @-@ 400 aircraft and expand the airline ’ s fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years , Boeing said . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Boeing 747 is a large , wide @-@ body ( two @-@ aisle ) airliner with four wing @-@ mounted engines . The wings have a high sweep angle of 37 @.@ 5 degrees for a fast , efficient cruise of Mach 0 @.@ 84 to 0 @.@ 88 , depending on the variant . The sweep also reduces the wingspan , allowing the 747 to use existing hangars . Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3 – 4 – 3 seat arrangement ( a cross section of 3 seats , an aisle , 4 seats , another aisle , and 3 seats ) in economy class and a 2 – 3 – 2 arrangement in first class on the main deck . The upper deck has a 3 – 3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2 – 2 arrangement in first class . 
 Raised above the main deck , the cockpit creates a hump . The raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants . The upper deck behind the cockpit provides space for a lounge or extra seating . The " stretched upper deck " became available as an option on the 747 @-@ 100B variant and later as standard on the 747 @-@ 300 . The 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit in the event of an emergency if they cannot exit through the cabin . 
 The 747 's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735 @,@ 000 pounds ( 333 @,@ 400 kg ) for the -100 to 970 @,@ 000 lb ( 439 @,@ 985 kg ) for the -8 . Its range has increased from 5 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 100 mi , 9 @,@ 800 km ) on the -100 to 8 @,@ 000 nmi ( 9 @,@ 200 mi , 14 @,@ 815 km ) on the -8I . 
 The 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each , which provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow @-@ outs . The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly . In addition , the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple @-@ slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard @-@ length runways . For transportation of spare engines , 747s can accommodate a non @-@ functioning fifth @-@ pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage . 
 = = Variants = = 
 The 747 @-@ 100 was the original variant launched in 1966 . The 747 @-@ 200 soon followed , with its launch in 1968 . The 747 @-@ 300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747 @-@ 400 in 1985 . Ultimately , the 747 @-@ 8 was announced in 2005 . Several versions of each variant have been produced , and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously . The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator ( e.g. " <unk> " for all -100 models ) . 
 = = = 747 @-@ 100 = = = 
 The first 747 @-@ 100s were built with six upper deck windows ( three per side ) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas . Later , as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space , Boeing offered a ten @-@ window upper deck as an option . Some early <unk> were retrofitted with the new configuration . The -100 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 3A engines . No freighter version of this model was developed , but many 747 @-@ 100s were converted into freighters . A total of 167 747 @-@ 100s were built . 
 = = = = 747SR = = = = 
 Responding to requests from Japanese airlines for a high @-@ capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities , Boeing developed the 747SR as a short @-@ range version of the 747 @-@ 100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability . With increased economy class seating , up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models . The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52 @,@ 000 flights during 20 years of operation , compared to 24 @,@ 600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747 . The initial 747SR model , the -100SR , had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings . Extra structural support was built into the wings , fuselage , and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity . 
 The initial order for the -100SR — four aircraft for Japan Air Lines ( JAL , later Japan Airlines ) — was announced on October 30 , 1972 ; rollout occurred on August 3 , 1973 , and the first flight took place on August 31 , 1973 . The type was certified by the FAA on September 26 , 1973 , with the first delivery on the same day . The -100SR entered service with JAL , the type 's sole customer , on October 7 , 1973 , and typically operated flights within Japan . Seven <unk> were built between 1973 and 1975 , each with a 520 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 240 @,@ 000 kg ) MTOW and Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 7A engines derated to 43 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 190 @,@ 000 N ) of thrust . 
 Following the -100SR , Boeing produced the -100BSR , a 747SR variant with increased takeoff weight capability . Debuting in 1978 , the -100BSR also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycle @-@ to @-@ flying hour ratio ; a related standard -100B model debuted in 1979 . The -100BSR first flew on November 3 , 1978 , with first delivery to All Nippon Airways ( ANA ) on December 21 , 1978 . A total of twenty <unk> were produced for ANA and JAL . The -100BSR had a 600 @,@ 000 lb MTOW and was powered by the same JT9D @-@ 7A or General Electric CF6 @-@ 45 engines used on the -100SR . ANA operated this variant on domestic Japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in March 2006 . 
 In 1986 , two -100BSR SUD models , featuring the stretched upper deck ( SUD ) of the -300 , were produced for JAL . The type 's maiden flight occurred on February 26 , 1986 , with FAA certification and first delivery on March 24 , 1986 . JAL operated the -100BSR SUD with 563 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006 . While only two -100BSR <unk> were produced , in theory , standard <unk> can be modified to the SUD certification . Overall , twenty @-@ nine <unk> were built , consisting of seven <unk> , twenty <unk> , and two -100BSR <unk> . 
 = = = = 747 @-@ 100B = = = = 
 The 747 @-@ 100B model was developed from the -100SR , using its stronger airframe and landing gear design . The type had an increased fuel capacity of 48 @,@ 070 US gal ( 182 @,@ 000 l ; 40 @,@ 030 imp gal ) , allowing for a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) range with a typical 452 @-@ passenger payload , and an increased MTOW of 750 @,@ 000 lb ( 340 @,@ 000 kg ) was offered . The first -100B order , one aircraft for Iran Air , was announced on June 1 , 1978 . This aircraft first flew on June 20 , 1979 , received FAA certification on August 1 , 1979 , and was delivered the next day . Nine <unk> were built , one for Iran Air and eight for Saudi Arabian Airlines . Unlike the original -100 , the -100B was offered with Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 7A , General Electric CF6 @-@ 50 , or Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ 524 engines . However , only RB211 @-@ 524 ( Saudia ) and JT9D @-@ 7A ( Iran Air ) engines were ordered . The last 747 @-@ 100B , EP @-@ IAM was retired by Iran Air in 2014 , the last commercial operator of the 747 @-@ 100 and -100B . 
 = = = 747SP = = = 
 The development of the 747SP stemmed from a joint request between Pan American World Airways and Iran Air , who were looking for a high @-@ capacity airliner with enough range to cover Pan Am 's New York – Middle Eastern routes and Iran Air 's planned Tehran – New York route . The Tehran – New York route , when launched , was the longest non @-@ stop commercial flight in the world . The 747SP is 48 feet 4 inches ( 14 @.@ 73 m ) shorter than the 747 @-@ 100 . Fuselage sections were eliminated fore and aft of the wing , and the center section of the fuselage was redesigned to fit mating fuselage sections . The SP 's flaps used a simplified single @-@ slotted configuration . The 747SP , compared to earlier variants , had a tapering of the aft upper fuselage into the empennage , a double @-@ hinged rudder , and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers . Power was provided by Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 7 ( A / F / J / FW ) or Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ 524 engines . 
 The 747SP was granted a supplemental certificate on February 4 , 1976 and entered service with launch customers Pan Am and Iran Air that same year . The aircraft was chosen by airlines wishing to serve major airports with short runways . A total of 45 <unk> were built , with the 44th 747SP delivered on August 30 , 1982 . In 1987 , Boeing re @-@ opened the 747SP production line after five years to build one last 747SP for an order by the United Arab Emirates government . In addition to airline use , one 747SP was modified for the NASA / German Aerospace Center SOFIA experiment . Iran Air is the last civil operator of the type ; its final 747 @-@ SP ( EP @-@ IAC ) is to be retired in June 2016 . 
 = = = 747 @-@ 200 = = = 
 While the 747 @-@ 100 powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations , it was marginal for long international route sectors . The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved -200 , which featured more powerful engines , increased MTOW , and greater range than the -100 . A few early <unk> retained the three @-@ window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck , but most were built with a ten @-@ window configuration on each side . The 747 @-@ 200 was produced in passenger ( <unk> ) , freighter ( <unk> ) , convertible ( -200C ) , and combi ( -200M ) versions . 
 The 747 @-@ 200B was the basic passenger version , with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines ; it entered service in February 1971 . In its first three years of production , the -200 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 7 engines ( initially the only engine available ) . Range with a full passenger load started at over 5 @,@ 000 nmi ( 9 @,@ 300 km ) and increased to 6 @,@ 000 nmi ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) with later engines . Most <unk> had an internally stretched upper deck , allowing for up to 16 passenger seats . The freighter model , the 747 @-@ 200F , could be fitted with or without a side cargo door , and had a capacity of 105 tons ( 95 @.@ 3 tonnes ) and an MTOW of up to 833 @,@ 000 lb ( 378 @,@ 000 kg ) . It entered service in 1972 with Lufthansa . The convertible version , the 747 @-@ <unk> , could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations , and featured removable seats and a nose cargo door . The -200C could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck . 
 The combi model , the 747 @-@ 200M , could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door . A removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front . The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three @-@ class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck . The model was also known as the 747 @-@ 200 Combi . As on the -100 , a stretched upper deck ( SUD ) modification was later offered . A total of 10 converted 747 @-@ 200s were operated by KLM . Union des Transports <unk> ( UTA ) also had two of these aircraft converted . 
 After launching the -200 with Pratt & Whitney JT9D @-@ 7 engines , on August 1 , 1972 Boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6 @-@ 50 series engines to increase the aircraft 's market potential . Rolls @-@ Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from British Airways for four aircraft . The option of RB211 @-@ <unk> engines was announced on June 17 , 1975 . The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers . 
 A total of 393 of the 747 @-@ 200 versions had been built when production ended in 1991 . Of these , 225 were <unk> , 73 were <unk> , 13 were -200C , 78 were -200M , and 4 were military . Many 747 @-@ 200s remain in operation , although most large carriers have retired them from their fleets and sold them to smaller operators . Large carriers have sped up fleet retirement following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent drop in demand for air travel , scrapping some or turning others into freighters . 
 = = = 747 @-@ 300 = = = 
 The 747 @-@ 300 features a 23 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch @-@ longer ( 7 @.@ 11 m ) upper deck than the -200 . The stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the -300 and previous models . Before being made standard on the 747 @-@ 300 , the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retrofit , and appeared on two Japanese 747 @-@ 100SR aircraft . The 747 @-@ 300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck , instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants , which creates room above and below for more seats . Minor aerodynamic changes allowed the -300 's cruise speed to reach Mach 0 @.@ 85 compared with Mach 0 @.@ 84 on the -200 and -100 models , while retaining the same takeoff weight . The -300 could be equipped with the same Pratt & Whitney and Rolls @-@ Royce powerplants as on the -200 , as well as updated General Electric CF6 @-@ <unk> engines . 
 Swissair placed the first order for the 747 @-@ 300 on June 11 , 1980 . The variant revived the 747 @-@ 300 designation , which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production . The 747 @-@ 300 first flew on October 5 , 1982 , and the type 's first delivery went to Swissair on March 23 , 1983 . Besides the passenger model , two other versions ( <unk> , <unk> ) were produced . The 747 @-@ 300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck , similar to the -200M , but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers . The 747 @-@ <unk> , a short range , high @-@ capacity domestic model , was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584 . No production freighter version of the 747 @-@ 300 was built , but Boeing began modifications of used passenger -300 models into freighters in 2000 . 
 A total of 81 747 @-@ 300 series aircraft were delivered , 56 for passenger use , 21 <unk> and 4 <unk> versions . In 1985 , just two years after the -300 entered service , the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747 @-@ 400 . The last 747 @-@ 300 was delivered in September 1990 to Sabena . While some -300 customers continued operating the type , several large carriers replaced their 747 @-@ 300s with 747 @-@ 400s . Air France , Air India , Pakistan International Airlines , and Qantas were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747 @-@ 300 . On December 29 , 2008 , Qantas flew its last scheduled 747 @-@ 300 service , operating from Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland . In July 2015 , Pakistan International Airlines retired their final 747 @-@ 300 after 30 years of service .

 The 747 @-@ 400 is an improved model with increased range . It has wingtip extensions of 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) and winglets of 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , which improve the type 's fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions . The 747 @-@ 400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three , with a reduction in the number of dials , gauges and knobs from 971 to 365 through the use of electronics . The type also features tail fuel tanks , revised engines , and a new interior . The longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops , such as Anchorage . <unk> include the Pratt & Whitney <unk> , General Electric CF6 @-@ 80C2 , and Rolls @-@ Royce RB211 @-@ 524 . 
 The -400 was offered in passenger ( -400 ) , freighter ( <unk> ) , combi ( <unk> ) , domestic ( <unk> ) , extended range passenger ( <unk> ) , and extended range freighter ( <unk> ) versions . Passenger versions retain the same upper deck as the -300 , while the freighter version does not have an extended upper deck . The 747 @-@ <unk> was built for short @-@ range operations with maximum seating for 624 . <unk> were not included , but they can be retrofitted . Cruising speed is up to Mach 0 @.@ 855 on different versions of the 747 @-@ 400 . 
 The passenger version first entered service in February 1989 with launch customer Northwest Airlines on the Minneapolis to Phoenix route . The combi version entered service in September 1989 with KLM , while the freighter version entered service in November 1993 with Cargolux . The 747 @-@ <unk> entered service with Air France in October 2002 , while the 747 @-@ 400ER entered service with Qantas , its sole customer , in November 2002 . In January 2004 , Boeing and Cathay Pacific launched the Boeing 747 @-@ 400 Special Freighter program , later referred to as the Boeing Converted Freighter ( BCF ) , to modify passenger 747 @-@ 400s for cargo use . The first 747 @-@ <unk> was <unk> in December 2005 . 
 In March 2007 , Boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the -400 . However , orders for 36 <unk> and <unk> freighters were already in place at the time of the announcement . The last passenger version of the 747 @-@ 400 was delivered in April 2005 to China Airlines . Some of the last built 747 @-@ 400s were delivered with Dreamliner livery along with the modern Signature interior from the Boeing 777 . A total of 694 of the 747 @-@ 400 series aircraft were delivered . At various times , the largest 747 @-@ 400 operator has included Singapore Airlines , Japan Airlines , and British Airways with 57 as of June 2013 .

 The 747 @-@ 400 <unk> ( originally called the 747 Large Cargo Freighter or LCF ) is a Boeing @-@ designed modification of existing 747 @-@ 400s to a larger configuration to ferry 787 Dreamliner sub @-@ assemblies . Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation of Taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747 @-@ 400s into <unk> in Taoyuan . The aircraft flew for the first time on September 9 , 2006 in a test flight . Modification of four aircraft was completed by February 2010 . The <unk> have been placed into service transporting sub @-@ assemblies for the 787 program to the Boeing plant in Everett , Washington , for final assembly . The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers . 
 = = = 747 @-@ 8 = = = 
 Boeing announced a new 747 variant , the 747 @-@ 8 , on November 14 , 2005 . Referred to as the 747 Advanced prior to its launch , the 747 @-@ 8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 787 , hence the use of the " 8 " . The variant is designed to be quieter , more economical , and more environmentally friendly . The 747 @-@ 8 's fuselage is lengthened from 232 to 251 feet ( 70 @.@ 8 to 76 @.@ 4 m ) , marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft . Power is supplied by General Electric <unk> @-@ <unk> engines . 
 The 747 @-@ 8 Freighter , or 747 @-@ 8F , is derived from the 747 @-@ <unk> . The variant has 16 percent more payload capacity than its predecessor , allowing it to carry seven additional standard air cargo containers , with a maximum payload capacity of 154 tons ( 140 tonnes ) of cargo . As on previous 747 freighters , the 747 @-@ 8F features an overhead nose @-@ door and a side @-@ door on the main deck plus a side @-@ door on the lower deck ( " belly " ) to aid loading and unloading . The 747 @-@ 8F made its maiden flight on February 8 , 2010 . The variant received its amended type certificate jointly from the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) on August 19 , 2011 . The <unk> was first delivered to Cargolux on October 12 , 2011 . 
 The passenger version , named 747 @-@ 8 Intercontinental or 747 @-@ <unk> , is designed to carry up to 467 passengers in a 3 @-@ class configuration and fly more than 8 @,@ 000 nmi ( 15 @,@ 000 km ) at Mach 0 @.@ 855 . As a derivative of the already common 747 @-@ 400 , the 747 @-@ 8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchangeable parts . The type 's first test flight occurred on March 20 , 2011 . At its introduction , the 747 @-@ 8 surpassed the Airbus A340 @-@ 600 as the world 's longest airliner . The first -8I was delivered in May 2012 to Lufthansa . The 747 @-@ 8 has received 125 total orders , including 74 for the <unk> and 51 for the -8I , as of June 2016 .

 Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage .

 During the late 1960s and early 1970s , Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines , to compete with the smaller L @-@ 1011 TriStar and DC @-@ 10 . The 747 trijet would have had more payload , range , and passenger capacity than the L @-@ 1011 and DC @-@ 10 . The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S @-@ duct intake similar to the L @-@ 1011 's . However , engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary . Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining . Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four @-@ engine 747 , resulting in the 747SP . 
 = = = = 747 ASB = = = = 
 Boeing announced the 747 ASB ( Advanced Short Body ) in 1986 as a response to the Airbus A340 and the McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 11 . This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747 @-@ 400 with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage . The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of 8 @,@ 000 nmi ( 9 @,@ 200 mi ; 15 @,@ 000 km ) . However , airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 777 . 
 = = = = 747 @-@ 500X , -600X , and <unk> = = = = 
 Boeing announced the 747 @-@ 500X and -600X at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow . The proposed models would have combined the 747 's fuselage with a new 251 ft ( 77 m ) span wing derived from the 777 . Other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear . 
 The 747 @-@ 500X concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) to 250 ft ( 76 @.@ 2 m ) long , and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 000 mi , 16 @,@ 100 km ) , with a gross weight of over 1 @.@ 0 <unk> ( 450 tonnes ) . The 747 @-@ <unk> concept featured a greater stretch to 279 ft ( 85 m ) with seating for 548 passengers , a range of up to 7 @,@ 700 nmi ( 8 @,@ 900 mi , 14 @,@ 300 km ) , and a gross weight of 1 @.@ 2 <unk> ( 540 tonnes ) . A third study concept , the 747 @-@ <unk> , would have combined the wing of the 747 @-@ <unk> with a widened fuselage , allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747 @-@ 400 . The cost of the changes from previous 747 models , in particular the new wing for the 747 @-@ 500X and -600X , was estimated to be more than US $ 5 billion . Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft . 
 = = = = 747X and 747X Stretch = = = = 
 As Airbus progressed with its A3XX study , Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000 ; a more modest proposal than the previous <unk> and -600X that retained the 747 's overall wing design and add a segment at the root , increasing the span to 229 ft ( 69 @.@ 8 m ) . Power would have been supplied by either the Engine Alliance <unk> or the Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 600 , which were also proposed for the 767 @-@ 400ERX . A new flight deck based on the 777 's would be used . The 747X aircraft was to carry 430 passengers over ranges of up to 8 @,@ 700 nmi ( 10 @,@ 000 mi , 16 @,@ 100 km ) . The 747X Stretch would be extended to 263 ft ( 80 @.@ 2 m ) long , allowing it to carry 500 passengers over ranges of up to 7 @,@ 800 nmi ( 9 @,@ 000 mi , 14 @,@ 500 km ) . Both would feature an interior based on the 777 . Freighter versions of the 747X and 747X Stretch were also studied . 
 Like its predecessor , the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production , and it was shelved along with the 767 @-@ 400ERX in March 2001 , when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept . Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747 @-@ 500X and -600X , it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747 @-@ 400 . The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board , but the 747 @-@ <unk> being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747 @-@ 400ER .

 After the end of the 747X program , Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 . The 747 @-@ 400XQLR ( Quiet Long Range ) was meant to have an increased range of 7 @,@ 980 nmi ( 9 @,@ 200 mi , 14 @,@ 800 km ) , with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise . Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767 @-@ 400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction . Although the 747 @-@ 400XQLR did not move to production , many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced , which has now been launched as the 747 @-@ 8 .

 Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747 . The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure , while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair . United Airlines Flight 811 , which suffered an explosive decompression mid @-@ flight on February 24 , 1989 , led the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) to issue a recommendation that 747 @-@ 200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified .

 Accidents due to design deficiencies included TWA Flight 800 , where a 747 @-@ 100 exploded in mid @-@ air on July 17 , 1996 , probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank ; this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an <unk> system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008 , after years of research into solutions . At the time , the new safety system was expected to cost US $ 100 @,@ 000 to $ 450 @,@ 000 per aircraft and weigh approximately 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) .

 = Trapped in the Closet ( South Park ) = 
 " Trapped in the Closet " is the twelfth episode in the ninth season of the animated series South Park . The 137th episode of the series overall , it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16 , 2005 . In the episode , Stan joins Scientology in an attempt to find something " fun and free " . After the discovery of his surprisingly high " thetan levels " , he is recognized as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of the church . The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . The title is a reference to the R. Kelly serialized song of the same name and a satirized version of R. Kelly appears in the episode . 
 " Trapped in the Closet " generated significant controversy . Tom Cruise , who is portrayed in the episode , reportedly threatened to back out of his promotional obligations for the Paramount Pictures film Mission : Impossible III if Viacom , the owner of both Comedy Central and Paramount , allowed a repeat of the episode to air . A publicist of Cruise denied this , saying " Tom had nothing to do with this matter . He 's been promoting ' Mission : Impossible III ' for the last six months . We have no clue where this came from . " Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast on March 15 , 2006 , the episode " Chef 's Chocolate Salty Balls " was shown instead . Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes , but South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone thought otherwise ; they issued a satirical statement saying they ( Parker and Stone ) were " servants of the dark lord Xenu " . Hayes , the voice of staple character Chef , asked to be released from his contract shortly before the start of the tenth season . The reason for his departure , as reported by Stone , was due to his membership in Scientology and this episode , which Hayes — despite initially supporting the show 's satirical take on several talk shows — claimed was very offensive . The episode has since been rebroadcast on Comedy Central multiple times . 
 " Trapped in the Closet " was nominated for an Emmy Award in July 2006 , in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming Less Than One Hour ) category . The episode was featured among Comedy Central 's list of " 10 South Parks That Changed The World " , spoofed by Conan O 'Brien in the opening segment of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards , and mentioned in the Scientology critique film The Bridge . TV Guide ranked the episode # 17 on its list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Saving for a bicycle and not wanting to spend money on entertainment , Stan takes a free " personality test " being offered by Scientologists on the street . After answering a long questionnaire , Stan is informed that he is extremely depressed and therefore a perfect candidate for Scientology . They offer to help him out for $ 240 . Back home , Stan asks his parents for the money . His father suggests that he use the money he had been saving . Stan pays and is taken into an auditing room where an attendant reads his " thetan levels " using an " E @-@ meter " . Stan has such a high reading that the Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles is notified . There , the president of Scientology determines that , because his reading is so high , Stan must be a reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard , Scientology 's founder and prophet . 
 Later that night , a large group of Scientologists , including John Travolta , gather outside the Marsh house to celebrate Hubbard 's " second coming " . The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan 's parents . They are opposed to Stan 's participation , but the president informs them that " we 're not asking him to join us ; we 're asking him to lead us " . Randy sends Stan to his room , where he finds Tom Cruise waiting . Cruise , believing that Stan is genuinely Hubbard 's reincarnation , asks him whether he has enjoyed his acting . When " Hubbard " replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others ' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy , Tom hears that he is " a failure in the eyes of the prophet " and locks himself in Stan 's closet . He refuses to come out , despite the entreaties of Randy , Nicole Kidman , the police , Travolta and R. Kelly to " come out of the closet " . Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet . 
 Downstairs , the church president tries to convince Stan 's parents to allow their son to participate . He tells to Stan the great secret behind the church — a condensed version of the story of Xenu , based directly on the Scientology Operating Thetan III document , and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading " This is what Scientologists actually believe " . He then begs Stan to continue writing where " L. Ron " left off . Stan , impressed by the story , does so . He shows his writings to the Scientology president , who initially approves of the work , but when Stan says " to really be a church , you can 't charge money to help " , the president reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a global money @-@ making scam . He asks that Stan continue with that in mind . Stan appears to agree and keeps writing . 
 Outside the house , the president introduces Stan to his followers , to whom he will read parts of his new doctrine . However , instead of presenting it to them , Stan states that he is not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard , and that " Scientology is just a big fat global scam " . The Scientologists grow angry and threaten to sue him . The celebrities in the closet appear , threatening to sue Stan as well . The last shot is Stan daring them to do so . However , that shot is followed immediately by the closing credits naming only " John Smith " and " Jane Smith " , a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology 's reputation for litigiousness .

 South Park had previously parodied Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards . The MTV short was entitled " The Gauntlet " and included " John Travolta and the Church of Scientology " arriving in a spaceship to defeat Russell Crowe ( as a gladiator ) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology . Travolta , along with his fellow Scientologists , was depicted as a Psychlo , as he appeared in the film Battlefield Earth . They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode , entitled " Super Best Friends " , in which David Blaine formed his own cult , called " <unk> " . Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology . 
 Parker stated that Isaac Hayes ' membership had previously kept the show 's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology . However , the decision to ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show 's creators have with Penn Jillette . Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of Bullshit ! based on Scientology , but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology . Parker commented , " We 're going , That 's fucked up . And hearing other people say , ' You can 't do that ' – you can only say ' You can 't do that ' so many times to Matt and me before we 're gonna do it . Finally , we just had to tell Isaac , ' Dude , we totally love working with you , and this is nothing personal , it 's just we 're South Park , and if we don 't do this , we 're belittling everything else we 've ripped on . ' " 
 Although some questions were raised prior to the episode 's screening about whether it was wise to take swipes at Cruise and Scientology , Comedy Central declared that it supported Stone and Parker . A Comedy Central spokesman told Radar magazine in November 2005 that " they are free , and have been , to satirize anybody and anything they want to . They 've made fun of MTV , they 've made fun of Viacom , they 've made fun of Comedy Central , and we 've never interfered with them . " 
 During production on the episode , investigative journalist Mark Ebner served as a consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker . Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood , Interrupted , which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood , and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta 's relationship to Scientology . On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode , it is asserted that the section of " Trapped in the Closet " that explains Scientology 's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated : " Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest . Seriously . " The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name , and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it .

 On March 13 , 2006 , Hayes announced that he was quitting the show because of the series ' treatment of religion saying , " There is a place in this world for satire , but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins . Religious beliefs are sacred to people , and at all times should be respected and honored . As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years , I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices . " The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement . Later in an interview on CNN 's Showbiz Tonight , Hayes added he did not see the episode itself , but was told about it . In a separate interview , he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone , " Guys , you have it all wrong . We 're not like that . I know that 's your thing , but get your information correct , because somebody might believe that shit , you know ? But I understand what they 're doing . I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses , and understand what we do . [ Laughs ] . " 
 Responding to Hayes ' departure , Stone asserted that " This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology ... He has no problem — and he 's cashed plenty of checks — with our show making fun of Christians . " According to Stone , neither he nor Trey Parker had " heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology . He wants a different standard for religions other than his own , and to me , that is where intolerance and bigotry begin . " Stone commented that " In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park , Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians , Muslims , Mormons and Jews . He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show . To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur . Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well . " According to a later commentary by Stone , prior to the episode 's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD , which they refused . 
 There were many conflicting stories as to the exact nature of Hayes ' departure . Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include " They didn 't pay me enough " , and " They weren 't that nice " . In late 2007 , reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay , because of a stroke he suffered in January . According to a Fox News article , Hayes ' agent Christina Kimball , herself a practicing Scientologist , was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park . Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone , commenting that " There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him , and I believe it ... It was a brutal , up @-@ close , personal thing with Isaac . If you look at the timeline , something doesn 't add up . " Due to the absence of Hayes , Chef was voiced in " The Return of Chef " using pre @-@ recorded snippets of dialog from previous episodes . The character was written out of the series by being struck by lightning , burned , impaled , shot , and mauled at the end of the episode .

 The creators used the ambiguity of " coming out of the closet " , having Tom Cruise literally refusing to come out of Stan 's closet , in a parody of rumors involving Cruise 's sexuality . Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality , and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park . Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was " cruisin ' for a <unk> ' " and wondered " how that sort of Cruise @-@ bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone 's new bosses : Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three @-@ year deal . Other people with Paramount deals ? Oh , just , you know , Tom Cruise . Should be one hell of a studio Christmas party " . 
 Concerns over possible litigation were raised in other countries where South Park is syndicated . The episode 's planned screening on the UK 's Paramount Comedy 1 channel was canceled for fear that Cruise would sue . In Australia , SBS TV screened the episode in late February , a spokesman telling Australian The Daily Telegraph that " We haven 't received any legal threats so we 're going to publish and be damned .

 This episode was scheduled to rebroadcast on March 15 , 2006 on Comedy Central , but the broadcast was canceled without prior notice , and was replaced with " Chef 's Chocolate Salty Balls " . Representatives of Comedy Central insist that the episode was changed as a tribute to Isaac Hayes following his departure from the show two days earlier . The following day , the <unk> blog alleged that Comedy Central parent Viacom canceled the rebroadcast due to threats of Cruise to boycott the publicity tour of his upcoming film Mission : Impossible III . These assertions were soon also reported by E ! News and American Morning . Fox News attributed threats from Tom Cruise , stating , " to back out of his Mission : Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn 't pull a repeat of the episode " , as evidence of " bad blood " between Cruise and Viacom ( which also owns Paramount Pictures , the distributor of MI : III ) . CNN 's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer also cited " industry sources " who believed the episode was pulled " because the network and Tom Cruise 's current movie studio are both owned by the same corporation . " The New York Post noted that Cruise had " a history of playing hardball " , alleging that he had been responsible for having a sex scene featuring his then @-@ fiancée Katie Holmes removed from the film Thank You for Smoking prior to its release . 
 The Washington Post reported that South Park fans " struck back " , in March 2006 , and threatened to boycott Mission : Impossible III until Comedy Central put " Trapped in the Closet " back on its schedule . Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the Mission : Impossible III box office debut . The South Park creators did not comment directly on Comedy Central 's decision to pull the episode , reportedly because they had been told not to discuss the matter to avoid embarrassing Cruise . Instead , they issued a statement to Variety on March 17 , 2006 , signing the statement , " Trey Parker and Matt Stone , servants of the dark lord Xenu " . 
 The Los Angeles Times dubbed the controversy surrounding the episode 's rebroadcast " Closetgate " . The Independent later cited the Los Angeles Times , noting that the controversy generated positive publicity for the show 's creators : " For Stone and Parker , Closetgate will be the gift that keeps on giving . " " Closetgate " has since been used to refer to the " brouhaha " surrounding Isaac Hayes ' departure and rebroadcasts of the episode , by other sources including Yahoo ! Movies , BBC , Turner Classic Movies , the Herald @-@ Sun , Thoralf <unk> of the University of Tromsø , and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times . 
 Cruise 's representative responded to the controversy shortly after it broke , telling the Associated Press that the allegations of Cruise 's involvement were " not true " and that " he never said that " . According to The Washington Post , Cruise 's publicist asserted that " Tom had nothing to do with this matter . He 's been promoting ' Mission : Impossible III ' for the last six months . We have no clue where this came from . " Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC 's Primetime in mid @-@ April . When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central , Cruise stated , " First of all , could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone ? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs . Here 's the thing : I 'm really not even going to dignify this . I honestly didn 't really even know about it . I 'm working , making my movie , I 've got my family . I 'm busy . I don 't spend my days going , ' What are people saying about me ? ' " A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue , specifically responding to allegations of Cruise 's reputed corporate power play . 
 In April 2006 , TelevisionWeek reported that fans had posted the episode in multiple locations on the internet . At that time , the episode had been viewed over 700 @,@ 000 times on YouTube , and an online petition to re @-@ air the episode had garnered 5 @,@ 000 signatures . TelevisionWeek noted that Comedy Central " looked the other way at the online proliferation " of " Trapped in the Closet " . A spokesman for MTV Networks , owner of Comedy Central , confirmed they had not asked YouTube to pull the episode from their site . The Situation Room also noted that clips from the episode were still available on Comedy Central 's web site . In May 2006 , " Trapped in the Closet " was shown in London , at the National Film Theatre . The free screening was followed by a discussion with Parker and Stone , who said the screening was a " display of free speech " . Free copies of the episode were given out to attendees after the screening . 
 On July 19 , 2006 , Comedy Central did air a rebroadcast of the episode at 10 : 00 Pacific Time and did so again on July 23 at 11 : 00pm Eastern Time and on September 24 at 10 : 00 PM Eastern time . Matt Stone stated " If they hadn 't put this episode back on the air , we 'd have had serious issues , and we wouldn 't be doing anything else with them . " After the episode was scheduled to be rebroadcast , Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN 's Showbiz Tonight , where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode . Parker was quoted : " But it 's really like a publicist couldn 't have orchestrated this any better for us . You know what I mean ? It 's like it 's been phenomenal . Tom Cruise has done more for South Park than anyone I think in the world . " 
 The episode was released in several DVDs , including South Park the Hits : Volume 1 and South Park : The Complete Ninth Season , in contradiction with an alleged request by either the Church of Scientology or Cruise to never put the episode on DVD format . The full episode is also available for viewing on the web site of South Park Digital Studios , along with Parker and Stone 's ' mini @-@ commentary ' on it . 
 A few references have been made by the show and Comedy Central to Scientology as an aftermath of the controversy . On August 1 , 2006 , Comedy Central placed an advertisement in Variety showing the South Park stars against a background of L. Ron Hubbard 's Scientology Celebrity Center , with the headline , " C 'mon Jews , show them who really runs Hollywood . " Although often misunderstood by the public to parody the Mel Gibson DUI incident , the advertisement actually congratulates South Park on gaining an Emmy nomination for " Trapped in the Closet " and satirizes the cancellation of the episode 's rebroadcast in March . 
 The Rolling Stone cover article Still Sick , Still Wrong , celebrating the show 's anniversary , also referred to the controversy . The article depicted Stone and Parker spray painting graffiti on the church 's Los Angeles organization sign , adding " Is dum " to the Scientology logo and a " Hi Tom " message with an accompanying depiction of Cartman 's head .

 In a review of South Park : The Complete Ninth Season , The Denver Post stated the jokes about Tom Cruise " work splendidly and reveal their depth on repeated viewings , much like the show in general . " IGN stated that " Perhaps the largest weakness of this season is that the most notorious episodes Best Friends Forever and Trapped in the Closet just don 't carry the eye @-@ popping impact that they did when they were ripped from the headlines " , giving the DVD a rating of 7 @.@ 0 . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Matt Stone and Trey Parker " probably hit their zenith when they made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology " . An article in The Times wrote that South Park " infamously satirized " texts by L. Ron Hubbard " available only to Operating Thetans " . TV Guide ranked the episode # 17 on its 2009 list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time " .

 An article in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion referred to the episode as a " scathing cartoon parody " of the Church of Scientology . University of Delaware philosophy professor Richard Hanley analyzed the mythology of Scientology , as it relates to the episode " Trapped in the Closet " , in his 2007 book South Park and Philosophy : Bigger , Longer , and More Penetrating . Hanley called the Xenu story as presented in the episode , " utterly ridiculous " . Hanley went on to delve into a philosophical analysis of the " evidential weight " of popularity and tradition in determining the " robustness " of beliefs . 
 Southwest Minnesota State University philosophy professor Robert Arp also analyzed the philosophical and cultural aspects of the episode in his book South Park and Philosophy : You Know , I Learned Something Today . Arp analyzed Comedy Central 's reaction to the episode itself , in a section of his book entitled " 2005 – 2006 : Comedy Central Caves " . Arp mentions South Park 's usage of the onscreen caption — " This is what Scientologists actually believe " — in the episode , noting that the same device was used in the episode " All About the Mormons ? " . In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device , Arp seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode . He explained , " By a long shot , this show was more kind to Scientology than was ' All About the Mormons ' to Mormonism . " He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time , though it later announced on July 12 , 2006 that it would .

 The organization Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network , founded by Lawrence Wollersheim , named the South Park staff their " <unk> Person ( s ) of the Year for 2005 " for this episode . Robert Arp cited the series winning a Peabody Award due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a " special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance " , and the notion that " the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices " , as the motivation behind the episode . 
 Stone and Parker submitted the episode for an Emmy Award , though Stone admitted that " We did it to be jerks . A ' fuck you ' to Comedy Central . " To their surprise the episode was nominated on July 6 , 2006 in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming Less Than One Hour ) category , the show 's sixth nomination ( one of which they won , for 2005 's " Best Friends Forever " ) . The Simpsons episode " The Seemingly Never @-@ Ending Story " was the eventual recipient of the award . It was also among Comedy Central 's list of " 10 South Parks That Changed The World " , which started airing at September 24 , 2006 in anticipation of the premiere of the second half of South Park 's tenth season .

 The scene where Cruise enters the closet is referenced in the South Park segment of the opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27 , 2006 , in which Conan O 'Brien is trying to get to the show , but suddenly appears in Stan 's room in an animated form . Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet . Immediately following the entrance , he exits the closet and says , " There 's someone else in there " , referring to Cruise , and leaves the door open . Cruise then pops out and closes the door . 
 There is a scene in the film The Bridge by Brett Hanover , where two young women looking for a laugh tell a Scientology volunteer they learned about the organization from South Park . The volunteer answers that she hasn 't seen the episode in question , and the two women later leave during the middle of an orientation video . 
 On February 8 , 2013 , while appearing on the Opie & Anthony Show , Jenna Miscavige Hill , the niece of the Chairman of Scientology , David Miscavige , admitted that she first learned about the story of Xenu from watching this episode .
