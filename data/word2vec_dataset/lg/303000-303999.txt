 In June 2000 Chapman signed a contract with newly professional Fulham to become one of the first full @-@ time professional female players in England . It was reported that Chapman was one of the most highly paid players in the team , on an annual salary of about £ 20 @,@ 000 . In her first season with The Cottagers Chapman won the South West Combination Women 's Football League , the third level of women 's football , and was again named FA Young Player of the Year . She also played in Fulham 's 1 – 0 FA Women 's Cup final defeat to Arsenal . 
 In 2001 – 02 Chapman helped Fulham win the FA Women 's Premier League Southern Division and promotion to the top flight . She also scored two goals in the 7 – 1 Premier League Cup final win over Birmingham City , after which Fulham 's manager Gaute <unk> claimed Chapman was good enough to play in any national side in the world . Chapman then scored the winning goal in the 2 – 1 FA Women 's Cup final victory over Doncaster Belles , a volley from 20 yards . In Conclusion to the 2001 @-@ 02 season , Chapman went on to be awarded the Ladies Player of the Season , as well as , winning the Nationwide International Player of the Year award . 
 Chapman sat out most of the following season due to pregnancy , as Fulham won a treble of FA Women 's Premier League National Division , FA Women 's Cup and Premier League Cup . She made the announcement during half @-@ time of a match against Tranmere Rovers , and was promptly substituted by <unk> – who quipped that he was not permitted to have 12 players on the pitch at once . When Chapman returned to action , in the FA Women 's Community Shield in August 2003 , Fulham were no longer a professional outfit . She represented Fulham in that season 's <unk> Women 's Cup campaign . In March 2004 Chapman played in Fulham 's Premier League Cup final defeat to Charlton Athletic .

 July 2004 saw Chapman depart Fulham to sign for Charlton , making her debut in a 1 – 0 Community Shield win over Arsenal at Broadhall Way . She played in The Addicks ' 3 – 0 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League Cup final in March 2005 . She then missed the conclusion of the 2004 – 05 season , including Charlton 's FA Women 's Cup win , with a broken hand sustained on international duty . In March 2006 Chapman played in her third successive Premier League Cup final , as Charlton beat Arsenal 2 – 1 . 
 = = = Arsenal = = = 
 Chapman signed for league champions Arsenal in July 2006 . She marked her Gunners debut with the opening goal in a 3 – 0 Community Shield win over Everton at Gresty Road . In Chapman 's first season at the club , Arsenal claimed an unprecedented quadruple , winning the FA Premier League Cup , FA Women 's Cup , FA Women 's Premier League and the UEFA Women 's Cup . Arsenal 's assistant coach Emma Hayes described Chapman as " a rock that makes everything around her better . She was the engine and heartbeat of the successful quadruple @-@ winning team . " Midway through the 2007 – 08 season , Chapman 's second pregnancy ruled her out of the rest of the campaign . 
 During 2008 – 09 Chapman returned to help Arsenal retain the league title ; she also scored the opening goal in the 2009 FA Women 's Cup final at Pride Park against Sunderland Ladies , in a game which ended 2 – 1 to Arsenal . She had also featured in Arsenal 's 5 – 0 Premier League Cup final win over Doncaster Rovers Belles .

 In December 2009 WPS club Chicago Red Stars signed Chapman , who cited the need for a new challenge . The Red Stars announced that Chapman would join the club in time for the 2010 WPS season , joining up with former Arsenal coach Emma Hayes and England team @-@ mate Karen Carney . After making 21 appearances during the campaign , Chapman negotiated a mutual release from her contract and returned to Arsenal . It was reported that Chapman 's husband had difficulty finding employment in America , so she returned home for the sake of her family .

 Chapman rejoined Arsenal in October 2010 , with the club on domestic hiatus before the launch of the FA WSL . She was praised by manager Laura Harvey after scoring late , decisive goals against Rayo Vallecano <unk> and Linköpings FC which helped to take Arsenal through to a UEFA Women 's Champions League semi @-@ final against eventual winners Lyon . In May 2011 , following injuries to Faye White and Jayne Ludlow , Chapman captained the Arsenal team which beat Bristol Academy 2 – 0 at the Ricoh Arena to reclaim the FA Women 's Cup . 
 Arsenal and Chapman won the first two editions of the FA WSL in 2011 and 2012 . In March 2013 Arsenal announced that Chapman was seven months pregnant and would miss the first half of the 2013 campaign . She returned to the team in a friendly win over Coventry City in July 2013 , following the birth of her third son . 
 On 3 August 2013 , Chapman made a substitute appearance in Arsenal 's 3 – 0 FA WSL win over Liverpool . The FA decreed she had not been properly registered and Arsenal were deducted three points . The blunder meant that Arsenal – champions for the last nine consecutive seasons – could not finish higher than third and would not qualify for the 2014 – 15 UEFA Women 's Champions League , unless they won the 2013 – 14 competition . 
 = = = Chelsea = = = 
 In January 2014 , Chelsea announced the double transfer of Chapman and Gilly Flaherty from Arsenal . The move reunited Chapman with Emma Hayes , her coach from Arsenal and Chicago . She hoped that training more regularly with Chelsea would kick start her international career . In August 2015 Chapman captained Chelsea in their FA Women 's Cup final against Notts County , the first time the event had been staged at Wembley Stadium . She described the experience as " overwhelming " . Chelsea 's 1 – 0 win before a Cup final record 30 @,@ 710 crowd secured the club 's first major trophy . It was the ninth FA Women 's Cup winner 's medal of Chapman 's career . In October 2015 she played in Chelsea 's 4 – 0 win over Sunderland which secured the club 's first FA WSL title and a League and Cup " double " . 
 = = International career = = 
 As a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , Chapman was called into the England U – 18 team , and captained her country at that level . Chapman made her senior debut for England at 17 , during the 2001 UEFA Women 's Championship qualification tournament , replacing Samantha Britton after 73 minutes of a 1 – 0 win over Switzerland in Bristol on 6 May 2000 . Chapman 's first senior start came in an 8 – 0 reverse to Norway in June 2000 . Despite the heavy defeat she was praised for her performance by national coach Hope Powell . England qualified for the final tournament with Chapman named Player of the Match in the away leg of the play @-@ off win over Ukraine . 
 At the 2001 UEFA Women 's Championship finals , Chapman played in all three of England 's games and was praised for her performances by UEFA and the victorious German coach Tina Theune @-@ Meyer . 
 In March 2002 Chapman headed her first goal for England in a 4 – 1 2003 FIFA Women 's World Cup qualification win in the Netherlands . She was named FA International Player of the Year for 2002 . Without Chapman – pregnant with her first child – England eventually failed to reach the 2003 FIFA Women 's World Cup after a play @-@ off defeat to France . 
 Despite a hand injury , Chapman also played every minute of all three games for England at the 2005 UEFA Women 's Championship , now featuring in midfield as she did at club level . Her initial appearances for the national team had come in central defence . At the 2007 FIFA Women 's World Cup Chapman started three matches , missing the group game against Argentina after picking up her second booking of the tournament during an impressive performance against Germany . 
 On Chapman 's return to the team she scored two goals in a Cyprus Cup win over South Africa in March 2009 . It was her first appearance for England since October 2007 , due to the birth of her second child . In May 2009 , Chapman was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association . She was an ever @-@ present in midfield during England 's run to the 2009 UEFA Women 's Championship final . In 2010 Chapman was named FA International Player of the Year for the second time . 
 Ahead of a March 2011 friendly against United States , Chapman unexpectedly withdrew from the England squad and quit international football . The decision , related to Chapman 's family commitments , was reported to have left England 's World Cup preparations in disarray . Hope Powell praised Chapman as " a wonderful servant to England over the years " . Chapman later confirmed she had been unhappy about a perceived lack of support with childcare costs and arrangements while on international duty . At the 2011 World Cup , Powell stressed that the FA had tried hard to accommodate Chapman 's requirements : " Katie was away with us in 2009 when we paid for her family to come along but at the end of the day there is not a bottomless pit of money in the women 's game . " 
 In September 2013 , after Powell had been sacked , Chapman gave an interview to BBC Radio 5 Live in which she lamented her treatment . Chapman recalled that she asked for time off to look after her children in a brief conversation with Powell , only to receive an e @-@ mail cancelling her central contract three hours later . She clarified that she had never retired from international football and that she still wanted to return and win 100 caps . 
 Powell 's successor Mark Sampson eventually recalled <unk> to the national team squad in February 2015 , for a friendly against the United States in Milton Keynes . In May 2015 Sampson confirmed Chapman in his final squad for the 2015 FIFA Women 's World Cup , to be hosted in Canada . During the tournament Chapman celebrated her 33rd birthday and her husband and three sons flew out for a surprise visit . England eventually finished in third place after Chapman , starting her fifth match of the tournament , helped them beat Germany 1 – 0 in the bronze medal play @-@ off .

 In June 2012 Chapman was not included in the final 18 – player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics . She had made the 35 – player longlist but was hurt and disappointed to be overlooked for the event in her home city . Chapman felt that her decision to withdraw from the England squad had caused Hope Powell – who managed Great Britain as well as England – to leave her out .

 Chapman has three sons with husband Mark . During the pregnancies Chapman trained until two weeks before the birth , then resumed training six weeks afterwards . In 2002 – 03 Chapman sat out Fulham 's treble winning season while pregnant with Harvey , but returned in August 2003 and played in the FA Women 's Community Shield win over Doncaster Belles . 
 As of January 2008 , Chapman announced she was pregnant with Riley , and as a result played no further part in Arsenal 's 2007 – 08 season . Riley was born on 8 July . Chapman returned to Arsenal for the 2008 – 09 season and assisted in their 5 – 1 victory over Nottingham Forest Ladies , in Carlton , on 18 September .

 = St Mawes Castle = 
 St Mawes Castle ( Cornish : Kastel <unk> ) is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII near Falmouth , Cornwall , between 1540 and 1542 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Carrick Roads waterway at the mouth of the River Fal . The castle was built under the direction of Thomas Treffry to a clover leaf design , with a four @-@ storey central tower and three protruding , round bastions that formed gun platforms . It was initially armed with 19 artillery pieces , intended for use against enemy shipping , operating in partnership with its sister castle of Pendennis on the other side of the estuary . During the English Civil War , St Mawes was held by Royalist supporters of King Charles I , but surrendered to a Parliamentary army in 1646 in the final phase of the conflict . 
 The castle continued in use as a fort through the 18th and 19th centuries . In the early 1850s , fears of a fresh conflict with France , combined with changes in military technology , led to the redevelopment of the fortification . The out @-@ dated Henrician castle was turned into a barracks and substantial gun batteries were constructed beneath it , equipped with the latest naval artillery . In the 1880s and 1890s an electronically @-@ operated minefield was laid across the River Fal , operated from St Mawes and Pendennis , and new , quick @-@ firing guns were installed at St Mawes to support these defences . After 1905 , however , St Mawes ' guns were removed , and between 1920 and 1939 it was run by the state as a tourist attraction . 
 Brought back into service in the Second World War , naval artillery and an anti @-@ aircraft gun were installed at the castle to defend against the risk of German attack . With the end of the war , St Mawes again returned to use as a tourist attraction . In the 21st century , the castle is operated by English Heritage . The castle has elaborate , carved 16th @-@ century decorations including sea monsters and gargoyles , and the historian Paul Pattison has described the site as " arguably the most perfect survivor of all Henry 's forts " .

 St Mawes Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Basic defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and he took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 The stretch of water known as Carrick Roads at the mouth of the River Fal was an important anchorage serving shipping arriving from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean , and plans were made to protect it with five castles . In the event , only two of these were constructed , St Mawes and Pendennis , positioned on each side of Carrick Roads . The two castles ' guns could provide overlapping fire across the water , while St Mawes also overlooked a separate anchorage on the eastern side of the estuary . The construction work began in 1540 , under the direction of Sir Thomas <unk> , a prominent member of the local gentry appointed to act as the project 's Clerk of Works by Lord Admiral Russell . By later that year , the castle was described as being " half @-@ made " , with most of the build having been finished by 1542 . The total cost of the project was £ 5 @,@ 018 . 
 The clover leaf shaped castle , with an additional small blockhouse at the water 's edge below , was armed with 19 artillery pieces - a demi @-@ cannon , a demi @-@ culverin , a demi @-@ sling , five slings , four portpieces and seven bases - along with 12 large <unk> , a form of arquebus . The artillery was originally mounted in the castle 's stone bastions and was intended as " ship @-@ sinking " weapons for use against enemy vessels . A smaller blockhouse was constructed beneath the main castle , at sea level ; this may have been constructed ahead of the main castle build as a form of early protection . Normally the castle would have held a small garrison , which would have been supplemented by the local militia in the event of a crisis ; St Mawes had 18 <unk> and 30 bows in its stores , probably for the use of the militia in such a situation . 
 = = = = Initial operation = = = = 
 Michael <unk> , a member of the local gentry , was appointed as the first captain of St Mawes and the surrounding land in 1544 , and was followed by Hannibal Vyvyan in 1561 . On Vyvyan 's death in 1603 , his son , Sir Francis Vyvyan , became captain . The captains of St Mawes frequently argued with those of Pendennis Castle and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping : both castles argued that they had a traditional right to do so . The Admiralty issued a compromise , proposing that the castles share the incoming traffic . Sir Francis was dismissed from office in 1632 , accused of " practising a variety of deceptions " at St Mawes , including falsely claiming wages for non @-@ existent members of the garrison , and was replaced by first Sir Robert Le <unk> and then Thomas Howard , the Earl of Arundel and Surrey . 
 Meanwhile , the invasion threat from France passed and a lasting peace was made in 1558 , but the Spanish threat to the south @-@ west of England grew in importance to the government . War broke out in 1569 , with the threat of invasion and the garrison at St Mawes was strengthened : in 1578 it comprised 100 soldiers . An additional battery of guns was built to allow the fort to fire further upriver . Fears of a Spanish attack continued especially after the failed Armada of 1597 ; two earth and timber bastions were built out from the original stone castle to hold guns , eventually becoming the main batteries for the castle . By 1623 the castle held two brass culverins , six iron culverins , one demi @-@ culverin and one saker , with a small garrison of 14 men , overseen by a captain and a lieutenant . A survey in 1634 indicated structural problems , and suggested that £ 534 was needed for repairs . 
 = = = = English Civil War and Restoration = = = = 
 When civil war broke out in 1642 between King Charles I and Parliament , St Mawes and the south @-@ west of England was held by the Royalists . The growing town of Falmouth was a strategically important part of their supply routes to the Continent , while Carrick Roads formed a base for Royalist piracy in the English Channel . The war turned in favour of the Parliamentarians and , by March 1646 , Thomas Fairfax had entered Cornwall with a substantial army . 
 The captain of the castle , Major Hannibal Bonithon , was invited by Colonel John Arundell to retreat to the stronger fortress of Pendennis , but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately without putting up resistance . This decision has been put down to a result of war @-@ weariness , the large numbers of Parliamentary troops facing them and the generous surrender terms on offer , although the 19th @-@ century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies . 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured : the castle 's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis , which fell that August . 
 The castle was placed on a " care and maintenance " footing , with a skeleton garrison . Parliament appointed George <unk> as the new captain and he probably remained in post until the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660 , when Sir Richard Vyvyan , Sir Francis 's son , took over command . Richard inherited a garrison of 13 men , which he considered insufficient . Richard 's son , Sir <unk> Vyvyan , became captain in turn on his father 's death , but he had no heirs and separated the castle 's lands from the captaincy , selling them to John Granville , the Earl of Bath . 
 = = = 18th – 19th centuries = = = 
 The castle continued in use as a fort through the 18th and 19th centuries under the command of successive captains , still operating in conjunction with Pendennis . A review by Colonel Christian Lilly in 1714 reported that the fortification was in a satisfactory condition , and in the 1730s , St Mawes was equipped with 17 artillery pieces , including six 24 @-@ pounder ( 11 kg ) cannons , mostly positioned in the batteries beneath the Henrician castle . Britain 's wars with France in the late @-@ 18th century made the defence of Falmouth critical and from 1775 until 1780 the local militia was called up to defend St Mawes . By the 1780s , the castle was equipped with over 30 pieces of heavy artillery . There were repeated concerns emerged about its ordnance , however , and an inspection in 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars found that only one 24 @-@ pounder gun was serviceable . 
 In 1796 , a new gun battery was created at St Anthony Head , just along the coast from St Mawes . For a period this battery became the primary defensive position on the east side of the estuary , although in 1805 St Mawes was still armed with ten 24 @-@ pounder guns . The poet Lord Byron , visiting in 1809 , complained that St Mawes was " extremely well calculated for annoying every body except an enemy " , and commented that the fort was garrisoned by only one , elderly man . At the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the St Anthony 's battery was closed but St Mawes remained in use , albeit being operated once again on a " care and maintenance " basis in the post @-@ war years . 
 Falmouth Harbour became one of the most important ports in England during the 19th century , attracting much of the transatlantic shipping trade . The Tudor office of the captaincy was abolished in 1849 , with the death of the final incumbent , Sir George Nugent , and the command of the garrison became a regular military appointment . In the early 1850s , fears of a conflict with France led to a review of the state of the harbour 's defences . The development of ironclad warships equipped with rifled guns meant that St Mawes required a comprehensive overhaul . A new Grand Sea Battery and magazine was built beneath the Henrician castle , linked with deep passages , and equipped with eight 56 @-@ pound ( 25 kg ) and four 64 @-@ pounder ( 29 kg ) rifled muzzle loader guns . The old castle was used as a barracks but , since it could only hold 30 men , St Mawes was typically used as a training base and manned by militia and volunteer units . 
 Fresh concerns about France rose in the 1880s and an electronically @-@ operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885 , jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis . Additional contact mines were added , forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes , illuminated with electric search lights . As part of this transformation , the castle 's 64 @-@ pounder guns were partially replaced with light , quick @-@ firing guns in the 1890s , able to engage any torpedo boats or mine sweepers attempting to break through the defences . The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited , and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901 , again for housing quick @-@ firing guns . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous , as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and the recently re @-@ established battery at St Anthony 's instead . <unk> , St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War . In 1920 the castle was transferred to the control of the government 's Office of Works , and was opened to visitors , being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped to profit by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth . 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , St Mawes was reoccupied by the British Army . In late 1941 , the No 173 Coast Battery took over running a new , twin 6 @-@ pounder ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) battery positioned just north @-@ west of the castle , combined with a 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) Bofors gun closer to the castle for anti @-@ aircraft protection , and searchlights along the base of the Grand Sea Magazine . Some of the 115 @-@ strong garrison lived in a local Nissen hut , with the remainder housed in St Mawes itself . 
 The castle was removed from active service in January 1945 and reopened to the public the following year . The Second World War gun battery was finally closed in 1956 after several years of use as a training site . Between 1945 and 1970 , much of the Victorian earthwork and concrete defences were cleared from the Grand Sea Battery , and the 1941 battery was completely destroyed . 
 In the 21st century , St Mawes Castle is operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction , receiving 21 @,@ 104 visitors in 2010 . It is protected under UK law as a Scheduled Monument .

 The central castle is built from <unk> rubble , with granite features and detailing ; it has a clover leaf design with a central , four @-@ storey circular tower , or keep , at its core , and three circular bastions emerging from it . The design allowed for multiple levels of artillery , and may have been influenced by the contemporary work of the Moravian engineer , Stefan von Haschenperg , on some of the other Device Forts constructed during this period . It had little protection to the landward side , and would have depended upon the local militia providing protection against such an attack . The castle has been little altered since its original construction , and the historian Paul Pattison considers it to be " arguably the most perfect survivor of all Henry 's forts " . 
 The castle is extensively decorated with carvings and inscriptions in stone and wood , praising Henry VIII and his lineage , leading the historian A. L. Rowse to describe the castle as the most decorative of all of Henry 's building works . These include Latin verses , such as " Henry , thy honour and praises will remain forever " , written by the antiquarian John Leland , and " Let fortunate Cornwall rejoice that Edward is now her Duke " , referring to Henry 's eldest son and heir . Carved sea monsters and gargoyles also feature around the fortification , along with heraldic shields which would originally have been painted and visible from the river . 
 The castle is entered through the gatehouse , a polygonal , stone building approximately 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) across . The gatehouse has gunloops , murder holes and slots for a drawbridge , although it is uncertain if one was ever fitted ; it would originally have formed a sort of protective barbican . The yard behind it is approximately 20 by 59 feet ( 6 by 18 m ) and dates from before 1735 , originally being used a stable . This leads to a stone bridge that crosses a 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) wide moat , cut out of the rock , to the main castle . 
 The central tower is 47 feet ( 14 m ) across and 44 feet ( 13 m ) high , with 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) thick walls . The basement was originally a kitchen and storerooms , with the first floor was subdivided and used by the garrison , before being later converted for storing gunpowder . The bridge across the moat leads into to the second storey , which originally had four chambers with fireplaces and windows , linked by a central corridor ; this area may have been used by the castle 's officers , and to house an enlarged garrison in an emergency . The third floor forms a single , large room with gun embrasures , and was probably used by the garrison as living accommodation . Above it , the <unk> gun platform on the fourth floor could support up to seven guns and incorporates a lookout turret , topped by a 17th @-@ century cupola , designed as a daymark to guide passing ships . 
 The central tower is linked to the forward bastion , 59 feet ( 18 m ) in diameter , which in turn has steps leading to the side bastions , each 54 @-@ foot ( 16 @.@ 4 m ) across . Each of the bastions forms a gun platform , with embrasures for larger artillery pieces - five in the forward bastion , three on each of the sides - as well as swivel mounts for lighter guns , and parapets for protection . The forward bastion 's roof is modern and was added after an archaeological debate in the 1960s as to whether the bastions would originally have been covered . The bastions have various 18th- and 19th @-@ century artillery pieces on display , as well as a bronze saker dating from 1560 called the <unk> gun , recovered from a shipwreck off the coast of Devon . 
 = = = Batteries and auxiliary buildings = = = 
 Gun batteries and other auxiliary buildings stretch across the St Mawes Castle site . Above the Henrician castle is the 12 @-@ pounder quick @-@ firing high @-@ level battery , dating from the start of the 20th century . Its four concrete platforms and earth parapets have survived , along with an underground magazine just behind the site . A small bungalow from this period at the entrance to the battery is still in use , serving as the English Heritage custodian 's house . Alongside the Henrician castle is the Engine House , approximately 41 feet ( 12 m ) square and dating from around 1902 . It originally contained an internal combustion engine , generating power for the castle 's searchlights , but was later converted into a storeroom . 
 Beneath the Henrician castle is a complex of artillery positions , cut out of the rock from around 1854 onwards , and collectively known as the Grand Sea Battery . The Grand Sea Battery was served by a 19th @-@ century magazine for holding gunpowder , approximately 35 by 18 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 by 5 @.@ 5 m ) with stone walls and bomb @-@ proof brick roof , topped with turf to help to protect against incoming shells . For many years the magazine was protected by an additional concrete fortification , but this was removed in 1970 . There are two gun platforms along the west and east sides of the complex , 110 feet ( 34 m ) and 80 feet ( 24 m ) across respectively and known as the Lower Gun Battery . The current design of the western platform dates from the 1890s , with two raised concrete platforms for rotating guns and a brick @-@ vaulted magazine just behind the battery . The eastern platform has pivots and racers for mounting four traversing gun carriages , one of which now houses a 12 @-@ pound smooth @-@ bore artillery piece dating from 1815 , mounted on a replica carriage . 
 Just below the Grand Sea Battery is the 16th @-@ century blockhouse , positioned by the water 's edge , 160 feet ( 49 m ) from the Henrician castle . The blockhouse is semi @-@ circular in shape , with 56 feet ( 17 m ) wide with 9 @.@ 8 @-@ foot ( 3 m ) thick stone walls facing the sea , but much thinner walls to the rear . It originally had four gunports , one of which has since been blocked up , along with an upper gun platform and battlements . The upper storey was later destroyed to turn it into a solid gun platform , although this has since been re @-@ excavated . Beside the blockhouse are the foundations of four searchlight emplacements dating from the Second World War . 
 To the west of the Grand Sea Battery are landscaped gardens , built on top of earlier gun positions along the site . Five 19th @-@ century smooth @-@ bore guns from the Napoleonic period are on display , forming a saluting battery . Beyond the gardens is the site of the Second World War 6 pounder battery , but little now remains of this position . 
 = Australian ringneck = 
 The Australian ringneck ( Barnardius zonarius ) is a parrot native to Australia . Except for extreme tropical and highland areas , the species has adapted to all conditions . Traditionally , two species were recognised in the genus Barnardius , the Port Lincoln parrot ( Barnardius zonarius ) and the mallee ringneck ( Barnardius barnardi ) , but the two species readily interbred at the contact zone and are now considered one species . Currently , four subspecies are recognised , each with a distinct range . 
 In Western Australia , the ringneck competes for nesting space with the rainbow lorikeet , an introduced species . To protect the ringneck , culls of the lorikeet are sanctioned by authorities in this region . Overall , though , the ringneck is not a threatened species . 
 = = Description = = 
 The subspecies of the Australian ringneck differ considerably in colouration . It is a medium size species around 33 cm ( 11 in ) long . The basic colour is green , and all four subspecies have the characteristic yellow ring around the hindneck ; wings and tail are a mixture of green and blue . 
 The B. z. zonarius and B. z. semitorquatus subspecies have a dull black head ; back , rump and wings are brilliant green ; throat and breast bluish @-@ green . The difference between these two subspecies is that B. z. zonarius has a yellow abdomen while B. z. semitorquatus has a green abdomen ; the latter has also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks ( the intermediate shown in the box has characteristics of both subspecies ) . The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the bright green crown and nape and blush cheek @-@ patches . The underparts of B. z. barnardi are turquoise @-@ green with an irregular orange @-@ yellow band across the abdomen ; the back and mantle are deep blackish @-@ blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band . The B. z. macgillivrayi is generally pale green , with no red frontal band , and a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen . 
 The calls of the mallee ringneck and Cloncurry parrot have been described as " ringing " , and the calls of the Port Lincoln ringneck and twenty @-@ eight have been described as " strident " . The name of the twenty @-@ eight parrot is an onomatopoeic derived from its distinctive ' <unk> @-@ eight ' call ( or ' <unk> @-@ <unk> ' , from an early French description ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The Australian ringneck was first described by the English naturalist George Shaw in 1805 . It is a broad @-@ tailed parrot and related to the rosellas of the genus Platycercus ; it has been placed in that genus by some authorities , including Ferdinand Bauer . 
 Currently , four subspecies of ringneck are recognised , all of which have been described as distinct species in the past : ( As of 1993 , the twenty @-@ eight and Cloncurry parrot were treated as subspecies of the Port Lincoln parrot and the mallee ringneck , respectively ) . 
 Several other subspecies have been described , but are considered synonyms with one of the above subspecies . B. z. occidentalis has been synonymised with B. z. zonarius . Intermediates exist between all subspecies except for between B. z. zonarius and B. z. macgillivrayi . Intermediates have been associated with land clearing for agriculture in southern Western Australia . 
 The classification of this species is still debated , and molecular research by Joseph and Wilke in 2006 found that the complex split genetically into two clades — one roughly correlating with B. z. barnardi and the other with the other three forms ; B. z. macgillivrayi was more closely related to B. z. zonarius than to the neighbouring B. z. barnardi . The researchers felt it was premature to reorganise the classification of the complex until more study was undertaken .

 = = Behaviour = = 
 The Australian ringneck is active during the day and can be found in eucalypt woodlands and eucalypt @-@ lined watercourses . The species is gregarious and depending on the conditions can be resident or nomadic . In trials of growing hybrid eucalypt trees in dry environments parrots , especially the Port Lincoln parrot , caused severe damage to the crowns of the younger trees during the research period between 2000 – 3 . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 This species eats a wide range of foods that include nectar , insects , seeds , fruit , and native and introduced bulbs . It will eat orchard @-@ grown fruit and is sometimes seen as a pest by farmers . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Breeding season for the northern populations starts in June or July , while the central and southern populations breed from August to February , but this can be delayed when climatic conditions are unfavourable . The nesting site is a hollow in a tree trunk . Generally four or five white oval eggs are laid measuring 29 mm x 23 mm , although a clutch may be as few as three and as many as six . <unk> survival rates have been measured at 75 % . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Although the species is endemic , the species is considered not threatened , but in Western Australia , the twenty @-@ eight subspecies ( B. z. semitorquatus ) gets locally displaced by the introduced rainbow lorikeets that aggressively compete for nesting places . The rainbow lorikeet is considered a pest species in Western Australia and is subject to eradication in the wild . 
 In Western Australia , a licence is required to keep or dispose of more than four Port Lincoln <unk> . All four subspecies are sold in the Canary Islands and in Australia , and they are traded via the CITES convention . The sale of the Cloncurry parrot is restricted in Queensland . The Australian ringneck can suffer from <unk> beak and feather disease , which causes a high nestling mortality rate in captivity . 
 = Washington State Route 285 = 
 State Route 285 ( SR 285 ) is a 5 @.@ 04 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 11 km ) state highway serving Douglas and Chelan counties , located in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway serves Wenatchee and begins at an interchange with State Route 28 ( SR 28 ) in East Wenatchee , crosses the Columbia River on the Senator George Sellar Bridge into Downtown Wenatchee and continues north to end at an interchange with U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) and US 97 north of the Wenatchee River in Sunnyslope . 
 The highway originally crossed the Columbia River on an earlier bridge built in 1908 . The bridge was signed as part of State Road 7 in 1909 and later State Road 2 ( the Sunset Highway ) in 1923 . The roadway was used by US 10 from 1926 until 1940 , when it was re @-@ routed and replaced by an alternate route . US 2 was extended from Idaho into Washington in 1946 and used the bridge until the newer Senator George Sellar Bridge was built to the south in 1950 . SR 285 was designated in 1977 after US 2 was routed onto the Richard Odabashian Bridge north of Wenatchee and East Wenatchee . The area around the Senator George Sellar Bridge is being improved by the Washington State Department of Transportation to handle increased traffic . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 285 begins its 5 @.@ 04 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 8 @.@ 11 km ) long route at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 28 west of the Wenatchee Valley Mall in East Wenatchee . The freeway crosses the Columbia River from Douglas County into Wenatchee and Chelan County on the Senator George Sellar Bridge , listed as a part of the National Register of Historic Places . The highway becomes Stevens Street and has a small interchange with Wenatchee Avenue before turning north onto Mission Street . 
 SR 285 serves Downtown Wenatchee and splits into a one @-@ way pair with southbound lanes on Chelan Avenue and northbound lanes staying on Mission Street , passing the Wenatchee branch of the North Central Regional Library at Memorial Park and the Wenatchee Valley Hospital . The one @-@ way pair rejoins the main route , turning north as Miller Street and then northwest as Wenatchee Avenue into West Wenatchee near Wenatchee Confluence State Park . Wenatchee Avenue crosses the Wenatchee River into Sunnyslope and becomes a freeway , intersecting Penny Road and Easy Street in an incomplete diamond interchange before ending at an interchange with US 2 and US 97 . 
 The Senator George Sellar Bridge is the busiest section of SR 285 , being used by a daily average of 52 @,@ 000 vehicles in 2011 . The southern end of the one @-@ way pair , at the intersection of Chelan Avenue and Mission Street , had a daily average of 22 @,@ 000 vehicles in 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 The cantilever truss Columbia River Bridge was built in 1908 by the Washington Bridge Company and purchased by the Washington State Highway Commission the following year to serve Wenatchee and East Wenatchee , divided by the Columbia River . The bridge and the streets were signed as State Road 7 in 1909 as part of the highway from Renton to Idaho , later named the Sunset Highway in 1913 . The Sunset Highway became State Road 2 in a 1923 renumbering before the creation of US 10 in 1926 . 
 State Road 2 became Primary State Highway 2 ( PSH 2 ) in 1937 during the creation of the primary and secondary state highway system . US 10 was re @-@ routed south to cross the Columbia River at Vantage in the 1940s and was designated as US 10 Alternate , until US 2 was extended from Bonners Ferry , Idaho to Everett in 1946 . The Columbia River Bridge was replaced by the newly built Senator George Sellar Bridge in 1950 and US 2 was re @-@ routed south onto the bridge . PSH 2 was decommissioned during the 1964 renumbering and US 2 remained . US 2 was re @-@ routed , along with US 97 , onto the Richard Odabashian Bridge in Sunnyslope , bypassing Wenatchee in 1975 . SR 285 was established in 1977 to maintain the Senator George Sellar Bridge and only included the short route until 1991 , when it was extended to Sunnyslope . 
 Since 1991 , no major revisions to the highway have occurred , however the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) has been improving the roadway around the Senator George Sellar Bridge . Between May 2009 and July 2011 , WSDOT added an additional eastbound lane by moving the sidewalks to a new structure on the outside of the bridge , opening on July 29 , 2011 . A southbound bypass lane for SR 28 is currently being constructed under the east end of the bridge , expected to be completed in spring 2013 . At the west end of the bridge , in Downtown Wenatchee , a new off @-@ ramp to Crescent Street and signal improvements at Mission Street are being constructed and are scheduled to be finished by fall 2013 .

 = David Booth ( ice hockey ) = 
 David Jonathan Booth ( born November 24 , 1984 ) is an American professional ice hockey player who is currently playing for Admiral Vladivostok of the Kontinental Hockey League , having last played full @-@ time for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League . Following his second year with the Michigan State Spartans , he was selected 53rd overall by the Florida Panthers in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft . He spent four years playing college hockey before turning professional with the Panthers organization in 2006 – 07 . After recording career @-@ highs in goals , assists and points , as well as being voted the Panthers ' most valuable player by the team 's fans in 2008 – 09 , he suffered two concussions the following season . Midway through his sixth year in the league , Booth was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in a four @-@ player deal . 
 Known as an offensive forward and a fast skater , Booth has reached the 30 @-@ goal plateau once in his NHL career . Representing the United States in international competition , he has won gold medals at the 2002 IIHF World U18 and 2004 IIHF World U20 Championships . He has also competed in the 2008 IIHF World Championship .

 After playing minor hockey with the Fraser Falcons , then the Detroit <unk> of the Midwest Elite Hockey League , Booth moved on to the Junior A level with the Detroit Compuware Ambassadors of the North American Hockey League ( NAHL ) . He recorded 30 points ( 17 goals and 13 assists ) over 42 games in 2000 – 01 , earning him NAHL All @-@ Rookie Team and Rookie of the Year honours . The following season , he joined the United States National Team Development Program and competed for their junior and under @-@ 18 teams in the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) and NAHL , respectively . 
 During his time with the Development Program , he committed to an athletic scholarship with the Michigan State Spartans of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association ( CCHA ) . Joining the Spartans in 2002 – 03 , he recorded 36 points ( 17 goals and 19 assists ) over 39 games , ranking fourth in team scoring and 13th in the CCHA overall . His freshman year included two CCHA Rookie of the Week distinctions and a hat @-@ trick , recorded on January 10 , 2003 , in a 5 – 2 win against the Alaska Nanooks . His efforts as a freshman earned him Spartans Rookie of the Year and CCHA All @-@ Rookie Team honours . Although Booth was eligible for the 2003 NHL Entry Draft , National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) rules stipulated that players under the age of 19 could not opt into the draft without foregoing their college eligibility . 
 Early the following season , Booth sustained a knee injury that forced him out of the lineup for several games . He finished his sophomore year with 18 points ( eight goals and ten assists ) over 30 contests . Despite his decreased offensive production , he remained highly ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ( CSB ) at the end of the season for the upcoming 2004 NHL Entry Draft . He was listed at 27th among skaters playing in North America by the CSB , while The Hockey News ranked him 33rd overall . During the draft , Booth was selected in the second round , 53rd overall , by the Florida Panthers . He was scouted as a player with size and toughness , while a USA Today article declared that he " would have gone much higher if he opted into the draft [ the previous ] season . " 
 Following his draft , Booth returned to Michigan State to complete his four @-@ year tenure with the school . During his junior year , he and teammate Bryan <unk> set a Spartans record for the fastest two goals scored in a game ( five seconds apart ) . Their goals came in a 6 – 5 overtime loss to the Alaska Nanooks in February 2005 and surpassed the previous record by one second . Later that month , Booth sustained a cracked rib and was sidelined for several games . He finished the 2004 – 05 season with 16 points ( seven goals and nine assists ) over 29 contests . 
 In the first month of his senior year , Booth played in his 100th career college game in a contest against the North Dakota Fighting Sioux on October 16 , 2005 . He recorded a short handed goal in a 3 – 0 win . Booth later missed some playing time due to injury before returning to the lineup in late @-@ November 2005 . After struggling to score in the first half of the 2005 – 06 season ( he recorded nine points in the first three months ) , Booth finished with 35 points ( 13 goals and 22 assists ) over 37 games . His strong offensive production in the second half included an 11 @-@ game point @-@ scoring streak that was broken on the last regular season game against the Miami RedHawks . In the 2006 CCHA playoffs , Booth helped the Spartans to a Mason Cup as league champions . Facing the Miami RedHawks in the final , Booth scored the game @-@ winning goal six minutes in the second period , securing a 2 – 1 win for Michigan State . Moving on to the 2006 NCAA Tournament , they were eliminated in the regional final by the Maine Black Bears 5 – 4 . Booth scored a goal and an assist in the losing effort . Over four years with the Spartans , Booth finished his college career with 105 points in 134 games . 
 = = = Florida Panthers ( 2006 – 2011 ) = = = 
 On July 20 , 2006 , Booth signed with the Panthers . Joining the organization , he was assigned to the Panthers ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Rochester Americans , to start the 2006 – 07 season . Within two months , he was called up to the Panthers on November 20 . Making his NHL debut that night against the Boston Bruins , he registered 11 @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes of ice time in a 3 – 2 win . After being returned to the AHL six days later , he received another call @-@ up the following month . During his second stint with the team , he recorded his first NHL point on December 12 against the Anaheim Ducks . Booth drew the first assist on the game 's first goal by Drew <unk> ; the Panthers went on to lose 5 – 4 . Sent back down to Rochester and recalled one more time in December , he remained with the team for the remainder of the campaign . Booth later scored his first NHL goal on January 4 , 2007 , against Jamie McLennan in a 5 – 4 overtime loss to the Calgary Flames . In the final month of the season , he registered his first game @-@ winning goal in the NHL on April 6 in a 7 – 2 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning . Booth completed his rookie season with 10 points ( 3 goals and 7 assists ) over 48 NHL games , while also recording 14 points ( seven goals and seven assists ) over 25 AHL games . As the Panthers failed to qualify for the 2007 playoffs , ranking 12th in the Eastern Conference , Booth was returned to the AHL for the Americans ' post @-@ season . He recorded two assists over six playoff games as Rochester was eliminated in the first round by the Hamilton Bulldogs . 
 Early in the 2007 – 08 season , Booth was injured after receiving a check from behind during a game against the Ottawa Senators on October 20 , 2007 . While playing the puck , he collided with Senators defenceman Anton Volchenkov , causing his head to hit the boards . Volchenkov received a five @-@ minute major penalty and a game misconduct on the play , while Booth was taken off the ice in a stretcher . He was brought to an Ottawa hospital for precautionary measures and returned home the same night with a sore neck . While a suspension for Volchenkov was suggested in the media following the game , the league chose not to hold a hearing regarding the incident . Senators head coach John Paddock was quick to dismiss the notion of a suspension , asserting that Booth turned into Volchenkov , as opposed to the Senators defenceman forcefully initiating contact . Booth missed one game due to the injury . Later in the campaign , he missed eight games with a knee injury . Missing nine games total , he recorded 40 points ( 22 goals and 18 assists ) over 73 contests , ranking fourth in team scoring . Becoming an integral part of the Panthers ' lineup , he also led the team with six game @-@ winning goals . As a team , the Panthers remained out of the playoffs in 2008 , finishing 11th in the East . 
 The following season , Booth recorded his first career NHL natural hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks on November 9 , 2008 . He scored all the Panthers goals against Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère in a 3 – 1 win over the Anaheim Ducks . The following month , he sustained a left shoulder injury that sidelined him for eight games . After returning , he began an eight @-@ game point @-@ scoring streak that lasted from December 27 , 2008 , to January 10 , 2009 . Later in the season , he recorded another hat trick in a contest against the St. Louis Blues on March 7 , 2009 . Scoring all three goals against Chris Mason , Booth helped the Panthers to a 5 – 3 win . His efforts made him the fourth player in team history to register two hat @-@ tricks in one season , after Pavel Bure , Ray Sheppard and Olli Jokinen . He also added an assist for a four @-@ point game . Booth bettered that single @-@ game total during the last contest of the regular season , scoring two goals and three assists for a personal best five @-@ point effort in a 7 – 4 win against the Washington Capitals on April 11 , 2009 . Booth finished the season with career @-@ highs of 31 goals , 29 assists and 60 points over 72 games . While leading the Panthers in goals , powerplay goals ( 11 ) , game @-@ winning goals ( 5 ; tied with Nathan Horton , and shots ( 246 ) , he finished one point behind team @-@ leader Stephen Weiss ( who played six more games than Booth ) . Booth 's efforts helped the Panthers compete for a playoff spot late in the season for the first time in his tenure with the club . They finished the season tied for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with the Montreal Canadiens at 41 wins and 93 points each . The Canadiens earned the spot over the Panthers by virtue of having won the season series between the two teams . 
 During his breakout season , Booth became a favorite among team followers ; home fans at BankAtlantic Center were known to cheer " <unk> " when he touched the puck during games . At the end of the campaign , he was chosen by the fans as the team 's most valuable player in an official online vote . Set to become a restricted free agent in the off @-@ season , Booth was tendered a qualifying offer by the Panthers on June 29 , 2009 . Two days later , he signed a six @-@ year , US $ 25 @.@ 5 million contract . Upon announcing the contract , Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton heralded Booth as " undoubtedly an important part of [ the ] club 's future ... [ and ] a role model for other players , " while embodying " every attribute of what a true Panthers player stands for . " 
 During the first month of the 2009 – 10 season , Booth sustained a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24 , 2009 . Skating up to the Flyers ' blueline , Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder . Rendered unconscious , Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital . In addition to his concussion , he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches ; he was released from hospital the next day . While Richards received a five @-@ minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure , he was not suspended for the play . The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue . Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards ' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position , warranting a suspension . The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth 's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally , but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him . Another concern was the timing of Richards ' hit , as Booth had already released the puck . In response , NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension . 
 Booth was not cleared for full @-@ contact practice with the team until January 25 , 2010 . Six days later , he returned to the lineup for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests . During his absence , the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21 , 2009 , for the first time since Richards ' hit . The game included four fights , including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards . The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3 , 2010 . After fighting Richards in the first period ( one of four fights in the game and Booth 's first in the NHL ) , Booth scored a goal and three assists ( completing a Gordie Howe hat trick ) to help the Panthers to a 7 – 4 win . 
 Although the NHL had not suspended Richards for his actions against Booth , the incident was instrumental in the League 's newfound efforts to eliminate hits to the head , particularly against players who cannot see the oncoming checker approaching ( as was the case with Booth ) . Several months after Booth 's October 2009 concussion , Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard was hit by Matt Cooke in a similar fashion on March 7 . Later that month , on March 25 , the NHL Board of Governors and NHL Players ' Association 's executive board voted in favour of a rule penalizing " blindside hits " ( bodychecking a player after having skated laterally towards him undetected , an idea similar to one 's " blind spot " while driving ) . That same night , Booth suffered his second concussion in five months during a game against the Montreal Canadiens . While reaching back to retrieve a loose puck , Booth was hit in the head by opposing defenceman Jaroslav <unk> 's shoulder . No penalty was called on the play , while Booth was helped off the ice and taken to hospital . The hit did not receive suspension and did not spark controversy as Booth 's previous concussion had . Following the game , Panthers forward Nathan Horton asserted that " It wasn 't a dirty hit " ; <unk> expressed concern for Booth , but explained that " when he turned I was standing right there and basically he just ran at me . " Sidelined for the remaining nine games of the season , Booth finished the campaign with 16 points ( eight goals and eight assists ) over 28 games . After pushing for a playoff spot the previous season , the Panthers ranked second @-@ worst in the East with 32 wins and 77 points . 
 While Booth 's hockey @-@ playing future was initially in doubt following his second concussion , he returned for the 2010 – 11 season and played all 82 games . Averaging 19 minutes of ice time per game ( second among forward behind Weiss ) , he led the Panthers with 23 goals while ranking third with 40 points ( behind Weiss and Mike <unk> ) . With 280 shots , including a 14 @-@ shot effort against the Bruins on November 18 , 2010 , he led all Panthers ' players and ranked 12th in the NHL overall . As a team , the Panthers continued to struggle and General Manager Dale Tallon began trading away many of their veteran players towards the end of the season ; they finished with the worst record in the East . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks ( 2011 – 2014 ) = = = 
 Less than a month into the 2011 – 12 season , Booth was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on October 22 , 2011 . The Panthers sent him , along with forward Steven Reinprecht and a third @-@ round pick in the 2013 draft , to Vancouver in exchange for forwards Mikael Samuelsson and Marco Sturm . Tallon described the deal as a performance @-@ based trade ; Booth had registered one assist over the first six games of the season and had a team @-@ worst – 6 plus @-@ minus rating while being demoted to the third line . Booth was saddened and admittedly surprised at the trade . Booth had also been reportedly sought after by Vancouver for six months prior ; the team conferred with alternate captain Ryan Kesler regarding Booth 's character on and off the ice ( the two grew up playing minor and junior hockey together ) . Joining Vancouver , he switched his jersey number from 10 to 7 , in honour of his younger sister , Rachael , who also wears the number as a hockey player . 
 Playing on the second line with countrymen Ryan Kesler and Christopher Higgins , the scoring unit was immediately nicknamed the " American Express " line . The unit has been occasionally shuffled , however , with Cody Hodgson replacing Higgins in some instances . Booth scored his first goal as a Canuck 15 days after the trade , opening the scoring in a 6 – 2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks . The following month , Booth suffered a right medial collateral ligament ( MCL ) injury after a knee @-@ on @-@ knee hit from Colorado Avalanche forward Kevin Porter during a game on December 6 , 2011 . Porter received a five @-@ minute major and game misconduct for the play , while a subsequent hearing with NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan resulted in a four @-@ game suspension . Booth was sidelined for 18 games over six weeks with the injury , returning in mid @-@ January 2012 . 
 Booth finished the regular season with 16 goals and 30 points over 62 games . Having never qualified for the playoffs with the Panthers previously in his career , Booth made his post @-@ season debut in 2012 . Playing against the Los Angeles Kings , he recorded one assist over five games as the first @-@ seeded Canucks were eliminated in the first round . Booth told reporters prior to the playoffs that he was struggling with his diminished role with the Canucks , in comparison to his time with the Panthers , alluding to his ice time . The previous year , he was averaging nearly 19 minutes per game , which dropped to 15 minutes as a Canuck . 
 On June 17 , 2014 , the Canucks placed Booth on unconditional waivers , and the following day after he cleared waivers the Canucks used their final compliance buyouts on him and Booth became an unrestricted free agent .

 On July 22 , 2014 , the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Booth to a one @-@ year contract worth $ 1 @.@ 1 million . He scored the only shootout goal in the first preseason game on September 22 , 2014 , which led the Toronto Maple Leafs to victory . 
 On November 21 , 2014 , Booth was sent down to the Toronto Marlies of the AHL for a conditioning stint . He would finish with one goal in his two @-@ game tour with the Marlies . On November 29 , Booth played his first game as a Maple Leaf in a 6 – 2 win over the Washington Capitals . Booth recorded no points but enjoyed his first game in Toronto . However , Booth would record his first point as a Leaf three games later , an assist on a goal scored by line @-@ mate Richard <unk> in a 5 – 2 victory over his former team , the Canucks . His first goal as a Maple Leaf would come on December 16 , where he scored the game winner in a 6 – 2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks . 
 Booth would finish the season with 13 points ( 7 goals , 6 assists ) in 59 games .

 During his tenure with the United States National Team Development Program , Booth competed at the 2002 IIHF World U18 Championship , held in Trnava and Piešťany , Slovakia . Playing Russia in the last game of the final round , Booth scored the United States ' first two goals of the game . A win against Russia placed the United States in a tie for the gold medal with four wins and one tie each . In order to beat Russia on the goal @-@ differential tiebreaker , they needed to win the contest by two goals . Leading 2 – 1 with a minute remaining , the United States pulled their goalie and Zach Parise scored with 30 seconds left to capture the gold medal . Booth was named MVP of the gold medal game . Booth finished the tournament with two goals and two assists over eight games . 
 Two years later ( now a member of the Michigan State Spartans ) , Booth moved on to the under @-@ 20 level , competing at the 2004 IIHF World Junior Championships , held in Helsinki and <unk> , Finland . He recorded his lone assist of the tournament on Dan Fritsche 's game @-@ winning goal in the semifinal against Finland . Booth and the United States went on to win the gold medal with a 4 – 3 win over Canada in the final . With a goal and an assist over six games , Booth tied for 12th in team point @-@ scoring . In a 2011 interview for <unk> , Booth recalled his IIHF U18 and U20 gold medals as his first- and second @-@ best hockey memories , respectively .

 Dr. Helen Magnus is the series protagonist and central character of the Canadian fantasy @-@ science fiction television series Sanctuary . She is portrayed by Amanda Tapping . In the series , Magnus is a life scientist from Victorian era England , who currently runs the global Sanctuary Network , an organization tasked with finding a series of creatures called " abnormals " , and later bring them to a Sanctuary base for refuge to protect them from the human population . The character is over two and a half centuries old , having been given her advanced longevity by injecting herself with vampire blood , as well as reliving the 20th century from time travel . After traveling back in time , Magnus had to avoid people so she isolated herself . In the season 4 finale " Sanctuary For None : Part 2 " It was revealed that Magnus spent the 113 years creating a new Sanctuary . 
 Tapping was offered a part in the original web series by series creator Damian Kindler and director Martin Wood . It became the actress ' first regular role since playing Samantha Carter on Stargate SG @-@ 1 and Stargate Atlantis for eleven years . She initially had difficulty playing Magnus as her personality greatly differed from Carter . She also dyed her hair darker and spoke with an English accent throughout the run , as she herself was born in England . In addition , Tapping serves as the series executive producer and on some occasions , director . 
 Magnus and Tapping 's portrayal of the character received generally mixed reactions from critics , with the negative comments pointing toward 's Tapping 's accent . However , Tapping was nominated for four awards , one Gemini Award and three Leo Awards , for her role as Helen Magnus , winning a Leo Award for " Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series " in 2009 for the episode " Requiem " .

 Helen Magnus was born on August 27 , 1850 to Gregory Magnus ( Jim Byrnes ) and Patricia <unk> . Her father was regarded as a controversial medical researcher of his time , and exposed his daughter to his profession when she was a child . Years later , she helped form a secret group known as " the Five " , along with John Druitt ( Christopher Heyerdahl ) , Nikola Tesla ( Jonathon Young ) , James Watson ( Peter Wingfield ) and Nigel Griffin ( Vincent Gale ) at Oxford University . Each member voluntarily injected themselves with pure vampire blood , a species that had become extinct centuries before . This granted each member unique abilities . Magnus ' ability was longevity , allowing her to live several times longer than any normal human . At this point she entered a relationship with Druitt , whose ability is personal teleportation . However , he became insane and murdered several prostitutes , thereby becoming Jack the Ripper . They did conceive a child , Magnus later took the embryo and froze it . 
 By the turn of the 20th century , her research with the abnormal population went into full swing , and she founded the Sanctuary Network . To get the funding she needed , the Prime Minister reunited the Five to stop and kill Adam Worth ( Ian Tracey ) , who was turned down as a sixth member and blamed the Five for the death of his daughter , from releasing a toxin in London . In the season two episode " Next Tuesday " , Magnus states she was a passenger on the RMS Titanic in 1912 . In July 1944 , she worked with the French Resistance in Normandy to prevent the Nazis from controlling a fire elemental before D @-@ Day . She then charged the head Sanctuary in Old City , a fictional city in the Pacific Northwest , during which she decided to use the embryo to bear her daughter , Ashley ( Emilie Ullerup ) . On one of her expeditions , she saved a young Will Zimmerman from a dangerous abnormal , but failed to capture it before it killed his mother . 
 = = = Season one = = = 
 In the first season of the show , Magnus appoints an adult Will ( Robin Dunne ) , a forensic psychiatrist who worked for the Old City Police Department , to become her new protégé , which he eventually accepts . Druitt returns to the Sanctuary to ask Magnus to cure him from an unknown affliction ; Magnus tricks him into injecting poison , though Druitt escapes . Later , in " The Five " , it would be revealed Druitt survived , and Tesla was able to suppress his insanity . In " Fata Morgana " , she becomes aware of an underground organization known as the Cabal , who plot to control all abnormals for their own gain , and in several episodes throughout the first season , will become her and her organization 's primary focus . In " Requiem " , Magnus becomes exposed to an aggressive parasite in the Bermuda Triangle when going with Will to see a group of mermaids who massacred each other because of the same parasite . To stop Magnus from killing Will and herself , Will locks her in a cabin in the submarine , and drains all the oxygen , killing her . She is later revived after Will captures the escaping parasite . In the two @-@ part season finale " Revelations " , the Cabal launch a bioweapon called " Lazarus " , which causes any exposed abnormal to attack humans . To combat this , Magnus regroups the Five to <unk> , a lost city , to recover the source blood ( vampire blood ) . However , by the end Magnus is distressed to learn that the Cabal have turned Ashley against her and the team and steals the blood sample . 
 = = = Season two = = = 
 The second season begins six weeks after the end of the first , where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley , whom the Cabal transformed to a vampire @-@ hybrid <unk> , one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network . When the <unk> arrive at the Old City Sanctuary , Magnus is able to get through to Ashley , who recognises her in time to save her from another <unk> , and then teleports . Because an electromagnetic field is active , it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized . Despite this , Magnus believes Ashley 's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field 's buffer . When it does not , she is forced to accept that Ashley has died . Because of her death , and other loved ones because of her longevity , she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again . She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras , but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie @-@ like creatures . After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir 's release by an incorporeal guardian , she decides to leave it behind . 
 Later on in the season , her leadership of the Sanctuary Network would be called into question by the other heads of house . In " Veritas " , she sets up an elaborate scheme to apprehend a telepath named Emma ( Erica Cerra ) , whom she suspects of working against the Network . In the scheme , Magnus forges a mental illness and fakes the murder of her butler , Bigfoot ( Heyerdahl ) , and makes Emma believe she kept alive Big Bertha , the most dangerous abnormal on Earth , which Magnus was thought to have killed . However , it is revealed in the season finale " Kali " , Magnus did indeed keep her alive in secrecy , but sedated , as she believes that killing Bertha would jeopardize the planet . When Big Bertha is being controlled by Edward Forsythe , Magnus attempts to sedate Big Bertha again , but by then , Terrence Wexford ( Paul McGillion ) overrides her authority and assumes control of the network . His attempt to kill Bertha only succeeds in angering her , and she launches a tsunami . 
 = = = Season three = = = 
 The third season begins with Magnus forcing Wexford to step down as head of the Sanctuary Network , thereby putting herself back in command , while the rest of the team deal with the tsunami . Though they are not happy that Big Bertha is still alive , the other Sanctuary house heads decide to keep Magnus in charge , while also firing Wexford for breaking several protocols . She learns from Will that when he talked to Kali , the avatar manifestation of Big Bertha , into stopping the tsunami , he saw her father , who left her clues leading to a map leading to Hollow Earth , thought to be the home of every abnormal species on the planet . In " Breach " Magnus learns Adam Worth is still alive , and he also intends to find Hollow Earth , having been there before and resurrected . After finding an entrance to Hollow Earth in Tibet , she and the team venture to the underground city of Praxis , where leader Ranna ( Polly Walker ) executes her and her team for trespassing . However , they are later resurrected as she wants their help in saving the city , which is facing destruction because a <unk> abnormal is not controlling the city 's geothermal energy . After saving it , Magnus and her team and Ranna part in good terms . It is also revealed Worth also came to the city to steal a power source with unlimited capabilities . Though it was assumed Druitt killed him before he could leave with it , it is later revealed in the season finale that Druitt kept him alive and that he is using the power source to create a time machine and cure his daughter 's leukemia , which could cause untold consequences on the planet . His first failed attempt causes the destruction of Praxis , and a time dilation bubble in Carentan , France . Magnus fails to stop him from succeeding , but does follow him through a time portal to London in 1898 .

 Magnus pursues Worth throughout London to stop him from curing his daughter Imogene , who is meant to die in the timeline . During the pursuit she tries to avoid her past self , but fails to stop encountering Watson , who quickly discovers she is from his future , but he promises to keep quiet for the sake of preserving the timeline . When Worth chases Magnus later he accidentally kills Imogene , restoring the timeline . After killing Worth , Magnus ends up in hiding for the next 113 years before she can resurface to help Will dealing with a mass of <unk> invading the surface . In the season finale , it is revealed that Helen had been secretly working with several important figures of the 20th Century , including Albert Einstein and Buckminster Fuller amongst others , and had built a new underground Sanctuary . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 The Syfy website describes Magnus as " beautiful and enigmatic " who has " devoted her life to the practical research of cutting edge medicine and science " . Her work is to explore the world of abnormals . While the rest of the world dismiss them as monstrous figments of their imaginations and elements of childhood nightmares , Magnus realizes that they are the world 's triumphs and mistakes . Magnus hence becomes their protector , but in some cases , their captor . She is also described as " bold and straightforward , brave and no @-@ nonsense , yet she remains proudly true to her formal Victorian English sensibilities " . Portraying actress Amanda Tapping described Magnus as a " crazy character " who is " very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic " . 
 Magnus " adores her daughter Ashley , respecting her independence and self @-@ reliance – but that doesn 't preclude some occasional mother @-@ daughter friction " . Tapping has said that there is a " huge amount of respect " between the two characters , adding " Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason . And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can 't . " Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother 's longevity , and Magnus would outlive her daughter . In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé . When asked what Magnus thinks of Will , Tapping stated " I think Helen finds him fascinating . He 's so idealistic , she sees in him all the qualities that she admires , but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time . His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things ... she absolutely respects that , but I think she also realises that there 's going to come a time when he 's going to become a bit jaded ... There are a couple of episodes where there 's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them ... but generally there 's just a huge healthy respect . " During a Blastr interview in 2011 , Tapping further explains Magnus ' relationship with Will ; " I love how this relationship has developed . [ ... ] " It 's been a really organic transformation of Will 's character and Magnus . To actually bring somebody on board who , initially , it 's all about teaching him the ropes . And then as the seasons have gone on he 's come into his own . He 's come into his own as a scientist . He 's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary . " Dunne meanwhile stated " there 's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters . And really , they 're two people that depend on each other for survival . And therefore , that 's where the respect comes out of . " 
 = = Conceptual history = = 
 Series creator Damian Kindler conceived the idea of Sanctuary in 2001 , many of his ideas were included in the final product , one of them being the English scientist Helen Magnus . A few years later , Kindler asked Martin Wood if there was a potential for a series . When Wood believed it would be , they both decided to approach Amanda Tapping to participate in the project , and she accepted . Kindler believed that casting Tapping was a " nice fit " to the character because the actress was born in England . Tapping , who played the regular character Samantha Carter in Stargate SG @-@ 1 and sister show Stargate Atlantis , did not know the future of her role in the show when she was approached to appear on Sanctuary in 2006 . When the webseries started shooting in January 2007 , it did not conflict with her commitments on Stargate . After the fourth season of Atlantis , Tapping was offered to return to the fifth season and she accepted . When Sanctuary was picked up to a television series , Tapping decided to turn down the Atlantis contract , having been encouraged by her husband to move on after playing Carter for eleven years . She went through a " weird disconnect " playing Magnus since " Sam Carter was so much a part of me " . However , she was able to embrace playing a new character " pretty quickly " . 
 Nevertheless , Tapping found it a challenge to play a different character , as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view ; " after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual , more mysterious being . She has a much darker edge to her and it was sort of finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long , and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will . " Whilst filming the webisodes , Tapping wore a dark @-@ haired wig , but when the television series was being shot , she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig . Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series . Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge , as her character came from the Victorian era , which is a " very specific way of speaking . She clings to that eccentricity a bit , to that Britishness . " The actress listened to several different voices , as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world . 
 Sanctuary was mostly filmed on virtual green screen sets . Initially Tapping went through what she called " chroma key green headaches " because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls for the first few days . When she got used to it , she likened filming on green screen to working in theatre . In the second season her daughter , Ashley was killed off . The producers , as well as the American and Canadian networks to give the character , including Magnus , a deep and most dramatic impact . They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season , especially in the first three episodes . After playing Magnus in the series ' third season , Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because " there 's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can 't wrap my head around , and to me that 's fascinating as an actor , to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing . " In the episode " Normandy " , Tapping wore a red @-@ haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War , as an homage to her late grandmother . For the fourth season , Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest . The request was granted in the form of a female virologist appearing early in the season ( thus establishing Magnus 's bisexuality ) . 
 In addition to being an actor , Tapping was also an executive producer on the series . However , she did not get paid extra as that salary would go towards financing the show , which was not backed up by a studio . She also served as a director on certain days if other directors were unavailable , or called in sick . In the second season , she was allowed to direct " Veritas " , the seventh episode .

 According to Mark Wilson of About.com , Amanda Tapping was enthusiastic about creating a radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG @-@ 1 and Stargate Atlantis , and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible . Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who 's experienced a century and a half of isolation , strangeness , and relentless compassion . Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping 's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter . Magnus is also described as a " non @-@ glib , female Jack Harkness ; " Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood . Hilary Rothing of UGO said that " Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent , alluring and has one of those tasty British accents – Victorian era to be exact . That 's because she 's a 157 years old . But seriously , she doesn 't look a day over 35 . " She also added that Tapping is " right at home " taking the lead for the show . Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was " typical for an English character in an American TV show , with a liking for tea and a cut @-@ glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent " . Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad 's " Ten Most mysterious characters on television " . 
 Magnus 's English accent was not well received by some critics . She was listed ninth in io9 's " Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks ( And Canucks ) Of Science Fiction " , with Meredith Woerner stating " I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show , especially since the monsters look amazing – but I 'm worried Tapping 's dreadful accent will get in the way . It sounds completely forced in all the clips I 've seen so far , but I 'll guess I 'll have to wait until October 3 to make my full assessment . " Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an " iffy accent , " but added she would be of interest by fans of Tapping 's previous works , notably Stargate . Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette called Tapping 's English accent " unremarkable " , whilst calling the show an " unremarkable series . "

 Over the course of the series , Tapping 's portrayal of Magnus resulted in several award nominations . Tapping was nominated for a 2009 Gemini Award for " Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role , " for her role in " Requiem " , but lost out to Being Erica 's Erin <unk> In the same year , Tapping won the similar " Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series " Leo Award for the same episode . She was nominated for the same category again in 2010 for " Pavor Nocturnus " , and in 2011 for " Breach " , but lost out to Erin <unk> and Blackstone 's Carmen Moore , respectively .

The Sanctuary , which was designed by <unk> Associates L.L.C. , <unk> Landscape and Design , and Environmental Resolutions Inc . , was opened with a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony on May 22 , 2013 , marking the completion of the school . It features a small amphitheater , a rain garden , a functioning waterfall , a fountain , decorative brick paved walkways , patios , and over 100 different species of all @-@ season shrubs and grasses . The Sanctuary provides e a point of relaxation to students and residents , and has been referred to by students and the press alike as a " tranquil oasis stylishly [ that ] contrasts with the urban surrounding . " In addition to its rural features , which provides research opportunities for the school 's environmental sciences classes and its horticultural and environment clubs , the Sanctuary also features technological conveniences such as free Wi @-@ Fi to allows students and staff to use their equipment outside , and in @-@ ground speakers that allow the amphitheater to host performances and other events .

 The school was the 301st @-@ ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine 's September 2014 cover story on the state 's " Top Public High Schools " , using a new ranking methodology . The school had been ranked <unk> in the state of 328 schools in 2012 . The magazine ranked the two predecessor schools 271st ( Emerson ) and 285th ( Union Hill ) out of 322 public high schools statewide , in the magazine 's September 2010 cover story on the state 's " Top Public High Schools " , after being ranked 288th ( Emerson ) and 233rd ( Union Hill ) in 2008 out of 316 public high schools statewide . 
 University of California , Berkeley Professor David L. Kirp , in his 2011 book , Kids First , and his 2013 book , Improbable Scholars , praised Union City 's education system for bringing poor , mostly immigrant children ( three quarters of whom live in homes where only Spanish is spoken and a quarter of which are thought to be undocumented and fearful of deportation ) into the educational mainstream . Kirp , who spent a year in Union City examining its schools , notes that while in the late 1970s , Union City schools faced the threat of state takeover , as of 2013 they boast achievement scores that approximate the statewide average . Kirp also observes that in 2011 , Union City boasted a high school graduation rate of 89 @.@ 5 percent — roughly 10 percentage points higher than the national average , and that in 2012 , 75 percent of Union City graduates enrolled in college , with top students winning scholarships to the Ivy League . Kirp attributes Union City 's success to among other things , the positive educational atmosphere of Union City High School generated by educators such as principal John <unk> . Deborah Short of the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington DC singled out the school 's initiatives , saying that the Union City High School " has created a culture that respects differences and promotes learning . The school expects its students to do well and it gives them lots of support . "

 The 360 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 33 @,@ 000 m2 ) school houses 66 classrooms equipped with Mac computers , automatic lights , SMART Boards and Wi @-@ Fi to enable students to use laptop computers in their studies . 
 The arts are served by two art class rooms devoted to painting , sculpture and pottery , sewing machine @-@ equipped rooms for fashion classes , television production facilities , and three music classrooms , each of which is equipped with grand pianos . Dancers have two separate rooms with floor to ceiling mirrors and ballet bars . The school 's cafeteria is located on the second floor and is equipped with several walk @-@ in freezers and a half @-@ dozen pizza ovens . The school 's restrooms utilize automated no @-@ touch sinks . 
 The school 's " world @-@ class " gym includes bleachers that seat 1 @,@ 800 people , and a weight room accessible directly from the gym . Elsewhere on the first floor is an aerobics room that houses cardio exercise machines . 
 A centrally located Media Center is located on the first floor and includes dozens of Mac computers . Although it was initially suggested to name the room after Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning poet and United States Poet Laureate W.S. Merwin , who grew up in Union City , it was eventually named after former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey . It is located next to the outdoor Senior Courtyard . An American flag that stands in that courtyard , when raised , overlooks the athletic field . The Media Center is also used for community functions , such as an April 2011 book signing by Professor David L. Kirp . 
 The school 's centerpiece is its three @-@ acre athletic field , called the Eagle 's Nest , located on the second floor roof , an idea that inspired from a field that lies on top of a parking garage on the campus of Georgetown University . The field features skyline views of the Empire State Building and Midtown Manhattan . The architecture of the athletic complex , which cost $ 15 million , was designed to resemble the former Roosevelt Stadium , which previously occupied the site . A number of classrooms on the third and fourth floors overlook the field , which rests on two floors of steel and reinforced concrete . The field 's bleachers seat 2 @,@ 100 spectators . The field 's on @-@ campus location eliminates not only the students ' prior need to walk or be bussed from school to a separate location to play , but the need for the two prior schools to share the field . Although the merger of the former Union Hill Hillers and Emerson Bulldogs had experienced some difficulties a year prior when the students were still housed at separate high schools ( called Union City High School 's North and South campuses , respectively ) , the merge had been ameliorated by the move of the unified student body to the single new school . The athletic facility has been singled out as one of the most unusual in the United States . It was included in MaxPreps ' 2012 list of " 10 more high school football stadiums to see before you die " . Due to the athletic field 's unique location , it deals with unusual logistical challenges , such as balls that land on the streets surrounding the school ; space limitations that place the band close to the visitors ' sideline , thus making it sometimes difficult to hear ; and games that are interrupted by school fire drills . 
 The school 's 910 @-@ seat auditorium also serves as the Union City Performing Arts Center . The Center opened on October 16 , 2009 with a celebration that featured an art gallery of over 160 paintings , as well as performances by a number of musicians , poets and dancers . Included in the performances were a guitar solo by Francisco " Pancho " Navarro , who appeared in 2002 Salma Hayek film Frida , a dance performance by Tap Ole Dance Company that was choreographed by Megan Fernandez , who had appeared on the reality television program America 's Got Talent , and a poetry reading by Graciela Barreto , who had been named poet laureate of Union City in September . Drama classes are aided with a separate black box theater for small productions , which doubles as a community conference center . Public events used by the auditorium including the 2010 swearing @-@ in ceremony for Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack , and the Union City International Film Festival , the first one of which was held in December 2010 . The school 's athletic field and auditorium are made available to local residents in order to utilize the school as a community center for the city . 
 The federally funded , social services nonprofit group , North Hudson Community Action Corporation 's ( NHCAC ) pediatric health center , which is housed in the building , opened in early July 2010 , in order to allow the corporation 's facilities on 31st Street to expand its women 's health and internal medicine capacity . The center was opened in July so that the patient flow could be monitored when students were not in school , in order to determine how to integrate the center 's operations with the school 's , educate students on managing their health , and allow them to utilize its services in order to decrease health @-@ related absenteeism , once the school session resumed . Union City Superintendent of Schools Stanley Sanger indicated that eventually , health screenings would be provided to all Union City students . NHCAC runs a health screening facility six days a week by two doctors . The facility has a separate entrance / exit from the street , and is closed off to the rest of the school . The state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art 2 @,@ 286 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 212 @.@ 4 m2 ) full pediatric facility includes four private examination rooms and an on @-@ site laboratory . It is open to low @-@ income Hudson County families and sees approximately 20 @-@ 25 patients 18 and under daily , charging sliding @-@ scale fees for its services , though NHCAC President and city commissioner Christopher Irizarry expressed hopes to eventually increase that capacity to 50 patients a day . It is the third of NHCAC 's ten such facilities in North Hudson , New Jersey to implement electronic health record @-@ keeping , which allows patients to schedule appointments online , see doctors more quickly and facilitate quicker lab results and filling of prescriptions at pharmacies . 
 The staff 's parking garage , built a block south of the school , also serves nearby residents and business .

 = Tropical Storm Cristobal ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Cristobal was the third named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . It formed on July 19 from a trough of low pressure off the Southeast U.S. Coast . In a marginally favorable environment , it attained minimal tropical storm status later that day . The storm remained offshore , and peaked as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras . It accelerated northeast parallel to the East Coast and became extratropical on July 23 near Nova Scotia . Because it was a weak storm and never made landfall , Cristobal 's effects were mostly limited to moderate rainfall . The storm dropped 3 @.@ 43 in ( 87 mm ) of rain in Wilmington , North Carolina , where minor flooding was reported . Additionally , the extratropical remnants contributed to rainfall on Nova Scotia which caused some street and basement flooding . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On July 14 , 2008 a weakening surface trough extended across northern Florida , producing thunderstorms across the state . A weak low pressure area developed on July 15 near Tallahassee , which moved southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico . Late on July 16 it crossed onshore near Tampa , and development was not anticipated due to land interaction . Late on July 17 , however , convection increased in association with the low , and the system quickly became better organized . Late on July 18 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) remarked that a tropical depression was developing , with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation ; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 ( 0300 UTC July 19 ) , it was classified as Tropical Depression Three , about 65 miles ( 105 km ) southeast of Charleston , South Carolina . 
 Located between a ridge to its southeast and northwest , the depression moved slowly northeastward , and with a marginally favorable upper @-@ level environment , it attained minimal tropical storm status during the early afternoon of July 19 . Initially fairly disorganized with little deep convection , dry air in the mid- to @-@ upper @-@ levels of the atmosphere prevented immediate intensification . However , late on July 20 thunderstorm activity increased . Cristobal remained a fairly weak tropical storm as it tracked adjacent to the Carolina coast , and the storm never made landfall . It reached peak intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras , and remained such over the warm Gulf Stream waters as convection became strong over the southern portion of the circulation . Beginning to enter cooler waters , the cyclone accelerated east @-@ northeastward on July 21 and July 22 . On the afternoon of July 22 , Cristobal began to weaken south of Nova Scotia . In the evening hours , satellite imagery indicated that the mid @-@ level center became separated from the low @-@ level center . The storm 's cloud pattern became disorganized , and by July 23 it had completed an extratropical transition . The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5 : 00 am EDT ( 0900 UTC ) on July 23 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In anticipation of Tropical Storm Cristobal , a tropical storm warning was issued for coastal areas from the South Santee River in South Carolina to the North Carolina – Virginia Border . The advisory was discontinued on July 20 as Cristobal pulled away from land . Flood advisories were declared for parts of North Carolina . National Weather Service forecasters advised against swimming due to high seas and potential rip currents . Environment Canada issued rain warnings throughout portions of Nova Scotia . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Prior to forming , the precursor low dropped light to moderate rainfall across the state of Florida . In Lake Wales , 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of precipitation was reported , most of which fell within the period of two hours . The sudden , heavy rainfall clogged storm drains , causing some street flooding . Up to 40 cars were pulled from flooded streets , some being submerged with 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) of water . Damages from the flooding was estimated at $ 10 @,@ 000 . In Georgia , the storm produced 3 @.@ 48 inches ( 88 mm ) of rain , while in South Carolina , 2 @.@ 60 inches ( 66 mm ) was recorded . 
 On July 20 , Cristobal skirted eastern North Carolina , resulting in minimal damage . Along the coast , water levels rose 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) above normal ; rough surf was also reported . Rainfall averaged 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 13 to 38 mm ) , though the NEXRAD weather radar estimates indicated that isolated amounts exceeded 4 inches ( 100 mm ) . The storm dropped 3 @.@ 43 in ( 87 mm ) in Wilmington , North Carolina , where minor flooding occurred . Because the bulk of the storm remained over open waters , winds along the coast ran about 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) . 
 While the center of Cristobal was more than a day away from the Canadian Maritimes , moisture extended ahead of the cyclone and became enhanced by a stalled frontal system . As a result , heavy rainfall fell along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia . At <unk> Point , 224 mm ( 8 @.@ 8 in ) of rain was reported , while 145 mm ( 5 @.@ 8 in ) fell at Sambro , near Halifax . The rain flooded basements and streets in the Cape Sable area . A sailor from Connecticut was rescued 250 km ( 160 mi ) to the southeast of Halifax when his ship capsized in stormy seas . The highest winds remained offshore , though a buoy recorded gusts to 58 miles per hour ( 93 km / h ) . 
 = Prime Minister of Vietnam = 
 The Prime Minister of Vietnam ( Vietnamese : Thủ tướng Việt Nam ) , officially styled Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic ( Vietnamese : Thủ tướng Chính phủ nước Cộng <unk> <unk> hội <unk> <unk> ) , is the head of government of Vietnam and presides over the meetings of the Central Government ( formerly the Council of Ministers ) . The prime minister directs the work of government members , and may propose deputy prime ministers to the National Assembly . 
 The head of government is responsible to the National Assembly and serves as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security . The tenure of a prime minister is five years , and the term is renewable once . The current prime minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has served since 2016 . In case of incapacity , a deputy prime minister assumes the office of acting prime minister until the prime minister resumes duty , or until the appointment of a new prime minister . 
 The powers and prestige of the prime minister have varied through the years . Pham Van Dong , Vietnam 's second prime minister , often lamented that in practice he had little power . Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988 , the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the order of precedence of the Communist Party 's Politburo , the highest decision @-@ making body in Vietnam . 
 = = History = = 
 Ho Chi Minh , who also served as the country 's President , was appointed Vietnam 's first prime minister in 1946 by the National Assembly , after having served months as Acting Chairman of the Provisional Government and foreign minister in the aftermath of the 1945 August Revolution . Both the 1946 and 1959 Constitutions state that the National Assembly had the power to appoint and relieve the prime minister of his duties . The prime minister presided over the Council of Ministers , the highest executive body of state , from 1981 until it was renamed to Government in the 1992 constitution . The office of prime minister was renamed in the 1980 constitution to that of Chairman of the Council of Ministers . 
 Pham Van Dong , the second Prime Minister of Vietnam , served as North Vietnamese Prime Minister from 1955 until 1976 , when he became prime minister of a unified Vietnam , and then until 1987 , when he resigned . At his resignation , he was the longest @-@ serving prime minister in Vietnamese history , and the oldest serving prime minister in the world . He often lamented that he was one of the world 's weakest prime ministers , on one occasion saying ; " I can do nothing . When I say something , nobody listens . If I propose changing a deputy minister , it turns out to be impossible . I cannot even choose my own ministers . " Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988 , the prime minister has been ranked Number 3 in the order of precedence of the Communist Party 's Politburo . 
 = = Duties , powers and responsibilities = = 
 The National Assembly by a proposal of the President of Vietnam elects the prime minister . The prime minister is responsible to the National Assembly , and the Assembly elects all ministers to government . Activity reports by the prime minister must be given to the National Assembly , while the Standing Committee of the National Assembly supervises the activities of the Central Government and the prime minister . Finally , the deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the prime minister and other members of government . 
 The prime minister is the only member of government who must be a member of the National Assembly . This is because the prime minister is accountable to the National Assembly , and he reports to it , or to its Standing Committee , and to the president . The prime minister issues directives and supervises the implementation of formal orders given by the president , the National Assembly or the Standing Committee . Cabinet members and members of the Central Government in general are responsible to the prime minister and the National Assembly for the fields they specialise in . According to the Constitution of Vietnam , the following are the duties , powers and responsibilities of the prime minister : 
 To head the Central Government , and direct the works of members of the Central Government , the People 's Councils at all levels and to chair the meetings of the Cabinet ; 
 To propose to the National Assembly that ministries , or organs with ministerial rank , be established or dissolved ; to present to the National Assembly or , when the latter is not in session , to its Standing Committee , for approval , proposals on the appointment , release from duty , or dismissal of deputy prime ministers , cabinet ministers and other members of the Government ; 
 To appoint , release from duty , or dismiss deputy ministers and officials of equal rank ; to approve the election , release from duty , secondment and dismissal of chairmen and deputy chairmen of People 's Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule ; 
 To suspend or annul decisions , directives and circulars of cabinet ministers and other Government members , decisions and directives of People 's Councils and chairmen of People 's Committees of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution , the law , or other formal written documents of superior State organs ; 
 To suspend the execution of resolutions of People 's Councils of provinces and cities under direct central rule that contravene the Constitution , the law , or the formal written orders of superior State organs ; at the same time to propose to the Standing Committee of the National Assembly to annul them ; 
 To make regular reports to the people through the mass media on major issues to be settled by the Government . 
 When the prime minister is absent , he must choose one of his deputy prime ministers to direct the work of the government . 
 The prime minister serves concurrently as the secretary of the CPV Government Caucus Commission . The National Assembly chairman serves as the commission 's deputy . Currently there are ten members of the Commission , all of whom hold government posts . Commission members are appointed by the Politburo , and the Commission itself is responsible to the Politburo and the Secretariat . The decision @-@ making process within the Commission is based on the principles of collective leadership .

 = Queen Maud Land = 
 Queen Maud Land ( Norwegian : Dronning Maud Land ) is a c . 2 @.@ 7 million @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 1 million sq mi ) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway . The territory lies between 20 ° west and 45 ° east , between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east . On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land 's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12 , 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area . Positioned in East Antarctica , the territory comprises about one @-@ fifth of the total area of Antarctica . The claim is named after Queen Maud of Norway ( 1869 – 1938 ) . 
 Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser @-@ Larsen was the first person known to have set foot in the territory , in 1930 . On 14 January 1939 , the territory was claimed by Norway . From 1939 until 1945 , Nazi Germany claimed New Swabia , which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land . On 23 June 1961 , Queen Maud Land became part of the Antarctic Treaty System , making it a demilitarised zone . It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway , the other being Peter I Island . They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo . 
 Most of the territory is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet , and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast . In some areas further within the ice sheet , mountain ranges breach through the ice , allowing for birds to breed and the growth of a limited flora . The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast , Princess Astrid Coast , Princess Ragnhild Coast , Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast . The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea . 
 There is no permanent population , although there are 12 active research stations housing a maximum average of 40 scientists , the numbers fluctuating depending on the season . Six are occupied year @-@ round , while the remainder are seasonal summer stations . The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights , corresponding with Cape Town , South Africa , are Troll Airfield , near the Norwegian Troll research station , and a runway at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Queen Maud Land extends from the boundary with Coats Land in the west to the boundary with Enderby Land in the east , and is divided into the Princess Martha Coast , Princess Astrid Coast , Princess Ragnhild Coast , Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast . The territory is estimated to cover around 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . The limits of the claim , put forth in 1939 , did not fix the northern and southern limits other than as ' … the mainland beach in Antarctica … with the land that lies beyond this beach and the sea beyond … ' . The sea that extends off the coast between the <unk> limits of Queen Maud Land is generally called King Haakon VII Sea . 
 There is no ice @-@ free land at the coast ; the coast consists of a 20 @-@ to @-@ 30 @-@ metre high ( 70 to 100 ft ) wall of ice throughout almost the entire territory . It is thus only possible to disembark from a ship in a few places . Some 150 to 200 kilometres ( 90 to 120 mi ) from the coast , rocky peaks pierce the ice cap , itself at a mean height of around 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) above sea level , with the highest point at <unk> ( 3 @,@ 148 metres or 10 @,@ 328 feet ) in the <unk> @-@ Hofmann Mountains . The other major mountain ranges are the <unk> Range , <unk> Mountains , <unk> Mountains and Sør <unk> Mountains . 
 Geologically , the ground of Queen Maud Land is dominated by Precambrian gneiss , formed c . 1 to 1 @.@ 2 Ga , before the creation of the supercontinent Gondwana . The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks , formed c . 500 to 600 Ma in the Pan @-@ African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana . In the farthest western parts of the territory , there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks . Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice , the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland , with deep fjords and islands .

 = = = Early activity = = = 
 Queen Maud Land was the first part of Antarctica to be sighted , on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen . It was however among the last to be explored , as it required aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration . Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on whaling and sealing expeditions funded by ship owners , particularly by Christen Christensen and his son Lars . The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892 – 93 and 1893 – 94 . While they were primarily sent for exploring , sealing , and whaling possibilities , they also performed scientific research . Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into the first decades of the 20th century . 
 The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau when his expedition was the first to reach South Pole on 14 December 1911 . It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole , including all the land above latitude 85 ° S. However , roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau , which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim . Amundsen 's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government . 
 The name Queen Maud Land was initially applied in January 1930 to the land between 37 ° E and 49 ° <unk> discovered by Hjalmar Riiser @-@ Larsen and Finn Lützow @-@ Holm during Lars Christensen 's Norvegia expedition of 1929 – 30 . It was named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales , wife of the then @-@ reigning King Haakon VII . The territory was explored further during the Norvegia expedition of 1930 – 31 . During this whaling season , a total of 265 whaling ships , mostly Norwegian , worked off the coast of Queen Maud Land . In the same season , Riiser @-@ Larsen discovered the Prince Olav Coast , Princess Martha Coast and Princess Ragnhild Coast from the air . Captain H. Halvorsen of the whaler Sevilla discovered the Princess Astrid Coast independently at the same time . Six years later , during Christensen 's expedition of 1936 – 37 , Viggo Widerøe flew over and discovered the Prince Harald Coast . Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20 ° W. 
 Norway 's claim was disputed by Germany , which in 1938 dispatched the German Antarctic Expedition , led by Alfred Ritscher , to fly over as much of it as possible . The ship <unk> reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939 . During the expedition , an area of about 350 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 140 @,@ 000 sq mi ) was photographed from the air by Ritscher , who dropped darts inscribed with swastikas every 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) . Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name New Swabia , but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the Second World War . 
 On 14 January 1939 , five days prior to the German arrival , Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway , after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the Falkland Islands Dependencies in the west and the Australian Antarctic Dependency in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty . The primary bases for the annexation were the Norwegian explorations and the need to secure the Norwegian whaling industry 's access to the region . Scientific operations were also a basis , with Norwegian contributions to international polar science extending back to the late 19th century . Norway was in addition forced to contend with competing claims made by the United Kingdom and other countries in the years prior to the Norwegian claim , including the new threat of German claims in Queen Maud Land . The Norwegian claim was sometimes referred to as the " Bouvet sector " , drawing from the previously annexed Bouvet Island . During 1946 and 1947 , vast areas of Queen Maud Land were photographed during the Richard Evelyn Byrd expedition . In 1948 , Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to longitudes from 20 ° W to 45 ° E , and that the Bruce Coast and Coats Land were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory .

 The Norwegian – British – Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949 – 52 was the first international scientific expedition in Antarctica . The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called <unk> at 71 ° S , 11 ° W , and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land . During the International Geophysical Year ( 1957 – 1958 ) , year @-@ round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway , the Soviet Union , Belgium and Japan . The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping , while the others started geophysical and geological research . Norway 's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following the withdrawal of the Norwegian expedition in 1960 . South Africa later built the SANAE station , near the now @-@ defunct Norway Station . The Soviet Union , and later Russia , has maintained continual operations , although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station . Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957 , except for a hiatus of a few years . Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961 , though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964 – 66 . The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966 . 
 In 1948 , the newly created Norwegian Polar Institute was assigned the administration of Norwegian territories in the Arctic and Antarctic , including Queen Maud Land . Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s , but its efforts declined after that . On 21 June 1957 , Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian sovereignty as a dependency ( <unk> ) , and the Antarctic Treaty officially came into force on 23 June 1961 . Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co @-@ expeditions with the United States , until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern Weddell Sea by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976 – 77 . 
 Founded in 1978 , the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police , headquartered in Oslo , has been assigned the administration of the Norwegian polar areas including Queen Maud Land . Since 1979 , the Norwegian Polar Institute has been a directorate under the Ministry of the Environment . 
 In 1992 , an expedition by Ivar Tollefsen made the first ascents of several mountains , including the tallest , <unk> . Norway established the summer station Troll in 1989 – 90 . In 2003 , Minister of the Environment <unk> <unk> was the first Norwegian minister to visit Queen Maud Land , and he soon allocated funds to expand the Troll station . Troll was upgraded to a year @-@ round station in 2005 as part of the centenary of Norway 's independence . Among the guests were Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen and Minister of the Environment Knut Arild Hareide , and Troll was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway , the first queen to ever visit Antarctica . In 2008 , Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg , accompanied by forty officials , scientists and reporters , became the first Norwegian prime minister to visit Queen Maud Land . He personally named three mountains around the Troll station where he was based , although he chose to sleep outdoors in a tent , rather than in a bed inside . He said the purposes of the visit were to claim Norway 's possessions in Antarctica , as well as to learn more about the climate research at Troll , which he said was key to better understanding of global climate change . 
 In 2015 , King Harald V became the world 's first reigning monarch to visit Antarctica when he went to Queen Maud Land .

 Like all other territorial claims in Antarctica , the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land ( along with its claim of Peter I Island ) is subject to the Antarctic Treaty System . The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity . It promotes international scientific cooperation and bans any nuclear @-@ related activities . Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty , all claims are effectively suspended as long as the treaty is in force . Norway , Australia , France , New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other 's claims in Antarctica . 
 Norwegian administration of Queen Maud Land is controlled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police , located in Oslo . The annexation of the territory is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933 ; Queen Maud Land was added on 21 June 1957 . It establishes that Norwegian criminal law , private law and procedural law applies to the territory , in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid in the territory . Furthermore , it establishes that all the land belongs to the state , and prohibits both nuclear detonations and the storage of nuclear waste . 
 Since 5 May 1995 , Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica to follow international environmental law for Antarctica . Norwegian citizens who plan activities in Queen Maud Land must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute , which may prohibit any non @-@ compliant activity . Those who visit Queen Maud Land must follow laws regarding protection of nature , treatment of waste , pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations . 
 = = Fauna and flora = = 
 There are three types of birds around Troll : the Antarctic petrel , the snow petrel and the only raptor in Queen Maud Land , the south polar skua . The Antarctic petrel lives on the sea ice for most of the year , with the exception of its breeding season ( in Antarctica , from November to February ) , when it moves to the inland mountains and nunataks . The 3 @.@ 9 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 5 sq mi ) area of ice @-@ free cliffs in Princess Astrid Coast called <unk> Mountain hosts Antarctica 's largest known inland colony of breeding seabirds , almost 1 million ( 250 @,@ 000 pairs ) Antarctic petrels . Many snow petrels and south polar skuas also breed in this area . Snow petrels are generally spread out in smaller colonies throughout the mountainous areas of Queen Maud Land . During the breeding season , the south polar skua feeds exclusively upon the eggs , as well as both young and adult birds , of both petrel species . 
 The emperor penguin has some of its breeding places concentrated in Queen Maud Land . All four of the true Antarctic seals , namely the Weddell seal , leopard seal , crabeater seal and Ross seal , can be found in the King Haakon VII Sea off Queen Maud Land . The Ross seal is notably found in its greatest numbers in the King Haakon VII Sea . 
 The nunatak areas have a scarcity of flora , limited to lichen , bryophyte and algae . Flowering plants are not found there . The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land , the known ones thus existing in healthy populations .

 Queen Maud Land is currently home to 12 research stations , the Norwegian Troll and Tor stations ; Russia 's Novolazarevskaya Station ; South Africa 's SANAE IV ; the Swedish Wasa ; the Finnish Aboa ; The German Neumayer @-@ Station III and Kohnen ; Indias Maitri station ; the Japanese Showa Station and Dome Fuji Station ; and Belgium 's Princess Elisabeth Base . 
 These stations are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project ( DROMLAN ) , which is a cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica . Long @-@ range aircraft fly between Cape Town , South Africa and either the Troll Airfield , located at the Troll research station , or the runway at the Novolazarevskaya Station . From these two main airfields , smaller aircraft may fly further to other Antarctic destinations . 
 Norway 's Troll station serves as a major hub of the DROMLAN network through the Troll Airfield . Research at Troll include air and atmospheric measurements , monitoring of greenhouse gases and bird colonies , as well as meteorological and climate research . The other Norwegian station , Tor , was established for researching birds at the breeding colony in <unk> Mountain . 
 Activities conducted by Russia 's Novolazarevskaya Station include environmental monitoring , geodesy / mapping , geomagnetic and meteorological observations , glaciology , biology , ionospheric / auroral observations , limnology , geology , geophysics and seismology . 
 South Africa 's SANAE IV station , the successor to three former stations , was completed in 1997 . Research at SANAE IV include invasion biology / ecology , geology , geomorphology and atmospheric sciences . Its facilities include a small hospital and a two @-@ helicopter hangar . 
 The Swedish Wasa station and the Finnish Aboa station together make up the Nordenskiöld Base , and cooperate in research and logistics . Research carried out includes geodesy / mapping , glaciology , human biology , meteorological observations , geology and geophysics . 
 The German Neumayer @-@ Station III , finished in 2009 , succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice . It conducts geophysical , meteorological and seismological research , as well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring . Germany 's other station , Kohnen , was opened as part of a major ice @-@ drilling project . 
 The Maitri station succeeded the Dakshin Gangotri station in 1989 , India 's first Antarctic base . Maitri 's research focus on geology , and the study of the supercontinent Gondwana , when India and Antarctica belonged to the same landmass . It also includes low @-@ temperature engineering research that is relevant to conditions in the Himalayas . 
 The Showa Station is Japan 's main research station in Antarctica . A vast array of research is conducted there , including upper atmosphere physics , meteorology , seismology , <unk> , geodesy / mapping , oceanography , glaciology , geology , marine and terrestrial biology , and medical research . Japan 's other station , Dome Fuji Station was opened as part of a major ice @-@ coring project . It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations . 
 Belgium 's Princess Elisabeth Base was established as a project to promote polar sciences , as well as to demonstrate the possibility of building a Zero emission station . Research is conducted by an international team of scientists , studying climatology , glaciology and microbiology .

After <unk> , SR 38 splits off . There would be no more major intersections until SR 161 has reached Plain City , as it meets U.S. Route 42 ( US 42 ) . SR 161 goes through Madison and a small section of Franklin County without major intersections . In Union County , it meets US 33 and Post Road in an interchange . SR 161 goes on the freeway and starts a concurrency . The concurrency goes back to Franklin County and into Dublin . In Dublin , the freeway has interchanges with Avery – Muirfield Drive and Interstate 270 ( I @-@ 270 ) . The freeway becomes an at @-@ grade highway as it meets Post Road again . 
 The road goes into Dublin downtown and has intersections with SR 745 and SR 257 . At SR 257 , US 33 splits off and the concurrency ends . After that , there are no more major intersections until SR 161 reaches Worthington , as it meets SR 315 in a diamond interchange , and US 23 at an at @-@ grade intersection . After the intersection at US 23 , SR 161 enters Columbus . There is an intersection with SR 710 and an interchange with I @-@ 71 .

 Country Bill 's Restaurant was a family @-@ owned American @-@ style steakhouse and seafood restaurant in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland , Oregon , in the United States . Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB 's Lounge . The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas ' family . Though Thomas was not particularly fond of the name of the business Blake had established in 1960 , he was unable to afford new signage and kept the lounge 's title . Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant , expanding from one space to four . In 1978 , the family purchased the building and property following the landlord 's death . 
 Eventually , Thomas transferred the business to one of his two sons , Craig . Craig and his wife decided to retire in 2011 and none of their children wanted to continue operating the restaurant .

 Country Bill 's Restaurant opened in 1964 after Ron Thomas ' family purchased the business from Bill Blake for $ 600 . Blake had named his lounge Country Bill 's in 1960 but the business was unsuccessful . Thomas had been in the food service industry in Utah previously and ended up living in Portland after a series of relocations with his family . Though he was not fond of the lounge 's name , Thomas was unable to afford new signage and kept the title . Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant , expanding east from one space to four . In 1978 , the family purchased the building and property following the death of their landlord . 
 Ownership stayed within the family , eventually transferring to Craig Thomas , one of Ron 's two sons , both of whom worked in the restaurant for numerous years . Craig Thomas and his wife decided to retire in 2011 and none of their children wanted to continue operating the restaurant . In February 2011 , Country Bill 's and the 5 @,@ 300 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 490 m2 ) building were listed for sale for $ 975 @,@ 000 . The restaurant closed on September 15 , 2012 , after 48 years of operation . Hundreds of customers , some from as far away as Europe , visited the restaurant during its final days . 
 Following the restaurant 's closing in 2012 , the building underwent interior and exterior renovation , resulting in two spaces for future tenants , one of which has been confirmed as a dental office .

 Country Bill 's served American food , originally operating as a hamburger stand , before becoming a steakhouse and seafood restaurant . The menu included prime rib , razor clams and steelhead ; meals were accompanied by soup or salad and a potato as sides . Slot machines were available on site but the business made 70 percent of its income from food . Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar reminiscent of the Brat Pack era called CB 's Lounge . 
 In his review for Willamette Week , Ben Waterhouse asserted that the restaurant had changed little since its establishment . Waterhouse stated " time travel " was Country Bill 's form of entertainment , noting its red vinyl booths , wood paneling and " white @-@ haired " clientele . He recommended ordering beer or spirits ( specifically Anchor Steam ) as opposed to cocktails , which he found contained too much sugar . Mix magazine reviewed Country Bill 's as one of " five vintage restaurants that have stood the test of time " .

 Tungsten , also known as wolfram , is a chemical element with symbol W and atomic number 74 . The word tungsten comes from the Swedish language tung <unk> , which directly translates to heavy stone . Its name in Swedish is <unk> , however , in order to distinguish it from scheelite , which in Swedish is alternatively named tungsten . 
 A hard , rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined , tungsten is found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds . It was identified as a new element in 1781 , and first isolated as a metal in 1783 . Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite . The free element is remarkable for its robustness , especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements . Its high density is 19 @.@ 3 times that of water , comparable to that of uranium and gold , and much higher ( about 1 @.@ 7 times ) than that of lead . Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material , making it difficult to work . However , pure single @-@ crystalline tungsten is more ductile , and can be cut with a hard @-@ steel hacksaw . 
 Tungsten 's many alloys have numerous applications , including incandescent light bulb filaments , X @-@ ray tubes ( as both the filament and target ) , electrodes in TIG welding , superalloys , and radiation shielding . Tungsten 's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles . Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts . 
 Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules , where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea . It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism . Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 In its raw form , tungsten is a hard steel @-@ grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work . If made very pure , tungsten retains its hardness ( which exceeds that of many steels ) , and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily . It is worked by forging , drawing , or extruding . Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering . 
 Of all metals in pure form , tungsten has the highest melting point ( <unk> ° C , <unk> ° F ) , lowest vapor pressure ( at temperatures above 1650 ° C , 3000 ° F ) and the highest tensile strength . Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten , carbon sublimes , rather than melts , so tungsten is considered to have a higher melting point . Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal . The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons . Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness . 
 Tungsten exists in two major crystalline forms : α and β . The former has a body @-@ centered cubic structure and is the more stable form . The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic ; it is metastable , but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non @-@ equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities . Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains , the β form exhibits a columnar habit . The α phase has one third of the electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase : ca . 0 @.@ 015 K vs. 1 – 4 K ; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values . The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal ( e.g. 7 @.@ 9 K for W @-@ Tc ) . Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low @-@ temperature superconducting circuits . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring tungsten consists of five isotopes whose half @-@ lives are so long that they can be considered stable . Theoretically , all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 ( hafnium ) by alpha emission , but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half @-@ life of ( 1 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 2 ) × 1018 years ; on average , this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year . The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay , constraining their half @-@ lives to be : 
 <unk> , t1 / 2 > 7 @.@ 7 × 1021 years 
 <unk> , t1 / 2 > 4 @.@ 1 × 1021 years 
 <unk> , t1 / 2 > 8 @.@ 9 × 1021 years 
 <unk> , t1 / 2 > 8 @.@ 2 × 1021 years 
 Another 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized , the most stable of which are <unk> with a half @-@ life of 121 @.@ 2 days , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 75 @.@ 1 days , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 69 @.@ 4 days , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 21 @.@ 6 days , and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 23 @.@ 72 h . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives of less than 3 hours , and most of these have half @-@ lives below 8 minutes . Tungsten also has 4 meta states , the most stable being <unk> ( t1 / 2 6 @.@ 4 minutes ) . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Elemental tungsten resists attack by oxygen , acids , and alkalis . 
 The most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is + 6 , but it exhibits all oxidation states from − 2 to + 6 . Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide , WO3 , which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions , WO2 − 
 4 . 
 Tungsten carbides ( W2C and WC ) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon . W2C is resistant to chemical attack , although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride ( <unk> ) . 
 In aqueous solution , tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and <unk> anions under neutral and acidic conditions . As tungstate is progressively treated with acid , it first yields the soluble , metastable " <unk> A " anion , W 
 <unk> – 
 24 , which over time converts to the less soluble " <unk> B " anion , H 
 2W 
 <unk> – 
 42 . Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion , H 
 2W 
 <unk> – 
 40 , after which equilibrium is reached . The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten @-@ oxygen octahedra known as the <unk> anion . Many other <unk> anions exist as metastable species . The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids , such as <unk> acid <unk> . 
 Tungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals . These are known as bronzes ; an example is sodium tungsten bronze . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1781 , Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid , tungstic acid , could be made from scheelite ( at the time named tungsten ) . Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid . In 1783 , José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid . Later that year , at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara , Spain , the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal , and they are credited with the discovery of the element . 
 In World War II , tungsten played a significant role in background political dealings . Portugal , as the main European source of the element , was put under pressure from both sides , because of its deposits of wolframite ore at <unk> . Tungsten 's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures , its hardness and density , and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry , both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself , e.g. , in tungsten carbide cutting tools for machining steel . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The name " tungsten " ( from the Swedish tung <unk> , " heavy stone " ) is used in English , French , and many other languages as the name of the element , but not in the Nordic countries . Tungsten was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite . The other name " wolfram " ( or " <unk> " ) is used in most European ( especially Germanic and Slavic ) languages , and is derived from the mineral wolframite , which is the origin of its chemical symbol , W. The name " wolframite " is derived from German " wolf <unk> " ( " wolf soot " or " wolf cream " ) , the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk <unk> in 1747 . This , in turn , derives from " <unk> <unk> " , the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546 , which translates into English as " wolf 's froth " , and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Tungsten is found in wolframite ( iron – manganese tungstate ( Fe , Mn ) <unk> being a solid solution of the minerals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) and scheelite ( calcium tungstate ( <unk> ) . Other tungsten minerals are moderately to very rare and have no economical value . They include the recently approved native tungsten . 
 = = Production = = 
 About 61 @,@ 300 tonnes of tungsten concentrates were produced in the year 2009 , and in 2010 , world production of tungsten was about 68 @,@ 000 tonnes . The main producers were as follows ( data in tonnes ) : 
 There is additional production in the U.S. , but the amount is proprietary company information . U.S. reserves are 140 @,@ 000 tonnes . 
 Tungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
 There is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of Dartmoor in the United Kingdom , which was exploited during World War I and World War II as the <unk> Mine . With recent increases in tungsten prices , as of 2014 this mine has been reactivated . 
 Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages . The ore is eventually converted to tungsten ( VI ) oxide ( WO3 ) , which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten . Because of tungsten 's high melting point , it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots . Instead , powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals , and sintered . During the sintering process , the nickel diffuses into the tungsten , producing an alloy . 
 Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF6 : 
 WF6 + 3 H2 → W + 6 HF 
 or <unk> decomposition : 
 WF6 → W + 3 F2 ( <unk> = + ) 
 Tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange . The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO3 . If converted to the metal equivalent , they were about US $ 19 per kilogram in 2009 .

 Approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials – namely tungsten carbide – with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels . Less than 10 % is used in other chemical compounds . 
 = = = Hard materials = = = 
 Tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide , one of the hardest carbides , with a melting point of 2770 ° C. WC is an efficient electrical conductor , but W2C is less so . WC is used to make wear @-@ resistant abrasives , and " carbide " cutting tools such as knives , drills , circular saws , milling and turning tools used by the metalworking , woodworking , mining , petroleum and construction industries . Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic / metal composite , where metallic cobalt acts as a binding ( matrix ) material to hold the WC particles in place . This type of industrial use accounts for about 60 % of current tungsten consumption . 
 The jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide , tungsten carbide / metal composites , and also metallic tungsten . WC / metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished . Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal , but it is a ceramic . Because of tungsten carbide 's hardness , rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant , and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten . Tungsten carbide rings are brittle , however , and may crack under a sharp blow . 
 = = = Alloys = = = 
 The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys . A good example is high speed steel , which can contain as much as 18 % tungsten . Tungsten 's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles , for example in the UGM @-@ 27 Polaris submarine @-@ launched ballistic missile . Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of different applications , including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding . <unk> containing tungsten , such as <unk> and Stellite , are used in turbine blades and wear @-@ resistant parts and coatings .

 Tungsten , usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys , is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium , in applications where uranium 's radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form , or where uranium 's additional pyrophoric properties are not required ( for example , in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor ) . Similarly , tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells , grenades and missiles , to create supersonic shrapnel . Tungsten has also been used in Dense Inert Metal Explosives , which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius . 
 = = = Chemical applications = = = 
 Tungsten ( IV ) sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization . MoS2 is more commonly used for such applications . 
 Tungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium / magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting . Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine . Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries . 
 Tungsten oxide ( WO3 ) is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction ( SCR ) catalysts found in coal @-@ fired power plants . These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) to nitrogen ( N2 ) and water ( H2O ) using ammonia ( NH3 ) . The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life . 
 = = = Niche uses = = = 
 Applications requiring its high density include weights , counterweights , ballast keels for yachts , tail ballast for commercial aircraft , and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One ; depleted uranium is also used for these purposes , due to similarly high density . 75 @-@ kg blocks of tungsten were used as " cruise balance mass devices " on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft . It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting , where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar . High @-@ density alloys of tungsten with nickel , copper or iron are used in high @-@ quality darts ( to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings ) or for fishing lures ( tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly ) . Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten . The extra density gives this sting more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with 3 strings from a different set . 
 Sodium tungstate is used in <unk> @-@ <unk> 's reagent , a mixture of different chemicals used in the " Lowry Assay " for protein content analysis . 
 = = = Gold substitution = = = 
 Its density , similar to that of gold , allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum . Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic , and is harder than gold alloys ( though not as hard as tungsten carbide ) , making it useful for rings that will resist scratching , especially in designs with a brushed finish . 
 Because the density is so similar to that of gold ( tungsten is only 0 @.@ 36 % less dense ) , tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars , such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold , which has been observed since the 1980s , or taking an existing gold bar , drilling holes , and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods . The densities are not exactly the same , and other properties of gold and tungsten differ , but gold @-@ plated tungsten will pass superficial tests . 
 Gold @-@ plated tungsten is available commercially from China ( the main source of tungsten ) , both in jewelry and as bars . 
 = = = Electronics = = = 
 Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point , elemental tungsten is used in many high @-@ temperature applications , such as light bulb , cathode @-@ ray tube , and vacuum tube filaments , heating elements , and rocket engine nozzles . Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high @-@ temperature uses such as electrical , heating , and welding applications , notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process ( also called tungsten inert gas ( TIG ) welding ) . 
 Because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness , tungsten is also used in electrodes , and in the emitter tips in electron @-@ beam instruments that use field emission guns , such as electron microscopes . In electronics , tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits , between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors . It is used in metallic films , which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten ( or molybdenum ) on silicon . 
 The electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X @-@ ray targets , and also for shielding from high @-@ energy radiations ( such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of <unk> ) . It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made , due to its excellent shielding properties . Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites , which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets , shot , and radiation shields . Since this element 's thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass , it is used for making glass @-@ to @-@ metal seals . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Tungsten , at atomic number 74 , is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional , with the next heaviest being iodine ( Z = 53 ) . It is used by some bacteria , but not in eukaryotes . For example , enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten @-@ <unk> complex with molybdopterin ( molybdopterin , despite its name , does not contain molybdenum , but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms ) . Tungsten @-@ using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes . The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations . The first tungsten @-@ requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium , and in this case the tungsten @-@ selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum @-@ sulfur pairing of some molybdenum cofactor @-@ requiring enzymes . One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten ( bacterial formate dehydrogenase H ) is known to use a selenium @-@ molybdenum version of molybdopterin . Acetylene <unk> is an unusual <unk> in that it catalyzes a hydration reaction . Two reaction mechanisms have been proposed , in one of which there is a direct interaction between the tungsten atom and the C ≡ C triple bond . Although a tungsten @-@ containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten @-@ <unk> and also non @-@ protein bound selenium , a tungsten @-@ selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described . 
 In soil , tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion . It can be selectively or non @-@ selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes . Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive . The soil 's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes ; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates ; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates . 
 Sodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms . Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic , but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability . 
 Tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist , in a role similar to the action of molybdenum . It has been found that <unk> may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals , similar to the <unk> . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Because tungsten is rare and its compounds are generally inert , the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited . The median lethal dose LD50 depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59 mg / kg ( intravenous , rabbits ) and 5000 mg / kg ( tungsten metal powder , intraperitoneal , rats ) . 
 People can be exposed to tungsten in the workplace by breathing it in , swallowing it , skin contact , and eye contact . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday and a short term limit of 10 mg / m3 . 
 = = Patent claim = = 
 Tungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings . In 1928 , a US court rejected General Electric 's attempt to patent it , overturning U.S. Patent 1 @,@ 082 @,@ 933 granted in 1913 to William D. Coolidge . 
 = Senior Prom = 
 Senior Prom was a classified black program conducted by the United States Air Force in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation 's Skunk Works for the development and testing of a cruise missile utilising stealth technology . Based on the company 's Have Blue demonstrator , the six Senior Prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at Area 51 in the late 1970s ; despite this , the aircraft was not selected to enter production , and the program was terminated in the early 1980s . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Following the success of the test programme for the Lockheed Have Blue stealth technology demonstrator aircraft , the United States Air Force awarded a contract to the Lockheed Advanced Development Projects division — the " Skunk Works " — for the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle , intended to act as the prototype of a cruise missile , that would apply the Have Blue 's faceted design in order to reduce the radar cross section of the missile by deflecting electromagnetic waves from radar transmitters away from their source , instead of directly back at the radar set 's antenna . 
 The program begin in 1977 , with a reported budget of USD $ 24 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ; the design of the aircraft was closely based on that of Have Blue , except scaled down . Intended for launch from Lockheed DC @-@ 130 Hercules drone launcher aircraft , the original configuration of the Senior Prom vehicle included winglets and a ventral fin ; the aircraft was later modified to include a V @-@ tail and more slender wings , closer in configuration to the F @-@ 117 Nighthawk stealth fighter . Radar @-@ absorbent material was applied to the airframe as part of its stealth configuration ; in addition to the faceting of the design , similar to that of Have Blue and the F @-@ 117 , the " sawtooth " wing profile bore similarities to the B @-@ 2 stealth bomber 's planform . 
 The Senior Prom vehicle was intended to be expendable ; however , it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced , with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage . The aircraft is believed to have been fitted with folding wings to <unk> carriage by the launching aircraft , and was powered by a single turbofan engine , with the air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground , reducing the aircraft 's radar and infrared signatures . 
 = = Testing and cancellation = = 
 Flight testing of the Senior Prom vehicles began in October 1978 ; a total of six aircraft were built , which completed a total of fourteen flights over the duration of the testing programme . The craft were reportedly capable of flying within 500 feet ( 150 m ) of a SPS @-@ 13 radar without generating a discernible return . Most testing took place at Groom Lake ( " Area 51 " ) in Nevada , with a DC @-@ 130 Hercules acting as the launch aircraft ; there are also reports that some testing was conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in California , with a B @-@ 52 Stratofortress being used as the launch platform , while " Hangar 18 " at the Groom Lake test complex was reportedly constructed to house the B @-@ 52 and Senior Prom combination . 
 Despite the success of the test programme , Senior Prom was cancelled in 1982 ; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B @-@ 1 bomber ; the AGM @-@ 129 ACM , a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement , had a more slender airframe with retractable wings , which rendered it capable of internal carriage ; it began flight testing shortly after the end of the Senior Prom programme . 
 Despite the cancellation of the programme in 1982 , the Senior Prom remained highly classified into the 21st century . There are rumours that a small number of Senior Prom aircraft , configured for aerial reconnaissance , were acquired by the United States Air Force , and were utilised in secret missions over Eastern Europe late in the Cold War , over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm , and over North Korea ; there is no official confirmation of this being the case .

In their attempt to pass the time , they participate in numerous activities and games . After being condemned by her peers , Meg lashes out and confronts her family . Meanwhile , Brian consumes magic mushrooms which cause him to hallucinate . 
 " Seahorse Seashell Party " is the second part of the Night of the Hurricane block with The Cleveland Show and American Dad ! . The episode was first announced by Seth MacFarlane at the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . It was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles . Originally scheduled to air on May 1 , 2011 as the sixteenth episode of the ninth season of Family Guy , the episode was postponed due to the April 25 – 28 , 2011 tornado outbreak subsequently coinciding with the timing of the scheduled episodes . 
 Critical responses to the episode were negative , particularly for its humor and main plot . An estimated 6 @.@ 91 million viewers tuned into the episode upon its initial airing , while also garnering a 3 @.@ 5 / 8 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic according to the Nielsen ratings . The episode featured guest performances by Ioan Gruffudd , Dee Bradley Baker , Debra Wilson , Kat <unk> , and Colin Ford along with several other recurring guest voice actors for the series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As the Griffins prepare for an approaching hurricane which had already hit Stoolbend , Brian decides to use magic mushrooms , to the curiosity of Stewie . As the mushrooms take effect on Brian , he has hallucinations and cuts his ear off , believing it would stop World War II . Stewie tries to take care of Brian , whose hallucinations become more overwhelmingly disturbing , to the point where he sees Stewie transforming into a hideous demon towering over him before he perceives himself in a grotesque , hellish world . During his nightmare sequence , Brian is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffin family and Quagmire . He recovers when Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water . 
 The rest of the family passes the time by playing charades and other games . Peter , Lois and Chris play a game of " finger @-@ bang , " until Meg joins in . They shun her , using the sexual connotation to insult and demean her and again later gang up on her when she disturbs Peter 's humming by opening a soda can . At her limit after years of their abuse , Meg finally gets the nerve to turn on them . 
 She starts with Chris by calling him " a bastard " for being a terrible brother to her , berating him for all the ill treatment he has given her over the years , and how he never takes her side when their parents abuse her . Lois condescendingly tells Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else invoking Meg to bring up her mother 's delinquent past . Meg tells her that she is far from the perfect parent , harshly berates her for constantly and ruthlessly pointing out Meg 's shortcomings . Lois tries to justify that she 's a better person because of her past and she is open that she isn 't the perfect parent , but Meg tells her that she 's the farthest thing from and states how she has neglected to protect her from harm and guide her through life . Meg also informs Lois that when she turns 18 , she may never want to see her again . This breaks Lois ' heart and she finally admits that she 's been a terrible mother to Meg . Finally , Meg turns on Peter who , unable to comprehend her insults , thinks that his daughter 's argument is amusing , even when she points out Peter 's destructive tendencies and that he would go to jail if someone could witness his negative treatment towards her . It dawns on Peter that he is being insulted when Meg calls him a " waste of a man . " 
 A shocked Peter asks Lois to tell Meg to " knock it off , " but Lois refuses because he didn 't stick up for her . Within moments , Peter , Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms and insults on each other . Peter finally runs to his room crying , leaving Meg and Brian , who is now full recovered from his trip , to discuss what just happened . Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself , Meg comes to the conclusion that her family cannot survive without a " lightning rod " to absorb the dysfunction , and the only way they can get along is if she continues to take their abuse . Brian tells her that she is more mature than her family . She then lies to them , saying that she was only taking her own problems out on everyone , restoring their egos and original opinions although she only did this to prevent further fighting and will return being abused by the family , as the hurricane heads for Langley Falls . 
 Before the episode ends , Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the viewer about the dangers of drugs : " Tonight 's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use , but the simple fact is , it 's no laughing matter . To learn more about drugs , visit your local library . There 's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs . " 
 = = Production and development = = 
 The episode was first announced in July 2010 by series creator Seth MacFarlane at the Comic @-@ Con International in San Diego , California . Kevin Reilly , the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company , originally pitched the idea for the crossover , which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s . MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an " enormous challenge " and a " substantial undertaking " ; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters . MacFarlane was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings . 
 In April 2011 , executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that " Seahorse Seashell Party " would air on May 1 . However , on April 29 , it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule , in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States . The episodes were subsequently replaced by repeats of " I Am the Walrus " from American Dad ! , " Brian Writes a Bestseller " from Family Guy , and " Ain 't Nothin ' But Mutton Bustin ' " from The Cleveland Show . MacFarlane agreed with the decisions after consulting with the executives of Fox , and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episodes would air the following season . 
 " Seahorse Seashell Party " was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles . It features guest appearances from Ioan Gruffudd , Dee Bradley Baker , Colin Ford , and Debra Wilson . This episode marked Gruffudd 's first guest appearance since the season eight episode " The Splendid Source " and Wilson 's first guest appearance since the season three episode " And the Wiener Is ...

 " Seahorse Seashell Party " first aired in the United States on October 2 , 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox . It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show , while being succeeded by an episode of American Dad ! . It was viewed by 6 @.@ 91 million viewers upon its initial airing , despite simultaneously airing with Desperate Housewives on ABC , Amazing Race on CBS , and a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC . Total viewership for the episode was the highest out of its respective line @-@ up .

 The main plot of " Seahorse Seashell Party " received negative reviews . Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode , " This far into the show ’ s run , shifting to a much more dramatic bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late . " He resumed : " Nobody cares about any member of the Griffin family the way we care about every last Simpson . I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat . Not because she ’ s a good character , but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable , Family Guy spent years going down the path of least resistance and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred . One episode of pointed , forced justification for that shift doesn ’ t change a thing . " McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D + . Similarly , Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted . In his review , Moore stated that " Seahorse Seashell Party " was " an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn ’ t need to be addressed . " He gave the episode a 4 @.@ 5 out of ten points . TV Fanatic 's Kate Moon was less negative of the episode , stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue , she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting . 
 Critics were polarized with the episode subplot . While McFarland expressed enjoyment of some of the animation of the episode , he asserted that it " fell flat . " Moon exclaimed that the subplot would have been more interesting had Stewie ingested the mushroom alongside Brian . 
 The episode debuted in the United Kingdom on May 20 , 2012 , and achieved 1 @.@ 6 million viewers . Although US reception was negative , UK critics praised the episode for its subplot animation and bold storyline . 
 = Marouane Chamakh = 
 Marouane Chamakh ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Arabic : <unk> <unk> ; born 10 January 1984 ) is a Moroccan professional footballer who plays as a <unk> for the Morocco national team . His most recent club side was English Premier League team Crystal Palace . He is described as a prototypical target man and is noted for his " link @-@ up play " , " tall stature " and " excellent heading ability " . He is the first and only player in UEFA Champions League history to score in six consecutive matches . 
 Chamakh started his career training throughout various clubs in the Aquitaine region . In 2000 , he signed with Bordeaux . Chamakh made his professional debut for the club in the 2002 – 03 season . He spent nine years at the club and helped Bordeaux win the Coupe de la Ligue in 2007 . In the 2008 – 09 season , Chamakh won his first league title as Bordeaux were crowned champions for the first time since the 1998 – 99 season . The club also won the Coupe de la Ligue completing the league and league cup double . In May 2010 , Chamakh joined Arsenal of the Premier League on a free transfer after agreeing to a four @-@ year contract with the club . 
 Although born and raised in France , Chamakh chose to play international football for Morocco , because he had Moroccan parents . He made his national team debut in July 2003 and has played at three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments , including the 2004 tournament in which Morocco finished runner @-@ up . In August 2010 , he captained the national team for the first time . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Chamakh was born in <unk> , a small town near the Garonne River , to Moroccan parents , and was raised in the nearby commune of Aiguillon . His father , El Mostafa Chamakh , was a former footballer in Morocco and played for <unk> Aïn <unk> in Casablanca . In 1979 , he left Morocco to locate more favorable living conditions and to find a better job . After settling in France and finding work as a stonemason , the elder Chamakh brought his family over soon after . Chamakh 's younger brother Yassin owns a café . Chamakh has stated that when he goes back home , he often waits tables to help out his brother . 
 While pursuing his career as a professional footballer , Chamakh was equally adept off the field earning good grades in school . During his early years at Bordeaux , he began attending high school . He hoped to earn a <unk> in accounting , which he later accomplished . In addition to having a <unk> , Chamakh is also very interested in politics and , in February 2010 , voiced his support for the Democratic Movement ( <unk> ) political party ahead of the upcoming regional elections . In the 2010 regional elections , Chamakh was , surprisingly , listed as a candidate by the <unk> for the Gironde department in the Aquitaine region . The lead deputy of the party , Jean Lassalle , stated on the decision to name Chamakh to the ballot : " I want to gather all the forces of Aquitaine to sustain our region , and Marouane is one of those forces who Aquitaine needs . " Chamakh was listed as a non @-@ eligible candidate on the ballot and Lasalle was accused of using Chamakh in order to garner votes from football supporters in the region . 
 Chamakh is a practising Muslim and has stated that " I have no problem fasting during Ramadan , it becomes normal . The day before a game and on match days I do not fast , but I 'll make up the lost days later . "

 Chamakh began his football career at the age of four playing for local club Nérac FC in the nearby commune of Nérac . While at Nérac , youth coaches at the club nicknamed him " Mr. George " after the former FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah because Chamakh " used to score four or five goals in every <unk> rovers game " . After six years at Nérac , Chamakh joined FC <unk> . While in <unk> , he developed his physical skills and traits , growing as tall as 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) and also earning his first regional selection to play for the Aquitaine regional team in the Coupe Nationale . 
 = = = Bordeaux = = = 
 In 2000 , Chamakh was pursued by several professional clubs that wanted to obtain his services . He drew interest from Lens , Toulouse , Lorient , and Bordeaux . Chamakh eventually decided to sign with Bordeaux due to the club 's infrastructure and training facilities and also because of the close proximity to his family . Upon his arrival , Chamakh was placed into the club 's youth academy . For the 2001 – 02 season , he was promoted to the club 's Championnat de France amateur 2 team in the fifth division . Chamakh was involved heavily in the campaign of the team , coached by Jean @-@ Louis Garcia . He appeared in 17 matches and scored six goals as the team finished first in their group , thus earning promotion to the Championnat de France amateur . 
 Following the season , Chamakh turned professional and signed a three @-@ year contract with Bordeaux . He spent the first half of the 2002 – 03 campaign playing in the fourth division , but following the winter break , was called up to the senior team by manager Elie <unk> . Chamakh made his professional debut on 19 January 2003 in the team 's Coupe de la Ligue match against Metz . He appeared as a substitute and played 15 minutes in a 1 – 0 defeat . Chamakh made his league debut three weeks later in a 2 – 0 home defeat to Bastia again appearing as a substitute . On 20 May , he scored his first professional goal against Nice , netting the equalizing goal just a minute before injury time in a 1 – 1 draw . Chamakh appeared in 14 games , always as a substitute , during the campaign . In the 2003 – 04 season , he was promoted to the senior team permanently by new manager Michel Pavon and made his first professional league start on 1 November 2003 in a 1 – 0 win over Marseille . In the team 's following match , Chamakh scored the opening goal in a 1 – 1 draw with Strasbourg just before halftime . However , mid @-@ way through the second half , he received his first career red card after incurring a second yellow . Upon returning from his one @-@ game suspension , Chamakh developed into a regular starter for the club , scoring goals in consecutive matches against Metz and Montpellier . He finished the league campaign with six goals in 25 matches . In the club 's UEFA Cup campaign , Chamakh netted four times in eight appearances . 
 In the 2004 – 05 season , Pavon decided to move Chamakh into the lead striker position and install Argentine playmaker Juan Pablo Francia as a support striker . The move was a success with Chamakh scoring ten league goals . He opened the campaign by scoring his first professional hat trick in a 5 – 1 victory over Nice . In September 2004 , Chamakh scored goals in back @-@ to @-@ back matches against Bastia and Derby de la Garonne rivals Toulouse . He finished the campaign by scoring the opening goal in a 1 – 1 draw with Monaco . Despite the positive individual season from Chamakh , Bordeaux finished the campaign in 15th place ; its worst finish since ending the league campaign in 16th over a decade before . Pavon , due to heart problems , stepped down from his position and was replaced by Ricardo Gomes . Under Gomes , Chamakh struggled to meet the success of his previous season scoring only 12 league goals in 58 matches over the course of two seasons . Two of his notable performances during Gomes ' reign included scoring a double in league matches against Metz and Nancy . In the match against the former club , Chamakh scored both of his goals within a minute of each other . He was later ejected from the match after committing a red card offense . Chamakh ended the 2006 – 07 Ligue 1 campaign by hoisting the Coupe de la Ligue trophy after featuring in the team 's 1 – 0 victory over Lyon in the final match . It was Chamakh 's first major club honour . 
 Following the departure of Gomes , Bordeaux hired rookie manager Laurent Blanc ahead of the 2007 – 08 season . Chamakh has stated on several occasions that Blanc was an important figure in his development as a footballer . However , when Blanc first arrived to the club , Chamakh struggled to earn meaningful minutes because Blanc preferred David Bellion , a new recruit . His playing time up front was further hampered by the arrival of striker Fernando Cavenaghi , who had a prolific season scoring 15 goals in only 23 appearances . Due to Cavenaghi 's emergence , Chamakh was used as a target man and scored four goals , his lowest output since becoming a professional . In the 2008 – 09 season , Chamakh was relegated to appearing as a substitute for the first @-@ half of the campaign . However , on 21 December 2008 , Chamakh convinced Blanc to change his mind . With Bordeaux trailing 3 – 0 against Monaco , Chamakh appeared as a substitute and , within minutes on the field , scored a goal . Following a goal from Alou Diarra to make the match 3 – 2 , Chamakh equalized three minutes from time and , two minutes later , Cavenaghi netted the game @-@ winner to give Bordeaux a 4 – 3 victory . Following the winter break , Blanc decided to use both Chamakh and Cavenaghi in the attack with influential playmaker Yoann Gourcuff acting in support . It was the former who developed a consistent partnership with Gourcuff , and Chamakh responded by scoring eight league goals in the second half of the season . On 30 May 2009 , Bordeaux sealed their first league title since the 1998 – 99 season after defeating Caen 1 – 0 at the Stade Chaban Delmas . Chamakh played the entire match . The club also won the Coupe de la Ligue , completing the league and league cup double . 
 During the club 's victory parade , with only one year left on his contract Chamakh declared that he would be staying at Bordeaux for the 2009 – 10 season , despite strong interest from Premier League club Arsenal . Despite the statement , rumors of a move to Arsenal continued to surface with negotiations reportedly having been ongoing throughout the summer . On 3 August 2009 , president Jean @-@ Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal had sent a bid of € 7 million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it , demanding that Arsenal improve its offer . The following day , Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced that he would not be offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead . The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009 – 10 season . On 29 August , Chamakh reportedly snubbed a move to West Ham United . The club offered Bordeaux £ 18 million for the player and offered Chamakh a four @-@ year contract worth £ 3 million a year . However , Chamakh remained firm on his stance , reiterating his commitment to Bordeaux . 
 In his final season with Bordeaux , Chamakh was equally adept in both the league and the Champions League . He began the season claiming his fifth trophy on 25 July 2009 as Bordeaux won the 2009 Trophée des Champions in a 2 – 0 victory over Guingamp . Chamakh scored ten goals in league play and netted five in the Champions League , which included goals against Italian club Juventus and German club Bayern Munich in the group stage . Bordeaux were only one of two clubs to finish the group @-@ stage portion undefeated . In the knockout rounds , Chamakh scored a goal in Bordeaux 's 2 – 1 victory over Greek club Olympiacos in the second leg of the team 's UEFA Champions League opening knockout round match . Bordeaux won the tie with a 3 – 1 aggregate scoreline to advance to the quarter @-@ finals , where they faced league rivals Lyon . In the first leg , which Lyon won 3 – 1 , Chamakh scored a vital away goal . In the second leg , Chamakh converted another goal to get the scoreline 3 – 2 on aggregate . In the second half , however , Bordeaux were unable to score another as Lyon advanced to the semi @-@ finals on the aggregate scoreline . In Ligue 1 , Chamakh appeared in all 38 matches for the first time in his career . Despite starting the campaign strong , Bordeaux fell out of the running for the league title in the spring and eventually finished the season in sixth place , failing to qualify for European competition next season . 
 = = = Arsenal = = = 
 On 21 May 2010 , Chamakh completed his move to Arsenal on a free transfer after completing his contract with Bordeaux . The transfer took effect on 1 July 2010 . He made his debut in a pre @-@ season friendly against Barnet on 17 July , appearing as a substitute . On 27 July , he scored his first pre @-@ season goal for the club , converting a penalty in a 4 – 0 victory over Austrian club SC <unk> . In the 2010 edition of the Emirates Cup , Chamakh scored on his home debut against Italian club Milan . He made his Premier League debut on 15 August in the team 's 1 – 1 draw with Liverpool . Chamakh contributed to the team 's equalising goal by heading a cross off the goal post , which then redirected off goalkeeper Pepe Reina and into the back of the net , resulting in an own goal . 
 On 21 August 2010 , Chamakh scored his first Premier League goal with a header against Blackpool . In the same match , he won a penalty when he was fouled by Ian Evatt , which Andrey Arshavin subsequently converted in a 6 – 0 win for Arsenal . In his third start in four games , Chamakh scored the team 's second goal against Bolton Wanderers in a 4 – 1 victory .

 Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger , and first appeared in Detective Comics # 27 ( May 1939 ) . Originally named the " Bat @-@ Man " , the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader , the Dark Knight , and the World 's Greatest Detective . 
 Batman 's secret identity is Bruce Wayne , an American billionaire , playboy , philanthropist , and owner of Wayne Enterprises . After witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child , he swore revenge on criminals , an oath tempered by a sense of justice . Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat @-@ inspired persona to fight crime . Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City , with assistance from various supporting characters , including his butler Alfred , police commissioner Jim Gordon , and vigilante allies such as Robin . Unlike most superheroes , Batman does not possess any superpowers ; rather , he relies on his genius intellect , physical prowess , martial arts abilities , detective skills , science and technology , vast wealth , intimidation , and indomitable will . A large assortment of villains make up Batman 's rogues gallery , including his archenemy , the Joker . 
 Batman became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title , Batman , the following year . As the decades went on , differing interpretations of the character emerged . The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic , which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended . Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots , culminating in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller . The success of Warner Bros. ' live @-@ action Batman feature films have helped maintain public interest in the character . 
 An American cultural icon , Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media , from radio to television and film , and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world , such as toys and video games . The character has also intrigued psychiatrists , with many trying to understand the character 's psyche . In May 2011 , Batman placed second on IGN 's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time , after Superman . Empire magazine listed him second in their 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time . The character has been portrayed in both film and television by Lewis Wilson , Robert Lowery , Adam West , Michael Keaton , Kevin Conroy , Val Kilmer , George Clooney , Christian Bale , Bruce Greenwood , Peter Weller , and Ben Affleck .

 In early 1939 , the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications ( the future DC Comics ) to request more superheroes for its titles . In response , Bob Kane created " the Bat @-@ Man " . Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that " Kane had an idea for a character called ' Batman , ' and he 'd like me to see the drawings . I went over to Kane 's , and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights , I believe , with boots ... no gloves , no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask , swinging on a rope . He had two stiff wings that were sticking out , looking like bat wings . And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN " . The bat @-@ wing @-@ like cape was suggested by Bob Kane , inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci 's sketch of an ornithopter flying device as a child . 
 Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask , a cape instead of wings , and gloves ; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume . Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character 's secret identity : " Bruce Wayne 's first name came from Robert Bruce , the Scottish patriot . Wayne , being a playboy , was a man of gentry . I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism . I tried Adams , Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne . " He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk 's popular The Phantom , a syndicated newspaper comic @-@ strip character with which Kane was also familiar . 
 Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat @-@ Man 's look , personality , methods , and weaponry . Details find predecessors in pulp fiction , comic strips , newspaper headlines , and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself . As an aristocratic hero with a double identity , the Bat @-@ Man had predecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel ( created by Baroness <unk> <unk> , 1903 ) and Zorro ( created by Johnston McCulley , 1919 ) . Like them , he performed his heroic deeds in secret , averted suspicion by playing the fool in public , and marked his work with a signature symbol . Kane noted the influence of the films The Mark of Zorro ( 1920 ) and The Bat Whispers ( 1930 ) in the creation of the character 's iconography . Finger , drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage , The Shadow , Dick Tracy , and Sherlock Holmes , made the character a master sleuth . 
 In his 1989 autobiography , Kane detailed Finger 's contributions to Batman 's creation : 
 One day I called Bill and said , ' I have a new character called the Bat @-@ Man and I 've made some crude , elementary sketches I 'd like you to look at . ' He came over and I showed him the drawings . At the time , I only had a small domino mask , like the one Robin later wore , on Batman 's face . Bill said , ' Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him , and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious ? ' At this point , the Bat @-@ Man wore a red union suit ; the wings , trunks , and mask were black . I thought that red and black would be a good combination . Bill said that the costume was too bright : ' Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous . ' The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms . As Bill and I talked , we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat @-@ Man was in action , and changed them into a cape , scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope . Also , he didn 't have any gloves on , and we added them so that he wouldn 't leave fingerprints .

 = = = = Subsequent creation credit = = = = 
 Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for , among other compensation , a mandatory byline on all Batman comics . This byline did not originally say " Batman created by Bob Kane " ; his name was simply written on the title page of each story . The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid @-@ 1960s , replaced by credits for each story 's actual writer and artists . In the late 1970s , when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a " created by " credit on the Superman titles , along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman , Batman stories began saying " Created by Bob Kane " in addition to the other credits . 
 Finger did not receive the same recognition . While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s , he began , in the 1960s , to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing ; in the letters page of Batman # 169 ( February 1965 ) for example , editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler , one of Batman 's recurring villains . However , Finger 's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline . Kane wrote , " Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career . He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by . " At the time of Finger 's death in 1974 , DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co @-@ creator . 
 Jerry Robinson , who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time , has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit . He recalled Finger resenting his position , stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics Journal : 
 Bob made him more insecure , because while he slaved working on Batman , he wasn 't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make , which is why ... [ he was ] going to leave [ Kane 's employ ] . ... [ Kane ] should have credited Bill as co @-@ creator , because I know ; I was there . ... That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for , was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman . As with Siegel and Shuster , it should have been the same , the same co @-@ creator credit in the strip , writer , and artist . 
 Although Kane initially rebutted Finger 's claims at having created the character , writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that " it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the ' ' Batman , t ' [ sic ] as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters . This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue . " Kane himself also commented on Finger 's lack of credit . " The trouble with being a ' ghost ' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without ' credit ' . However , if one wants the ' credit ' , then one has to cease being a ' ghost ' or follower and become a leader or innovator . " 
 In 1989 , Kane revisited Finger 's situation , recalling in an interview : 
 In those days it was like , one artist and he had his name over it [ the comic strip ] — the policy of DC in the comic books was , if you can 't write it , obtain other writers , but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version . So Bill never asked me for it [ the byline ] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time . And I felt badly , really , when he [ Finger ] died . 
 In September 2015 , DC Entertainment revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman 's creation on the 2016 superhero film Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice and the second season of Gotham after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC . Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with Batman and Robin Eternal # 3 and Batman : Arkham Knight Genesis # 3 . The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as " Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger " . 
 = = = = Early years = = = = 
 The first Batman story , " The Case of the Chemical Syndicate " , was published in Detective Comics # 27 ( May 1939 ) . Finger said , " Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps " , and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals . Batman proved a hit character , and he received his own solo title in 1940 , while continuing to star in Detective Comics . By that time , National was the top @-@ selling and most influential publisher in the industry ; Batman and the company 's other major hero , Superman , were the cornerstones of the company 's success . The two characters were featured side @-@ by @-@ side as the stars of World 's Finest Comics , which was originally titled World 's Best Comics when it debuted in fall 1940 . Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period . 
 Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved . Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character 's jawline more pronounced , and lengthened the ears on the costume . " About a year later he was almost the full figure , my mature Batman " , Kane said . Batman 's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics # 29 ( July 1939 ) , followed by the boomerang @-@ like batarang and the first bat @-@ themed vehicle , the Batplane , in # 31 ( Sept . 1939 ) . The character 's origin was revealed in # 33 ( Nov. 1939 ) , unfolding in a two @-@ page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman , a character driven by the death of his parents . Written by Finger , it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents ' murder at the hands of a mugger . Days later , at their grave , the child vows that " by the spirits of my parents [ I will ] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals " . 
 The early , pulp @-@ inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in Detective Comics # 38 ( April 1940 ) with the introduction of Robin , Batman 's junior counterpart . Robin was introduced , based on Finger 's suggestion , because Batman needed a " Watson " with whom Batman could talk . Sales nearly doubled , despite Kane 's preference for a solo Batman , and it sparked a proliferation of " kid sidekicks " . The first issue of the solo spin @-@ off series Batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies , the Joker and Catwoman , but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death . That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun . 
 By 1942 , the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos . In the years following World War II , DC Comics " adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de @-@ emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy " . The impact of this editorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period ; removed from the " bleak and menacing world " of the strips of the early 1940s , Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a " bright and colorful " environment .

 Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s . In the story " The Mightiest Team in the World " in Superman # 76 ( June 1952 ) , Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other 's secret identity . Following the success of this story , World 's Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together , instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before . The team @-@ up of the characters was " a financial success in an era when those were few and far between " ; this series of stories ran until the book 's cancellation in 1986 . 
 Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist Fredric Wertham 's book Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 . Wertham 's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books , and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth . Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers . Wertham 's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s , eventually leading to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority , a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry . The tendency towards a " sunnier Batman " in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code . Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman ( in 1956 ) and the pre @-@ Barbara Gordon Bat @-@ Girl ( in 1961 ) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay , and the stories took on a campier , lighter feel . 
 In the late 1950s , Batman stories gradually became more science fiction @-@ oriented , an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre . New characters such as Batwoman , Ace the Bat @-@ Hound , and Bat @-@ Mite were introduced . Batman 's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens . In 1960 , Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the Bold # 28 ( Feb. 1960 ) , and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year .

 By 1964 , sales on Batman titles had fallen drastically . Bob Kane noted that , as a result , DC was " planning to kill Batman off altogether " . In response to this , editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles . He presided over drastic changes , beginning with 1964 's Detective Comics # 327 ( May 1964 ) , which was cover @-@ billed as the " New Look " . Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary , and to return him to more detective @-@ oriented stories . He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the character . The Batmobile was redesigned , and Batman 's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat @-@ insignia . The space aliens , time travel , and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman , Ace , and Bat @-@ Mite were retired . Batman 's butler Alfred was killed off ( though his death was quickly reversed ) while a new female relative for the Wayne family , Aunt Harriet , came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson . 
 The debut of the Batman television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character . The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry , and Batman reached a circulation of close to 900 @,@ 000 copies . Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show 's campy nature were introduced into the comics ; the series also initiated the return of Alfred . Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time , the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968 . In the aftermath , the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again . As Julius Schwartz noted , " When the television show was a success , I was asked to be campy , and of course when the show faded , so did the comic books . " 
 Starting in 1969 , writer Dennis O 'Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a " grim avenger of the night " . O 'Neil said his idea was " simply to take it back to where it started . I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories . I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after . " 
 O 'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story " The Secret of the Waiting Graves " ( Detective Comics # 395 , January 1970 ) . Few stories were true collaborations between O 'Neil , Adams , Schwartz , and inker Dick Giordano , and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s ; nevertheless the influence of their work was " tremendous " . Giordano said : " We went back to a grimmer , darker Batman , and I think that 's why these stories did so well ... " While the work of O 'Neil and Adams was popular with fans , the acclaim did little to improve declining sales ; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics # 471 – 476 ( August 1977 – April 1978 ) , which went on to influence the 1989 movie Batman and be adapted for Batman : The Animated Series , which debuted in 1992 . Regardless , circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s , hitting an all @-@ time low in 1985 .

 Frank Miller 's limited series The Dark Knight Returns ( February – June 1986 ) , which tells the story of a 55 @-@ year @-@ old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future , reinvigorated the character . The Dark Knight Returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium 's most noted touchstones . The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character 's popularity . 
 That year Dennis O 'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC 's status quo @-@ altering miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths . O 'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before . One outcome of this new approach was the " Year One " storyline in Batman # 404 – 407 ( February – May 1987 ) , in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redefined the character 's origins . Writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988 's 48 @-@ page one @-@ shot Batman : The Killing Joke , in which the Joker , attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane , cripples Gordon 's daughter Barbara , and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner , physically and psychologically . 
 The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call to vote on whether Jason Todd , the second Robin , lived or died . Voters decided in favor of Jason 's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes ( see Batman : A Death in the Family ) . The following year saw the release of Tim Burton 's Batman feature film , which firmly brought the character back to the public 's attention , grossing millions of dollars at the box office , and millions more in merchandising . However , the three sequels , Tim Burton 's Batman Returns and director Joel Schumacher 's Batman Forever and Batman & Robin , did not perform as well at the box office . The fourth film in the series , the Schumacher @-@ directed Batman & Robin , meanwhile , was a critical and commercial failure . The Batman movie franchise was rebooted with director and co @-@ writer Christopher Nolan 's Batman Begins in 2005 , The Dark Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 . In 1989 , the first issue of Legends of the Dark Knight , the first new solo Batman title in nearly 50 years , sold close to a million copies . 
 The 1993 " Knightfall " story arc introduced a new villain , Bane , who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance . Jean @-@ Paul Valley , known as Azrael , is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne 's convalescence . Writers Doug <unk> , Chuck Dixon , and Alan Grant worked on the Batman titles during " Knightfall " , and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s . 1998 's " Cataclysm " storyline served as the precursor to 1999 's " No Man 's Land " , a year @-@ long storyline that ran through all the Batman @-@ related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake @-@ ravaged Gotham City . At the conclusion of " No Man 's Land " , O 'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck . 
 Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series , was Jeph Loeb . Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale , they wrote two miniseries ( " The Long Halloween " and " Dark Victory " ) that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire rogues gallery ( most notably Two @-@ Face , whose origin was re @-@ envisioned by Loeb ) while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman . In 2003 , Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc : " Batman : Hush " for the main Batman book . The twelve – issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman 's entire rogues gallery , including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd , while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush . While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers , the arc was a sales success for DC . As the storyline was Jim Lee 's first regular comic book work in nearly a decade , the series became # 1 on the Diamond Comic Distributors sales chart for the first time since Batman # 500 ( October 1993 ) and Jason Todd 's appearance laid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick 's subsequent run as writer on Batman , with another multi @-@ issue epic , " Under the Hood " , which ran from Batman # 637 – 650 . 
 In 2005 , DC launched All @-@ Star Batman and Robin , a stand @-@ alone comic series set outside the existing DC Universe . Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee , the series was a commercial success for DC Comics though widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence . 
 Starting in 2006 , the regular writers on Batman and Detective Comics were Grant Morrison and Paul Dini , with Grant Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore ( most notably , the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics , which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind @-@ bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training ) into the character . Morrison 's run climaxed with " Batman R.I.P. " , which brought Batman up against the villainous " Black Glove " organization , which sought to drive Batman into madness . " Batman R.I.P. " segued into Final Crisis ( also written by Morrison ) , which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid . In the 2009 miniseries Batman : Battle for the Cowl , Wayne 's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman , and Wayne 's son Damian becomes the new Robin . In June 2009 , Judd Winick returned to writing Batman , while Grant Morrison was given his own series , titled Batman and Robin . 
 In 2010 , the storyline Batman : The Return of Bruce Wayne saw Bruce travel through history , eventually returning to the present day . Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman , he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well . Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally , which is the central focus of Batman Incorporated . DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in Batman , Detective Comics and Batman and Robin , while Wayne would be the main character in Batman Incorporated .

 In September 2011 , DC Comics ' entire line of superhero books , including its Batman franchise , was canceled and relaunched with new # 1 issues as part of The New 52 reboot . Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in Batman , Detective Comics , Batman and Robin , and Batman : The Dark Knight . Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series . While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers , Batman 's history remains mostly intact . Batman Incorporated was relaunched in 2012 @-@ 2013 to complete the " Leviathan " storyline . 
 Since the beginning of The New 52 , Scott Snyder has been the writer of the flagship Batman title . His first major story arc was " Night of the Owls " , where Batman confronts the Court of Owls , a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries . The second story arc was " Death of the Family " , where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family . The third story arc was " Batman : Zero Year " , which redefined Batman 's origin in The New 52 . It followed Batman # 0 , published in June 2012 , which explored the character 's early years . The final storyline before the Convergence ( 2015 ) event was Endgame , depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City . The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker 's supposed deaths . Starting with # 41 , Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce 's mantle as a new , state @-@ sanctioned , mecha Batman , debuting in the Free Comic Book Day special comic Divergence . However , Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive , albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred . Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend , Julie , but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a " strange star " to swallow the city . Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot ( it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker ) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman , but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne . He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor . Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner , and the government Batman project is shuttered . 
 In 2015 , DC Comics released The Dark Knight III : The Master Race , the sequel to Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again . 
 During the Darkseid War Batman acquires the Mobius Chair and asks " What 's the Joker 's real name ? " and the response causes him to say " No that is not possible . At the end of the Darkseid War Batman reveals to Hal that the chair told him there were three Jokers and during DC Universe - Rebirth # 1 Batman confirms the existence of at least two Jokers : one who was in Civic City killing people while the other Joker had been caught just outside Baltimore three hours ago and was still in transit to Arkham Asylum . " ( F ) rom the looks of the artwork , it appears that the three jokers include the original , Jerry Robinson Joker ; the Brian Bolland Killing Joke Joker ; and the Scott Snyder / Greg Capullo " New 52 " Joker .

 Batman 's secret identity is Bruce Wayne , a wealthy American business magnate who resides outside of Gotham City . As a child , Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents , Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne , which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals . Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family 's fortune , which was amassed through investment in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis , and the profits of Wayne Enterprises , his inherited conglomerate . He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation , but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite . In public , he appears frequently in the company of high @-@ status women , which encourages tabloid gossip . Although he leads an active romantic life , crime @-@ fighting accounts for most of his time . 
 Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two . Interpretations vary depending on the writer , the story , and the timing . Grant Morrison notes that both heroes " believe in the same kind of things " despite the day / night contrast their heroic roles display . He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities . Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes : " Bruce has a butler , Clark has a boss . " T. James <unk> 's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne 's vast personal wealth is important in his life story , and the crucial role it plays in his crusade against crime . 
 Modern stories tend to portray the playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade ( in counterpoint to the post @-@ Crisis Superman , whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity , while the Superman persona is the facade ) . In Batman Unmasked , a television documentary about the psychology of the character , behavioral scientist Benjamin <unk> notes that Batman 's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne 's inherent humanity ; that " Batman , for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it , is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne 's efforts to make the world better " . 
 Will Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that " the confirmation of the Batman 's identity lies with the young audience ... he doesn 't have to be Bruce Wayne ; he just needs the suit and gadgets , the abilities , and most importantly the morality , the humanity . There 's just a sense about him : ' they trust him ... and they 're never wrong . " 
 During the character 's creation , the name " Bruce Wayne " was chosen for certain connotations . According to co @-@ creator Bill Finger , " Bruce Wayne 's first name came from Robert Bruce , the Scottish patriot . Wayne , being a playboy , was a man of gentry . I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism . I tried Adams , Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne . " 
 = = = = Personality = = = = 
 Batman 's primary character traits can be summarized as " wealth ; physical prowess ; deductive abilities and obsession " . The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams . Dennis O 'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes : " Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray <unk> did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other . Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts , nor were they asked to do so . Continuity was not important in those days . " 
 The driving force behind Bruce Wayne 's character is his parents ' murder and the absence of the father . Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman 's background and decided that " there 's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes " . Despite his trauma , he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman , an inspired idea from Wayne 's insight into the criminal mind . 
 Another of Batman 's characterizations is a vigilante ; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents , he must sometimes break laws himself . Although manifested differently by being re @-@ told by different artists , it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman 's origin have never varied at all in the comic books , the " reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions " . The origin is the source of the character 's traits and attributes , which play out in many of the character 's adventures . 
 Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories . Frank Miller views the character as " a <unk> figure , a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order " . Dressed as a bat , Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime @-@ fighting , a fear that originates from the criminals ' own guilty conscience . Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti @-@ heroic traits into Batman 's characterization , such as his brooding personality , willingness to use violence and torture , and increasingly alienated behavior . Batman 's original character was changed when comic book codes went into place and DC editor Whitney Ellsworth reinvented Batman as having a stringent moral code which never allowed him to kill . Miller 's Batman was closer to the original , Golden Age version , who was willing to kill criminals . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 On two occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman . He served briefly while Wayne recovered from spinal injuries caused by Bane in the 1993 Knightfall storyline . He assumed the mantle again in a 2009 comic book while Wayne was believed dead , and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010 . As part of DC 's 2011 editorial mandate , he returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event . 
 In an interview with IGN , Morrison details that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a " reverse " of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin , with , " a more light @-@ hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling , badass Robin " " Morrison explains his intentions for the new characterization of Batman : " Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero . The guy has been Batman 's partner since he was a kid , he 's led the Teen Titans , and he 's trained with everybody in the DC Universe . So he 's a very different kind of Batman . He 's a lot easier ; He 's a lot looser and more relaxed . " 
 Over the years , there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman , or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence . Jean Paul Valley , also known as Azrael , assumed the cowl after the events of the Knightfall saga . James Gordon , donned a mech @-@ suit after the events of Batman : Endgame , and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016 . 
 Additionally , members of the group Batman , Incorporated , Bruce Wayne 's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism , have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world . Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures , including , among them , various former proteges of Bruce Wayne . 
 = = Abilities = = 
 = = = Skills and training = = = 
 Batman has no inherent superhuman powers ; he relies on " his own scientific knowledge , detective skills , and athletic prowess " . In the stories , Batman is regarded as one of the world 's greatest detectives , if not the world 's greatest crime solver . Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius @-@ level intellect , being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe , and having peak human physical conditioning . He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid in his crusade against crime . As a polymath , his knowledge and expertise in almost every discipline known to man is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe . In the Superman : Doomed story arc , Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet . Batman 's inexhaustible wealth allows him access to advanced technology , and as a proficient scientist , he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage . 
 Batman has trained extensively in various martial arts , mastering over 127 different types , making him one of the best hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighters in the DC Universe . Superman describes Batman as " the most dangerous man on Earth " , able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison 's first storyline in JLA . 
 Batman has the ability to function under great physical pain and to withstand telepathy and mind control . He is a master of disguise , multilingual , and an expert in espionage , often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone , a notorious gangster . He is a master of stealth and <unk> , which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable <unk> with little to no harm . 
 Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and often uses extreme methods to extract information from suspects , such as hanging a person over the edge of a building . His intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects . Despite having the potential to harm his enemies , Batman 's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his unwillingness to take life , regardless of the situation he has faced . This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe , most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman .

 Batman 's body armored costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals . The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades , stories , medias and artists ' interpretations , but the most distinctive elements remain consistent : a scallop @-@ hem cape ; a cowl covering most of the face ; a pair of <unk> ears ; a stylized bat emblem on the chest ; and the ever @-@ present utility belt . The costumes ' colors have traditionally been dark blue and grey , although this colorization arose due to the way comic book art was colored ; the character is sometimes depicted in black and grey . Finger and Kane conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit , but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue . In the Tim Burton 's Batman and Batman Returns films , Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background . Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high @-@ tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle . 
 Batman 's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies , having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex . It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts . His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long , gauntlet @-@ like cuffs , although in his earliest appearances he wore short , plain gloves without the scallops . The overall look of the character , particularly the length of the cowl 's ears and of the cape , varies greatly depending on the artist . Dennis O 'Neil said , " We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don 't have to look the same . . . Everybody loves to draw Batman , and everybody wants to put their own spin on it . " 
 Batmobile 
 Batman 's primary vehicle is the Batmobile , which is usually depicted as an imposing black car , often with tailfins that suggest a bat 's wings . Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane ( later called the " Batwing " ) , along with various other means of transportation . In proper practice , the " bat " prefix ( as in Batmobile or batarang ) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment , particularly after some portrayals ( primarily the 1960s Batman live @-@ action television show and the Super Friends animated series ) stretched the practice to campy proportions . For example , the 1960s television show depicted a <unk> , Bat @-@ Sub , and Batcycle , among other bat @-@ themed vehicles . The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such " <unk> " names as the bat @-@ computer , bat @-@ scanner , bat @-@ radar , bat @-@ cuffs , bat @-@ pontoons , bat @-@ drinking water dispenser , bat @-@ camera with polarized bat @-@ filter , bat @-@ shark repellent bat @-@ spray , and bat @-@ rope . The storyline " A Death in the Family " suggests that given Batman 's grim nature , he is unlikely to have adopted the " bat " prefix on his own . In The Dark Knight Returns , Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name " Batmobile " when he was young , since that is what a kid would call Batman 's vehicle . The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books , with the <unk> being given heavier armor and new aesthetics . 
 Utility belt 
 Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt . Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime @-@ fighting tools , weapons , and investigative and technological instruments . Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments , often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it . Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable . This allows him to attach to distant objects , be propelled into the air , and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City . An exception to the range of Batman 's equipment are guns , which he refuses to use on principle , since a gun was used in his parents ' murder . 
 Bat @-@ Signal 
 When Batman is needed , the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat @-@ shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat @-@ Signal , which shines into the night sky , creating a bat @-@ symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham . The origin of the signal varies , depending on the continuity and medium . 
 In various incarnations , most notably the 1960s Batman TV series , Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line , dubbed the Bat @-@ Phone , connected to a bright red telephone ( in the TV series ) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top . The line connects directly to Batman 's residence , Wayne Manor , specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne 's study and the extension phone in the Batcave . 
 = = = = Batcave = = = = 
 The Batcave is Batman 's secret headquarters , consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion , Wayne Manor . It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance , as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime . It also is a storeroom for Batman 's memorabilia . In both the comic Batman : Shadow of the Bat ( issue # 45 ) and the 2005 film Batman Begins , the cave is said to have been part of the Underground Railroad . 
 = = = = Other equipment = = = = 
 Batman uses a large arsenal of specialized , high @-@ tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime , the designs of which usually share a bat motif . Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman 's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics # 29 ( July 1939 ) and the first bat @-@ themed weapons the batarang and the " <unk> " in Detective Comics # 31 and # 32 ( September ; October 1939 ) . 
 = = Supporting characters = = 
 Batman 's interactions with both villains and cohorts have , over time , developed a strong supporting cast of characters . 
 = = = Adversaries = = = 
 Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains . Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman 's character and development , often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime . These foes are commonly referred to as Batman 's " rogues gallery " . Batman 's " most implacable foe " is the Joker , a homicidal maniac with a clown @-@ like appearance . The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary , since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance ; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance , while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance . As a " personification of the irrational " , the Joker represents " everything Batman [ opposes ] " . Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman 's rogues gallery include Catwoman ( a cat burglar antiheroine who is an occasional ally ) , the Penguin , Ra 's al Ghul , Two @-@ Face , the Riddler , the Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze , Poison Ivy , Harley Quinn , Bane , Clayface , and Killer Croc among others .

 Batman gained a butler named Alfred Pennyworth in Batman # 16 ( 1943 ) . He serves as Bruce Wayne 's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity . Having practically raised Bruce since his parents ' death , Alfred knows him on a very personal level . He is sometimes portrayed as the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce . The character " [ lends ] a homey touch to Batman 's environs and [ is ] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand " to the hero and his sidekick . 
 Other supporting characters in the Batman family include Barbara Gordon , Commissioner Gordon 's daughter , who has fought crime under the costumed identity of Batgirl and , during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker , the computer hacker Oracle ; Helena Bertinelli , the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante who has worked with Batman on occasion , primarily as the Huntress and as Batgirl for a brief stint ; Cassandra Cain , the daughter of professional assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva , who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl .

 Commissioner James " Jim " Gordon , Batman 's ally in the Gotham City police , debuted along with Batman in Detective Comics # 27 . Gordon has been a consistent presence ever since . As a crime @-@ fighting everyman , he shares the Batman 's goals while offering , much as the character of Watson does in Sherlock Holmes stories , a normal person 's perspective on the work of an extraordinary genius . 
 = = = = Justice League = = = = 
 Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders . Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman , notably as the co @-@ stars of World 's Finest and Superman / Batman series . In pre @-@ Crisis continuity , the two are depicted as close friends ; however , in current continuity , they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship , with an emphasis on their differing views on crime @-@ fighting and justice . In Superman / Batman # 3 ( December 2003 ) , Superman observes , " Sometimes , I admit , I think of Bruce as a man in a costume . Then , with some gadget from his utility belt , he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind . And how lucky I am to be able to call on him . " 
 = = = = Robin = = = = 
 A widely recognized supporting character for many years has been Batman 's junior counterpart Robin . Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because " Batman didn 't have anyone to talk to , and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking . " The first Robin , Dick Grayson , was introduced in 1940 . In the 1970s he finally grew up , went off to college and became the hero Nightwing . A second Robin , Jason Todd , appeared in the 1980s . In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker , but was later revived . He used the Joker 's old persona , the Red Hood , and became an antihero vigilante with no qualms about using firearms or deadly force . Carrie Kelly , the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories , was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller 's graphic novels The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again , fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity . 
 The third Robin in mainstream comics is Tim Drake , who first appeared in 1989 . He went on to star in his own comic series , and currently goes by Red Robin , a variation on the traditional Robin persona . In the first decade of the new millennium , Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in @-@ universe Robin between stints as her self @-@ made costumed identity The Spoiler , and later as Batgirl . After Stephanie Brown 's apparent death , Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time . The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne , the ten @-@ year @-@ old son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul , in the late 2000s . Damian 's tenure as du jour Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of Batman Incorporated in 2013 . Batman 's next young sidekick is Harper Row , a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the ornithological theme nonetheless ; she debuted the codename and identity of Bluebird in 2014 . Unlike the Robins , Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun , albeit non @-@ lethal ; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that fires taser rounds . In 2015 , a new series titled We Are Robin will focus on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City .

 Helena Wayne is the biological daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle of an alternate universe established in the early 1960s ( Multiverse ) where the Golden Age stories took place . 
 Damian Wayne is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul , and thus the grandson of Batman villain Ra 's al Ghul . 
 = = = Romantic interests = = = 
 Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the " playboy " aspect of Bruce Wayne 's persona . Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman , while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being " Gotham 's most eligible bachelor " . Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically involved with many women throughout his various incarnations . The most significant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle and Talia al Ghul , as both women gave birth to his biological offsprings , Helena Wayne and Damien Wayne , respectively . 
 Some of Batman 's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society , such as Julie Madison , Vicki Vale , and Silver St. Cloud . Batman has also been romantically involved with allies , such as Batwoman ( Kathy Kane ) , Sasha Bordeaux , and Wonder Woman , and with villainesses , such as Catwoman , Jezebel Jet , and Talia al Ghul . 
 = = = = Catwoman = = = = 
 While most of Batman 's romantic relationships tend to be short , the attraction between Batman and Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear . Although Catwoman has been historically portrayed as a <unk> , Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic relationship . 
 After the introduction of DC Comics ' multiverse in the 1960s , DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth @-@ Two Batman , a character from a parallel world . This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth @-@ Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle ( as shown in Superman Family # 211 ) . They have a daughter named Helena Wayne , who , as the Huntress , becomes ( along with Dick Grayson , the Earth @-@ Two Robin ) Gotham 's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner , a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman . 
 In an early 1980s storyline , Selina and Bruce develop a relationship , in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as " Bruce " . However , a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and , apparently , all that transpired during the story arc . Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle ( out of costume ) develop a relationship during The Long Halloween . The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy . However , the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice ; once as Bruce and once as Batman . In Batman : Dark Victory , he stands her up on two holidays , causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while . When the two meet at an opera many years later , during the events of the twelve @-@ issue story arc called Hush , Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina . However , Hush sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire rogues gallery and rekindling their romantic relationship . In Hush , Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman . 
 Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in Catwoman # 1 ( 2011 ) ; the same issue implies that the two have had an ongoing sexual relationship .
