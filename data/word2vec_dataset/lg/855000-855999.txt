 The show has become one of the most popular of the Gundam series in Japan , enjoying high television ratings and DVD sales . In April 2004 , Bandai Visual announced that one million copies of the Gundam SEED DVD had been sold in Japan , with the first volume having sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies . CDs sales have also been high with the single CD from the series ' first ending theme becoming one of the top @-@ selling CDs in Japan during 2002 . By July 2004 , 10 million plastic Gundam SEED models had been sold worldwide . In the same month , Jerry Chu , marketing manager for Bandai Entertainment Inc . , stated the response to Gundam SEED has been highly positive , having broken rating records when it first aired in Japan . Chu added that reaction in the United States was the most enthusiastic Bandai received in the last six years . According to the analyst John Oppliger of <unk> Gundam SEED became the first Gundam series which was widely successful not only among " Gundam fans and hardcore otaku " but also among " mainstream , casual Japanese viewers " . Gundam SEED was the eighth TV Feature Award winner at the Animation Kobe Awards in 2003 . It was the third winner at the Japanese Otaku Awards in 2003 . It won Animage 's twenty @-@ fifth Anime Grand Prix award winner in 2002 , with the characters of Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne topping the male and female anime categories , respectively . It topped the charts in the Newtype magazine reader poll during 2004 . However , the show was not well received by older Japanese fans . In February 2004 , Sunrise 's president , Takayuki Yoshii , stated it was because Gundam SEED incorporated elements from popular live @-@ action television dramas . On the other hand , Bandai Visual reported in April 2004 that Gundam SEED had a wide audience , including both young and older viewers . 
 Gundam SEED has been praised for being a stand @-@ out in a long line of Gundam series with Anime News Network 's Paul Fargo calling it " the best of the alternative timelines , but stands as one of the best Gundam titles " . The story has been praised for its battle sequences as well as its character @-@ driven scenes , neither of which were reviewed to have detracted emphasis from the other . The series was noted to " downshift " in pace from its early episodes as the main characters development began to progress along political themes , which appealed to some audiences . Early in the series , speculations were made with regard to the progress the characters ' relationships . The relationship between Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala earned praise as it resulted in entertaining action scenes between their mobile suits , while in later reviews speculation arose as to whether the two would become allies . 
 The climax has been praised for bringing unexpected inclusions within the war , as well as revelations regarding the characters ' roles . A common comment among writers was that Gundam SEED blended elements from previous Gundam series and displayed it in fast @-@ paced way , making it enjoyable to younger fans but still engaging older fans familiar with previous series . DVD Verdict writer Mitchell Hattaway further noted that while it used elements from other anime series , it still " drew [ him ] in so quickly [ he ] soon found [ himself ] wrapped up in the proceedings " . Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network stated that Gundam SEED adapted the original Mobile Suit Gundam series from 1979 for a modern audience in the same way Mobile Suit Gundam 00 would adapt Mobile Suit Gundam Wing . Bamboo Dong from the same site stated that while this caused the appearance of " hardcore anti @-@ Gundam Seed zealots " who criticized the series for these traits , it was nevertheless entertaining to watch and give anime fans a step into the " Gundam fandom " . 
 The quality of the animation led THEM Anime Reviews ' Derrick L. Tucker to call it " by @-@ and @-@ far the best of any Gundam Series to date " . Additionally , the soundtrack was popular for bringing popular J @-@ pop artists such as Nami Tamaki and T.M. Revolution to perform the theme songs . The casting of many talented voice actors , such as Rie Tanaka , Seki Tomokazu and Houko Kuwashima , provided the emotional depth in scenes that required it . The English dub was reviewed favorably for the most part but comparisons between the English and original Japanese dubbing revealed weaknesses in the portrayal of the characters .

 The sixteenth episode of Gundam SEED features a scene in which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay <unk> lies sleeping naked , suggesting a sexual relationship . The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6 pm when children would be watching . Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it . The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off @-@ screen scene with three shots . 
 = Interstate 35E ( Minnesota ) = 
 Interstate 35E ( I @-@ 35E ) is an Interstate Highway in the US state of Minnesota , passing through downtown Saint Paul . It is one of two through routes for Interstate 35 through the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul , the other being Interstate 35W through Minneapolis . Thus , both ends of I @-@ 35E are shared with I @-@ 35W and I @-@ 35 . This is one of two pairs of suffixed Interstates that has not been eliminated ; I @-@ 35 also splits into I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 35W in Dallas @-@ Fort Worth , Texas . 
 In Minnesota , I @-@ 35E continues the exit numbers of I @-@ 35 , while those of I @-@ 35W begin with 1 just north of the split . I @-@ 35E also carries the legislative route of I @-@ 35 — unsigned legislative route 390 — through the Twin Cities . On the other hand , the portion of I @-@ 35E through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul is a controversial four @-@ lane parkway that heavy trucks are prohibited from using . 
 Interstate 35E in Minnesota is 39 miles ( 63 km ) in length . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The southern terminus of I @-@ 35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville , where I @-@ 35 splits into I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 35W . While I @-@ 35W heads north into Minneapolis , I @-@ 35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul . There is no access between I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 35W here , but Dakota County Road 42 ( exit <unk> ) , immediately to the north , connects the two Interstates in Burnsville . Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 ( MN 77 , signed as Cedar Avenue — exit 92 ) at Apple Valley – Eagan and Interstate 494 ( exit 99 ) in Mendota Heights . Between exits 94 and 97 , the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake . As it crosses I @-@ 494 , I @-@ 35E turns more to the north , crossing MN 110 ( exit 101 ) and MN 13 ( exit 102 ) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul . This portion of I @-@ 35E is four lanes wide ( two in each direction ) , except between MN 77 and MN 110 , where it carries six lanes . The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes — four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN 13 — as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path . The bridge has an innovative automatic anti @-@ icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather . 
 The auxiliary lanes from MN 13 leave at the first exit in Saint Paul , a half interchange with Shepard Road ( exit <unk> ) with ramps toward the bridge . Shepard Road is a four @-@ lane roadway with minimal intersections that follows the Mississippi River northeast into downtown Saint Paul . Immediately after Shepard Road is MN 5 ( West 7th Street ) ( exit <unk> ) , which leads northeast to downtown through the heart of the West Seventh neighborhood . The portion of I @-@ 35E between MN 5 and downtown is a mostly sunken four @-@ lane parkway with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) ( this portion is sometimes referred to as the " practice freeway " by locals ) , a ban on trucks over 9 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 100 kg ) gross vehicle weight , and median landscaping . This parkway was built instead of a typical six @-@ lane freeway because of local opposition . Major interchanges on this section include Ayd Mill Road ( exit 104B ) , a sunken four @-@ lane road to the northwest , and Kellogg Boulevard ( exit 106B ) , which extends in both directions as part of a loop around downtown . 
 The four lanes of I @-@ 35E pass through downtown Saint Paul in the center of the six lanes of I @-@ 94 , with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets . Despite this short overlap , there is no weaving between the two highways , since an exit in each direction of I @-@ 35E — exit 107A from I @-@ 35E north to I @-@ 94 east , and exit <unk> from I @-@ 35E south to I @-@ 94 west — takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway . There are no interchanges on the common segment , and no direct access from I @-@ 35E northbound to I @-@ 94 west or I @-@ 94 eastbound to I @-@ 35E south . Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection ; Ayd Mill Road , further west , nears I @-@ 94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights . Unlike the west split of I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 94 , all ramps are present at the east split ; among other uses , the I @-@ 35E southbound to I @-@ 94 east and I @-@ 94 westbound to I @-@ 35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway 10 ( US 10 ) , which overlaps I @-@ 35E north of downtown , and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway ( US 52 ) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood . 
 From downtown Saint Paul north to the junction with I @-@ 694 west ( exit 113 ) in Little Canada , where US 10 also leaves I @-@ 35E , the highway carries three lanes of traffic in each direction . Major interchanges here include Pennsylvania Avenue ( exit 108 ) , another part of the loop that includes Kellogg Boulevard , and MN 36 ( exit 111 ) . An overlap of about one mile ( 1 @.@ 5 km ) exists between the two interchanges with I @-@ 694 ( exits 113 and 115 ) ; unlike the one with I @-@ 94 , traffic must weave to remain on either road . Heading northbound on I @-@ 35E , the three lanes split into two for I @-@ 694 westbound and two for I @-@ 35E northbound , and then one lane from I @-@ 694 eastbound enters on the left . These three lanes then split into two on the right for I @-@ 694 eastbound and two on the left for I @-@ 35E northbound ; after the turn north , a lane joins on the right from I @-@ 694 westbound traffic . Thus through traffic on I @-@ 694 eastbound must move right at least one lane , and only the center lane of I @-@ 35E north continues through . The configuration in the other direction , where I @-@ 35E southbound and I @-@ 694 westbound merge , is similar , but two lanes of I @-@ 694 westbound enter the merge , and the rightmost of the two I @-@ 35E lanes ends , so all I @-@ 35E south traffic must move at least one lane to the left , while the right lane of I @-@ 694 west can continue straight through . A four @-@ year construction project , called " <unk> the Weave " beginning in 2004 , was completed in 2008 , to eliminate this weaving in a similar method to the I @-@ 94 overlap , with three I @-@ 35E lanes inside three I @-@ 694 lanes , and separate right @-@ side ramps from I @-@ 35E to I @-@ 694 . 
 I @-@ 35E is four lanes wide north of I @-@ 694 ; the third lane added northbound from the I @-@ 694 westbound ramp exits immediately onto County Road E ( exit 115 ) in Vadnais Heights . Other than the northern terminus of I @-@ 35E ( exit 127 ) in Columbus near Forest Lake , where it merges with I @-@ 35W to re @-@ form I @-@ 35 , there are only four interchanges on I @-@ 35E north of I @-@ 694 between Vadnais Heights and Columbus , all for county roads . 
 = = History = = 
 Early plans for the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same alignment as the present I @-@ 35 through the Twin Cities area , but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served . When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955 , a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally . South of the Twin Cities , I @-@ 35 followed the corridor of old US 65 , which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis . I @-@ 35E was located parallel to MN 13 , which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US 65 south of the Minnesota River . North of the metropolitan area , I @-@ 35 closely paralleled US 61 , which passed through Saint Paul ; I @-@ 35W paralleled old US 8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton and then to the present day I @-@ 35E – I @-@ 35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake , near where old US 8 had joined US 61 . The Minnesota Legislature defined I @-@ 35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route 390 , which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I @-@ 35 . 
 I @-@ 35E was completed north of downtown Saint Paul in 1970 . The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I @-@ 694 in Little Canada ; this was completed in the early 1960s , concurrently with I @-@ 694 west to old MN 49 ( Rice Street ) . Later that decade , I @-@ 35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul , opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I @-@ 94 , including the I @-@ 35E / I @-@ 94 concurrency ( and I @-@ 94 in both directions ) . In 1970 , I @-@ 35E was extended north along the I @-@ 35E / I @-@ 694 concurrency in Little Canada – Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake ; the adjacent sections of I @-@ 35 , I @-@ 35W , and I @-@ 694 opened at about the same time . 
 The southern half of I @-@ 35E in the metro area took a lot longer to build . Its first section — a short stretch from MN 110 north to State Highway 5 , including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River — opened in the mid @-@ 1960s . Even though the connecting piece of I @-@ 35W and I @-@ 35 at the southern terminus of I @-@ 35E in Burnsville opened in the mid @-@ 1960s , it was not until the mid @-@ 1980s that I @-@ 35E was completed south of MN 110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley , where there had been a missing link of I @-@ 35E for 20 years . Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake . The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake , as well as a less complicated interchange at I @-@ 494 in Mendota Heights , eliminating access to MN 55 that was part of the earlier plans . 
 = = = Controversy through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul = = = 
 The missing piece through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul , from MN 5 ( West 7th Street ) northeast to I @-@ 94 in downtown Saint Paul , was held up by controversy . Construction began in 1964 , and was planned for completion in the 1970s as a typical six @-@ lane freeway , but in late 1969 , a group of neighbors in the area had formed " Residents in Protest 35E " ( R.I.P. 35E ) to oppose the completion of I @-@ 35E . The group convinced the city to drop its support , and in August it filed a joint lawsuit against the Minnesota Highway Department ( MHD ) and U.S. Department of Transportation along with four neighborhood associations and eight citizens . The parties quickly reached an agreement , favorable to the plaintiffs , to halt construction pending an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) . 
 The Saint Paul City Council decided in late 1974 to support I @-@ 35E , possibly due to the influence of proponents . R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan , and convinced the city council to go along with it . The plan included a four @-@ lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue ( the street chosen for the I @-@ 35E alignment ) , with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I @-@ 35E . The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I @-@ 94 near the State Capitol , where I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 94 were to merge . The EIS was completed in early 1975 , identifying noise pollution , air pollution , vibrations , and slope stability as the main concerns . In addition to the nearby location of historic districts , hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations ; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed . The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I @-@ 35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System , and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice , but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street . 
 A bill passed by the Minnesota Legislature on May 31 , 1975 , imposed a moratorium on building I @-@ 35E , as well as other area freeways such as the canceled I @-@ 335 project and the MN 55 ( Hiawatha Avenue ) upgrade project . This law defined several new legislative routes , which " may be added by order of the commissioner of transportation to the trunk highway system " ( as opposed to other such routes , which were added to that system by the legislature ) : 
 Legislative Route No. 380 . Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [ I @-@ 35E ] at its intersection with Shepard Road in the city of Saint Paul ; thence extending in a northeasterly direction generally following along the course of Shepard Road to a point on Route No. 112 [ Lafayette Freeway ] ; thence extending in a northeasterly direction to a point on Route No. 392 [ I @-@ 94 ] easterly of the downtown area of Saint Paul ; providing a connector route between Route No. 390 and Routes No. 112 and 392 ; 
 Legislative Route No. 381 . Beginning at a point on Route No. 112 [ Lafayette Freeway ] , northerly of the Lafayette Street bridge in the city of Saint Paul ; thence extending in a northwesterly direction to a point on Route No. 390 [ I @-@ 35E ] , southerly of Maryland Avenue in the city of Saint Paul ; providing a connector route between Route No. 112 and Route No. 390 ; and 
 Legislative Route No. 382 . Beginning at a point on Route No. 390 [ I @-@ 35E ] at its junction with Route No. 111 [ MN 5 ] , thence extending in a general northerly direction , within the corridor of the right of way already acquired on the effective date of this act , for Route No. 390 , to a point on Short Line Road ; thence extending in a northeasterly direction within said corridor of right of way to the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Kellogg Boulevard in the city of Saint Paul . 
 Legislative Routes 380 and 381 provided for an alternate alignment of I @-@ 35E along Shepard Road and a northerly extension of the Lafayette Freeway , while Legislative Route 382 was a " four @-@ lane parkway facility " that the MHD could build along the original alignment of I @-@ 35E , but without a connection to I @-@ 94 . The city announced its support of the parkway in August 1976 . 
 An act passed on April 5 , 1978 , added a condition to the definition of Legislative Route 390 ( I @-@ 35E ) : 
 Legislative Route No. 390 [ I @-@ 35E ] shall not include any portion of Legislative Route No. 382 [ the parkway ] as designated by section 161 @.@ 117 or any portion of any route connecting Route No. 382 to Route No. 392 [ I @-@ 94 ] , nor shall it include any portion of trunk highway marked number 3 from trunk highway marked number 110 in Dakota County to East Seventh Street in the city of Saint Paul . 
 At the time , old MN 3 was marked along the nearby Lafayette Freeway ( now US 52 ) from the late 1970s to 1994 . 
 It also allowed a connection from the parkway to I @-@ 94 , but this link could not be controlled access . The Metropolitan Council was to complete a draft EIS for the parkway and I @-@ 35E by September 1 , 1979 , with the cooperation of Minnesota Department of Transportation ( Mn / DOT ) and Saint Paul . There was widespread support for a 45 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 72 km / h ) parkway , with landscaping and a truck restriction , but the non @-@ connection to I @-@ 94 jeopardized federal Interstate funding , since it could no longer be part of the continuous I @-@ 35E . Two notable alternatives came out of the draft EIS — a parkway with or without an I @-@ 94 connection . The parkway with a connection would provide the same level of service as a typical freeway . 
 R.I.P. 35E and other citizens ' groups continued to oppose a direct connection , arguing that it would be no different from a typical freeway , since drivers would be more likely to exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I @-@ 94 . Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981 , supporting a direct connection , along with Mn / DOT and the Metropolitan Council . A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I @-@ 94 , and allowed Route 390 ( I @-@ 35E ) to use Route 382 ( the parkway ) . The final EIS was approved at about that time , and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983 . 
 The suit alleged that the EIS focused almost exclusively on the Pleasant Avenue alignment , and that it did not consider the effect of a direct connection on speed limit compliance ; faster traffic would mean more noise . Judge Paul Magnuson ruled in February 1984 that the EIS was valid , stating that the Pleasant Avenue alternative was the only reasonable one that would meet goals . This court order has been interpreted as a legal contract , prohibiting the state from raising the speed limit or allowing trucks . Construction went forward , and I @-@ 35E was opened from MN 5 north to Saint Clair Avenue in 1984 , using original bridges that had been built for three lanes in each direction . Further extensions , including all new bridges , were opened to Grand Avenue in 1986 , to Kellogg Boulevard in November 1988 , and to I @-@ 94 on October 15 , 1990 , 26 years after construction began . The 1990 opening ceremony of I @-@ 35E in downtown Saint Paul was attended by a group of highway experts from the Soviet Union , and both the US and Soviet national anthems were played . 
 = = = Later changes = = = 
 The original plans for the I @-@ 94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul did not include the right @-@ side ramps that eliminate weaving . The ramp from I @-@ 35E northbound to I @-@ 94 eastbound was added when I @-@ 35E was finally completed in 1990 , and a five @-@ year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I @-@ 35E southbound to I @-@ 94 westbound , as well as a direct ramp from I @-@ 35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway ( US 52 ) to avoid weaving across I @-@ 94 east . This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I @-@ 35E and I @-@ 94 would not be able to handle the extra load from the completed I @-@ 35E parkway . 
 When the first piece of the parkway opened in 1984 , unused provisions , pending more study , were added for a direct link to Ayd Mill Road , a sunken four @-@ lane road with minimal intersections that leads northwest from I @-@ 35E . The ramps were built and temporarily opened in 1992 for high @-@ occupancy vehicles , due to the closure of the nearby Lafayette Bridge ( US 52 ) for reconstruction . The ramps were reopened on June 12 , 2002 , as a test , and remain open as of 2014 . A controversial extension of Ayd Mill Road to I @-@ 94 remains on the table . 
 The 1964 Lexington Bridge across the Mississippi River was replaced by a new bridge , built from 2001 to 2004 , due to deterioration of the old structure including cracks in steel beams . <unk> the Weave , a project to eliminate weaving at the I @-@ 694 overlap , was completed in 2008 . 
 The 1965 bridge just north of downtown Saint Paul carrying a daily traffic volume of 148 @,@ 000 vehicles over Cayuga Street and the BNSF Railway line was rated by Mn / DOT as meeting minimum tolerable limits in 2006 . Its superstructure and substructure were described as poor with advanced section loss , deterioration , spalling , or scour . As the fourth busiest bridge in the state , it was scrutinized following the collapse of the I @-@ 35W Mississippi River Bridge in nearby Minneapolis on August 1 , 2007 .

 Born and raised in Busan , South Korea , Kwon Ji @-@ yong began his career at age five as part of the group Little Roo <unk> . After releasing a Christmas album , the group 's contract was terminated by their record company , which Kwon described as " shock [ ing ] . " Although he vowed to his mother that he " wouldn 't [ become a singer ] again , " he was scouted by SM Entertainment while on a ski trip with his family . He was a trainee under the record label for five years ( from 8 – 13 years old ) , specializing in dance before he left as he was unclear about what he wanted to do . 
 In third grade , Kwon was introduced to the American rap group Wu @-@ Tang Clan by a friend . Inspired by their music , he developed an interest in rapping and began taking class . Under People Crew 's tutelage , he participated in the release of the Korean hip @-@ hop Flex album in 2001 , becoming the youngest Korean rapper at just 13 years old . Although he wrote his own lyrics for the song , he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical " I 'm young , but I 'm the best . " Kwon caught the interest of Sean of the hip @-@ hop duo <unk> from YG Entertainment , who later recommended him to CEO Yang Hyun Suk . After signing a contract with the record label , Kwon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching them water bottles during dance practice . He and another trainee Dong Young @-@ <unk> , originally planned to debut as the hip @-@ hop duo <unk> , with him choosing the stage name of G @-@ Dragon ( " Ji " is pronounced like " G " , and Yong is Korean for Dragon ) . After six years of training , Kwon made several featured appearances on other artists ' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name " <unk> . " G @-@ Dragon made his official debut as the leader of the group Big Bang in 2006 , after six years of training under YG Entertainment , with Dong Young @-@ <unk> ( who chose the stage @-@ name Taeyang ) and three other members ( T.O.P , Daesung , & Seungri ) . 
 The formation of the group was documented on television , and though there were initially six members , Jang Hyun @-@ <unk> was dropped before the official debut . The group 's debut was fairly successful , with their first single netting in sales of over 40 @,@ 000 copies . It spawned several airplay singles , including " La La La " , " We Belong Together " and " Forever with You " which featured label @-@ mate Park Bom . The album also included G @-@ Dragon 's first solo song , a cover of the American alternative rock group Maroon 5 's single " This Love .

However , EMI , the record label that distributed " Right Round " said that they saw no similarities between these two songs . On March 6 , 2010 , YG Entertainment announced that they personally contacted Flo Rida 's representatives requesting that he feature in G @-@ Dragon 's live album , Shine a Light , to which Flo Rida accepted . In support of his album , G @-@ Dragon staged his first solo concert at the Olympic Park in December 2009 . Entitled Shine a Light , the name of the concert was derived from the lyrics to his song " A Boy . " The concert subsequently sparked controversy following complaints of obscenity and suggestive content .

 On October 5 , 2011 , it was reported that G @-@ Dragon was tested positive for marijuana . His urine test came back negative but a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair . The tests were done in early June and the results came back in August . As it was a first offense with a minuscule amount , it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged . He allegedly accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May . He was the only one at the party who was later tipped off to Korean authorities . He confessed that he smoked the cigarette that was offered to him , but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette , he threw it away . 
 The scandal caused a halt to his promotions , and YG Entertainment issued a statement that he was being given time to reflect on his mistake . Because he was not charged , he did not lose any endorsers and later made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV <unk> with his group Big Bang .

 = Angevin kings of England = 
 The Angevins / <unk> / ( " from Anjou " ) were an English royal house in the 12th and early 13th centuries ; its monarchs were Henry II , Richard I and John . In the 10 years from 1144 , two successive counts of Anjou , Geoffrey and his son , the future Henry II , won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the Angevin Empire . As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding Norman and subsequent Plantagenet realms . Geoffrey became Duke of Normandy in 1144 and died in 1151 . In 1152 his heir , Henry , added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine . Henry also inherited the claim of his mother , Empress Matilda , the daughter of King Henry I , to the English throne , to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of King Stephen . 
 Henry was succeeded by his third son , Richard , whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet " Cœur de Lion " or " Lionheart " . He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life , perhaps as little as six months . Despite this Richard remains an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France , and is one of very few kings of England remembered by his nickname as opposed to regnal number . 
 When Richard died , his brother John – Henry ’ s fifth and only surviving son – took the throne . In 1204 John lost the Angevins ' continental territories , including Anjou , to the French crown . The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John 's son — Henry III of England — being considered the first Plantagenet — a name derived from a nickname for Geoffrey . Where no distinction is made between the Angevins — and Angevin era — and subsequent English Kings , Henry II is the first Plantagenet king . From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of Richard II before dividing into two competing cadet branches , the House of Lancaster and the House of York . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 = = = Angevin = = = 
 The adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou — beginning with Henry II — descended from Geoffrey and Matilda ; their characteristics , descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid @-@ twelfth to early @-@ thirteenth centuries . In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou , or any sovereign , government derived from this . As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler . As such Angevin is also used for other Counts and Dukes of Anjou ; including the three kings ' ancestors , their cousins who held the crown of Jerusalem and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the Capetian House of Anjou and the Valois House of Anjou . 
 = = = Angevin Empire = = = 
 The term " Angevin Empire " was coined in 1887 by Kate Norgate . As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to — if at all — by clumsy circumlocutions such as our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be or the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father . Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial . In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term espace Plantagenet was acceptable . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The Angevins descend from Geoffrey II , Count of Gâtinais and Ermengarde of Anjou . In 1060 this couple inherited , via cognatic kinship , the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called Ingelger . The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda , the only surviving legitimate child of Henry I of England , was part of struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of Normandy , Brittany , Poitou , Blois , Maine and the kings of France . It was from this marriage that Geoffrey ’ s son , Henry , inherited the claims to England , Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties . This was the third attempt by Geoffrey ’ s father Fulk V to build a political alliance with Normandy . The first was by marrying his daughter Matilda to Henry ’ s heir William Adelin , who drowned in the wreck of the White Ship . Fulk then married his daughter Sibylla to William Clito , heir to Henry 's older brother Robert Curthose , but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William ’ s rival claim to his lands . 
 = = Inheritance custom and Angevin practice = = 
 As society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century , inheritance customs developed that allowed daughters ( in the absence of sons ) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates . The twelfth @-@ century chronicler Ralph de Diceto noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest . The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king ( and widow of an emperor ) occurred in this context . It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir , but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito ’ s rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak . Even so , it is probable that , should the marriage be childless , King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as Theobald II , Count of Champagne or Stephen of Blois who in the event did seize King Henry ’ s English crown . King Henry ’ s great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple , described as " the heir to the Kingdom " , is understandable in the light of this situation . Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother , Geoffrey . 
 According to William of Newburgh writing in the 1190s , the plan failed because of Geoffrey ’ s early death in 1151 . The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen , and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou . Henry ’ s brother Geoffrey died in 1154 , too soon to receive Anjou , but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord . 
 The unity of Henry ’ s assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family , influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure . The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation . Indeed , if Henry II 's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young , the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered . Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together . For example , in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John . This was complicated by the Angevins ' being subjects of the kings of France , who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them . This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey 's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204 . On the Young King ’ s death in 1183 , Richard became heir in chief , but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance . More by accident than design this meant that , while Richard inherited the patrimony , John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany . By the mid @-@ thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an Angevin Empire as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost . 
 = = Arrival in England = = 
 Henry I of England named his daughter Matilda heir ; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine , while her cousin Stephen was closer in Boulogne , giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England . Matilda 's husband Geoffrey , though he had little interest in England , commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy . To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen , instigating the civil war known as the Anarchy . In 1141 she captured Stephen at the battle of Lincoln , prompting the collapse of his support . While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years , Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory . She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half @-@ brother Robert , 1st Earl of Gloucester , allowing Stephen resumed control of much of England . Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead — beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9 — with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king . In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance . Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion : 
 In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and Geoffrey , who would have received England and Anjou respectively . 
 Louis VII of France divorced Eleanor of Aquitaine whom Henry quickly married , greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of Duchy of Aquitaine . 
 In 1153 Stephen ’ s son Eustace died . The disheartened Stephen , who had also recently been widowed , gave up the fight and , with the Treaty of Wallingford , repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142 : Stephen would be king for life , Henry his successor , preserving Stephen ’ s second son William 's rights to his family estates . Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154 . 
 Henry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father ’ s and grandfathers ’ lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties . In 1162 Theobald , Archbishop of Canterbury , died , and Henry saw an opportunity to re @-@ establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend Thomas Becket to succeed him . Instead , Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors . Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly : over church tenures , Henry ’ s brother ’ s marriage and taxation . Henry reacted by getting Becket , and other members of the English episcopate , to recognise sixteen ancient customs — governing relations between the king , his courts , and the church — in writing for the first time in the Constitutions of Clarendon . When Becket tried to leave the country without permission , Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket ’ s time as chancellor . In response Becket fled into exile for five years . Relations later improved , allowing Becket 's return , but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry 's son as coregent by the Archbishop of York as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him . When he heard the news , Henry said : " What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low @-@ born clerk . " Three of Henry 's men killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him . Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket 's death . The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah , so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks . 
 In 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power , including Strongbow . Pope Adrian IV had given Henry a papal blessing to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church . Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry ’ s brother , William , but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead . Instead Henry ’ s designs were made plain when he gave the lordship of Ireland to his youngest son , John . 
 In 1172 Henry II tried to give his landless youngest son John a wedding gift of the three castles of Chinon , Loudun and Mirebeau . This angered the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a rebellion by Henry II 's wife and three eldest sons . Louis VII supported the rebellion to destabilise his Henry II . William the Lion and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority . In Le Mans in 1182 , Henry II gathered his children to plan a partible inheritance in which his eldest son ( also called Henry ) would inherit England , Normandy and Anjou ; Richard the Duchy of Aquitaine ; Geoffrey Brittany , and John Ireland . This degenerated into further conflict . The younger Henry rebelled again before he died of dysentery and , in 1186 , Geoffrey died after a tournament accident . In 1189 Richard and Philip II of France took advantage of Henry ’ s failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms , including naming Richard as his sole heir . Two days later the old king died , defeated and miserable in the knowledge that even his favoured son John had rebelled . This fate was seen as the price he paid for the murder of Beckett .

 On the day of Richard 's English coronation there was a mass slaughter of Jews , described by Richard of Devizes as a " holocaust " . After his coronation , Richard put the Angevin Empire 's affairs in order before joining the Third Crusade to the Middle East in early 1190 . Opinions of Richard by his contemporaries varied . He had rejected and humiliated the king of France 's sister ; deposed the king of Cyprus and sold the island ; insulted and refused to give spoils from the Third Crusade to Leopold V , Duke of Austria , and allegedly arranged the assassination of Conrad of Montferrat . His cruelty was exemplified by the massacre of 2 @,@ 600 prisoners in Acre . However , Richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners . Despite victories in the Third Crusade he failed to capture Jerusalem , retreating from the Holy Land with a small band of followers . 
 Richard was captured by Leopold on his return journey . He was transferred to Henry VI , Holy Roman Emperor , and a 25 @-@ percent tax on goods and income was required to pay his 150 @,@ 000 @-@ mark ransom . Philip II of France had overrun Normandy , while John of England controlled much of Richard 's remaining lands . However , when Richard returned to England he forgave John and re @-@ established his control . Leaving England permanently in 1194 , Richard fought Phillip for five years for the return of holdings seized during his incarceration . On the brink of victory , he was wounded by an arrow during the siege of Château de <unk> @-@ Chabrol and died ten days later . 
 His failure to produce an heir caused a succession crisis . Anjou , Brittany , Maine and Touraine chose Richard 's nephew Arthur as heir , while John succeeded in England and Normandy . Philip II of France again destabilised the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland , supporting his vassal Arthur 's claim to the English crown . Eleanor supported her son John , who was victorious at the Battle of Mirebeau and captured the rebel leadership . 
 Arthur was murdered ( allegedly by John ) , and his sister Eleanor would spend the rest of her life in captivity . John 's behaviour drove a number of French barons to side with Phillip , and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John 's control of his continental possessions — the de facto end of the Angevin Empire , although Henry III would maintain his claim until 1259 . 
 After re @-@ establishing his authority in England , John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou by drawing the French from Paris while another army ( under Otto IV , Holy Roman Emperor ) attacked from the north . However , his allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines in one of the most decisive battles in French history . John 's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown , with John agreeing to a five @-@ year truce . Philip 's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France , and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France . 
 John 's French defeats weakened his position in England . The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the Magna Carta , which limited royal power and established common law . This would form the basis of every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries . The barons and the crown failed to abide by the Magna Carta , leading to the First Barons ' War when rebel barons provoked an invasion by Prince Louis . Many historians use John 's death and William Marshall 's appointment as protector of nine @-@ year @-@ old Henry III to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty . Marshall won the war with victories at Lincoln and Dover in 1217 , leading to the Treaty of Lambeth in which Louis renounced his claims . In victory , the Marshal Protectorate reissued the Magna Carta as the basis of future government .

 Historians use the period of Prince Louis 's invasion to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty . The outcome of the military situation was uncertain at John 's death ; William Marshall saved the dynasty , forcing Louis to renounce his claim with a military victory . However , Philip had captured all the Angevin possessions in France except Gascony . This collapse had several causes , including long @-@ term changes in economic power , growing cultural differences between England and Normandy and ( in particular ) the fragile , familial nature of Henry 's empire . Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259 , but John 's continental losses and the consequent growth of Capetian power during the 13th century marked a " turning point in European history " . 
 Richard of York adopted " Plantagenet " as a family name for himself and his descendants during the 15th century . Plantegenest ( or Plante Genest ) was Geoffrey 's nickname , and his emblem may have been the common broom ( planta genista in medieval Latin ) . It is uncertain why Richard chose the name , but it emphasised Richard 's hierarchal status as Geoffrey 's ( and six English kings ' ) patrilineal descendant during the Wars of the Roses . The retrospective use of the name for Geoffrey 's male descendants was popular during the Tudor period , perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard 's great @-@ grandson Henry VIII of England . 
 = = = Descent = = = 
 Through John , descent from the Angevins ( legitimate and illegitimate ) is widespread and includes all subsequent monarchs of England and the United Kingdom . He had five legitimate children with Isabella : 
 Henry III – king of England for most of the 13th century 
 Richard – a noted European leader and King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire 
 Joan – married Alexander II of Scotland , becoming his queen consort . 
 Isabella – married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II . 
 Eleanor – married William Marshal 's son ( also called William ) and , later , English rebel Simon de Montfort . 
 John also had illegitimate children with a number of mistresses , including nine sons — Richard , Oliver , John , Geoffrey , Henry , Osbert Gifford , Eudes , Bartholomew and ( probably ) Philip — and three daughters — Joan , Maud and ( probably ) Isabel . Of these Joan was the best known , since she married Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales . 
 = = = Contemporary opinion = = = 
 The chronicler Gerald of Wales borrowed elements of the Melusine legend to give the Angevins a demonic origin , and the kings were said to tell jokes about the stories . 
 Henry was an unpopular king , and few grieved his death ; William of Newburgh wrote during the 1190s , " In his own time he was hated by almost everyone " . He was widely criticised by contemporaries , even in his own court . Henry 's son Richard 's contemporary image was more nuanced , since he was the first king who was also a knight . Known as a valiant , competent and generous military leader , he was criticised by chroniclers for taxing the clergy for the Crusade and his ransom ; clergy were usually exempt from taxes . 
 Chroniclers Richard of Devizes , William of Newburgh , Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were generally unsympathetic to John 's behaviour under Richard , but more tolerant of the earliest years of John 's reign . Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall , neither of whom were satisfied with John 's performance as king . His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king 's death : Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris . The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam , but this is not believed by modern historians . 
 = = = Constitutional impact = = = 
 Many of the changes Henry introduced during his rule had long @-@ term consequences . His legal innovations form part of the basis for English law , with the Exchequer of Pleas a forerunner of the Common Bench at Westminster . Henry 's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries ' legal reforms : Philip Augustus ' creation of itinerant bailli , for example , drew on Henry 's model . Henry 's intervention in Brittany , Wales and Scotland had a significant long @-@ term impact on the development of their societies and governments . John 's reign , despite its flaws , and his signing of the Magna Carta were seen by Whig historians as positive steps in the constitutional development of England and part of a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in medieval England . Winston Churchill said , " [ W ] hen the long tally is added , it will be seen that the British nation and the English @-@ speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns " . The Magna Carta was reissued by the Marshal Protectorate and later as a foundation of future government . 
 = = = Architecture , language and literature = = = 
 There was no distinct Angevin or Plantagenet culture that would distinguish or set them apart from their neighbours in this period . Robert of Torigni recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy , England , Aquitaine , Anjou , Maine and <unk> . However this patronage had no distinctive style except in the use of circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type . Similarly amongst the multiple vernaculars — French , English and Occitan — there was not a unifying literature . French was the lingua franca of the secular elite and Latin or the church . 
 The Angevins were closely associated with the Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou . Henry 's aunt was Abbess , <unk> retired there to be a nun and the abbey was originally the site of his grave and those of Eleanor , Richard , his daughter Joan , grandson Raymond VII of Toulouse and John 's wife — Isabella of Angoulême . Henry III visited the abbey in 1254 to reorder these tombs and requested his heart be buried with them . 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 According to historian John Gillingham , Henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years and Richard ( whose reputation has " fluctuated wildly " ) is remembered largely because of his military exploits . Steven Runciman , in the third volume of the History of the Crusades , wrote : " He was a bad son , a bad husband , and a bad king , but a gallant and splendid soldier . " Eighteenth @-@ century historian David Hume wrote that the Angevins were pivotal in creating a genuinely English monarchy and , ultimately , a unified Britain . Interpretations of the Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been revised ; although the charter 's symbolic , constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable , for most historians it is a failed peace agreement between factions . John 's opposition to the papacy and his promotion of royal rights and prerogatives won favour from 16th @-@ century Tudors . John Foxe , William Tyndale and Robert Barnes viewed John as an early Protestant hero , and Foxe included the king in his Book of Martyrs . John Speed 's 1632 Historie of Great Britaine praised John 's " great renown " as king , blaming biased medieval chroniclers for the king 's poor reputation . Similarly , later Protestant historians view Henry 's role in Thomas Becket 's death and his disputes with the French as worthy of praise . Similarly , increased access to contemporary records during the late Victorian era led to a recognition of Henry 's contributions to the evolution of English law and the exchequer . William Stubbs called Henry a " legislator king " because of his responsibility for major , long @-@ term reforms in England ; in contrast , Richard was " a bad son , a bad husband , a selfish ruler , and a vicious man " . 
 The growth of the British Empire led historian Kate Norgate to begin detailed research into Henry 's continental possessions and create the term " Angevin Empire " during the 1880s . However , 20th @-@ century historians challenged many of these conclusions . During the 1950s , Jacques <unk> , John Jolliffe and others focused on the nature of Henry 's " empire " ; French scholars , in particular , analysed the mechanics of royal power during this period . Anglocentric aspects of many histories of Henry 's reign were challenged beginning in the 1980s , with efforts to unite British and French historical analyses of the period . Detailed study of Henry 's written records has cast doubt on earlier interpretations ; Robert Eyton 's 1878 volume ( tracing Henry 's itinerary by deductions from pipe rolls ) , for example , has been criticised for not acknowledging uncertainty . Although many of Henry 's royal charters have been identified , their interpretation , the financial information in the pipe rolls and broad economic data from his reign has proven more challenging than once thought . Significant gaps in the historical analysis of Henry remain , particularly about his rule in Anjou and the south of France . 
 Interest in the morality of historical figures and scholars waxed during the Victorian period , leading to increased criticism of Henry 's behaviour and Becket ’ s death . Historians relied on the judgement of chroniclers to focus on John 's ethos . Norgate wrote that John 's downfall was due not to his military failures but his " almost superhuman wickedness " , and James Ramsay blamed John 's family background and innate cruelty for his downfall . 
 Richard 's sexuality has been controversial since the 1940s , when John Harvey challenged what he saw as " the conspiracy of silence " surrounding the king 's homosexuality with chronicles of Richard 's behaviour , two public confessions , penances and childless marriage . Opinion remains divided , with Gillingham arguing against Richard 's homosexuality and Jean Flori acknowledging its possibility . 
 According to recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren , although John was an unsuccessful monarch his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th @-@ century chroniclers . Jim Bradbury echoes the contemporary consensus that John was a " hard @-@ working administrator , an able man , an able general " with , as Turner suggests , " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " . John Gillingham ( author of a biography of Richard I ) agrees and judges John to be a less @-@ effective general than Turner and Warren do . Bradbury takes a middle view , suggesting that modern historians have been overly lenient in evaluating John 's flaws . Popular historian Frank McLynn wrote that the king 's modern reputation amongst historians is " bizarre " and , as a monarch , John " fails almost all those [ tests ] that can be legitimately set " . 
 = = = In popular culture = = = 
 Henry II appears as a fictionalised character in several modern plays and films . The king is a central character in James Goldman 's play The Lion in Winter ( 1966 ) , depicting an imaginary encounter between Henry 's family and Philip Augustus over Christmas 1183 at Chinon . Philip 's strong character contrasts with John , an " effete weakling " . In the 1968 film , Henry is a sacrilegious , fiery and determined king . Henry also appears in Jean Anouilh 's play Becket , which was filmed in 1964 . The Becket conflict is the basis for T. S. Eliot 's play Murder in the Cathedral , an exploration of Becket 's death and Eliot 's religious interpretation of it . 
 During the Tudor period , popular representations of John emerged . He appeared as a " proto @-@ Protestant martyr " in the anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John and John Bale 's morality play Kynge Johan , in which John attempts to save England from the " evil agents of the Roman Church " . Shakespeare 's anti @-@ Catholic King John draws on The Troublesome Reign , offering a " balanced , dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto @-@ Protestant victim of Rome 's machinations and as a weak , selfishly motivated ruler " . Anthony Munday 's plays The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington demonstrate many of John 's negative traits , but approve of the king 's stand against the Roman Catholic Church . 
 Richard is the subject of two operas : in 1719 George Frideric Handel used Richard 's invasion of Cyprus as the plot for Riccardo Primo and in 1784 André Grétry wrote Richard Coeur @-@ de @-@ lion . 
 = = = = Robin Hood = = = = 
 The earliest ballads of Robin Hood such as those compiled in A Gest of Robyn <unk> associated the character with a king named " Edward " and the setting is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th or the 14th century . As the historian J.C. Holt notes at some time around the 16th century , tales of Robin Hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of Richard , Robin being driven to outlawry during John ’ s misrule , while in the narratives Richard was largely absent , away at the Third Crusade . Plays such as Robert Davenport 's King John and Matilda further developed the Elizabethan works in the mid @-@ 17th century , focussing on John 's tyranny and transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons . Graham Tulloch noted that unfavourable 19th @-@ century fictionalised depictions of John were influenced by Sir Walter Scott 's historical romance Ivanhoe . They , in turn , influenced the children 's author Howard Pyle 's The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood ( 1883 ) which cast John as the principal villain of the Robin Hood narrative . During the 20th century , John also appeared in fictional books and films with Robin Hood . Sam De Grasse 's John , in the 1922 film version , commits atrocities and acts of torture . Claude Rains ' John , in the 1938 version with Errol Flynn , began a cinematic trend in which John was an " effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay @-@ at @-@ home " . John 's character highlights Richard 's virtues and contrasts with Guy of Gisbourne , the " swashbuckling villain " opposing Robin . In the Disney cartoon version , John ( voiced by Peter Ustinov ) is a " cowardly , <unk> lion " .

 During the 13th century , a folktale developed in which Richard ’ s minstrel <unk> roamed ( singing a song known only to him and Richard ) to find Richard 's prison . This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry 's opera Richard Coeur @-@ de @-@ Lion , and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe 's film version of Ivanhoe . Sixteenth @-@ century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary ( and supporter ) of Richard the Lionheart ; Robin became an outlaw during the reign of Richard 's evil brother , John , while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade . 
 = Gilbert and Sullivan = 
 Gilbert and Sullivan refers to the Victorian @-@ era theatrical partnership of the librettist W. S. Gilbert ( 1836 – 1911 ) and the composer Arthur Sullivan ( 1842 – 1900 ) and to the works they jointly created . The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896 , of which H.M.S. Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado are among the best known . 
 Gilbert , who wrote the words , created fanciful " topsy @-@ turvy " worlds for these operas where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion — fairies rub elbows with British lords , flirting is a capital offence , gondoliers ascend to the monarchy , and pirates emerge as noblemen who have gone astray . Sullivan , six years Gilbert 's junior , composed the music , contributing memorable melodies that could convey both humour and pathos . 
 Their operas have enjoyed broad and enduring international success and are still performed frequently throughout the English @-@ speaking world . Gilbert and Sullivan introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theatre through the 20th century . The operas have also influenced political discourse , literature , film and television and have been widely parodied and pastiched by <unk> . Producer Richard D 'Oyly Carte brought Gilbert and Sullivan together and nurtured their collaboration . He built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 to present their joint works ( which came to be known as the Savoy Operas ) and founded the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , which performed and promoted Gilbert and Sullivan 's works for over a century . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 = = = Gilbert before Sullivan = = = 
 Gilbert was born in London on 18 November 1836 . His father , William , was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories , some of which included illustrations by his son . In 1861 , to supplement his income , the younger Gilbert began writing illustrated stories , poems and articles of his own , many of which would later be mined as inspiration for his plays and operas , particularly Gilbert 's series of illustrated poems , the Bab Ballads . 
 In the Bab Ballads and his early plays , Gilbert developed a unique " topsy @-@ turvy " style in which humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences , however absurd . Director and playwright Mike Leigh described the " Gilbertian " style as follows : 
 With great fluidity and freedom , [ Gilbert ] continually challenges our natural expectations . First , within the framework of the story , he makes bizarre things happen , and turns the world on its head . Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff , the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes , and so on , and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts ... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand , to blend the surreal with the real , and the caricature with the natural . In other words , to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way . 
 Gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction , following theatrical reformer Tom Robertson . At the time Gilbert began writing , theatre in Britain was in disrepute . Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre , especially beginning with his six short family @-@ friendly comic operas , or " entertainments " , for Thomas German Reed . 
 At a rehearsal for one of these entertainments , Ages Ago ( 1869 ) , the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend , the young composer Arthur Sullivan . Two years later , Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together . Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert 's theatrical style . He continued to write humorous verse , stories and plays , including the comic operas Our Island Home ( 1870 ) and A Sensation Novel ( 1871 ) , and the blank verse comedies The Princess ( 1870 ) , The Palace of Truth ( 1870 ) , and Pygmalion and Galatea ( 1871 ) . 
 = = = Sullivan before Gilbert = = = 
 Sullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842 . His father was a military bandmaster , and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight , he was proficient with all the instruments in the band . In school he began to compose anthems and songs . In 1856 , he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig , where he also took up conducting . His graduation piece , completed in 1861 , was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare 's The Tempest . Revised and expanded , it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation . He began building a reputation as England 's most promising young composer , composing a symphony , a concerto , and several overtures , among them the Overture di Ballo , in 1870 . 
 His early major works for the voice included The Masque at Kenilworth ( 1864 ) ; an oratorio , The Prodigal Son ( 1869 ) ; and a dramatic cantata , On Shore and Sea ( 1871 ) . He composed a ballet , L 'Île Enchantée ( 1864 ) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays . Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E , Concerto for Cello and Orchestra , and Overture in C ( In Memoriam ) ( all three of which premiered in 1866 ) . These commissions , however , were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat . He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns , popular songs , and parlour ballads . 
 Sullivan 's first foray into comic opera was Cox and Box ( 1866 ) , written with librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends . Public performance followed , with W. S. Gilbert ( then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine Fun ) saying that Sullivan 's score " is , in many places , of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded . " Nonetheless , it proved highly successful , and is still regularly performed today . Sullivan and Burnand 's second opera , The Contrabandista ( 1867 ) was not as successful .

 = = = First collaborations = = = 
 = = = = Thespis = = = = 
 In 1871 , producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment , Thespis , at his Gaiety Theatre , a large West End house . The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods , grown elderly , are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th @-@ century actors and actresses , one of whom is the eponymous Thespis , the Greek father of the drama . Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach 's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène , which ( in translation ) then dominated the English musical stage . 
 Thespis opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances . It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season , and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety , but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration . Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works , it was hastily prepared , and its nature was more risqué , like Gilbert 's earlier burlesques , with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors . Two of the male characters were played by women , whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned . The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost , except for one song that was published separately , a chorus that was re @-@ used in The Pirates of Penzance , and the Act II ballet music . 
 Over the next three years , Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again , but each man became more eminent in his field . Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on Happy Arcadia ( 1872 ) and with Alfred Cellier on Topsyturveydom ( 1874 ) , and wrote The Wicked World ( 1873 ) Sweethearts ( 1874 ) and several other libretti , farces , extravaganzas , fairy comedies , dramas and adaptations . Sullivan completed his Festival Te Deum ( 1872 ) ; another oratorio , The Light of the World ( 1873 ) ; his only song cycle , The Window ; or , The Song of the Wrens ( 1871 ) ; incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor ( 1874 ) ; and more songs , parlour ballads , and hymns , including " Onward , Christian Soldiers " ( 1872 ) . At the same time , the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population ; improvement in education and the standard of living , especially of the middle class ; improving public transportation ; and installation of street lighting , which made travel home from the theatre safer . The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened . 
 = = = = Trial by Jury = = = = 
 In 1874 , Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer – conductor Carl Rosa , whose wife would have played the leading role , but her death in childbirth cancelled the project . Not long afterwards , Richard D 'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre , and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach 's La Périchole . Carte knew about Gilbert 's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it . Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875 , and the composer was delighted with it ; Trial by Jury was composed and staged in a matter of weeks . 
 The piece is one of Gilbert 's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession , based on his short experience as a barrister . It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit . The defendant argues that damages should be slight , since " he is such a very bad lot , " while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks " substantial damages . " After much argument , the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself . With Sullivan 's brother , Fred , as the Learned Judge , the opera was a runaway hit , outlasting the run of La Périchole . Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed . 
 Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the " patter " ( comic ) baritone roles in the later operas . F. C. Burnand wrote that he " was one of the most naturally comic little men I ever came across . He , too , was a first @-@ rate practical musician ... As he was the most absurd person , so was he the very <unk> ... " Fred 's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators ' works , and each of them has a crucial comic little man role , as Burnand had put it . The " patter " baritone ( or " principal comedian " , as these roles later were called ) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic operas , and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs . 
 After the success of Trial by Jury , Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together . Over the next two years , Richard D 'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms . Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season , which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised , but he was unable to obtain financing for the project . In early 1876 , Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one @-@ act opera on the theme of burglars , but this was never completed . 
 = = = Early successes = = = 
 = = = = The Sorcerer = = = = 
 Carte 's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage . He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company , with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening 's entertainment . 
 Gilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories , " The Elixir of Love , " which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village . The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer , a purveyor of blessings ( not much called for ) and curses ( very popular ) . Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters , seeing to it that The Sorcerer opened as a fully polished production , in marked contrast to the under @-@ rehearsed Thespis . While The Sorcerer won critical acclaim , it did not duplicate the success of Trial by Jury . Nevertheless , Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full @-@ length opera from the team . 
 = = = = H.M.S. Pinafore = = = = 
 Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1878 ) , satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good @-@ natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status ( building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer , love between members of different social classes ) . As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story . 
 Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes , and he directed the performers on stage . He sought realism in acting , shunned self @-@ conscious interaction with the audience , and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity . Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions , which was something new to many actors of the day . Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation . The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre . As Jessie Bond wrote later : 
 Our stage discipline was strict and unbending . Gilbert 's word was law ; he thoroughly worked out in his own mind every bit of action , by @-@ play and grouping , and allowed no deviation from his plan . He ... made drawings and took measurements with the minutest care .... He had unlimited fertility of invention in comic business and would allow no gag , no clowning , no departure from his own definite conception . Sullivan 's musical conception was equally clear @-@ cut and decided . Every part must be made subservient to the whole , and his <unk> overwhelmed the transgressor with scorn . " And now , might I trouble you to try over my music , " he would say to a singer too anxious to display his or her top notes . But there was nothing to hurt or offend us in this unswerving discipline , we took their good @-@ humoured <unk> as our due when we failed in our rendering or overstepped the bounds ; and the patience and enthusiasm of that artistic pair so infected all of us that we worked willingly for hours and hours at rehearsals , trying with all our might to realize the conceptions of those two brilliant minds . 
 H.M.S. Pinafore ran in London for 571 performances , the second longest run of any musical theatre piece in history up to that time ( after the operetta Les cloches de Corneville ) . Hundreds of unauthorised , or " pirated " , productions of Pinafore appeared in America . During the run of Pinafore , Richard D 'Oyly Carte split up with his former investors . The disgruntled former partners , who had invested in the production with no return , staged a public fracas , sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance . Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers . This event cleared the way for Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , which then produced all of their succeeding operas . 
 The libretto of H.M.S. Pinafore relied on stock character types , many of which were familiar from European opera ( and some of which grew out of Gilbert 's earlier association with the German Reeds ) : the heroic protagonist ( tenor ) and his love @-@ interest ( soprano ) ; the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue ( contralto ) ; the baffled lyric baritone — the girl 's father ; and a classic villain ( bass @-@ baritone ) . Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter @-@ singing character . With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore , the D 'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented , and each opera would make use of these stock character types . Before The Sorcerer , Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for , as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury . Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer , Gilbert no longer hired stars ; he created them . He and Sullivan selected the performers , writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars . 
 The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer , John Wellington Wells , would become the ruler of the Queen 's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore , then join the army as Major @-@ General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance , and so on . Similarly , Mrs. <unk> in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore , then into Ruth , the piratical maid @-@ of @-@ all @-@ work in Pirates . Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years , becoming stars of the Victorian stage . These included George Grossmith , the principal comic ; Rutland Barrington , the lyric baritone ; Richard Temple , the bass @-@ baritone ; and Jessie Bond , the mezzo @-@ soprano soubrette . 
 = = = = The Pirates of Penzance = = = = 
 The Pirates of Penzance ( New Year 's Eve , 1879 ) also poked fun at grand opera conventions , sense of duty , family obligation , the " respectability " of civilisation and the peerage , and the relevance of a liberal education . The story also revisits Pinafore 's theme of unqualified people in positions of authority , in the person of the " modern Major @-@ General " who has up @-@ to @-@ date knowledge about everything except the military . The Major @-@ General and his many daughters escape from the tender @-@ hearted Pirates of Penzance , who are all orphans , on the false plea that he is an orphan himself . The pirates learn of the deception and re @-@ capture the Major @-@ General , but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers , the Major @-@ General bids them : " resume your ranks and legislative duties , and take my daughters , all of whom are beauties ! " 
 The piece premiered first in New York rather than London , in an ( unsuccessful ) attempt to secure the American copyright , and was another big success with both critics and audiences . Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas , without success . Nevertheless , Pirates was a hit both in New York , again spawning numerous imitators , and then in London , and it became one of the most frequently performed , translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works , also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera . 
 In 1880 , Sullivan wrote the cantata The Martyr of Antioch , presented at the Leeds Triennial Music Festival , with a libretto modified by Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman concerning the martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch in the 3rd century . Sullivan became the conductor of the Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance . It could be said that Martyr was the 15th opera of the partnership , since the Carl Rosa Opera Company presented the work as an opera in 1898 .

 = = = = Patience = = = = 
 Patience ( 1881 ) satirised the aesthetic movement in general and its colourful poets , in particular , combining aspects of Algernon Charles Swinburne , Dante Gabriel Rossetti , Oscar Wilde , James McNeill Whistler and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor . Grossmith , who created the role of Bunthorne , based his makeup , wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler , as seen in the adjacent photo . The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military . The story concerns two rival " aesthetic " poets , who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village , who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment . But both poets are in love with Patience , the village milkmaid , who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him . Richard D 'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde , a then lesser @-@ known proponent of aestheticism , and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera 's U.S. run , so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about . 
 During the run of Patience , Carte built the large , modern Savoy Theatre , which became the partnership 's permanent home . It was the first theatre ( indeed the world 's first public building ) to be lit entirely by electric lighting . Patience moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances , surpassing the run of H.M.S. Pinafore and becoming the second longest @-@ running work of musical theatre up to that time in history . 
 = = = = Iolanthe = = = = 
 Iolanthe ( 1882 ) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy . The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects , such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies . The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes . The critics felt that Sullivan 's work in Iolanthe had taken a step forward . The Daily Telegraph wrote , " The composer has risen to his opportunity , and we are disposed to account Iolanthe his best effort in all the Gilbertian series . " Similarly , the Theatre asserted that " the music of Iolanthe is Dr Sullivan 's chef d 'oeuvre . The quality throughout is more even , and maintained at a higher standard , than in any of his earlier works ... " 
 Iolanthe is one of a number of Gilbert 's works , including The Wicked World ( 1873 ) , Broken Hearts ( 1875 ) , Princess Ida ( 1884 ) and Fallen Fairies ( 1909 ) , where the introduction of men and " mortal love " into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo . Gilbert had created several " fairy comedies " at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s . These plays , influenced by the fairy work of James Planché , are founded upon the idea of self @-@ revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference . 
 In 1882 , Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study . Gilbert had referred to the new technology in Pinafore in 1878 , only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service . Sullivan had one installed as well , and on 13 May 1883 , at a party to celebrate the composer 's 41st birthday , the guests , including the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , heard a direct relay of parts of Iolanthe from the Savoy . This was probably the first live " broadcast " of an opera . 
 During the run of Iolanthe , in 1883 , Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria . Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame , the honour was conferred for his services to serious music . The musical establishment , and many critics , believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera — that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera . Sullivan , despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy , increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant , beneath his skills , and repetitious . Furthermore , he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert 's words could be heard . But paradoxically , in February 1883 , just after Iolanthe opened , Sullivan had signed a five @-@ year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months ' notice . 
 = = = = Princess Ida = = = = 
 Princess Ida ( 1884 ) spoofed women 's education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from Iolanthe of the war between the sexes . The opera is based on Tennyson 's poem The Princess : A Medley . Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870 , called The Princess , and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida . Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts . Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role , but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough , and when she missed a rehearsal , he dismissed her . 
 Princess Ida was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that , by the partnership 's previous standards , was not a success . A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales . The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919 . Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto , but two months after Ida opened , Sullivan told Carte that " it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself . " As Princess Ida showed signs of flagging , Carte realised that , for the first time in the partnership 's history , no new opera would be ready when the old one closed . On 22 March 1884 , he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months ' time . In the meantime , when Ida closed , Carte produced a revival of The Sorcerer . 
 = = = Dodging the magic lozenge = = = 
 = = = = The Mikado = = = = 
 The most successful of the Savoy Operas was The Mikado ( 1885 ) , which made fun of English bureaucracy , thinly disguised by a Japanese setting . Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters , which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in " human interest and probability " , as well as being too similar to their earlier opera , The Sorcerer . As dramatised in the film Topsy @-@ Turvy , the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884 , when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements . 
 The story focuses on a " cheap tailor , " Ko @-@ Ko , who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu . Ko @-@ Ko loves his ward , Yum @-@ Yum , but she loves a musician , who is really the son of the emperor of Japan ( the Mikado ) , and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha . The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu . When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town , Ko @-@ Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko @-@ Ko has carried out the executions . Too timid to execute anyone , Ko @-@ Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado , which goes awry . Eventually , Ko @-@ Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him , in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators . 
 With the opening of trade between England and Japan , Japanese imports , art and styles became fashionable in London , making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan . Gilbert said , " I cannot give you a good reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan . It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment , scenery and costume , and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate , who is ... judge and actual executioner in one , and yet would not hurt a worm , may perhaps please the public . " 
 Setting the opera in Japan , an exotic locale far away from Britain , allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings . Gilbert wrote , " The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution . " G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels : " Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on , exactly as Swift did ... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese . But all the jokes in the play fit the English . ... About England Pooh @-@ bah is something more than a satire ; he is the truth . " Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales , including The Gondoliers , Utopia Limited , and The Grand Duke . 
 The Mikado became the partnership 's longest @-@ running hit , enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre , which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre ( surpassing the 571 performances of Pinafore and 576 of Patience ) and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time . The Mikado remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera . It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history . 
 = = = = Ruddigore = = = = 
 Ruddigore ( 1887 ) , a topsy @-@ turvy take on Victorian melodrama , was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances . The original title , Ruddygore , together with some of the plot devices , including the revivification of ghosts , drew negative comments from critics . Gilbert and Sullivan <unk> the title and made a number of changes and cuts . Nevertheless , the piece was profitable , and the reviews were not all bad . For instance , the Illustrated London News praised the work and both Gilbert and , especially , Sullivan : " Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour . In the former respect , the charm of graceful melody prevails ; while , in the latter , the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun . " Further changes were made , including a new overture , when Rupert D 'Oyly Carte revived Ruddigore after the First World War , and the piece was regularly performed by the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter . 
 Some of the plot elements of Ruddigore were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one @-@ act opera , Ages Ago ( 1869 ) , including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits . When Ruddigore closed , no new opera was ready . Gilbert again proposed a version of the " lozenge " plot for their next opera , and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership . While the two men worked out their artistic differences , Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as H.M.S. Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance , and The Mikado . 
 = = = = The Yeomen of the Guard = = = = 
 The Yeomen of the Guard ( 1888 ) , their only joint work with a serious ending , concerns a pair of strolling players — a jester and a singing girl — who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century . The dialogue , though in prose , is quasi @-@ early modern English in style , and there is no satire of British institutions . For some of the plot elements , Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy , Broken Hearts . The Times praised the libretto : " It should ... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things . " Although not a grand opera , the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date . The critics , who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio , The Golden Legend , considered the score to Yeomen to be Sullivan 's finest , including its overture , which was written in sonata form , rather than as a sequential pot @-@ pourri of tunes from the opera , as in most of his other overtures . The Daily Telegraph wrote : 
 The accompaniments ... are delightful to hear , and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention . Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly , written for them more lovingly ... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind . Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane , and we have a genuine English opera ... 
 Yeomen was a hit , running for over a year , with strong New York and touring productions . During the run , on 12 March 1889 , Sullivan wrote to Gilbert , 
 I have lost the liking for writing comic opera , and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it ... You say that in a serious opera , you must more or less sacrifice yourself . I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces , and , what is more , must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful . 
 Sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera . Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto , but he offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted . The two would write a light opera for the Savoy , and at the same time , Sullivan a grand opera ( Ivanhoe ) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera . After a brief impasse over the choice of subject , Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life , as " this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music . " 
 = = = = The Gondoliers = = = = 
 The Gondoliers ( 1889 ) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of " republican equality . " Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes , including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos . The libretto also reflects Gilbert 's fascination with the " Stock Company Act " , highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities , which plays an even larger part in the next opera , Utopia Limited . Press accounts were almost entirely favourable . The Illustrated London News reported : 
 ... Gilbert has returned to the Gilbert of the past , and everyone is delighted . He is himself again . The Gilbert of the Bab Ballads , the Gilbert of whimsical conceit , inoffensive cynicism , subtle satire , and playful paradox ; the Gilbert who invented a school of his own , who in it was schoolmaster and pupil , who has never taught anybody but himself , and is never likely to have any imitator — this is the Gilbert the public want to see , and this is the Gilbert who on Saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more . 
 Sullivan 's old collaborator on Cox and Box ( later the editor of Punch magazine ) , F. C. Burnand , wrote to the composer : " <unk> ! ... I envy you and <unk> being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion . " The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for H.M.S. Pinafore , Patience and The Mikado . There was a command performance of The Gondoliers for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891 , the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured . The Gondoliers was Gilbert and Sullivan 's last great success . 
 = = = Carpet quarrel = = = 
 Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship , partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other 's , and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two — Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin @-@ skinned ( though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness ) , while Sullivan eschewed conflict . In addition , Gilbert imbued his libretti with " topsy @-@ turvy " situations in which the social order was turned upside down . After a time , these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan 's desire for realism and emotional content . Also , Gilbert 's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage . 
 Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject . After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore , which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers , Sullivan asked to leave the partnership , saying that he found Gilbert 's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him . While the two artists worked out their differences , Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works . On each occasion , after a few months ' pause , Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan 's objections , and the partnership was able to continue successfully . 
 In April 1890 , however , during the run of The Gondoliers , Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production . Among other items to which Gilbert objected , Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership . Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone . Gilbert confronted Carte , who refused to reconsider the accounts . Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that " I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen " . Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte " in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial . " As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained : 
 After all , the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items , and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things , but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan . Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts , and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others . It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance , but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time . Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891 , a year after the end of the " Quarrel " , that Carte had admitted " an unintentional overcharge of nearly £ 1 @,@ 000 in the electric lighting accounts alone . 
 Things soon degraded , a legal hearing was held , and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell . On 5 May 1890 , Gilbert had written to Sullivan : " The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived . " Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit , but Sullivan refused . Gilbert felt it was a moral issue , and could not look past it . Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith , and in any event , Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte 's good graces : Carte was building a new theatre , the Royal English Opera House , to produce Sullivan 's only grand opera , Ivanhoe . Gilbert brought suit , and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891 , he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti , vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy . 
 Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith , and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy . Gilbert eventually won the law suit , but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners . Nevertheless , the partnership had been so profitable that , after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House , Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer . In late 1891 , after many failed attempts at reconciliation , Gilbert and Sullivan 's music publisher , Tom Chappell , stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists , and within two weeks he had succeeded , eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan . 
 = = = Last works = = = 
 Utopia , Limited ( 1893 ) , their penultimate opera , was a very modest success , and their last , The Grand Duke ( 1896 ) was an outright failure . Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s . Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto , His Excellency ( 1894 ) , but Gilbert 's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh , his protege from Utopia , led to Sullivan 's refusal , and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr . Meanwhile , the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , in between new pieces , and D 'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory . 
 After The Grand Duke , the partners saw no reason to work together again . A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898 . At the premiere of Sullivan ’ s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May , Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends , assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him . Instead , he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence . The composer later denied that this was true . The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer . They did not speak to each other . Sullivan , by this time in exceedingly poor health , died in 1900 , although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists , most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia ( 1899 ) . Gilbert also wrote several works , some with other collaborators , in the 1890s . By the time of Sullivan 's death in 1900 , Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been " completely bridged over , " and " the most cordial relations existed between us . " He stated that Sullivan was " A composer of the rarest genius – who , because he was a composer of the rarest genius , was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be , but seldom is .... I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name . " 
 Richard D 'Oyly Carte died in 1901 , and his widow , Helen , continued to direct the activities of the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour . Gilbert went into semi @-@ retirement , although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally . Between 1906 and 1909 , he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre . These were very popular and revived interest in the works . Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season . After Sullivan 's death , Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera , Fallen Fairies ( 1909 ; music by Edward German ) , which was not a success . 
 = = Legacy and assessment = = 
 Gilbert died in 1911 , and Richard 's son , Rupert D 'Oyly Carte , took over the opera company upon his step @-@ mother 's death in 1913 . His daughter , Bridget , inherited the company upon his death in 1948 . The D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year @-@ round , except for its many London seasons and foreign tours , performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , until it closed in 1982 . During the 20th century , the company gave well over 35 @,@ 000 performances . The Savoy operas , from the beginning , were produced extensively in North America and Australasia , and soon afterwards in Germany , Russia , and elsewhere in Europe and around the world . 
 In 1922 , Sir Henry Wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows : 
 Sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery , for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity , and for charm and grace . His orchestration is delightful : he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice . Above all , his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting .... He found the right , the only cadences to fit Gilbert 's happy and original rhythms , and to match Gilbert 's fun or to throw Gilbert 's frequent irony , pointed although not savage , into relief . Sullivan 's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert 's libretti , just as Gilbert 's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan 's music . We have two masters who are playing a concerto . Neither is subordinate to the other ; each gives what is original , but the two , while neither predominates , are in perfect correspondence . This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique . They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music , but of two geniuses . 
 G. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists , anticipating the operas ' success into the " remote future " . He wrote that Gilbert 's satire was " too intelligent to be intelligible " by itself , and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given " wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious . [ The words ' ] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music ; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it . " In 1957 , a review in The Times gave this rationale for " the continued vitality of the Savoy operas " : 
 " [ T ] hey were never really contemporary in their idiom .... Gilbert and Sullivan 's [ world ] , from the first moment was obviously not the audience 's world , [ it was ] an artificial world , with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion – because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society .... For this , each partner has his share of credit . The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert 's plots is perfectly matched by his language .... His dialogue , with its primly mocking formality , satisfies both the ear and the intelligence . His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording .... How deliciously [ his lines ] prick the bubble of sentiment .... [ Of ] equal importance ... Gilbert 's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan 's music .... Sullivan 's tunes , in these operas , also exist in a make @-@ believe world of their own .... [ He is ] a delicate wit , whose airs have a precision , a neatness , a grace , and a flowing melody .... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful .... Light , and even trifling , though [ the operas ] may seem upon grave consideration , they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art " . 
 Because of the unusual success of the operas , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able , from the start , to license the works to other professional companies , such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company , and to amateur troupes . For almost a century , until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961 , and even afterwards , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide , creating a " performing tradition " for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors , both amateur and professional . Indeed , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre . Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals . After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas , professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups " support the culture of music and the drama . They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage , and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present @-@ day favourites . " Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to " the popularity of , and infectious craze for performing , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas " . The National Operatic and Dramatic Association ( NODA ) was founded in 1899 . It reported , in 1914 , that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year , constituting most of the amateur companies in the country ( this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA ) . The association further reported that almost 1 @,@ 000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year , many of them to benefit charities . Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand . In the U.S. , and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced , both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960 . The Savoy Company , an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia , continues to perform today . 
 Recordings of excerpts from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas began to be released in 1906 . In 1917 , the Gramophone Company ( also known as HMV ) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera , The Mikado , followed by recordings of eight more of the operas . Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s . These recordings were supervised by Rupert D 'Oyly Carte . The original D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well @-@ regarded recordings until 1979 , helping to keep the operas popular through the decades . Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD . After the copyrights on the operas expired , other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas . Many performing companies arose to produce the works , such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain and the Light Opera of Manhattan and Light Opera Works in the U.S. , and existing companies , such as English National Opera and Australian Opera added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories . These companies also released popular audio and video recordings of the operas . In 1980 , a Broadway and West End production of Pirates produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan , and between 1988 and 2003 , the revived D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End , also recording seven of the operas . A set of eleven of the operas ( omitting the last two ) was produced in 1982 for television , ten of which are available on VHS and DVD . 
 Today , numerous professional repertory companies , small opera companies , amateur societies , churches , schools and universities continue to produce the works . The most popular G & S works also continue to be performed from time to time by major opera companies , and professional recordings of the operas , and albums of songs from the operas , continue to be released . Since 1994 , a three @-@ week @-@ long International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England , with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage , and several dozen related " fringe " events given in smaller venues . The Festival sells both professional and amateur videos of its most popular productions . In connection with the 2009 festival , a contemporary critic wrote , " The appeal of G & S ’ s special blend of charm , silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion . " There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide . 
 = = = Cultural influence = = = 
 In the past 125 years , Gilbert and Sullivan have pervasively influenced popular culture in the English @-@ speaking world , and lines and quotations from their operas have become part of the English language ( even if not originated by Gilbert ) , such as " short , sharp shock " , " What never ? Well , hardly ever ! " , " let the punishment fit the crime " , and " A policeman 's lot is not a happy one " . The operas have influenced political style and discourse , literature , film and television , have been widely parodied by humorists , and have been quoted in legal rulings . 
 The American and British musical owes a tremendous debt to G & S , who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll , Adrian Ross , Lionel Monckton , P. G. Wodehouse , Guy Bolton , and Victor Herbert , and later Jerome Kern , Ira Gershwin , Yip Harburg , Irving Berlin , Ivor Novello , Oscar Hammerstein II , and Andrew Lloyd Webber . Gilbert 's lyrics served as a model for such 20th @-@ century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter , Ira Gershwin , and Lorenz Hart . Noël Coward wrote : " I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously . The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age . My father sang them , my mother played them , my nurse , Emma , breathed them through her teeth .... My aunts and uncles ... sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation .... " 
 Professor Carolyn Williams has noted , however : " The influence of Gilbert and Sullivan – their wit and sense of irony , the send ups of politics and contemporary culture – goes beyond musical theater to comedy in general . Allusions to their work have made their way into our own popular culture " . Gilbert and Sullivan expert and enthusiast Ian Bradley agrees : 
 The musical is not , of course , the only cultural form to show the influence of G & S. Even more direct heirs are those witty and satirical songwriters found on both sides of the Atlantic in the twentieth century like Michael Flanders and Donald Swann in the United Kingdom and Tom Lehrer in the United States . The influence of Gilbert is discernible in a vein of British comedy that runs through John Betjeman 's verse via Monty Python and Private Eye to ... television series like Yes , Minister ... where the emphasis is on wit , irony , and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet <unk> comfortable and urbane . 
 The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched and parodied . Well known examples of this include Tom Lehrer 's The Elements and Clementine ; Allan Sherman 's I 'm Called Little Butterball , When I Was a Lad , You Need an Analyst and The Bronx Bird @-@ Watcher ; and The Two Ronnies ' 1973 Christmas Special . Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as a key part of their routines , including Hinge and Bracket , Anna Russell , and the HMS Yakko episode of the animated TV series Animaniacs . Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising , and elaborate advertising parodies have been published , as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades . Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature , film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan 's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera , such as in the film The Girl Said No . There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films , such as Mike Leigh 's Topsy @-@ Turvy ( 2000 ) and The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan ( 1953 ) , as well as shows about the partnership , including a 1938 Broadway show , Knights of Song and a 1975 West End show called Tarantara ! Tarantara ! 
 It is not surprising , given the focus of Gilbert on politics , that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works . Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of Iolanthe . Alternatively , Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to Iolanthe 's comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office . British politicians , beyond quoting some of the more famous lines , have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches . These include Conservative Peter Lilley 's speech mimicking the form of " I 've got a little list " from The Mikado , listing those he was against , including " sponging socialists " and " young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue " . Political humour based on Gilbert and Sullivan 's style and characters continues to be written .

 = = = Overtures = = = 
 The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular , and there are many recordings of them . Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas . They are generally well @-@ orchestrated , but not all of them were composed by Sullivan . However , even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided , and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections . Sullivan invariably conducted them ( as well as the entire operas ) on opening night , and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan . 
 Those Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to Thespis , Iolanthe , Princess Ida , The Yeomen of the Guard , The Gondoliers and The Grand Duke . Sullivan 's authorship of the overture to Utopia , Limited cannot be verified with certainty , as his autograph score is now lost , but it is likely attributable to him , as it consists of only a few bars of introduction , followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera ( the Drawing Room scene ) . Thespis is now lost , but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture . Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan 's incidental music to Shakespeare 's Henry the VIII , as he did not have time to write a new overture , but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke . Of those remaining , the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier , the overture to Patience is by Eugene d 'Albert , and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke ( although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye ) . 
 Most of the overtures are in three sections : a lively introduction , a slow middle section , and a concluding allegro in sonata form , with two subjects , a brief development , a recapitulation and a coda . However , Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern . The overture to Princess Ida , for instance , has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section . The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section , with only a very brief original passage introducing it . 
 In the 1920s , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time , Geoffrey Toye , to write new overtures for Ruddigore and The Pirates of Penzance . Toye 's Ruddigore overture entered the general repertory , and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke . Toye 's Pirates overture , however , did not last long and is now presumed lost . Sir Malcolm Sargent devised a new ending for the overture to The Gondoliers , adding the " cachucha " from the second act of the opera . This gave the Gondoliers overture the familiar fast @-@ slow @-@ fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures , and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan 's original version .

 Gilbert and Sullivan operas have been translated into many languages , including Portuguese , Yiddish , Hebrew , Swedish , Dutch , Danish , Estonian , Hungarian , Russian , Japanese , French , Italian , Spanish ( reportedly including a version of Pinafore transformed into zarzuela style ) , Catalan and others . 
 There are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas , including the popular Der Mikado . There is even a German version of The Grand Duke . Some German translations were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée , librettists of Die Fledermaus and other Viennese operettas , who even translated one of Sullivan 's lesser @-@ known operas , The Chieftain , as ( Der <unk> ) .

The music is arranged by Sir Charles Mackerras from themes by Sullivan . 
 = = = Adaptations = = = 
 Gilbert adapted the stories of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado into children 's books called The Pinafore Picture Book and The Story of The Mikado giving , in some cases , backstory that is not found in the librettos . Many other children 's books have since been written retelling the stories of the operas or adapting characters or events from them . In the 19th century , the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces . 
 Many musical theatre and film adaptations of the operas have been produced , including the following :

 = Hurricane Karl ( 1980 ) = 
 Hurricane Karl was a late @-@ season and unusual tropical cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season . A minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale , Karl developed at the center of another , larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic . After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25 , it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a full @-@ fledged hurricane . It peaked in intensity on November 26 , and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system . 
 Karl holds the record for the northernmost formation of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean . It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude , and contributed to one of the most active <unk> on record in terms of tropical cyclones . However , it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land . It was the 11th named storm of the season , and due to the lack of damage , its name was not retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Karl originated in a low pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States . It approached the Canadian Maritimes the next day and strengthened to below 1000 millibars . On November 24 , the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland , and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core . It evolved into a separate vortex , and due to the lack of inhibiting wind shear , a small cyclone developed . It became a subtropical storm at 0000 UTC before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone . About 18 hours later , the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane , accompanied by the formation of a pronounced eye feature . At the time , it was situated around 610 miles ( 1 @,@ 110 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Azores . Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non @-@ tropical storm is rare , it is not unprecedented . An unnamed hurricane in November 1991 also formed in this manner . 
 After being classified as a hurricane , Karl gradually strengthened , and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness . A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward , and on November 26 , it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) . Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast . On November 27 , the storm 's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230 miles ( 370 km ) of the Azores and started to show signs of deterioration . The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area , and Karl turned northward around its periphery . It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28 . 
 = = Records and impact = = 
 Hurricane Karl was unusual in several aspects . It developed late in the hurricane season , which runs from June 1 through November 30 , over waters colder than the standard limit for tropical cyclone formation . It marked the farthest @-@ north development of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone on record . While the 1991 unnamed hurricane was farther north , it became a subtropical storm late on October 31 , and had moved south by November 1 . Karl attained Category 1 hurricane status farther north than any other storm ( in any month ) until the 1991 unnamed hurricane became a hurricane at a higher latitude . The storm 's record was also surpassed by Hurricane Noel in 2001 . Karl was reported at the time to be the farthest @-@ east hurricane during the last 10 days of the month of November . Additionally , it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45 @.@ 0 ° N , at which point it became extratropical ; only Hurricane Lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane farther north in the month of November . 
 When Karl became a hurricane on November 25 , the 1980 season became notable for having two November hurricanes ; the other was Jeanne . This tied 1932 and 1969 for the record of the most November hurricanes , which was later accomplished during the 1994 season . Later , 2001 broke this record with three hurricanes . The cyclone never affected land , and as a result , no deaths or damages occurred . One ship to the northwest of Karl 's center recorded 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) winds and an air pressure of 993 mbar . 
 = Operation Flax = 
 Operation Flax was a Western Allied air operation executed during the Tunisia Campaign , as part of the larger North African Campaign of the Second World War . The operation was designed to cut the air supply lines between Italy and the Axis armies in Tunis , Tunisia , in April 1943 . The parallel Allied naval effort was Operation Retribution . 
 In November 1942 , American and British forces landed in North Africa under Operation Torch . Allied thrusts overran Vichy French Morocco and Algeria and advanced into Tunisia . The danger for the Axis Powers was now apparent . The Allied forces advancing eastward and the British 8th Army advancing westward after the victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein , would trap and destroy the remaining Axis forces in North Africa . In response to the crisis , and the poor state of Axis forces , reinforcements for the German Afrika Korps , Italian Army and Luftwaffe were dispatched by sea and air . These reinforcements duly staved off an immediate defeat in Tunisia , the last region still in Axis hands . The poor state of the roads and rail lines in Algeria meant that Allied forces faced difficult logistic challenges which enabled the Axis to prolong a defence . The inexperience of U.S. forces was also apparent at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass . Nevertheless , the growing number and experience of Allied forces squeezed the Axis toward the northern tip of Tunisia . The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and Royal Navy operating from Malta took a heavy toll of Axis shipping . However , Axis supplies were still reaching the besieged Afrika Korps by air . By early April , large quantities of Axis manpower was also being evacuated by air . Although the Allies held air superiority by this time , Luftwaffe transports were operating with impunity during darkness . 
 In order to prevent this the Allied Air Forces , the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) — were ordered to conduct operations against Axis air power by day and night in order to prevent their resupply or withdrawal . Owing to bad weather and the need to gather intelligence , the operation , codenamed " Flax " , did not begin until 5 April . Although the Axis put up determined resistance and large scale air battles took place , the Allied Air Forces succeeded in destroying the aerial link between Axis @-@ held Sicily and Italy . During the course of the interdiction operation , an air battle known as the 18 April <unk> <unk> ( " Palm Sunday Massacre " ) took place , in which the German Junkers Ju 52 transport fleets suffered heavy losses over Cape Bon , while evacuating Heer forces escaping from the Allied ground offensive Operation Vulcan . The air operation continued until 27 April . The operation destroyed Axis logistical support . Along with the attempted airlift during the Battle of Stalingrad , Operation Flax inflicted such grievous losses on the German transport fleets that they were unable to recover . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Strategic situation = = = 
 The Axis campaign in North Africa was characterised by a lack of consistent concentrated logistics support to their forces in the field . The failure was one of the primary reasons that Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) Erwin Rommel could not win a decisive breakthrough against the British 8th Army throughout 1941 — 1942 . Rommel , at points , had recognised Malta as a serious obstacle to Axis logistical lines between Axis @-@ held Europe and their forces in North Africa . Malta lay across their lines of communication and , despite being under siege for two and a half years , it remained an active base for Allied naval and air forces to interdict Axis supply lines for much of this period . Yet Rommel failed to apply enough pressure on the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( German High Command , OKW ) to launch a planned invasion of the island , Operation Herkules . Although Malta became largely ineffective as an offensive base in mid 1942 , later that same year the Allied offensive from Malta became increasingly effective . The Axis defeat at the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Allied landings , Operation Torch , in Western North Africa , threatened to crush the Axis from both East and West . The Germans responded by sending reinforcements to Africa through Vichy @-@ held Tunisia , but by the start of 1943 they were suffering increasing shipping losses to Malta 's forces . Some respite was won for the Axis when the Allies lost the " Run for Tunis " in part owing to rapid German reactions and the difficulty in supplying their armies through the poor Algerian infrastructure . By early 1943 , the Axis had numerical superiority in aircraft ; 690 to the Allies ' 480 . 
 But for the Axis , the interdiction campaign from Malta caused chronic supply shortages in Africa . By April 1943 , the Allied armies had pushed the supply @-@ starved Axis forces to the northern tip of Tunisia , near its capital Tunis . Despite the desperate situation , the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air . To prevent prolonged resistance , the Allies , now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra , launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link . It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943 , but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April . 
 = = = Axis supply situation = = = 
 The situation in the air , on land and at sea was gradually deteriorating . Axis supply ships had suffered heavy losses between Cape Bon and Sicily . A total of 67 % of all losses were to Allied aircraft . Theo Osterkamp was appointed <unk> <unk> ( Fighter Leader Sicily ) to fly over the area , nicknamed " Death Row " , by Axis shipping . On 7 April 1943 , the organisation was given 148 fighters for these operations . The Luftwaffe reorganised its forces in Tunisia as well . Hans Seidemann was appointed Fliegerkorps Tunis ( Flying Corps Tunisia ) with three commands , Fliegerführer Tunis ( Flying Leader Tunis ) , Mitte ( Middle ) and Gabès , after its headquarters ′ location . <unk> had the equivalent of 12 Gruppen ( 12 Groups ) and maintained around 300 fighters until mid @-@ April . The German fighter defences also benefited from a rudimentary radar supported early @-@ warning network . 
 Generalmajor ( Major General ) Ulrich Buchholz — Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) of KGzbV 3 — was appointed <unk> II , Mittelmeer ( Air Transport Leader II , Mediterranean Sea ) on 15 January 1943 . His forces were organised under the Naples @-@ based KGzbV N ( N for <unk> , or Naples ) and the Trapani @-@ based KGzbV S. KGzbV S had to make two missions a day , KGzbV S only one . The formations would be between 80 — 120 aircraft strong . Operations were to be flown at only 150 ft ( 46 m ) in altitude , arriving around noon in order to operate during the Allied " lunch " period . The units — operating mostly the Junkers Ju 52 , brought in 90 tonnes daily and the giant Messerschmitt Me 323s brought some 30 tonnes with their fewer numbers . The logistical effort was made using Indian prisoners of war , who helped unload supplies . The operational method usually involved escort fighters picking up the formation on route . Only one fighter aircraft for every five transports was made available owing to various shortages . The Naples units were met near Trapani , and on the return leg fighters , including Bf 110 Zerstörer , escorted them home . The end of the airlifts at Stalingrad and in the Kuban allowed the expansion of Axis transport aircraft to 185 by 10 March . By the beginning of April , it rose to 426 . The force flew much needed ammunition and fuel to the Axis armies in Africa . 
 = = = Allied plan = = = 
 James H. Doolittle commanding Northwest African Strategic Air Force ( NASAF ) was ordered to formulate an air interdiction campaign . He named it Operation Flax . Operation Flax called for Allied fighters to intercept the aerial convoys over the Sicily — Tunisia strait . Allied units were also briefed to carry out major offensive operations against Axis airfields in Tunisia and the overcrowded staging fields in Sicily . They were also ordered to carry out anti — shipping sweeps . Flax was an operation which was unlikely to work more than a few times , as shown by the relative impunity with which the surviving Axis air transports operated at night after the operation had begun . The flight time across the Strait of Sicily was so short that aerial interception could be made only with precise intelligence . The Germans understood this but did not know that their communications had been compromised and were being read by Allied intelligence . Ignorant of their intelligence leaks , they operated by day . Since their enemy had the option of flying by night , and the weather conditions were not ideal for interception operations , the Allies delayed the implementation of Operation Flax until the most German transport aircraft were in operation so that the blow would be as decisive as possible . Allied intelligence listened in to the Y @-@ stations until they were sure they could strike . 
 The tactical plan included coordinated strikes on Axis airfields carried out by Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress groups to tie down Axis fighter groups . Medium bomber units operating the North American B @-@ 25 Mitchell would fly sweeps over the Gulf of Tunis . They were to be joined by Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning heavy fighters which were also detailed to sweep the area . The presence of the B @-@ 25s would allow the P @-@ 38s to operate in the area without raising the Axis suspicions . It would seem as if they were there to escort the B @-@ 25s , rather than their actual intention , to interdict Axis air transports . Supermarine Spitfire units would sweep the straits further north , catching any enemy aircraft that evaded the P @-@ 38s . More B @-@ 25 and B @-@ 17 units were detailed to strike at Sicilian airfields to catch transports on the ground . The USAAF 9th Air Force was detailed to send its Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator bomb groups against airfields in and around Naples in this capacity as well . On 2 April Doolittle 's superiors , supreme commander of all Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean , Arthur Tedder and commander of Allied Air Forces in Western North Arica Carl Spaatz , decided to wait for the next suitable window to launch the offensive .

 At 06 : 30 on 5 April , 26 P @-@ 38s of the U.S. 1st Fighter Group conducted a sweep over the Sicilian Strait . Meanwhile , 18 B @-@ 25s of the <unk> Bomb Group — escorted by 32 P @-@ 38s of the 82nd Fighter Group — set out on a maritime interdiction operation . Six of the P @-@ 38s returned to base for unrecorded reasons . The B @-@ 25s claimed two ferries damaged and a destroyer sunk . One B @-@ 25 was shot down . 
 The 1st Group arrived over Cape Bon at 08 : 00 . They reported contact with several formations of different types . They estimated 50 — 70 Ju 52s , 20 Bf 109s , four Fw 190s , six Ju 87s and a Fw 189 formed these flights . In fact , the German formation had only 31 Ju 52s , ten Bf 109s , six to seven Bf 110s , four Ju 87s and one Fw 190 in it . The U.S. fighters attacked and a large air battle developed . The 82nd Fighter Group also joined in . The 1st Fighter Group claimed 11 Ju 52s , two Ju 87s , two Bf 109s and the Fw 189 for two P @-@ 38s lost . The 82nd claimed seven Ju 52s , three Ju 87s , three Bf 109s , one Bf 110 and one Me 210 for four P @-@ 38s . Losses are uncertain , and a significant amount of over claiming was done . In fact , German losses amounted to 13 — 14 Ju 52s and about three fighters . Another source states the loss of 13 Ju 52s and two Bf 109s , from 5 . / JG 27 . ( The supposed Fw 189 was no doubt a mis @-@ identified P @-@ 38 . )

 Later , 18 B @-@ 17s from the 97th Bomb Group bombed Axis airfields at El <unk> . Two Me 323s , two Ju 52s and five Italian transports were destroyed . A second mission was flown to Sid Ahmed . Both raids were flown with Spitfire escorts . Only a few German fighters intercepted , without success . The bombers claimed one German fighter destroyed . 
 One hour later , 35 B @-@ 25s from the 310th Bomb Group and 18 P @-@ 38s from the 82nd Fighter Group raided Axis airfields in Sicily near <unk> . Some 80 — 90 Axis aircraft were counted , poorly camouflaged and vulnerable . The attack achieved good results with fragmentation bombs . The attackers were intercepted by 15 Bf 109s , losing two B @-@ 25s . The bombers claimed three Bf 109s while the P @-@ 38s claimed two of the German fighters . The 301st Bomb Group attacked Milo airfield , claiming 52 destroyed on the ground . Actual Axis losses were 13 German and eight Italian aircraft destroyed with 11 German and 30 Italian aircraft damaged . Some 72 B @-@ 17s of the 99th Bomb Group bombed the airfield at <unk> di Falco . They claimed to have seen 100 — 150 aircraft , but the raid only destroyed four Axis aircraft and damaged several . Spitfires claimed two Bf 109s for two losses . Two sweeps by P @-@ 38 groups found nothing further . 
 The NASAF claimed 201 Axis aircraft destroyed including 40 in the air . German sources only list the loss of 14 Ju 52s in aerial combat and 11 Ju 52s and Me 323s on the ground with 67 damaged . Aside from combat aircraft , the British Official History concludes 27 German and three Italian transports were lost on 5 April .

 The Operation Flax attacks merged into the preparatory phase of the Sicilian Campaign as air attacks were also helping to erode air defences on the island . While Flax continued on a smaller scale , the emphasis was on fighter operations . On 10 April , Flax was renewed . Some 75 P @-@ 38s of the 1st Fighter Group intercepted 20 Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti <unk> and around six Macchi <unk> The battle resulted in 10 transports and two Italian fighters being shot down . Later that morning , 27 P @-@ 38s of the 82nd Fighter Group were escorting 18 B @-@ 25s of the 310th Bomb Group over Cape Bon when 30 Ju 52s were spotted with two Bf 110s , two Ju 87s and just three Ju 88s with them . At first , 11 P @-@ 38s stayed with the B @-@ 25s acting as escort , but then the bombers joined in , flying past the transports and firing on them using their gunners . Around 15 Bf 109s were scrambled from Tunisia to help the transports and they destroyed one P @-@ 38 and damaged three more . However , the Germans had already suffered heavy losses . One P @-@ 38 pilot was killed when he flew into a Bf 110 and some B @-@ 25s were shot up . The Americans claimed 25 victories . The Germans lost 10 Ju 52s , one Ju 88 , one Bf 109 and one Bf 110 . Some Ju 52s managed to ditch and their crews survived . A Spitfire patrol later shot down four more Ju 52s . It is likely the Bf 110s " spotted " in the formation were actually Me <unk> from Zerstörergeschwader 1 . RAF and USAAF units also downed a SG 2 Fw 190 on a ferry flight , and another from SKG 210 . An SG 2 Hs 129 was also shot down while another Ju 88 from III . / KG 77 was also shot down . 
 On 11 April , the 82nd ran into 20 Ju 52s , four Ju 88s , four Bf 110s and seven Bf 109s . The Americans claimed all of the Ju 52s and seven escorts . Actual German and Americans losses are unclear . In the afternoon , 20 of the 82nd ran into 30 unescorted Ju 52s . The transports fought back , losing only five and shooting down one P @-@ 38 . Its pilot was killed . The day 's total amounted to 17 Ju 52s , one <unk> and two Bf 110s destroyed . The RAF had also been involved in the day 's operations . No. 152 Squadron RAF sent 34 Spitfires to intercept 12 Ju 52s escorted by a handful of Bf 109s . Three Ju 52s were shot down for the loss of two Spitfires , both claimed by Wolfgang <unk> of I. / JG 53 . The German units reported no losses . 
 The day had been bad for the Luftwaffe . Losses amounted to 18 Ju 52s ; four belonged to III . / <unk> 1 . Raids by RAF Vickers Wellington bombers continued during the night . Ju 88 night fighters from NJG 2 downed two Wellingtons . The results of the raids are not known . 
 On 13 April , B @-@ 17s from the 97th and 301st Bomb Groups bombed Sicilian airfields at Castelvetrano and Trapani . The Italians lost 11 SM.82s destroyed and 16 damaged on the ground . At Trapani the Germans lost eight aircraft and 40 damaged for the loss of two B @-@ 17s to the island 's fighter defences consisting of Bf 109s from JG 27 . Battles over the airfields in the afternoon were inconclusive , costing the Axis one Ju 88 from II . / KG 26 and the Allies an RAF a Spitfire from No. 232 Squadron RAF . That night , air raids killed four German fighter pilots from I. / JG 53 while two Ju 88s from II . / NJG 2 and III . / KG 76 were lost .

 On 12 April , the RAF Desert Air Force took command over most of the Operation Flax operations . The RAF used sea @-@ looking radar . However , the use of it was not all advantageous as the German formations flew low . The considerable ranges stretched the P @-@ 40 and Spitfires to the limit . The British spread their forces more thinly to maintain continuous coverage . However , on 16 April , 13 Spitfires ran into a large formation of Axis aircraft . The Spitfires shot down seven SM.82s and a Bf 109 for the loss of two . German fighters claimed three Spitfires . One of the two actual victims was Wing Commander Ian " <unk> " Gleed of No. 244 Wing RAF . Gleed was possibly the victim of a Leutnant Ernst @-@ Wilhelm Reinert of 4 Staffel JG 77 . At the time of his death Gleed had 14 victories . This near @-@ disaster meant small operations were abandoned . From that point on missions consisted of three P @-@ 40 squadrons covered by one Spitfire squadron . 
 Later on the 16 April , in a small @-@ scale counter @-@ attack , eight <unk> 10 Fw 190s escorted by 16 Bf 109s of JG 27 led an attack on Allied airfields near Souk el <unk> . They destroyed six A @-@ 20 Havoc bombers . The next day , 17 April , II . / ZG 26 several Bf 110s were shot down by No. 260 Squadron RAF P @-@ 40s on offensive operations . In response , the American 97th Bomb Group dispatched seven B @-@ 17s covered by 40 P @-@ 38s to bomb Palermo airfields . A large air battle developed when 30 Bf 110s and Bf 109s from ZG 26 and JG 27 intercepted . The Bf 110s attacked the bombers while the JG 27 Bf 109s tackled the escort . The Germans claimed five bombers and one fighter for the loss of one Bf 109 . Actual Allied losses are unknown .

 The patrols failed to intercept any formations of transports on the afternoon of the 18 April . In the evening , the Ninth Air Force 's 57th Fighter Group sent out all of its squadrons , including the 314th Fighter Squadron of the 324th Fighter Group , under its command . The 57th had already flown unproductive sorties in the afternoon . Still , 47 USAAF P @-@ 40s arrived in the sweep area with 12 Spitfires from No. 92 Squadron RAF . The Spitfires flew high cover at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) while the P @-@ 40s stayed at around 4 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) . Soon enough , a large formation of 30 Ju 52 was reported by Allied pilots at an altitude of only 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) flying north east on a return flight . Actually , there were 65 Ju 52s , 16 Axis fighters and five Bf 110s . As the Allied fighters began their attacks , the passengers fired machine guns out of the Junkers ′ windows in desperation to fend off the attack . In the air battle that followed , six P @-@ 40s and a Spitfire were shot down . The Americans claimed 146 victories , which was later reduced to 58 or 59 Ju 52s , 14 Macchi <unk> and Bf 109s and two to four Bf 110s . Actual German losses were 24 Ju 52s along with 10 fighters . The German fighter casualties amounted to nine Bf 109s and one Bf 110 . It is also possible some Italian fighters were shot down as well . Along with the 24 Ju 52s destroyed , another 35 were damaged and managed to crash @-@ land all along the Sicilian coastline . The battle became known as the " Palm Sunday Massacre " . 
 = = = Continuation of offensive = = = 
 The following day , No. 7 Wing SAAF shot down another 16 Italian <unk> The ease with which they caught fire led the Allied pilots to believe they were carrying precious fuel cargoes . Among those units involved were No. 54 Squadron SAAF , No. 2 Squadron SAAF . Another source gives Axis losses as 10 destroyed and four crash landed . 
 On 22 April , the South African No. 7 Wing sent out 36 P @-@ 40s which intercepted a well escorted Italian formation . The South Africans claimed 12 Ju 52s , two SM <unk> , a Ju 87 towing a glider , a Reggiane Re.2001 , two Bf 109s and a Ju 88 for the loss of five Spitfires and three P @-@ 40s . Known Axis losses were 12 SM.79s and a Macchi C.202 ; RAF Spitfires flying from Malta downed another two transports . Later , a flight made in daylight cost the Axis 16 or 17 Me 323 transports destroyed , plus a Macchi C.202 , three German fighters and a Re @-@ 2001 , when they were intercepted by 36 Australian , British and South African P @-@ 40s covered by South African , British and Polish Spitfire units . Four P @-@ 40s were lost and one Spitfire had to force land . The main combatants in the battles were No. 1 Squadron SAAF , No. 112 Squadron RAF , No. 450 Squadron RAAF , I. / JG 27 and II . / JG 27 . 
 Göring ordered that no more transport flights be made . Albert Kesselring complained that this would deny the Axis forces vital supplies , and Göring once again permitted flights . This time they were to travel via Sardinia , but no more than 60 – 70 flights would be allowed per night ; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax . The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar @-@ equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them . One last Allied effort was made by 70 B @-@ 24 Liberators , which bombed airfields around Bari in Italy . Some 54 German aircraft were destroyed and 13 damaged on the ground . The USAAF units claimed 50 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The aerial operation had a considerable effect in strangling Axis logistics . The supplies reaching Axis units dwindled , and the Axis armies and air units remaining in Tunisia gradually ran out of fuel , ammunition and other supplies . Having lost most of its airbases , the Luftwaffe also evacuated most of its units . By early May 1943 , only the Italian fighter units , and one German Gruppe ( I. JG 77 ) , remained as the Axis held on to a narrow strip of African coastline near Tunis . Allied air superiority was so overwhelming , that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages , or squeezed into the cockpits of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft . Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way . Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous ; 16 personnel were killed in a crash on 29 or 30 April . The last transport missions were flown on 4 May , in which 117 tons of fuel and ammunition was brought in . Some supply drops were attempted ( by II . / Kampfgeschwader 1 ) , but most of the remaining signals , FlaK , transport and administrative staff left were captured when the campaign ended on 13 May 1943 . 
 = Music of Saint Lucia = 
 The music of Saint Lucia is home to many vibrant oral and folk traditions and is based on elements derived from the music of Africa , especially rhythmically , and Western Europe , dances like the quadrille , polka and waltz . The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments , especially a four @-@ stringed banjo called the bwa <unk> . Celebratory songs called jwé show lyricism , and rhythmic complexity . The most important of the Afro @-@ Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril . Music is an integral part of Lucian folk holidays and celebrations , as well as the good @-@ natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies . There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia , and the country 's popular music industry is only nascent . There are few recording opportunities , though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture . Popular music from abroad , especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca , is widespread . 
 Music education has long been a part of Lucian public education in the primary school age groups . More recently , it has been introduced to older students , many of whom now participate in String Orchestras , wind ensembles , steelpan bands and other musical enrichment opportunities . There is also a well @-@ known government assisted non @-@ profit music school , the Saint Lucia School of Music . The Ministry of Education sponsors a variety of festivals and other special events . The island is also home to the prestigious Saint Lucia Jazz Festival and the Creole celebration Jounen Kwéyòl . 
 Saint Lucia , is an island in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean . 
 = = Folk music = = 
 A typical Saint Lucian folk band is based around the fiddle , cuatro , banjo , guitar and chak @-@ chak ( a rattle ) . The banjo and cuatro are regarded as particularly important in Saint Lucian culture , especially the small , four @-@ stringed bwa <unk> , or <unk> banjo . Saint Lucian dances include <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( a derivative of the minuet ) ; however , the kwadril is increasingly viewed as a national symbol . It is a highly stylized and formalized dance that derives from the European quadrille . Jwé is a more informal form of Lucian folk music , and is performed at dances , wakes and other social events ; performers improvise comedic and often biting or lyrics . Music also plays a role in the La Rose and La Marguerite tradition of two rival societies that compete in celebration and form a fundamental part of Lucian culture . 
 Jwé ( play ) is a form of rural Lucian folk music associated with beach parties , wakes , débòt dances and full moon gatherings . Jwé is performed as an informal , social event that provide the chance for Lucians to show off their verbal skills , and communicate their comedic , social and political commentaries without offending people . Jwé includes both songs for men and women , both of which can be singers , though most Lucian folk instrumentalists are male . A jwé performance is considered good if the audience participates enthusiastically by clapping , responding to the leader and singing and dancing . Some Lucians avoid jwé altogether because of its sexually raunchy lyricism and atmosphere ; nevertheless , elements of jwé have entered mainstream Lucian culture , such as the use of lang <unk> , or saying the opposite of what is meant . 
 Musical elements of jwé include <unk> ( game song ) , listwa ( storytelling ) , jwé chanté ( sung songs ) and jwé dansé ( song @-@ play @-@ dance ) . These forms are united by their use of the Creole language , their use of call @-@ and @-@ response singing between a leader and a chorus , with the exception of listwa , and the use of improvisation . Jwé chanté and listwa are purely vocal styles with no accompaniment , nor any traditional dance ; the other two are typically accompanied by a ka drum or sometimes the tibwa percussion sticks , which provides a rhythm for dancers . 
 Sung jwé , jwé chanté or chanté kont , is mostly part of the funeral wake tradition . A jwé chanté leader uses pantomime to enact scenes from a story , or sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it . The <unk> ( game song ) are based around a leader who uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics , while the audience participates in the performance . Jwé dansé includes four traditional dances . The solo is a couple dance , and the débòt , <unk> and jwé <unk> are all circle dances . The <unk> is a musical movement found in all jwé dansé styles , occurring , for example , every four beats in the débòt dance . 
 = = = Kwadril = = = 
 Quadrille is a Lucian Creole folk dance derived from the European quadrille . It is performed primarily at private parties which are organized by a host in a private home or rented hall , with musicians paid by the host . <unk> are held throughout the year , except during Lent . The modern kwadril has declined in popularity ; it had come to be seen as a symbol of colonialism around the time of independence , and was shunned as old @-@ fashioned and out @-@ of @-@ date . More recently , some aspects of Lucian society have come to promote the quadrille as a symbol of Lucian culture . <unk> are unlike other Lucian dances in that they must be memorized and choreographed , with only slight room for personal interpretation and improvisation . <unk> act as a sort of apprentice for more established performers . A successful performance brings respect and prestige for all participants who dance the correct steps which are traditionally said to " demonstrate control over behavior , manner , and skills " and " symbolize ... a set of special values linked with a higher social class " . 
 Kwadril music is provided by an ensemble consisting of a four @-@ stringed instrument , the cuatro ( instrument ) , a rattle , the chakchak , bones called zo , a violin , banjo ( <unk> , bwa <unk> ) , mandolin and guitar . A kwadril consists of five separate dances : the <unk> fidji , <unk> fidji , <unk> fidji , <unk> fidji ( also <unk> or <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> won ( also grande rond ) . The musicians may also use a lakonmèt ( mazurka ) , <unk> or polka ; the lakonmèt , also called the <unk> , is especially popular and is the only closed couple dance which originated in Saint Lucia . 
 = = = La Rose and La Marguerite = = = 
 La Rose and La Marguerite are rival societies that commemorate the Anglo @-@ French heritage of the island ; the factions represent the warring colonial powers , between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times . La Rose is held on August 30 while La <unk> is held on October 17 . The societies date back to the early 19th century , when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church . Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions , including the King , Queen , Prince , Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse . La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent . At these meetings , which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite , members sing or play instruments and dance . La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader , the chantwèl , standing , while La Rose meetings include instruments like the <unk> ( tambourine ) , <unk> ( wooden trumpet ) , chakchak ( rattles ) , guitar and <unk> ( scraper ) . 
 The celebrations of both groups differ in that La Rose , the " English " faction , is characterized by <unk> , movement , participation , rhythm and exuberance , while La Marguerite , the " French " faction , is characterized by melody , discipline and restraint . There is a vibrant tradition of women singing factional songs related to this rivalry . Traditions common to both factions include the <unk> , a sort of waltz , Marches and the duple rhythm <unk> ( or <unk> ) dance . Kwadril and lakonmèt are also performed by La Rose . 
 = = = Other traditional styles = = = 
 In addition to jwé and other music performed for entertainment , Saint Lucia is also home to styles used only for specific occasions . These include work songs , drinking songs , funereal music and serenades and masquerades . The latter two traditions are nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia . The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year 's Day , which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou <unk> , chakchak and a bamboo flute . This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights , merry @-@ go @-@ rounds and vocal serenades , called <unk> in Lucian Creole . 
 The most widespread form of Lucian work song is the chanté <unk> , which accompanies the sawing of wood . The vocals are performed by a lead singer and two responding singers , accompanied by a ka and tibwa duo . Both instruments are played in an atypical manner . The ka drum is played on the ground rather than upright , and the tibwa percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than the rim of a drum . 
 Lucian drinking songs are the chanté <unk> , which are rarely performed in recent years . Their traditional context , however , is the <unk> celebration , held during Christmas time . Chanté <unk> are performed in a game in which the singers , seated at a long table , take turns singing a new song each time their turn comes . Those who lasted the entire evening won prizes , often a bottle of rum . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The bélè tradition is a form of Creole song and couple dance , performed one couple with a leader and chorus . They are performed in several contexts , most notably in funeral wakes . <unk> include the bélè <unk> , bélè <unk> , bélè <unk> and the bélè <unk> . The bélè <unk> is the only form which is not responsorial . 
 = = = = Funeral music = = = = 
 On Saint Lucia , wakes are held on the first and eighth night after a person has died , in contrast to other Caribbean islands , which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days . Wakes often include music , such as the singing of hymns and drumming . Traditional music for wakes is performed both inside and outside of the deceased 's house . The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole , because they are derived from the English @-@ using songs of Lucian churches . The songs include both hymns and <unk> ( gospel songs ) , and are generally responsorial , led by a male singer with the slow , unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison . The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment , called kont . These songs often related to the death of the deceased , and may deal with the cause of death , the last words or events surrounding the death . Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè , accompanied zo or tibwa and ka . 
 The villages of La Grace , <unk> and <unk> in the southwest area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song @-@ dance called the koutoumba . The koutoumba was only performed for the death of a <unk> , a person descended from Africans who came to the island in the middle of the 19th century . The koutoumba is unique among Lucian folk dance in that it is performed by a sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text , which is evocative of the song 's atmosphere rather than narrative . The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986 . 
 = = = = Kélé = = = = 
 Kélé is an Afro @-@ Lucian religious tradition from the <unk> people of the <unk> region . Only one family , from <unk> , in modern Saint Lucia claims to have the religious authority to perform and pass on the <unk> rituals . Kélé is based around three deities , <unk> , Shango and Ogun , and is similar to the Nigerian Ogun festival . Kélé 's rituals involve contacting one 's ancestors to ask for protection , especially " good crops , good health , and good fortune " . Kélé has been underground for much of its history , and was only accepted by the Lucian Roman Catholic Church in the early 1960s . 
 Kélé rituals are accompanied by the drumming of the tanbou <unk> ( mother drum ) and the tanbou ich ( child drum ) , which play four different rhythms at specified moments ; these are the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> rhythms . Kélé rituals also include singing and dance , as well as feasting , praying to Ogun and the other gods , the smashing of the calabash to appease <unk> at the end of the ceremony , the display of tools made of iron and steel to honor Ogun , and smooth stones to represent Shango , who also receives a ceremonially cleansed sacrificial ram . 
 = = Popular music = = 
 Lucian popular music can be traced back to the 1940s , when calypso became a part of the island 's musical culture . Calypso is a lyrical Trinidadian genre , related to several styles found through the Antillean music area . Music scholar <unk> Guilbault has called calypso the primary way modern Lucians " express social commentary " . Along with calypso , Lucia has also imported the Trinidadian steelband and soca traditions . 
 Some Lucian calypsonians recorded in the 1980s , mostly on 45 @-@ RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today . The Lucian music industry is quite small scale , due to the island 's small market , its lack of recording studios and record producers , the widespread bootlegging of cassettes , and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures . Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International , which play a variety of popular music ; since 1989 , St Lucian radio stations have played an increasing number of programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue . 
 Modern Saint Lucia has produced a few popular musicians in various styles , but is most closely associated with calypso music . Popular Lucian musicians include Tru Tones , Rameau <unk> , <unk> , Disturbing Joan and <unk> Simmons . Marie <unk> <unk> Descartes ( known simply as " <unk> " ) was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her work as a <unk> and in the promotion of Saint Lucian traditional culture and music . Saint Lucian folk dance and theater includes flower dances , masquerades and the Papa Djab festival ; various kinds of music are associated with these celebrations . 
 = = = Roots revival = = = 
 In 1969 , three Saint Lucians ( Eric <unk> , Primrose <unk> and Charles Cadet ) collected numerous folk songs for a presentation at the 1969 Expo in Grenada and then again at Guyana 's 1973 <unk> . Two major folk groups emerged ; they were The <unk> ( led by Clement Springer ) and Joyce Auguste 's The Hewanorra Voices . Auguste later introduced folk music into Saint Lucian music education . By the end of the 1980s , music and other aspects of Lucian culture was an integral part of the Lucian education system . 
 In the time leading up to independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 , Saint Lucia underwent a profound political and cultural awakening and roots revival which drew on the rise of the black consciousness movement of the United States , the influence of the Caribbean Ecumenical Consultation for Development on local culture and the loosening of restrictions from the powerful Roman Catholic Church on non @-@ Christian cultural elements . Since 1973 , the non @-@ government organization Folk Research Centre which seeks to " promote research into St. Lucian culture " and to " explore and clarify the role of culture in the development of our people " .

 Bouyon soca typically blends old bouyon music rhythms from the 90s ' and soca music . In recent years Bouyon soca has become popular in the island of Saint Lucia . Saint Lucian artist Ricky T released a song " Pressure boom " in 2007 which blended the two genres and became very popular throughout the English speaking Caribbean . 
 This style of bouyon is mostly , but not exclusively , produced in Saint Lucia . 
 = = Government and industry = = 
 The government has seen value in promoting a music industry , and has formed the Cultural Development Foundation ( CDF ) the statutory body given responsibility for preservation and promotion of Saint Lucian culture and <unk> to accomplish this goal . In 1979 , the first @-@ ever M & C Fine Arts Awards were given by <unk> & <unk> Ltd , to Saint Lucian artists as an Independence Gift to the Nation ; in the early 2000s , this event was handed over to the newly formed Cultural Development Foundation and is now run as the National Arts Festival . The Folk Research Centre has been a prominent part of Lucian cultural research since 1973 , and has also published the journal Lucian <unk> , devoted to Lucian calypso , since 1990 . The island 's calypso traditions are also celebrated at the annual <unk> ( a <unk> symposium ) , held since 1987 . The island 's music industry remains little @-@ known internationally and of small economic importance . The government of Saint Lucia has worked with the <unk> to promote the regional music industry through intellectual property law and sponsoring festivals and other activities . 
 The most important festival in modern Lucian culture is the Jounen Kwéyòl ( International Creole Day ) held annually on October 28 since 1983 . The Jounen Kwéyòl is sponsored by the <unk> Kwéyòl , an international organization . Lucian activities are run by the Folk Research Centre in conjunction with the National Research and Development Foundation and the <unk> Kwéyòl Sent Lisi ( St. Lucia Creole Movement ) . Lucian law protects the owners of intellectual property , such as songwriters , through the Copyright Act of 1995 ; copyrights are administered by the Hewanorra Musical Society . 
 There is also a Saint Lucia Jazz Festival that is a major attraction , and a well @-@ known part of the local music scene . It has been an annual event for fifteen years , and has hosted a variety of jazz stars , in addition to local talent . The 2005 festival was a boost for the local music industry , netting $ 46 million . The Festival is sponsored by a number of corporations and groups , perhaps most significantly BET . 
 = = Education = = 
 Music is a part of the curriculum at public schools in Saint Lucia ; it has long been taught in younger grade levels , but was only introduced to secondary education in 1999 . Primary education on Saint Lucia , music and other artistic education is commonly used incidentally to teaching other subjects or for special occasions . About 40 % of the island 's schools engage in general music education , while others spent more time on general group singing or choir , or recorder ensemble performance . In 2003 , a string program was instituted for primary students . 
 About 70 % of schools teach music at the lower secondary level . Many of the schools that do not normally instruct in music may offer volunteer clubs or other more informal opportunities for musical enrichment . Many Lucian schools have formed ensembles , most commonly a wind ensemble ( 30 % of schools ) , or a steelpan band ( 20 % ) or combo group ( 20 % ) . The public education field has also collaborated with the Saint Lucia School of Music to form the National Youth Choir , String Orchestra and Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble . The governmental Ministry of Education also sponsors a number of festivals and musical special events , both for the benefit of all students and the enrichment of the musically @-@ gifted among them . 
 The Saint Lucia School of Music is an independent institute of music education that has two branches on the island , one in the north and one in the south . It was established in 1987 , and has a student body of around four hundred students . The School 's professed goal is to provide music education at all levels , to offer community opportunities for musical enrichment , to facilitate the training and professional development of educators , and to establish the school as a musical resource . There is also a notable music Education Centre operated by a vocal group from the fishing village Anse la Raye ; this Centre provides music education opportunities for gifted and underprivileged children from across the island .

 Cave Story ( <unk> , <unk> Monogatari ) is a freeware platform @-@ adventure video game released in 2004 for the PC . It was developed over five years by Daisuke " Pixel " Amaya in his free time . Cave Story features 2D platform mechanics and is reminiscent of the classic games the developer played in his youth , such as Metroid . 
 After its initial self @-@ published release , Cave Story slowly gained popularity on the Internet . It received wide critical acclaim for its compelling story and gameplay . Independent developer Nicalis worked with Amaya to port the game to WiiWare and DSiWare in 2010 . An enhanced version , Cave Story + , was released for Steam in November 2011 , with a Nintendo 3DS release in October 2012 . A 3D remake of the game , titled Cave Story 3D , was developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America for the Nintendo 3DS in November 2011 . 
 The game focuses on an amnesiac protagonist who awakens in a cave . Through his explorations , he discovers a plot by the Doctor , a megalomaniac who intends to force the inhabitants of the cave to fight for him in his bid to conquer the world . The protagonist is thrust into the position of savior as he endeavors to defeat the Doctor .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Cave Story takes place within the cavernous interior of a floating island . The island is populated by Mimigas , a race of sentient , rabbit @-@ like creatures . A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas , upon ingesting the flower , to temporarily grow to an abnormally large size with great strength and fall into a violent frenzy . The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown , which has vast magical powers . An army of killer robots was sent to the floating island on a previous expedition , seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world . These soldiers from the surface slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown . Shortly before the game begins , Professor Booster , the Sakamoto family , the " Doctor , " and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island , but they became stranded . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The player character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there . He finds a village of Mimigas , who are being persecuted by the Doctor . The Doctor 's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto , a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga . Not finding her , they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead . The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor , where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon , which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched . Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma , but King , the leader of Mimiga Village , captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko 's kidnapping . Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from <unk> . After freeing him , they meet Professor Booster , who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world . Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them . While there , the player meets Curly Brace , a female robot who also has no memories of her past , and Jenka , an old witch who is Misery 's mother and guardian of the red flowers . Jenka calls the player character a " soldier from the surface " , one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas . Balrog manages to obtain the key to the warehouse containing the red flowers from Jenka , who urges the player to stop them . Before the player can reach the warehouse , however , the Doctor samples a red flower on the captured Toroko and gravely injures King , and leaves the player to fight the rabid Toroko , who ultimately dies . 
 Misery transports the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor 's plans . Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape . Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit , revealing his kind nature . The pair find and defeat the Core , a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat . However , the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses . Depending on certain conditions , the player may rescue Curly Brace , who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character . When he returns to Mimiga Village , he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas . In the Egg Corridor , Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon , leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains . The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island 's Core , which would return the Mimigas to normal . The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers . The Doctor 's servants capture him and place him in a jail cell with Sue . She is taken away before the player wakes up , but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue 's family and Professor Booster , but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown . Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor . 
 If the player saved Curly Brace earlier , the player may find an item to restore her memories . She remembers that the player character 's name is Quote , and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past . Instead , they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands . Quote finds Sue 's mother , <unk> , who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides . After helping her complete the rocket , Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor . The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal , which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body . The Doctor 's spirit possesses the Core of the island , but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well , causing the island to begin falling to Earth . Under certain conditions , the player may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where the creator of the Demon Crown , Ballos , is imprisoned . Ballos , Jenka 's brother , was a powerful wizard who went insane after being tortured . Misery forced Ballos to create the Demon Crown , but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it . With the help of Curly Brace , Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall , saving its inhabitants . Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos ' collapsing prison — he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse . Quote , Curly Brace , and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace . 
 = = Development = = 
 Daisuke Amaya developed Cave Story in his free time over the course of five years . He began the project when he was in college and continued working on it after getting a job as a software developer . He started by writing the title screen music and programming rudimentary character movements . The idea for the cave setting evolved spontaneously when he created a number of enclosed spaces . Amaya admitted this lack of planning caused " problems down the line " because he did not have dedicated map editing and data management tools . Amaya describes the game as having an " old @-@ fashioned feel " , reminiscent of the games he played as a child like Metroid . More importantly , this " retro " design choice allowed him to create a large volume of artwork on his own , which would have been impossible for a 3D game . 
 At a Game Developers Conference project post @-@ mortem , he emphasized the role of pragmatic design in shaping the game . While designing the main character , Quote , Amaya drew inspiration from Mario 's iconic original appearance — a large , expressive face and a high contrast between his white skin and red shirt make him stand out from the dark cave backgrounds . Most other characters feature either light skin or white clothes for the same reason . To make levels memorable , Amaya designed them around a single theme , such as " warmth " for the Egg Corridor or " arid and oppressive " for the Sand Zone . Instead of a tutorial level , a concept Amaya dislikes , the first level of the game gives the player two paths , one of which is blocked off until retrieving an item from the other path . This setup , inspired by the opening of Metroid , " lets players feel like they 've solved problems on their own " and persists throughout the game . In beta versions of the game , all the enemies were shaped like bars of soap , a concept that evolved into the Balrog character . There was also a " frog prince " character who could travel through water more easily . Elements of this beta were incorporated into the Nintendo 3DS version of the game . 
 Quote appears as a downloadable character in Bit.Trip Presents ... <unk> : Future Legend of Rhythm Alien .

 Cave Story has been ported to Linux , <unk> , <unk> , AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X operating systems , PlayStation Portable , Xbox , Dreamcast , GP2X , GP2X Wiz , and the TI graphing calculator . An enhanced port , featuring updated character designs , remixed music and extra game modes , was developed by Nicalis and released on WiiWare on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe . Nicalis also ported the game to DSiWare on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan . Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound or some of the extra modes from the Wii version , it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode . There is also a free / libre SDL @-@ based recreation of the original game engine , titled <unk> , made by programmer Caitlin Shaw , which allows for extended modification of the game , and the creation of ports for additional devices . The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS 's Nintendo eShop service ( separate from the retail 3DS game ) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014 . This version includes the DSiWare version 's Jukebox mode , as well as all the additional modes included in Cave Story + .

 Cave Story 3D is a 3D version of the game developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS . It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America , 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan . The game was built from scratch using 3D character models , featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level , as well as a remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky . The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies ' franchises such as Crazy Climber , Ikki , and Dragon Slayer . In order to devote more time to perfecting the title , Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D . He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The original Cave Story earned widespread critical acclaim . 1UP.com described it as " so massive that it rivals modern [ Game Boy Advance ] Castlevania and Metroid games in terms of scope and play time " . Matt Miller of Game Informer observed that Cave Story combines elements of Metroid , Ninja Gaiden , Mega Man , The Legend of Zelda , and Castlevania into an " engrossing , challenging , and quite lengthy " whole . Inside Mac Games ascribed the game 's popularity to its " polished feel , engaging storyline , and compelling artwork " . Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that " the burgeoning Western indie game scene owes a tremendous debt to Japanese pioneers like Studio Pixel , whose freeware hit Cave Story proved that with sufficient vision , skill , and passion , a single developer can still craft a deep , compelling action game " . Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid called Cave Story an " important game " , observing its influence on artistic indie games like Braid , as well as the continued relevance of 2D game design ( cf . Capcom 's Mega Man 9 ) . He also compares the game design to that of Shigeru Miyamoto in its ability to teach without tutorials , like at the beginning of Super Mario Bros. In July 2006 , Cave Story earned 1st place in Super PLAY 's list of the 50 best freeware games of all time . In July 2015 , the game placed 14th on USgamer 's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list . 
 The WiiWare version has received mostly positive reviews , with the central criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag ( US $ 12 , £ 10 ) , after years of free play . Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update , which " sacrifices none of [ the game 's ] classic @-@ influenced charm " . He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original . On the issue of price , he explained that " the prospect of Amaya finally earning a little something for the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic " and " absolutely worth your money " . John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments , but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music , recommending the original soundtrack . Edge compared the remake to The Secret of Monkey Island : Special Edition , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics . Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story " belongs on a Nintendo system " and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master , in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well . Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards , as well as WiiWare Game of the Year . 
 Criticism of Cave Story 3D echoed that of the WiiWare version . Many reviewers cautioned that the graphical update does not justify the $ 40 initial price point , especially with cheaper or free versions of the game available through download services . Parish defended the release , deriving satisfaction from the game 's availability as a physical cartridge . Holmes praised the dynamic camera system and new graphics , comparing them to classic Disney films . He considers this release to be the " best version of the game , [ but ] not necessarily the definitive version " . Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the 3DS Circle Pad was a comfortable fit for the game 's control scheme . Audrey Drake of IGN noted that the 3D effect made it difficult to distinguish certain platforms between background and foreground , a complaint shared by Douglas . Simon Parkin of the UK Official Nintendo Magazine was more critical , citing lack of detail in the 3D models and a too @-@ dark color palette . Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly 's four reviewers scored it 7 , 7 , 8 , and 8 points out of 10 to a total of 30 out of 40 points , indicating average reviews . This version was nominated for Best Adventure Game at the 2011 Nintendo Power Awards . 
 = Amina Bokhary controversy = 
 The Amina Bokhary controversy occurred in Hong Kong in 2010 involving the assault conviction of a wealthy woman from a well @-@ connected political family . Amina Mariam Bokhary , 32 , received a non @-@ custodial sentence and a one @-@ year driving ban following an incident in the aftermath of a road traffic accident when she struck several police officers . As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008 , her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient . 
 The perceived leniency in her sentence provoked an uproar in Hong Kong for alleged preferential treatment . In particular , the presiding judge caused outrage when he said in his judgment that Bokhary had an " unblemished background and was born into a good family with caring parents [ and ] an outstanding academic record " . The comment highlighted the public perception of widening inequality and increasing disparities in the balance of political power between different social classes in Hong Kong . The judge came under pressure to reconsider his sentencing , but he declined to amend it upon review . Pundits also blamed the police for charging her with an offence carrying a lesser penalty ; the Department of Justice was forced to appeal her sentence . 
 Opinion polls carried out indicated that the public 's confidence in the judiciary and the impartiality of the courts had been shaken in light of the incident . In the end , after breaching her conditions of probation , Bokhary was jailed for six weeks . On appeal , her driving ban was further extended by two years . 
 = = Background to the incident = = 
 Bokhary is descended from influential Hong Kong families . Her grandfather , Daoud Bokhary , served in the British Indian Army and founded Bokhary Securities . Her father , Syed Bagh Ali Shah , was a council member of the former Stock Exchange of Hong Kong . Her uncle , Kemal , is a judge sitting at the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal , and Kemal 's wife is a High Court judge ; a maternal uncle , Ronald <unk> , was the chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and previously member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong . 
 Bokhary attended university in the United Kingdom and graduated with a first @-@ class honors degree in economics . She has had a string of jobs in the fashion industry , including Sotheby ’ s , LVMH , and Harvey Nichols in Hong Kong . According to her counsel , Bokhary failed to find peace or satisfaction in her personal and professional life after returning to Hong Kong from Britain , and in 2007 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder , for which she was being treated with strong psychotropic drugs and was reportedly undergoing intensive counselling . Her increasing alcohol consumption , combined with her medication , was said to have contributed to her violent outburst in 2008 . 
 = = = Prior incidents = = = 
 Bokhary 's first brush with the police was in the early hours of 24 June 2001 , when the manager of a bar in Central district of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance . When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary , she hit one officer on the cheek ; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs . Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person . She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK $ 9 @,@ 000 ( US $ 1 @,@ 153 ) . She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence . 
 Bokhary was involved in a second altercation at around 3 am on 13 July 2008 , again in Central . Short of cash with which to pay the HK $ 17 @.@ 80 taxi fare , she proffered her credit card . When the taxi driver refused , Bokhary angrily flung her credit card in the driver 's face ; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene . The police were called . As she was being questioned by the two officers , Bokhary struck one of them . She was arrested and charged with common assault and assaulting a police officer . She was on medication and had taken wine prior to the incident . Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008 , she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK $ 1 @,@ 000 in compensation . 
 = = Incident and trial = = 
 Bokhary 's vehicle was involved in a head @-@ on collision with a bus on Stubbs Road shortly after midnight on 27 January 2010 . She refused paramedics ' attempts to put her on a stretcher , returned to her vehicle , and continued to refuse to cooperate . She then attempted to walk away from the scene , but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer , whom she then slapped . She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving , refusing a breathalyser test , and two counts of assault on a police officer . She was released on HK $ 5 @,@ 000 bail . 
 Scheduled to appear in Eastern Magistrates ' Court on 7 April , Acting Principal Magistrate Bina <unk> recused herself due to her familiarity with Bokhary ; the defence was granted a further delay , to permit preparation of a medical assessment . She pleaded guilty on 7 July , advancing mental illness in mitigation . On 2 August , she was sentenced to 12 months ' probation and a fine of HK $ 8 @,@ 000 ; her driving licence was suspended for 12 months . As a condition of her probation , she would also enter a treatment programme at the Betty Ford Center in the United States . Passing sentence , magistrate Anthony Yuen Wai @-@ ming stated that her offences would normally result in prison time , but he decided to be lenient because of her mental disorder . Yuen 's comment in his judgment that Bokhary has an " unblemished background and was born into a good family with caring parents [ and ] an outstanding academic record " caused an uproar locally . Her resulting probation was criticised in certain quarters , notably by the police , for its leniency . Between 6 and 7 August , Magistrate Yuen reviewed the case , but did not change his ruling . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 Various sectors of society expressed concern over the light sentence ; the Police Inspectors ' Association asked for clearer guidelines on the penalties to be expected in such cases . The Junior Police Officers ' Association also complained that the probation decision could not be seen as a deterrent , but accepted that the court decision had to be respected as the magistrate " would have considered all factors . " The Standard editorial derided Yuen 's reasoning as " unpersuasive " . Kevin <unk> , deputy director of public prosecutions , requested that Yuen rethink his sentence . The police also received criticism for charging Bokhary under the Police Force Ordinance – with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment – instead of the Offences Against the Person Ordinance , which carries a maximum two @-@ year sentence . Police Director of Crime and Security Xavier Tang responded that the lesser charge had been chosen because officers believed they had a better chance of conviction – she was said to be ready to plead guilty to assaulting police . 
 = = = Public = = = 
 An editorial in the South China Morning Post ( <unk> ) criticised Yuen 's for citing her background , family , education and academic achievement as being mitigating factors , which to some implied such would " buy leniency from the courts " . It summarised that " The failure to show any logical connection between family background and the sentence leaves the public with the perception that those with a notable surname are more equal than others . " 
 With widespread criticism of his decision , the <unk> published on 7 August an explanation by Yuen , in which he said that Bokhary 's behaviour was " consistent with the mental illness she was , and is still , suffering " . He added that sending the defendant to " prison for a few months would air the grievances of the public , but would destroy the rest of the life of the defendant . " 
 Approximately 300 people protested outside the Legislative Council Building in Central on 8 August , while another 50 , among them retired policemen , joined a Liberal Party @-@ led march from Wan Chai to the Department of Justice building . In a telephone survey of 1 @,@ 100 people conducted from 10 – 13 August by the Hong Kong Research Association , 91 % responded that they felt the sentence was too light . Another survey of 1 @,@ 007 people in the same period by the University of Hong Kong found that confidence in the judiciary had fallen ; respondents ' ratings on " fairness of the judicial system " fell to the lowest level since October 2004 , while " rule of law " indicator and confidence in the " impartiality of the courts " also declined in the month . A Facebook page complaining about the sentence had attracted 42 @,@ 500 participants by 4 August . Another Facebook group allegedly inciting Hong Kong residents to slap police officers was shut down by the site 's administrators . Bokhary 's lawyer Peter Duncan disputes that the widespread perception for Bokhary receiving a light sentence was due to her family 's wealth and connections . 
 Under public pressure , the Department of Justice ( <unk> ) stated on 4 August that they were considering an appeal against Bokhary 's sentence . In particular , Secretary for Justice Wong Yan @-@ lung described Yuen 's sentence as " inadequate " and stated that he would initiate a review . In a press release on 11 August , the <unk> stated that they had filed the application for leave to review with the Court of Appeal two days earlier . 
 = = = Legal profession = = = 
 In response to the increased negative attention on the judiciary , the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong on 11 August issued a joint statement to " allay misgivings of the public " and to explain the court 's approach , whilst deploring " any attempt to bring public pressure on a Judge or Magistrate to change his or her mind upon a review of sentence " . Senior Counsel Martin Lee also spoke out against the protest , which he described as mob rule and detrimental to the rule of law . Lee said he would have handed down the same sentence as Yuen in light of the facts of the case . Public focus had been expected to remain on Yuen as he is also the judge handling the case of Christina Chan , the protester charged with assaulting a police officer during the 2010 Hong Kong new year march , although the chairman of the Hong Kong Police Officers ' Association stated that the two cases were not comparable . Chan was acquitted of the assault on 3 September . 
 = = = Pundits = = = 
 Former legislator Albert Cheng noted that had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance , and not the Offences Against the Person Ordinance , she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years ; furthermore , the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman at the police station after her arrest ; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving . Cheng said : " The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice . But , in this case , its targets shouldn 't be the government or the courts , but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan @-@ lung , who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters . " Legislator and former Secretary for Security , Regina Ip , said : " At the end of the day , the sense of outrage is not about justice and penalties , but about the widening inequality between rich and poor , between the corporate giant and the artless individual , and the yawning asymmetry of money , knowledge and expert power between the haves and have @-@ nots of our society . " Political commentator Michael <unk> agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair , and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view . He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary 's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging : the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure ; if she was not jailed , the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism . 
 = = = Probation breach and jail sentence = = = 
 Bokhary appeared before magistrates court on 23 December 2010 and was sentenced to six weeks in jail for breaking five out of seven conditions of her 2 August probation order – she failed to complete three months ' alcohol rehabilitation in the United States ; failed to report to her probation officer or to participate in programs arranged by same as required ; did not reside as directed ; refused to receive psychiatric and psychological treatment . Her lawyer said Bokhary had become increasingly paranoid as a result of the media attention and felt that “ she had become a target of abuse . ” The court rejected her bail application . Prosecution appealed the sentence – a one @-@ year driving ban and probation order – imposed on Bokhary for failing to provide a breath specimen . The appeal against the probation order was dropped when she was jailed , but at a hearing on 11 January , the Court of Appeal extended Bokhary 's driving ban to three years . She served four weeks of the sentence , and was released on 22 January 2011 . 
 = Adenosine triphosphate = 
 Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) is a nucleoside triphosphate used in cells as a coenzyme often called the " molecular unit of currency " of intracellular energy transfer . 
 ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism . It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation , aerobic respiration , and fermentation , and is used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes , including biosynthetic reactions , motility , and cell division . One molecule of ATP contains three phosphate groups , and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes , including ATP synthase , from adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) or adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) and various phosphate group donors . Substrate @-@ level phosphorylation , oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration , and photophosphorylation in photosynthesis are three major mechanisms of ATP biosynthesis . 
 Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it back into its precursors . ATP is therefore continuously recycled in organisms : the human body , which on average contains only 250 grams ( 8 @.@ 8 oz ) of ATP , turns over its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day . 
 ATP is used as a substrate in signal transduction pathways by kinases that phosphorylate proteins and lipids . It is also used by adenylate cyclase , which uses ATP to produce the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP . The ratio between ATP and AMP is used as a way for a cell to sense how much energy is available and control the metabolic pathways that produce and consume ATP . Apart from its roles in signaling and energy metabolism , ATP is also incorporated into nucleic acids by polymerases in the process of transcription . ATP is the neurotransmitter believed to signal the sense of taste . 
 The structure of this molecule consists of a purine base ( adenine ) attached by the 9 ′ nitrogen atom to the 1 ′ carbon atom of a pentose sugar ( ribose ) . Three phosphate groups are attached at the 5 ′ carbon atom of the pentose sugar . It is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter @-@ convert ATP , ADP and AMP . When ATP is used in DNA synthesis , the ribose sugar is first converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase . 
 ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann , and independently by Cyrus Fiske and <unk> <unk> of Harvard Medical School , but its correct structure was not determined until some years later . It was proposed to be the intermediary molecule between energy @-@ yielding and energy @-@ requiring reactions in cells by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941 . It was first artificially synthesized by Alexander Todd in 1948 . 
 = = Physical and chemical properties = = 
 ATP consists of adenosine – composed of an adenine ring and a ribose sugar – and three phosphate groups ( triphosphate ) . The phosphoryl groups , starting with the group closest to the ribose , are referred to as the alpha ( α ) , beta ( β ) , and gamma ( γ ) phosphates . Consequently , it is closely related to the adenine nucleotide , a monomer of RNA . ATP is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between pH 6 @.@ 8 and 7 @.@ 4 , but is rapidly hydrolysed at extreme pH . Consequently , ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt . 
 ATP is an unstable molecule in unbuffered water , in which it hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate . This is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP is less than the strength of the hydrogen bonds ( hydration bonds ) , between its products ( ADP and phosphate ) , and water . Thus , if ATP and ADP are in chemical equilibrium in water , almost all of the ATP will eventually be converted to ADP . A system that is far from equilibrium contains Gibbs free energy , and is capable of doing work . Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium , with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP . This displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of ATP in the cell releases a large amount of free energy . 
 Two phosphoanhydride bonds ( those that connect adjacent phosphates ) in an ATP molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule . In the context of biochemical reactions , these anhydride bonds are frequently – and sometimes controversially – referred to as high @-@ energy bonds ( despite the fact it takes energy to break bonds ) . Energy stored in ATP may be released upon hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds . The primary phosphate group on the ATP molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions is the γ @-@ phosphate group . Located the farthest from the ribose sugar , it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α- or β @-@ phosphate . The bonds formed after hydrolysis – or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP – are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP . During enzyme @-@ catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP or phosphorylation by ATP , the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work . 
 Any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy , if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction . However , as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules , the breakdown of RNA , DNA , and ATP into simpler monomers is driven by both energy @-@ release and entropy @-@ increase considerations , in both standard concentrations , and also those concentrations encountered within the cell . 
 The standard amount of energy released from hydrolysis of ATP can be calculated from the changes in energy under non @-@ natural ( standard ) conditions , then correcting to biological concentrations . The net change in heat energy ( enthalpy ) at standard temperature and pressure of the decomposition of ATP into hydrated ADP and hydrated inorganic phosphate is − 30 @.@ 5 kJ / mol , with a change in free energy of 3 @.@ 4 kJ / mol . The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate ( Pi ) or pyrophosphate ( PPi ) unit from ATP at standard state of 1 M are : 
 ATP + H 
 2O → ADP + Pi ΔG ° 
 = − 30 @.@ 5 kJ / mol ( − 7 @.@ 3 kcal / mol ) 
 ATP + H 
 2O → AMP + PPi ΔG ° = 
 − 45 @.@ 6 kJ / mol ( − 10 @.@ 9 kcal / mol ) 
 These values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular ATP / ADP ratio . However , a more representative value ( which takes AMP into consideration ) called the Energy charge is increasingly being employed . The values given for the Gibbs free energy for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors , including overall ionic strength and the presence of alkaline earth metal ions such as Mg2 + and Ca2 + . Under typical cellular conditions , ΔG is approximately − 57 kJ / mol ( − 14 kcal / mol ) . 
 = = = Ionization in biological systems = = = 
 ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) has multiple groups with different acid dissociation constants . In neutral solution , ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP4 − , with a small proportion of <unk> − . As ATP has several negatively charged groups in neutral solution , it can chelate metals with very high affinity . The binding constant for various metal ions are ( given as per mole ) as Mg2 + ( <unk> ) , Na + ( 13 ) , Ca2 + ( <unk> ) , K + ( 8 ) , Sr2 + ( 1381 ) and Li + ( 25 ) . Due to the strength of these interactions , ATP exists in the cell mostly in a complex with Mg2 + . 
 = = Biosynthesis = = 
 The ATP concentration inside the cell is typically 1 – 10 mM . ATP can be produced by redox reactions using simple and complex sugars ( carbohydrates ) or lipids as an energy source . For complex fuels to be synthesized into ATP , they first need to be broken down into smaller , more simple molecules . Carbohydrates are hydrolysed into simple sugars , such as glucose and fructose . Fats ( triglycerides ) are metabolised to give fatty acids and glycerol . 
 The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide is known as cellular respiration and can produce about 30 molecules of ATP from a single molecule of glucose . ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes ; the three main pathways used to generate energy in eukaryotic organisms are glycolysis and the citric acid cycle / oxidative phosphorylation , both components of cellular respiration ; and beta @-@ oxidation . The majority of this ATP production by a non @-@ photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote takes place in the mitochondria , which can make up nearly 25 % of the total volume of a typical cell . 
 = = = Glycolysis = = = 
 In glycolysis , glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate via the glycolytic pathway . In most organisms , this process occurs in the cytosol , but , in some protozoa such as the kinetoplastids , this is carried out in a specialized organelle called the <unk> . Glycolysis generates a net two molecules of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes : <unk> and pyruvate kinase . Two molecules of NADH are also produced , which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase . The pyruvate generated as an end @-@ product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle . 
 = = = Glucose = = = 
 In the mitochondrion , pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group , which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle ( also known as the Krebs cycle ) . Every " turn " of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide , one molecule of the ATP equivalent guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) through substrate @-@ level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl @-@ CoA synthetase , three molecules of the reduced coenzyme NADH , and one molecule of the reduced coenzyme FADH2 . Both of these latter molecules are recycled to their oxidized states ( NAD + and FAD , respectively ) via the electron transport chain , which generates additional ATP by oxidative phosphorylation . The oxidation of an NADH molecule results in the synthesis of 2 – 3 ATP molecules , and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1 – 2 ATP molecules . The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process . Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen , it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is needed to recycle the reduced NADH and FADH2 to their oxidized states . In the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available NAD + and FAD . 
 The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate @-@ aspartate shuttle ( and to a lesser extent , the glycerol @-@ phosphate shuttle ) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD + . Instead of transferring the generated NADH , a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate , which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix . Another malate dehydrogenase @-@ catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction , producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion 's interior store of NAD + . A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space . 
 In oxidative phosphorylation , the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space . This creates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane . Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is , from the intermembrane space to the matrix – provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase . This enzyme contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during ATP synthesis . 
 Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol ; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix . The inner membrane contains an antiporter , the ADP / ATP translocase , which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space . This translocase is driven by the membrane potential , as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside . However , it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion ; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate , partially dissipating the proton gradient .

 Fatty acids can also be broken down to acetyl @-@ CoA by beta @-@ oxidation . Each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one NADH and one FADH2 molecule , which are used to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation . Because NADH and FADH2 are energy @-@ rich molecules , dozens of ATP molecules can be generated by the beta @-@ oxidation of a single long acyl chain . The high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary calories . 
 = = = Fermentation = = = 
 Fermentation entails the generation of energy via the process of substrate @-@ level phosphorylation in the absence of a respiratory electron transport chain . In most eukaryotes , glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor . The equation for the oxidation of glucose to lactic acid is :

 Anaerobic respiration is the process of respiration using an electron acceptor other than O 
 2 . In prokaryotes , multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration . These include nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide . These processes lead to the ecologically important processes of denitrification , sulfate reduction and acetogenesis , respectively . 
 = = = ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases = = = 
 ATP can also be synthesized through several so @-@ called " replenishment " reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of nucleoside diphosphate kinases ( <unk> ) , which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high @-@ energy phosphate donor , and the ATP : <unk> @-@ <unk> family . 
 = = = ATP production during photosynthesis = = = 
 In plants , ATP is synthesized in thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast during the light @-@ dependent reactions of photosynthesis in a process called photophosphorylation . Here , light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane . This produces a proton @-@ motive force and this drives the ATP synthase , exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation . Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle , which produces triose sugars . 
 = = = ATP recycling = = = 
 The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0 @.@ 2 moles . The majority of ATP is not usually synthesised de novo , but is generated from ADP by the aforementioned processes . Thus , at any given time , the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant . 
 The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles of ATP daily , which is around 50 to 75 kg . A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day . This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 500 to 750 times during a single day ( 100 / 0 @.@ 2 = 500 ) . ATP cannot be stored , hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis . However a total of around 5 g of ATP is used by cell processes at any time in the body . 
 = = Regulation of biosynthesis = = 
 ATP production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by allosteric mechanisms , by feedback effects , and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways . Key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions . 
 In glycolysis , hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product , glucose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate , and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself . The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP . The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual , since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK ; the biologically active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two possible conformations , only one of which binds the second substrate fructose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate ( F6P ) . The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation , but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly . A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP @-@ induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK , including cyclic AMP , ammonium ions , inorganic phosphate , and fructose @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates , particularly the ratio of NAD + to NADH and the concentrations of calcium , inorganic phosphate , ATP , ADP , and AMP . <unk> – the molecule that gives its name to the cycle – is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK , providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis . 
 In oxidative phosphorylation , the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase , which is regulated by the availability of its substrate – the reduced form of cytochrome c . The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates : 
 1 ⁄ 2 NADH + cyt cox + ADP + Pi ⇌ 1 ⁄ 2 NAD + + cyt cred + ATP 
 which directly implies this equation : 
 <formula> 
 Thus , a high ratio of [ NADH ] to [ NAD + ] or a high ratio of [ ADP ] [ Pi ] to [ ATP ] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity . An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm . 
 = = Functions in cells = = 
 = = = Metabolism , synthesis , and active transport = = = 
 ATP is consumed in the cell by energy @-@ requiring ( endergonic ) processes and can be generated by energy @-@ releasing ( exergonic ) processes . In this way ATP transfers energy between spatially separate metabolic reactions . ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions . This includes the synthesis of macromolecules , including DNA and RNA ( see below ) , and proteins . ATP also plays a critical role in the transport of macromolecules across cell membranes , e.g. exocytosis and endocytosis . 
 = = = Roles in cell structure and locomotion = = = 
 ATP is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the cytoskeleton . In a related process , ATP is required for the shortening of actin and myosin filament <unk> required for muscle contraction . This latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for locomotion and respiration . 
 = = = Cell signalling = = = 
 = = = = Extracellular signalling = = = = 
 ATP is also a signalling molecule . ATP , ADP , or adenosine are recognised by purinergic receptors . <unk> might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues . 
 In humans , this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system . Activity @-@ dependent release of ATP from synapses , axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as P2 . The P2Y receptors are metabotropic , i.e. G protein @-@ coupled and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic AMP levels . Though named between <unk> and <unk> , only nine members of the P2Y family have been cloned , and some are only related through weak homology and several ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) do not function as receptors that raise cytosolic calcium . The <unk> <unk> receptor subgroup comprises seven members ( <unk> – <unk> ) , which are ligand @-@ gated Ca2 + <unk> ion channels that open when bound to an extracellular purine nucleotide . In contrast to P2 receptors ( agonist order ATP > ADP > AMP > ADO ) , purinergic nucleoside triphosphates like ATP are not strong agonists of P1 receptors , which are strongly activated by adenosine and other nucleosides ( ADO > AMP > ADP > ATP ) . P1 receptors have A1 , A2a , A2b , and A3 subtypes ( " A " as a remnant of old nomenclature of adenosine receptor ) , all of which are G protein @-@ coupled receptors , A1 and A3 being coupled to Gi , and A2a and A2b being coupled to Gs . All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases . The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of ATP . In the CNS , adenosine has multiple functions , such as modulation of neural development , neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems . 
 = = = = Intracellular signaling = = = = 
 ATP is critical in signal transduction processes . It is used by kinases as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions . <unk> activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction . Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase cascade . 
 ATP is also used by adenylate cyclase and is transformed to the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP , which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores . This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function , although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes . 
 = = = DNA and RNA synthesis = = = 
 In all known organisms , the <unk> that make up DNA are synthesized by the action of ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides . These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from ribose to deoxyribose by removing oxygen from the 2 ′ hydroxyl group ; the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products <unk> diphosphates ( the latter are denoted <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> respectively . ) All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds in the course of the reaction . RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with thioredoxin or <unk> . 
 The regulation of RNR and related enzymes maintains a balance of dNTPs relative to each other and relative to <unk> in the cell . Very low dNTP concentration inhibits DNA synthesis and DNA repair and is lethal to the cell , while an abnormal ratio of dNTPs is mutagenic due to the increased likelihood of the DNA polymerase incorporating the wrong dNTP during DNA synthesis . Regulation of or differential specificity of RNR has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dNTP pools under cellular stress such as hypoxia . 
 In the synthesis of the nucleic acid RNA , adenosine derived from ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases . The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate ( two phosphate groups ) . The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis , except that ATP is reduced to the <unk> <unk> , before incorporation into DNA . 
 = = Amino acid activation in protein synthesis = = 
 Aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetase enzymes utilize ATP as an energy source to attach a tRNA molecule to its specific amino acid , forming an aminoacyl @-@ tRNA complex , ready for translation at ribosomes . The energy is made available by ATP hydrolysis to adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) as two phosphate groups are removed . Amino acid activation refers to the attachment of an amino acid to its Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) . Aminoacyl transferase binds Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to amino acid , PP is released . Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP @-@ amino acid to tRNA . The AMP is used in this step . 
 = = = Amino Acid Activation = = = 
 During amino acid activation the amino acids ( aa ) are attached to their corresponding tRNA . The coupling reactions are catalysed by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetases ( named after the reaction product aminoacyl @-@ tRNA or aa @-@ tRNA ) . The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps : 
 aa + ATP aa @-@ AMP + PPi 
 aa @-@ AMP + tRNA aa @-@ tRNA + AMP 
 The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3 ′ <unk> of the tRNA ( the A in the sequence CCA ) via an ester bond ( roll over in illustration ) . The formation of the ester bond conserves a considerable part of the energy from the activation reaction . This stored energy provides the majority of the energy needed for peptide bond formation during translation . 
 Each of the 20 amino acids are recognized by its specific aminoacyl @-@ tRNA synthetase . The synthetases are usually composed of one to four protein subunits . The enzymes vary considerably in structure although they all perform the same type of reaction by binding ATP , one specific amino acid and its corresponding tRNA . 
 The specificity of the amino acid activation is as critical for the translational accuracy as the correct matching of the codon with the anticodon . The reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the tRNA during translation . Thus , the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between tRNAs with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids . 
 The error frequency of the amino acid activation reaction is approximately 1 in 10000 despite the small structural differences between some of the amino acids . 
 = = Binding to proteins = = 
 Some proteins that bind ATP do so in a characteristic protein fold known as the Rossmann fold , which is a general nucleotide @-@ binding structural domain that can also bind the coenzyme NAD . The most common ATP @-@ binding proteins , known as kinases , share a small number of common folds ; the protein kinases , the largest kinase superfamily , all share common structural features specialized for ATP binding and phosphate transfer . 
 ATP in complexes with proteins , in general , requires the presence of a divalent cation , almost always magnesium , which binds to the ATP phosphate groups . The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the dissociation constant of ATP from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound . The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation . 
 = = ATP analogues = = 
 Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP @-@ dependent molecular processes . Enzyme inhibitors of ATP @-@ dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP @-@ dependent reactions . ATP analogs are also used in X @-@ ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP , often together with other substrates . Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be ; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP @-@ bound state . Adenosine 5 ′ - ( γ @-@ <unk> ) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma @-@ phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom ; this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP @-@ dependent processes . In crystallographic studies , hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion . However , caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs , since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration . 
 = Jim Hensley = 
 James Willis " Jim " Hensley ( April 12 , 1920 – June 21 , 2000 ) was an American businessman in the beer industry . 
 Hensley was born in Texas and moved to Arizona during his youth . He was a bombardier on B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses during World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . After the war he was convicted of illegal distribution of liquor and was also involved in a racetrack operation that was investigated by authorities . 
 He founded Hensley & Co. in 1955 . Headquartered in Phoenix , it grew to be one of the largest Anheuser @-@ Busch beer <unk> in the nation . One of Arizona 's richest men at the time of his death , Hensley was the father of Cindy Hensley McCain and the father @-@ in @-@ law of United States Senator and 2000 and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain . 
 = = Early life , military service and family = = 
 Hensley was born in San Antonio , Texas to Jessie and James L. Hensley . The family was poor and his father was an alcoholic . They lived in the South until moving to Arizona ; Hensley graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1936 . He married Mary Jeanne Parks , his high school sweetheart , around 1937 , and worked as a paper salesman . 
 Hensley and his older brother , Eugene , first began working in the liquor distribution business before World War II , being in the employ of Kemper Marley , Sr. , an Arizona rancher who had become wealthy in that business in Phoenix and Tucson following the end of Prohibition . The brothers started the United Liquor Co. in Phoenix and the United Distribution Co. in Tucson . 
 Jim Hensley then served three years as an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II . He was a bombardier on B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses . On his thirteenth mission , his plane was shot down over the English Channel ; around the same time , his wife gave birth to their daughter , Kathleen Ann Hensley , in February 1943 . In all , his planes were shot down two or three times . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . 
 Hensley was injured during his service , and sent to a West Virginia medical facility to recover . There he met Marguerite " Smitty " Johnson ( born Cairo , Illinois , January 16 , 1919 , died Scottsdale , Arizona , October 11 , 2006 , daughter of Swedish American parents ) , who had one daughter , Dixie , from a previous relationship . Hensley divorced his wife , and shortly thereafter married Marguerite on March 29 , 1945 in Memphis , Tennessee while on leave from the USAAF . They would have one child together , Cindy Lou Hensley , born 1954 . Hensley 's first daughter grew up with her mother , but he maintained occasional contact with her . 
 = = Early business career , legal issues = = 
 Following his discharge in 1945 , Hensley and his brother went back to work for Marley in his United Sales Company in Phoenix and United Distributors in Tucson . In 1948 , both brothers were prosecuted by the federal government and convicted of multiple counts of falsifying liquor records in a conspiracy to conceal illegal distribution of whiskey against post @-@ war rationing regulations . Jim Hensley received a six @-@ month sentence ( later upheld but suspended by an appeals court ) while his brother received a year in federal prison , and both were fined . In 1953 , Jim Hensley and Marley were charged by federal prosecutors with falsifying liquor records . Defended by future Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist , they were acquitted . 
 In December 1952 , the Hensley brothers bought into the Ruidoso Downs racetrack in New Mexico , with Eugene running it and Jim returning to Phoenix . In a May 1953 hearing before the New Mexico State Racing Commission , the Hensley brothers concealed the existence an equal partner , Clarence " <unk> " Baldwin , who had been banned from any ownership role due to illegal bookmaking activities . A 1953 New Mexico State Police investigation found further that Kemper Marley was a financial backer for bookmakers and had connections with Baldwin and with the bookmaking operations of organized crime , a conclusion echoed decades later by the Arizona Project investigative reporting team . The Hensley brothers gained their Ruidoso Downs racetrack license in 1953 , as no New Mexico law barred convicted felons from race track ownership , although in 1955 new Governor of New Mexico John F. Simms would say he was " appalled " by the previous administration 's decision to do so . Previous Governor Edwin L. <unk> had defended the approval , saying that the <unk> had been under constant surveillance and deserved continued attention , but that no action was taken against them because the investigation showed that as race tracks go , all laws apparently were being observed . Jim Hensley would sell his interest in Ruidoso Downs to his brother Eugene in 1955 ( who would in turn sell it to a Marley @-@ connected company in 1969 ) . 
 = = Hensley & Co . = = 
 In 1955 , Hensley founded the beer distributorship that would have his name , borrowing $ 10 @,@ 000 against everything he had to buy a small existing distributorship . He was given a state liquor license despite his normally disqualifying past felony conviction . At the start it had 15 workers , sold 73 @,@ 000 cases of beer a year , and had a 6 percent market share . Hensley soon switched to exclusively distributing Anheuser @-@ Busch beer . Under the early names Hensley & Company Distributors and Hensley & Company Wholesale , the company saw decades of steady growth . It was aided by the Phoenix area becoming one of the fastest @-@ growing regions of the country while the company maintained its position as Anheuser @-@ Busch 's only distributor there . Jim Hensley 's tireless sales efforts and the generous wages and benefits he gave employees were also key success factors . By 1980 the business had become quite successful and Jim Hensley was a multi @-@ millionaire . Hensley had also distanced himself from Marley , and had helped set up a local hospital ; nevertheless , he was never fully accepted by the Phoenix establishment . 
 In 1981 , Hensley hired his new son @-@ in @-@ law John McCain , recently married to his daughter Cindy , as Vice President of Public Relations for Hensley & Co . McCain soon left to begin his Congressional career with a victory in the 1982 election for U.S. House of Representatives . Jim Hensley 's past record with the law , as well as his past connection to Marley ( who was suspected by the police in the 1976 car @-@ bomb murder of Arizona Republic investigative reporter Don Bolles ) , were raised by McCain 's opponent in the 1986 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate . McCain won that election handily . 
 As his business continued to grow , Hensley became one of Arizona 's richest men , although he never sought publicity . He held most of the controlling stock in Hensley & Co . , although by 2000 his health was poor and he had withdrawn from daily operational control . With 500 employees , annual revenues at the time were about $ 220 million on 20 million cases of beer sold ; Hensley & Co. was the second @-@ largest Anheuser @-@ Busch distributor in the nation , the fifth @-@ largest beer distributorship overall in the nation and the 12th largest privately held company in Arizona . Jim Hensley was a major contributor to charity in the Phoenix metropolitan area as well , starting the Hensley Family Foundation . He also supported groups such as NASCAR and Gilbert Rodeo Days . 
 Hensley died in Phoenix on June 21 , 2000 . His frequently @-@ amended will left his entire estate to Cindy Hensley McCain , who became the controlling stockholder and chair of the board after his death . His first daughter Kathleen , her husband and children had received substantial ongoing gifts , credit cards , and college tuition payments in the decade before his death , but were left only one modest lump sum from his estate . 
 = Everglades = 
 The Everglades ( or Pa @-@ hay @-@ okee ) are a natural region of tropical wetlands in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida , comprising the southern half of a large drainage basin and part of the neotropic ecozone . The system begins near Orlando with the Kissimmee River , which discharges into the vast but shallow Lake Okeechobee . Water leaving the lake in the wet season forms a slow @-@ moving river 60 miles ( 97 km ) wide and over 100 miles ( 160 km ) long , flowing southward across a limestone shelf to Florida Bay at the southern end of the state . The Everglades experience a wide range of weather patterns , from frequent flooding in the wet season to drought in the dry season . Writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas popularized the term " River of Grass " to describe the sawgrass marshes , part of a complex system of interdependent ecosystems that include cypress swamps , the estuarine mangrove forests of the Ten Thousand Islands , tropical hardwood hammocks , pine rockland , and the marine environment of Florida Bay . 
 Human habitation in the southern portion of the Florida peninsula dates to 15 @,@ 000 years ago . Before European colonization , the region was dominated by the native Calusa and Tequesta tribes . With Spanish colonization , both tribes declined gradually during the following two centuries . The Seminole formed from mostly Creek people who had been warring to the North ; they assimilated other peoples and created a new culture . After being forced from northern Florida into the Everglades during the Seminole Wars of the early 19th century , they adapted to the region and were able to resist removal by the United States Army . 
 Migrants to the region who wanted to develop plantations first proposed draining the Everglades in 1848 , but no work of this type was attempted until 1882 . Canals were constructed throughout the first half of the 20th century , and spurred the South Florida economy , prompting land development . In 1947 , Congress formed the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project , which built 1 @,@ 400 miles ( 2 @,@ 300 km ) of canals , levees , and water control devices . The Miami metropolitan area grew substantially at this time and Everglades water was diverted to cities . Portions of the Everglades were transformed into farmland , where the primary crop was sugarcane . Approximately 50 percent of the original Everglades has been developed as agricultural or urban areas . 
 Following this period of rapid development and environmental degradation , the ecosystem began to receive notable attention from conservation groups in the 1970s . Internationally , UNESCO and the Ramsar Convention designated the Everglades a Wetland Area of Global Importance . The construction of a large airport 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of Everglades National Park was blocked when an environmental study found that it would severely damage the South Florida ecosystem . With heightened awareness and appreciation of the region , restoration began in the 1980s with the removal of a canal that had straightened the Kissimmee River . However , development and sustainability concerns have remained pertinent in the region . The deterioration of the Everglades , including poor water quality in Lake Okeechobee , was linked to the diminishing quality of life in South Florida 's urban areas . In 2000 the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was approved by congress to combat these problems . To date , it is the most expensive and comprehensive environmental restoration attempt in history , but its implementation has faced political complications . 
 = = Names = = 
 The first written record of the Everglades was on Spanish maps made by cartographers who had not seen the land . They named the unknown area between the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida Laguna del Espíritu Santo ( " Lake of the Holy Spirit " ) . The area was featured on maps for decades without having been explored . Writer John Grant Forbes stated in 1811 , " The Indians represent [ the Southern points ] as impenetrable ; and the [ British ] surveyors , wreckers , and coasters , had not the means of exploring beyond the borders of the sea coast , and the mouths of rivers " . 
 British surveyor John Gerard de Brahm , who mapped the coast of Florida in 1773 , called the area " River Glades " . Both Marjory Stoneman Douglas and linguist Wallace McMullen suggest that cartographers substituted " Ever " for " River " . The name " Everglades " first appeared on a map in 1823 , although it was also spelled as " Ever Glades " as late as 1851 . The Seminole call it Pa @-@ hay @-@ okee , meaning " Grassy Water . " The region was labeled " Pa @-@ hai @-@ okee " on an American military map from 1839 , although it had earlier been called " Ever Glades " throughout the Second Seminole War . 
 A 2007 survey by geographers Ary J. <unk> and Raymond K. <unk> found that the " Glades " has emerged as a distinct vernacular region of Florida . It comprises the interior areas and southernmost Gulf Coast of South Florida , largely corresponding to the Everglades itself . It is one of the most sparsely populated areas of the state . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The geology of South Florida , together with a warm , wet , subtropical climate , provides conditions well @-@ suited for a large marshland ecosystem . Layers of porous and permeable limestone create water @-@ bearing rock and soil that affect the climate , weather , and hydrology of South Florida . The properties of the rock underneath the Everglades can be explained by the geologic history of the state . The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana . About 300 million years ago , North America merged with Africa , connecting Florida with North America . Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock . Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 million years ago . When Florida was part of Africa , it was initially above water , but during the cooler Jurassic Period , the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited . Through the Cretaceous Period , most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths . The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed . 
 = = = Limestone and aquifers = = = 
 Fluctuating sea levels compressed numerous layers of calcium carbonate , sand , and shells . The resulting permeable limestone formations that developed between 25 million and 70 million years ago created the Floridan Aquifer , which serves as the main source of fresh water for the northern portion of Florida . However , this aquifer lies beneath thousands of feet of impermeable sedimentary rock from Lake Okeechobee to the southern tip of the peninsula . 
 Five geologic formations make up the southern portion of Florida : the Tamiami Formation , Caloosahatchee Formation , Anastasia Formation , Miami Limestone ( or Miami Oolite ) , and the Fort Thompson Formation . The Tamiami Formation is a compression of highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands and pockets of quartz , 150 feet ( 46 m ) thick . It is named for the Tamiami Trail that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp , and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades . Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation , named for the river over it . Much less permeable , this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of sandy shell marl , clay , and sand . Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized . Both the Tamiami and Caloosahatchee Formations developed during the Pliocene Epoch . 
 Surrounding the southern part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation , made of dense , hard limestone , shells , and sand . Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes — smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table . In this formation the beds are generally impermeable . Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation , composed of shelly limestone , coquina , and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh . The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with <unk> and solution holes . The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations , and Miami Limestone and ( x ) , were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period . 
 The geologic formations that have the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation . The Miami Limestone forms the floor of the lower Everglades . The Miami Limestone is made up of ooids : tiny formations of egg @-@ shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate , formed around a single grain of sand . The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite , which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms . The unique structure was some of the first material used in housing in early 20th @-@ century South Florida . The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology , plant life , and wildlife above it : the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades , and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region . The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay . 
 The metropolitan areas of Miami , Fort Lauderdale , and West Palm Beach are located on a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida , called the Eastern Coastal Ridge , that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation . Along the western border of the Big Cypress Swamp is the <unk> Ridge ( or <unk> Rise ) , a slight rise of compressed sand that divides the runoff between the Caloosahatchee River and The Big Cypress . This slight rise in elevation on both sides of the Everglades creates a basin , and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee to creep toward the southwest . Under both the Miami Limestone formation and the Fort Thompson limestone lies the Biscayne Aquifer , a surface aquifer that serves as the Miami metropolitan area 's fresh water source . Rainfall and stored water in the Everglades replenish the Biscayne Aquifer directly . 
 With the rise of sea levels that occurred during the Pleistocene approximately 17 @,@ 000 years ago , the runoff of water from Lake Okeechobee slowed and created the vast marshland that is now known as the Everglades . Slower runoff also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) of peat in the area . The presence of such peat deposits , dated to about 5 @,@ 000 years ago , is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The consistent Everglades flooding is fed by the extensive Kissimmee , Caloosahatchee , Myakka , and Peace Rivers in central Florida . The Kissimmee River is a broad floodplain that empties directly into Lake Okeechobee , which at 730 square miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km2 ) with an average depth of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) , is a vast but shallow lake . Soil deposits in the Everglades basin indicate that peat is deposited where the land is flooded consistently throughout the year . Calcium deposits are left behind when flooding is shorter . The deposits occur in areas where water rises and falls depending on rainfall , as opposed to water being stored in the rock from one year to the next . Calcium deposits are present where more limestone is exposed . 
 The area from Orlando to the tip of the Florida peninsula was at one point a single drainage unit . When rainfall exceeded the capacity of Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River floodplain , it spilled over and flowed in a southwestern direction to empty into Florida Bay . Prior to urban and agricultural development in Florida , the Everglades began at the southern edge of Lake Okeechobee and flowed for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) , emptying into the Gulf of Mexico . The limestone shelf is wide and slightly angled instead of having a narrow , deep channel characteristic of most rivers . The vertical gradient from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay is about 2 inches ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) per mile , creating an almost 60 @-@ mile ( 97 km ) wide expanse of river that travels about half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) a day . This slow movement of a broad , shallow river is known as sheetflow , and gives the Everglades its nickname , River of Grass . Water leaving Lake Okeechobee may require months or years to reach its final destination , Florida Bay . The sheetflow travels so slowly that water is typically stored from one wet season to the next in the porous limestone substrate . The ebb and flow of water has shaped the land and every ecosystem in South Florida throughout the Everglades ' estimated 5 @,@ 000 years of existence . The motion of water defines plant communities and how animals adapt to their habitats and food sources .

 The climate of South Florida is located across the broad transition zone between subtropical and tropical climates ( Koppen Cf and Aw ) . Like most regions with this climate type , there are two basic seasons - a " dry season " ( winter ) which runs from November through April , and a " wet season " ( summer ) which runs from May through October . About 70 % of the annual rainfall in south Florida occurs in the wet season - often as brief but intense tropical downpours . The dry season sees little rainfall and dew points and humidity are often quite low . The dry season can be severe at times , as wildfires and water restrictions are often in place . 
 The annual range of temperatures in south Florida and the Everglades is rather small ( less than 20 F ) - ranging from a monthly mean temperature of around 65 F ( 18 C ) in January , to 83 F ( 29 C ) in July . High temperatures in the hot and wet season ( summer ) typically exceed 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) across inland south Florida ( although coastal locations are cooled by winds from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean ) , while high temperatures in the dry winter season average in the 70 's F. Frost and freeze is rare across south Florida and the Everglades , annually coastal cities like Miami and Naples report zero days with frost , although a few times each decade low temperatures may fall to 30 to 40 F across South Florida . Annual rainfall averages approximately 62 inches ( 160 cm ) , with the Eastern Coastal Ridge receiving the majority of precipitation and the area surrounding Lake Okeechobee receiving about 48 inches ( 120 cm ) . 
 Unlike any other wetland system on earth , the Everglades are sustained primarily by the atmosphere . Evapotranspiration — the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth 's land surface to atmosphere — associated with thunderstorms , is the key mechanism by which water leaves the region . During a year unaffected by drought , the rate may reach 40 inches ( 100 cm ) a year . When droughts take place , the rate may peak at over 50 inches ( 130 cm ) , and exceed the amount of rainfall . As water leaves an area through evaporation from groundwater or from plant matter , activated primarily by solar energy , it is then moved by wind patterns to other areas that border or flow into the Everglades watershed system . Evapotranspiration is responsible for approximately 70 – 90 percent of water entering undeveloped wetland regions in the Everglades . 
 Precipitation during the wet season is primarily caused by air mass thunderstorms and the easterly flow out of the subtropical high ( Bermuda High ) . Intense daytime heating of the ground causes the warm moist tropical air to rise , creating the afternoon thundershowers typical of tropical climates . 2 : 00 PM is the mean time of daily thundershowers across South Florida and the Everglades . Late in the wet season ( August and September ) , precipitation levels reach their highest levels as tropical depressions and lows add to daily rainfall . Occasionally , tropical lows can become severe tropical cyclones and cause significant damage when the make landfall across south Florida . Tropical storms average one a year , and major hurricanes about once every ten years . Between 1871 and 1981 , 138 tropical cyclones struck directly over or close to the Everglades . Strong winds from these storms disperse plant seeds and replenish mangrove forests , coral reefs , and other ecosystems . Dramatic fluctuations in precipitation are characteristic of the South Florida climate . Droughts , floods , and tropical cyclones are part of the natural water system in the Everglades . 
 = = Formative and sustaining processes = = 
 The Everglades are a complex system of interdependent ecosystems . Marjory Stoneman Douglas described the area as a " River of Grass " in 1947 , though that metaphor represents only a portion of the system . The area recognized as the Everglades , prior to drainage , was a web of marshes and prairies 4 @,@ 000 square miles ( 10 @,@ 000 km2 ) in size . Borders between ecosystems are subtle or imperceptible . These systems shift , grow and shrink , die , or reappear within years or decades . Geologic factors , climate , and the frequency of fire help to create , maintain , or replace the ecosystems in the Everglades . 
 = = = Water = = = 
 Water is the dominant force in the Everglades , shaping the land , vegetation , and animal life in South Florida . Starting at the last glacial maximum , 21 @,@ 000 years ago , continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose . This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise . Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades , eroding some of it away , and created springs and sinkholes . The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root , and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation . 
 As rain continued to fall , the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone . As limestone wore away , the groundwater came into contact with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem . Although the region appears flat , weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas . These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches , but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold . 
 = = = Rock = = = 
 The underlying bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin affects the hydroperiod , or how long an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year . Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater for longer periods of time , while the geology of Florida was forming . More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level . A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass , whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton , a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms . There are only two types of soil in the Everglades , peat and marl . Where there are longer hydroperiods , peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter . Where periphyton grows , the soil develops into marl , which is more calcitic in composition . 
 Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful , but the nutrients in the peat were rapidly removed . In a process called soil subsidence , oxidation of peat causes loss of volume . Bacteria decompose dead sawgrass slowly underwater without oxygen . When the water was drained in the 1920s and bacteria interacted with oxygen , an aerobic reaction occurred . Microorganisms degraded the peat into carbon dioxide and water . Some of the peat was burned by settlers to clear the land . Some homes built in the areas of early farms had to have their foundations moved to stilts as the peat deteriorated ; other areas lost approximately 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) of soil depth . 
 = = = Fire = = = 
 Fire is an important element in the natural maintenance of the Everglades . The majority of fires are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season . Their effects are largely superficial , and serve to foster specific plant growth : sawgrass will burn above water , but the roots are preserved underneath . Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees , and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition . Whereas in the wet season , dead plant matter and the tips of grasses and trees are burned , in the dry season the fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply , destroying root systems . Fires are confined by existing water and rainfall . It takes approximately 225 years for one foot ( .30 m ) of peat to develop , but in some locations the peat is less dense than it should be for the 5 @,@ 000 years of the Everglades ' existence . Scientists indicate fire as the cause ; it is also cited as the reason for the black color of Everglades muck . Layers of charcoal have been detected in the peat in portions of the Everglades that indicate the region endured severe fires for years at a time , although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence in 940 BCE . 
 = = Ecosystems = = 
 = = = Sawgrass marshes and sloughs = = = 
 Several ecosystems are present in the Everglades , and boundaries between them are subtle or absent . The primary feature of the Everglades is the sawgrass marsh . The iconic water and sawgrass combination in the shallow river 100 miles ( 160 km ) long and 60 miles ( 97 km ) wide that spans from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay is often referred to as the " true Everglades " or just " the Glades " . Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905 , the sheetflow occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula . Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water , but may die in unusually deep floods if oxygen is unable to reach its roots . It is particularly vulnerable immediately after a fire . The hydroperiod for the marsh is at least nine months , and can last longer . Where sawgrass grows densely , few animals or other plants live , although alligators choose these locations for nesting . Where there is more room , periphyton grows . Periphyton supports larval insects and amphibians , which in turn are consumed as food by birds , fish , and reptiles . It also absorbs calcium from water , which adds to the calcitic composition of the marl . 
 Sloughs , or free @-@ flowing channels of water , develop in between sawgrass prairies . Sloughs are about 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) deeper than sawgrass marshes , and may stay flooded for at least 11 months out of the year and sometimes multiple years in a row . Aquatic animals such as turtles , alligators , snakes , and fish thrive in sloughs ; they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates . Submerged and floating plants grow here , such as bladderwort ( Utricularia ) , waterlily ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( Nuphar lutea ) . Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the Shark River Slough flowing out to Florida Bay , <unk> River Slough bordering The Big Cypress , and Taylor Slough in the eastern Everglades . 
 Wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes , but with greater plant diversity . The surface is covered in water only three to seven months of the year , and the water is , on average , shallow at only 4 inches ( 10 cm ) deep . When flooded , the marl can support a variety of water plants . Solution holes , or deep pits where the limestone has worn away , may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry , and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails , and larval amphibians which feed young wading birds . These regions tend to border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes . 
 Alligators have created a niche in wet prairies . With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season . Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates , turtles , fish , small mammals , and birds during extended drought periods . The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole . 
 = = = Tropical hardwood hammock = = = 
 Small islands of trees growing on land raised between 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) and 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above sloughs and prairies are called tropical hardwood hammocks . They may range from one ( 4 @,@ 000 m ² ) to ten acres ( 40 @,@ 000 m ² ) in area , and appear in freshwater sloughs , sawgrass prairies , or pineland . Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several inches above the surrounding peat , or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires . Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees , such as Southern live oak ( Quercus virginiana ) , gumbo limbo ( Bursera simaruba ) , royal palm ( Roystonea ) , and <unk> ( <unk> salicifolia ) that grow in very dense clumps . Near the base , sharp saw palmettos ( Serenoa repens ) flourish , making the hammocks very difficult for people to penetrate , though small mammals , reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat . Water in sloughs flows around the islands , creating moats . Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire , hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover . The moats around the hammocks protect the trees . The trees are limited in height by weather factors such as frost , lightning , and wind ; the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than 55 feet ( 17 m ) . 
 = = = Pineland = = = 
 Some of the driest land in the Everglades is pineland ( also called pine rockland ) ecosystem , located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod . Some floors , however , may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time . The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine ( Pinus elliottii ) . Pineland communities require fire to maintain them , and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire . The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable . South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat . Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor , and opens pine cones to germinate seeds . A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines . The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire @-@ resistant saw palmetto ( Serenoa repens ) , cabbage palm ( Sabal palmetto ) , and West Indian lilac ( <unk> bicolor ) . The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs , of which there are two dozen species . These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred . 
 Prior to urban development of the South Florida region , pine rocklands covered approximately 161 @,@ 660 acres ( 654 @.@ 2 km2 ) in Miami @-@ Dade County . Within Everglades National Park , 19 @,@ 840 acres ( 80 @.@ 3 km2 ) of pine forests are protected , but outside the park , 1 @,@ 780 acres ( 7 @.@ 2 km2 ) of pine communities remained as of 1990 , averaging 12 @.@ 1 acres ( 49 @,@ 000 m2 ) in area . The misunderstanding of the role of fire also played a part in the disappearance of pine forests in the area , as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks . Prescribed fires occur in Everglades National Park in pine rocklands every three to seven years . 
 = = = Cypress = = = 
 Cypress swamps can be found throughout the Everglades , but the largest covers most of Collier County . The Big Cypress Swamp is located to the west of the sawgrass prairies and sloughs , and it is commonly called " The Big Cypress . " The name refers to its area rather than the height or diameter of the trees ; at its most conservative estimate , the swamp measures 1 @,@ 200 square miles ( 3 @,@ 100 km2 ) , but the hydrologic boundary of The Big Cypress can be calculated at over 2 @,@ 400 square miles ( 6 @,@ 200 km2 ) . Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thinner layer of limestone . The limestone underneath the Big Cypress contains quartz , which creates sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation different from what is found in other areas of the Everglades . The basin for The Big Cypress receives on average 55 inches ( 140 cm ) of water in the wet season . 
 Though The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida , cypress swamps can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods , as well as in sawgrass marshes . Cypresses are deciduous conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions , with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water , called " knees " . Bald cypress trees grow in formations with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center , rooted in the deepest peat . As the peat thins out , cypresses grow smaller and thinner , giving the small forest the appearance of a dome from the outside . They also grow in strands , slightly elevated on a ridge of limestone bordered on either side by sloughs . Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes , such as red maple , swamp bay , and pop ash . If cypresses are removed , the hardwoods take over , and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest . 
 = = = Mangrove and Coastal prairie = = = 
 Eventually the water from Lake Okeechobee and The Big Cypress makes its way to the ocean . Mangrove trees are well adapted to the transitional zone of brackish water where fresh and salt water meet . The estuarine ecosystem of the Ten Thousand Islands , which is comprised almost completely of mangrove forests , covers almost 200 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 km2 ) . In the wet season fresh water pours out into Florida Bay , and sawgrass begins to grow closer to the coastline . In the dry season , and particularly in extended periods of drought , the salt water creeps inland into the coastal prairie , an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water . Mangrove trees begin to grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water goes far enough inland . 
 There are three species of trees that are considered mangroves : red ( Rhizophora mangle ) , black ( Avicennia germinans ) , and white ( Laguncularia racemosa ) , although all are from different families . All grow in oxygen @-@ poor soil , can survive drastic water level changes , and are tolerant of salt , brackish , and fresh water . All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms . Red mangroves have the farthest @-@ reaching roots , trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms . All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and storm surges . Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish , and rookeries for birds . The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp ( Farfantepenaeus <unk> ) and stone crab ( Menippe mercenaria ) industries ; between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in Florida 's salt waters are born or spend time near the Everglades . 
 = = = Florida Bay = = = 
 Much of the coast and the inner estuaries are built of mangroves ; there is no border between the coastal marshes and the bay . Thus the marine ecosystems in Florida Bay are considered to be a part of the Everglades watershed and one of the ecosystems connected to and affected by the Everglades as a whole . More than 800 square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) of Florida Bay is protected by Everglades National Park , representing the largest body of water in the park boundaries . There are approximately 100 keys in Florida Bay , many of which are mangrove forests . The fresh water coming into Florida Bay from the Everglades creates perfect conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that are the foundation for animal life in the bay . Sea turtles and manatees eat the grass , while invertebrate animals , such as worms , clams and other mollusks eat the algae formations and microscopic plankton . Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore , and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay . Sea grasses also serve to stabilize the sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Native Americans = = = 
 Humans arrived in the Florida peninsula approximately 15 @,@ 000 years ago . Paleo @-@ Indians came to Florida probably following large game that included giant sloths , saber @-@ toothed cats , and spectacled bears . They found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions . However , 6 @,@ 500 years ago , climate changes brought a wetter landscape ; large animals became extinct in Florida , and the Paleo @-@ Indians slowly adapted and became the Archaic peoples . They conformed to the environmental changes , and created many tools with the various resources available . During the Late Archaic period , the climate became wetter again , and approximately 3000 BCE the rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity . Florida Indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for the bodies of water near where they were located : Okeechobee , Caloosahatchee , and Glades . 
 = = = = Calusa and Tequesta = = = = 
 From the Glades peoples , two major nations emerged in the area : the Calusa and the Tequesta . The Calusa was the largest and most powerful nation in South Florida . It controlled fifty villages located on Florida 's west coast , around Lake Okeechobee , and on the Florida Keys . Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands . The Calusa were hunter @-@ gatherers who lived on small game , fish , turtles , alligators , shellfish , and various plants . Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth , although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war . Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows , atlatls , and spears . Canoes were used for transportation , and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades , but rarely lived in them . Canoe trips to Cuba were also common .
