 Paramount Pictures won a jump ball with Warner Bros. ( parent companies Viacom and Time Warner , respectively , jointly owned Comedy Central until Time Warner exited the venture in 2003 ) to release the film in the United States , with Warner Bros. getting the international rights . Viacom bought all of Comedy Central in 2004 , but Warner Bros. continued to distribute the film internationally . 
 The film was rated R for " pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor , and for some violent images " by the Motion Picture Association of America ; this rating did not come as surprise to most media outlets , as many had predicted long before that the film would likely be for ages 18 and over . However , there was much more discussion within the MPAA than initially reported in the media . The board 's objections to the film were described in highly specific terms by Paramount Pictures executives in private memos circulating at Paramount . For months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC @-@ 17 . South Park was screened by the MPAA six times — five times , the board returned the movie to Paramount with an NC @-@ 17 . The last submission the filmmakers received was an NC @-@ 17 , two weeks before release . A marketing agent from Paramount called the two and explained that the studio " needed " an R. In response , Stone called producer Scott Rudin and " freaked out . " Rudin then called a Paramount executive and , in Stone 's words , " freaked out on them . " The next day the film was changed to an R rating without reason , with the original film intact . " The ratings board only cared about the dirty words ; they 're so confused and arbitrary , " said Parker to The New York Times shortly before the release of the picture . " They didn 't blink twice because of violence . " During production of the trailer for the film , the raters objected to certain words but had no problem with a scene in which cartoon bullets are killing soldiers . " They had a problem with words , not bullets , " he said . The MPAA gave Paramount specific notes for the film ; in contrast , Parker and Stone 's NC @-@ 17 comedy Orgazmo , released in 1998 by Rogue Pictures , was not given any specifications on how to make the movie acceptable for an R rating . The duo attributed the R rating to the fact that Paramount is a member of the MPAA ; the distributor dismissed these claims . The film was given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for " frequent coarse language and crude sexual references " with no cuts made . It was rated MA15 + ( Mature accompanied for those under 15 ) by the Australian Classification Board without cuts . 
 As predicted through the actions of the boys in the film , there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters . There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB 's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park . This came as a result of a movie @-@ industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R @-@ rated films , as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre , which occurred two months before the film 's release . South Park was cited , along with American Pie , as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters . When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999 , there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd . 
 Hayes , voice of Chef in the film , responded to conservatives urging prudishness as a cure for society 's ills : " If we give in to that and allow [ entertainment ] to become a scapegoat , you might wind up living in who @-@ know 's @-@ what kind of state .... If you believe in [ your artistic vision ] and you 've got a moral conviction , take it to ' em ! " The rating of film later brought comparisons to Stanley Kubrick 's Eyes Wide Shut , released in theaters in a digitally altered and censored version just two weeks after South Park . Kubrick 's original cut was given an NC @-@ 17 rating , but Warner Bros. then blocked out characters in an orgy scene so the film could be rated R. In response to these debates and controversy , Stone called the MPAA a " bumbling , irresponsible organization " .

 The licensing arm of Paramount took the step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores ( Hot Topic , Spencer 's ) to big chains ( Target , J.C. Penney ) , which involved carefully stripping T @-@ shirts of racy slogans from the television show . Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast @-@ food chains and Hollywood movie studios , which was particularly tough for South Park , as no fast @-@ food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show 's racy content . Eventually , J.C. Penney ended the tie @-@ ins with the show in April 1999 as a result of customer complaints . On July 7 , 1999 , Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien to promote the film 's release . During the interview , Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O 'Brien , played by Brett Spiner , hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night . Upon seeing the clip , a bemused O 'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was " really funny " , but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as on the top floor of the GE Building , when it was really on the sixth floor . The film also suffered negative publicity before release . It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre , a friend of the killers was seen wearing a black T @-@ shirt depicting characters from South Park . Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado , and Stone went to Heritage High School , not far from Columbine High . He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings . " Nothing seemed funny after that , " he said . South Park was , at the time , generally waning in popularity : ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series ' third season and , according to Entertainment Weekly , " it [ wasn 't ] the pop @-@ culture behemoth it was last year [ 1998 ] . " In response to the decline , Parker commented , " Suddenly we suck and we 're not cool anymore . The funny thing is , last year we were saying the same things and we were hip , fresh , and cute . Now they 're telling us we 're pushing 30 , we 're failures , and we 're sellouts . "

 The film was released on DVD worldwide November 23 , 1999 , with a VHS release initially for rental services only , such as Blockbuster . A traditional retail VHS release followed on May 16 , 2000 . The DVD contained three theatrical trailers for special features , which many criticized as being typical of " bare @-@ bones " DVD releases . There is also a NTSC laserdisc version that was released on January 18 , 2000 ; copies are extremely rare . The film was re @-@ released on Blu @-@ ray on June 30 , 2009 in celebration of its decade @-@ long anniversary . The film 's 1080p AVC encode ( at 1 @.@ 78 : 1 ) was taken from the original film source as well with random audio sync issues , despite the fact the film was animated entirely digitally . IGN 's Scott Lowe explained , " Although clearly aged , South Park : Bigger , Longer , and Uncut looks great and is free of the washed out , compressed imperfections of previous standard definition releases of the film . " However , Michael <unk> of DVDTalk notes that an automatic digital scratch removal process may have inadvertently removed some intentional lines from the picture , notably during Cartman 's first scene with the V @-@ chip . The disc contained a full @-@ length audio commentary from Parker and Stone , as well as other crew members though most of them had no recollection of making the film due to heavy scheduling .

 The film has a " certified fresh " approval rating of 81 % with an average rating of 7 / 10 based on 94 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes ; the site 's consensus states : " Its jokes are profoundly bold and rude but incredibly funny at the same time . " It also has a 73 out of 100 rating based on 31 reviews , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " , at Metacritic . Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film " outrageously profane " and " wildly funny " , writing that " While censorship is the filmmakers ' main target [ … ] [ Parker and Stone 's ] favorite monster is the Motion Picture Association of America , self @-@ appointed guardians of the nation 's chastity . It 's all in good dirty fun and in service of their pro @-@ tolerance theme . " Stephen Holden of The New York Times heavily praised the film , regarding the film 's " self @-@ justifying moral " as " about mass entertainment , censorship and freedom of speech . " He also praised Cartman 's subjection to the V @-@ chip , which he called " the movie 's sharpest satirical twist , reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange " . Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A − and praised the film 's message in a post @-@ Columbine society , as well as Parker and Shaiman 's musical numbers , which " brilliantly parody / honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and , especially , the Disney @-@ formula ditties that began with Alan Menken and Howard Ashman . " The Washington Post 's Michael O 'Sullivan neutrally regarded the offensive nature of the film , commenting " Yes , the lampooning is more broad than incisive , but under the bludgeoning of this blunt instrument very few sacred cows are left standing . " In a review that was later quoted on the film 's original home video cover , Richard Corliss from Time warned viewers " You may laugh yourself sick – as sick as this ruthlessly funny movie is . " Corliss would later name the film his fifth favorite animated film of all time . The film had its fair share of critical detractors , without noting the conservative family groups offended by the film 's humor . Jack Matthews of the Daily News suggested the film 's running time made Parker and Stone " run out of ideas " , while Roger Ebert stated that the " vicious social satire " of the film both " offended " and " amazed " him . Ebert called the film " the year 's most slashing political commentary " , but also said , " It is too long and runs out of steam , but it serves as a signpost for our troubled times . Just for the information it contains about the way we live now , thoughtful and concerned people should see it . After all , everyone else will . "

 South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for " Blame Canada " . When the time came to perform the track live at the ceremony , as is customary for the Academy Awards , it ran into trouble with ABC 's standards and practices department : censors demanded they write TV @-@ friendly lyrics . " It would be ironic to have to change the words in a movie about censorship , " remarked Shaiman . Censors were particularly unhappy with the use of the word " fuck " and allusions to the Ku Klux Klan . When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests , Robin Williams , a friend of Shaiman 's , sang the song with black tape over his mouth and turning his back when curse words were to be sung . Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag , wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez . The two claimed years later that they took acid before the ceremony and were high while wearing the outfits . The song ended up losing to " You 'll Be in My Heart " , a Tarzan song by Phil Collins ( that film came from ABC parent Disney ) . In response , Parker and Stone ridiculed him in two consecutive episodes of the series ' fourth season ( " Cartman 's Silly Hate Crime 2000 " and " Timmy 2000 " ) . In DVD commentary , Parker states " we were fully expecting to lose , just not to Phil Collins " .

 = Conrad I of Salzburg = 
 Conrad I [ of Abenberg ] ( German : Konrad von Abenberg , c . 1075 – 9 April 1147 ) was Archbishop of Salzburg , Austria , in the first half of the 12th century . 
 Born into the Abenberg @-@ <unk> nobility , Conrad was raised for a clerical career at the court of Emperor Henry IV , where he was a member of the court chapel . He became a canon in Hildesheim . After escorting Emperor Henry V in July 1110 , Conrad sided with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy , which eventually led to his exile for several years . He returned to Salzburg in 1121 and played an important role in the major political events of the day , including the election of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125 and the papal schism of 1130 in which he played a role in the recognition of Pope Innocent II by the king . 
 During the absence of Lothair of Supplinburg in Italy , Conrad was ordained as the archbishop of Salzburg on 4 June 1133 . As a prince @-@ bishop , he was influential in German politics and was an extremely energetic reformer who is often called " the second founder of the Church of Salzburg . " He presided over an assembly that supervised the affairs of the religious houses , maintained strong control over tithes , and was responsible for building Salzburg Cathedral and the cemetery in 1140 . Conrad also supervised the construction of numerous other monasteries and the castles of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = Early life and work = = 
 Conrad of Abenberg came from the family of the Counts of Abenberg @-@ <unk> , and had many distinguished relatives in Germany . He was born around 1075 , son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg . His mother was probably the daughter of Heinrich I , viscount of Regensburg . Conrad had two older brothers , Otto and Wolfram . He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV , where he was a member of the court chapel . He became a canon in Hildesheim .

 = = = Military and political endeavors = = = 
 Conrad seems to have been involved when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105 . This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106 . At that time the anti @-@ Archbishop Berthold von <unk> was installed in Salzburg . Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers , the counts Otto and Wolfram , with an escort of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers . Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors , servile rather than free vassals . With this display of force , he was able to force Berthold to abdicate . Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium . 
 In July 1110 , Conrad accompanied Emperor Henry V to Italy . Conrad brought a strong military escort on this visit . However , Conrad sided with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy . Due to further conflicts with imperial officials , Conrad had to flee in 1112 and was not able to return to Salzburg until 1121 . While in exile , he lived in Tuscany , Admont in Styria , and Saxony . 
 Conrad played an important role in the major political events of the day , including the election of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125 , whom he supported during the fight against the Hohenstaufen usurpation . During the papal schism of 1130 he played a role in the recognition of Pope Innocent II by the king . After this , tensions rose between Conrad and Lothair due to diverging views on church politics . Lothair visited Italy in 1132 @-@ 33 , and was crowned emperor by Innocent II on 4 June 1133 . In his absence , Conrad was ordained an archbishop . This directly infringed on the emperor 's right , recently confirmed by the Pope , to invest a bishop with his regalia before he was ordained . It earned a stern rebuke from Lothair . 
 When Lothair died , Conrad initially resisted the election of the Hohenstaufen Conrad III and supported Henry X , Duke of Bavaria instead . Conrad later came round to support the king . 
 = = = Reform and administration = = = 
 On his return from exile in 1121 or 1122 , Conrad found his diocese " very poor and greatly devastated . " Conrad worked with notables such as Hartmann von Brixen and <unk> von <unk> to reform the clergy in his archdiocese . In particular , he undertook a major reform of the cathedral clergy . Conrad presided over an assembly that supervised the affairs of the religious houses , including the cathedral , and used the canons to help administer his possessions . He maintained strong control over tithes , allocating them between the monasteries and parish priests to avoid disputes over their distribution . During his administration , clerics of servile origin steadily gained in status , now called <unk> rather than servitor . 
 Conrad rebuilt and expanded Salzburg Cathedral and built the cathedral chapter house , and in 1140 he created the cathedral cemetery . He built hospitals for the poor of the city , and commenced construction of St. Peter 's monastery where his former residence stood , moving to a new archbishop 's residence nearer the cathedral . Conrad founded several monasteries and reformed others , a total of 17 in which the rule of the Augustinian Canons Regular prevailed . These included St. Zeno , <unk> , <unk> , Berchtesgaden , <unk> , Gars am Inn , Au am Inn , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The archbishop supported the Benedictines . 
 During his exile , Duke Henry III of <unk> , brother of Ulrich I , patriarch of Aquileia ( r . 1086 – 1121 ) , had seized property belonging to the Salzburg diocese in Friuli and Carinthia . Conrad excommunicated him and sent a force of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers to Carinthia , forcing the duke to return the properties . Later , Conrad reached an agreement of " peace and friendship " ( pax et amicitia ) with the Patriarch Pellegrino I of Aquileia ( r . 1130 – 1161 ) whereby he agreed to pay tithes to Aquileia for those properties which the archdiocese held in the patriarchate . Conrad 's example was followed by pledges to pay their tithes from the others present when the agreement was reached . 
 Conrad completed construction of the castles of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077 . In Styria , he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties , and built strong fortresses . For defense against Hungary , he built strongholds at <unk> ( <unk> ) and Pettau ( Ptuj ) , and <unk> castle . He also expanded the Burg <unk> castle at the center of the Salzburg possessions in western Styria . In 1131 , he made peace with King Béla II of Hungary , which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region . 
 Conrad died on 9 April 1147 in <unk> , Salzburg . An anonymous biography , known as the Vita <unk> <unk> <unk> , was composed in the 1170s . It portrays Conrad as a man of peace . His role in the royal elections of 1125 and 1138 place him among the leading German Prince @-@ bishops in the High Middle Ages . He earned the title of " second founder of the Salzburg church . " 
 = The Harrowing ( Inside No. 9 ) = 
 " The Harrowing " is the sixth and final episode of the first series of British dark comedy anthology series Inside No. 9 . It aired on 12 March 2014 on BBC Two . The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , and stars Shearsmith , Aimee @-@ Ffion Edwards , Helen McCrory , Poppy Rush and Sean Buckley . While comedic in places , " The Harrowing " makes extensive use of gothic horror elements transmuted into a modern context . The plot follows Katy ( Edwards ) , who has been hired to <unk> for eccentric siblings Hector ( Shearsmith ) and Tabitha ( McCrory ) . They rarely leave the house , but have an event to attend . They tell Katy about their bedridden , disabled brother Andras ( Buckley ) , who cannot speak but will ring a bell if he needs assistance . Katy is joined by her friend Shell ( Rush ) once Hector and Tabitha leave , and , upon hearing Andras 's bell , the pair reluctantly head upstairs . The episode takes place in Hector and Tabitha 's mansion , which is kept deliberately cold and filled with paintings depicting Hell . The writers experimented with a variety of possible endings , hoping to make the episode 's close both interesting and scary . 
 Critics agreed that the episode was the most gothic and scary of the series , with journalists writing for The Sunday Times saying that " The Harrowing " would be best avoided by those of a nervous disposition . Critics writing in the Metro felt that the episode was a poor finale for the series , and that the episode 's ending was unsatisfying . By contrast , Alex Hoskins , writing for the Cheddar Valley Gazette , felt the episode 's ending was very strong , and Bruce Dessau described " The Harrowing " as an excellent end to the series . On an Empire Online list , " The Harrowing " , particularly its final scene , was selected as the 17th best TV moment of the year . The episode was watched by 833 @,@ 000 people on its first showing , which was 4 @.@ 7 % of the audience . Due in part to her appearance , Edwards was nominated for a " Daffta " award .

 Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , who had previously worked together on The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville , took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from " David and Maureen " , episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville . This episode , in turn , was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope . " David and Maureen " took place entirely in a single room , and was filmed in only two shots . At the same time , the concept of Inside No. 9 was a " reaction " to Psychoville , with Shearsmith saying that " We 'd been so involved with labyrinthine over @-@ arcing , we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week . That 's appealing , because as a viewer you might not like this story , but you 've got a different one next week . " As an anthology series with horror themes , Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected , The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents . 
 As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week , the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . " The Harrowing " starred Aimee @-@ Ffion Edwards as Katy , Helen McCrory as Tabitha , Shearsmith as Hector , Poppy Rush as Shell and Sean Buckley as Andras . " The Harrowing " was the only episode in the series in which Pemberton did not star ; Shearsmith played a character in all but " Last Gasp " . Comedy critic Bruce Dessau noted that Shearsmith 's role was actually relatively minor , saying that the house was the real star . 
 Pemberton and Shearsmith are fans of classic horror films , and the episode displays inspiration from the likes of Alfred Hitchcock 's filmography and the Hammer Horror films . Pemberton called the episode the " most genre " of the series , while Shearsmith described it as their attempt to produce a " full on ... gothic horror @-@ esque " episode . The writers utilised the horror norm of a gothic mansion rather than bringing horror into a normal home . This route , Shearsmith suggested , has now become atypical . The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror , sometimes for comedic effect ( a reference to " something called <unk> " ) , and sometimes to add to the horror ( mobile phones cannot be used , as the characters are in a " dead zone " ) . While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality , they also wanted to make more use of gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of Inside No. 9 . " The Harrowing " was advertised with a poster homage to classic horror films . The poster was designed by Graham Humphreys , a graphic designer known for his work on horror film posters . The episode 's name was taken from the Harrowing of Hell , the story of Jesus Christ 's descent to Hell in Christian theology . 
 The character Katy is initially hired to babysit , though it turns out that there is no baby . Previous horror films , including When a Stranger Calls , have made use of a babysitter as a plot device , and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs . Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together , with both beginning in a position of ignorance . For Pemberton , the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown . In " The Harrowing " , he suggests , it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom . The writers experimented with different endings , in an attempt to make the bedroom 's contents interesting and genuinely scary . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Katy has been hired to take care of Hector and Tabitha 's mansion while the two go out for the evening . They usually never leave the house , but have a rare event to attend . Tabitha greets Katy at the door and explains that the house is always kept at − 3 ° C as Hector and Tabitha 's disabled brother , Andras , needs the air to be at this temperature . The paintings on the house 's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell . After meeting Hector , Katy is disturbed by Tabitha 's descriptions of Andras , who , it is claimed , does not have a mouth . He instead keeps a bell , which he never uses , beside his bed . Katy is told not to go upstairs . 
 Hector and Tabitha leave . Katy is spooked by the house , especially when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa . She sees an old photograph of Hector , Tabitha and Andras as children , but Andras does not look disabled . Katy 's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector 's <unk> , sending it upstairs . Katy warns Shell not to break anything , and is startled to see the now @-@ live cat . Katy tries to call her father so she can leave , but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone 's party line is tied up . As she prepares to leave , the <unk> returns downstairs and Andras 's bell rings . Katy is scared of going upstairs , but , at Shell 's insistence , the two go to check on him . 
 Katy and Shell explore and enter Hector 's bedroom , where they find a circle of salt around the bed . They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras 's room . When Katy opens the bed 's curtains , Andras 's deformed body is revealed ; he is tied to the bed and gagged . Katy goes to untie him , believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner . Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied . Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell . They quote Dante 's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold , as the text says , so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras . They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel , demon of mischief , but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years , and Andras is now dying . Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector 's church recommended her to them . It is revealed that Shell also attends the church , and she helped them to lure Katy . Shell implies that the church 's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons . 
 Tabitha and Hector prepare to inject Katy with a sedative , but she fights back . She runs downstairs only to find that the door is locked . Shell arrives and says that Katy cannot escape . Shell says she wanted to be Castiel 's new human host , but she is too weak , whereas Katy has the strength of character needed to keep the demon contained . Shell injects Katy , who collapses . Upstairs , Hector strips Katy and ties her to a chair , while Tabitha feeds Andras his " last supper " : <unk> and baby milk , the only food he can manage . Hector , Tabitha and Shell leave Katy to become acquainted with Castiel , who , they say , will possess her as Andras dies . Andras advances on Katy as she screams .

 Critics variously called " The Harrowing " the " nastiest " , " most Gothic " and most <unk> episode of Inside No. 9 . It was described as " unashamedly macabre " by Metro journalists , " genuinely frightening " by David Upton of PopMatters , and " a genuine fright fest " by Dessau . Despite both reviews characterising " The Harrowing " as one of the weaker episodes of the series , it was called " very creepy " in the Liverpool Echo , and the closing scene was described as extremely scary in the Metro . Critics writing for The Sunday Times said that the episode " really is best avoided by those of a nervous disposition " , and the sentiment was echoed in the Cheddar Valley Gazette , where it was suggested that the character of Andras " certainly warranted the warning of disturbing scenes " given before the episode . 
 Concerning the comedic elements of " The Harrowing " , Sunday Times critics said that " comedy doesn 't come blacker than this " . Jack Seale , of the Radio Times , said that viewers would " marvel at how [ the writers could ] pepper the elegant script with gags without breaking the spell " . Dessau also felt that the script was " great " , and commented on a " particularly pithy " joke , " just when you least expect it " . Nick Rutherford and Keith Watson , writing for the Metro , downplayed the comedy of the episode , saying that " the odd defiantly bad joke ... pierced the darkness " . They felt that " The Harrowing " was a weak instalment of Inside No. 9 , giving it three out of five stars . The ending , these critics suggested , was " a bit of a cop out " rather than " daring " . For them , unlike in other Inside No. 9 scripts , there was no twist . Alex Hoskins , writing for the Cheddar Valley Gazette , acknowledged that the " ending will most likely have sparked an online outcry " , but felt that " it was fantastic , fearless and a perfect end to [ the ] series " . Dessau shared a positive view , saying that the series ended " on an absolute high " , with one of his favourite episodes .

 = Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia = 
 The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske ; ZNDH ) , was the air force of the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) , a puppet state established with the support of the Axis Powers on the territory of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during World War II . The ZNDH was founded under German authority in April 1941 , following the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . 
 Although it could not be considered a large air arm in the wider context of World War II , the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945 , as well as anti @-@ aircraft and paratroop units . From humble beginnings in 1941 , the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air @-@ support ( fighter , attack and transport ) until the last days of World War II in Europe . 
 The ZNDH maintained a flying training school equipped with gliders and trainers , originally at Rajlovac airfield near Sarajevo and then at Velika Gorica and <unk> airfields in Zagreb . Its parachute and paratroop school was located in Koprivnica . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 The ZNDH came into being as early as 19 April 1941 , just nine days after the proclamation of the NDH . Its commander was Colonel Vladimir Kren , a former captain of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije ; VVKJ ) , who had defected to the Germans in Graz in his Potez 25 on 4 April 1941 and declared himself an Ustaše supporter . 
 The first task of the new air force , the backbone of which was provided by 500 former VVKJ officers and 1 @,@ 600 NCOs , was the acquisition or salvage of aircraft , weapons , machinery , equipment and fuel that had survived the fighting and had not been confiscated by the German or Italian forces . 
 Following the brief April War , the Germans had captured over 300 ex @-@ VVKJ aircraft . They considered them to be of little use for the Luftwaffe , so it was decided to equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft . These aircraft , scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia , were then collected , minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops . Naturally , the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible . Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation ( most of them were in German POW camps ) , jobs and safety for their families . 
 Kren also initiated the formation of an early warning system , anti @-@ aircraft batteries ( armed with German and Czech weapons ) and various training and servicing departments , ammunition stores and workshop facilities . The fuel necessary for the operations of the ZNDH was supplied by the Germans from former Yugoslav stocks in Kraljevo , Serbia . 
 As early as May 1941 , the NDH had asked Germany for , among other things , 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s . Instead , they got some of the remaining largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ . At the same time , Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers , which were then supplied to Bulgaria . Romania received six ex @-@ VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes , as well as six Bristol Blenheims , whilst Finland received 20 half @-@ completed Blenheims , together with manufacturing tools and production equipment , as well as a huge variety of spare parts . 
 During the middle part of 1941 , some of the ZNDH 's man @-@ power capacity ( one fighter squadron and one medium bomber squadron ) was sent to the Eastern Front as part of the Luftwaffe , the Croatian Air Force Legion ( Croatian : Hrvatska <unk> Legija ; HZL ; German : Kroatische Luftwaffen Legion ) . Most of the Croatian Air Force Legion 's personnel were back on NDH territory by late 1942 ( bomber squadron ) / early 1944 ( fighter squadron ) to help counter the growing Allied air threat . 
 The personnel of the ZNDH took over and re @-@ activated the airfields at Zagreb , Sarajevo , Mostar , Banja Luka and Zemun , where the Ikarus and Zmaj aircraft plants were located . By June 1941 , the Germans had begun to pass on to the ZNDH various captured VVKJ aircraft , including eight Bristol Blenheim I and five Potez 25 bombers . These and most of the 211 ex @-@ VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and / or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun . 
 = = = The first missions : 1941 = = = 
 In late 1941 the ZNDH had 95 aircraft distributed in four groups and eight squadrons . Fighting the Yugoslav Partisans from the air had begun already in late June 1941 , when Breguet 19 and Potez 25 bombers had proved most suitable . The <unk> could carry a bomb load of up to 400 kilograms ( 880 lb ) using 24 12 @-@ kilogram ( 26 lb ) bombs , whilst the Potez 25s could carry about half that amount . Both types were also armed with three 7 @.@ 7 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 30 in ) machine guns . Altogether the ZNDH eventually came to possess 50 Breguet 19s and 45 Potez 25s . The operational use of these light bombers was not limited to fighting the Partisans ; the aircraft were also used to supply isolated or surrounded army strong points . 
 The emblem of the ZNDH was to be the red and white <unk> insignia , ( Croatian : <unk> ) , derived from the Croat coat of arms , dating back to the 10th century , carried on the fin . In January 1945 this was replaced by the black and white trefoil cross of King Zvonimir . 
 As well as the Breguet and Potez aircraft , which were the most numerous types in the ZNDH inventory , Zmaj Fizir FP @-@ 2 light biplane trainers were also converted to carry six 12 kilograms ( 26 lb ) bombs . These aircraft were used to bomb and strafe Partisan troops and positions in northern Bosnia but they also faced anti @-@ aircraft fire . The first missions cost the ZNDH a Breguet and a Potez aircraft , both of which crash landed after being hit by Partisan ground fire . The ZNDH crews had little chance of survival after being hit , as flying suits , helmets and parachutes were not available at the time - hence their desperate crash @-@ landings . 
 Similar actions continued throughout 1941 . The ZNDH flew many missions in support of Army troops in limited scale operations against the Partisans mostly over eastern and western Bosnia , as well as over other parts of the NDH . By September , the ZNDH introduced larger aircraft for bombing Partisan forces and territory . Two bombers , an Avia Fokker <unk> derived <unk> and a Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 were available for operations and had the added advantage of being able to carry 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) bombs . They were extensively used for bombing villages and road communications . However it was soon established that the vintage biplane Breguet 19 and Potez 25 aircraft were ideally suited for missions against Partisan troop concentrations . Although they were outdated and certainly their use would be out of the question on any other front , their performance and armament made them very dangerous for an ill @-@ armed enemy . The Partisans were scattered in villages , forests and mountains and their positions could only be detected by a slow moving aircraft . Visual reconnaissance missions using hand @-@ held cameras were also flown . Aerial reconnaissance supplied the army with vital data about Partisan movements and positions and about the situation in Partisan territory in general . This was all the more important because the army desperately lacked radio equipment of all kinds . Light aircraft were frequently used for liaison duties , particularly connecting the surrounding army garrisons and higher command . Often the Army requested one or two aircraft to be temporarily attached to particular army units to closely co @-@ operate with ground troops . 
 The ZNDH 's fighter force was poorly equipped in every respect , consisting of 12 ex @-@ VVKJ machines including four Ikarus IK @-@ 2s , seven ancient Avia BH @-@ 33 Es and one Hawker Fury II . Fortunately for this ill @-@ equipped force , there was no aerial opposition and some more modern fighter aircraft were received from 1942 onwards . 
 Colder October and November weather limited aerial activities over the NDH . The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their appearance on the Bosnian @-@ Serbian border area . The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia , which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941 . The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia @-@ Fokker <unk> and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable <unk> and Potez . These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad . 
 = = = Expansion : 1942 = = = 
 In 1942 , fighting with the Partisans intensified . Not only had they liberated a substantial territory in the eastern part of Yugoslavia , but they encouraged rebellion all over the country . The German , Italian and NDH governments were aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces . They planned several large @-@ scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role . 
 The first half of 1942 was marked by several deliveries of new or refurbished aircraft from Germany and Italy , aside from those received from Ikarus in Zemun . First of all the ZNDH received 10 brand new Caproni <unk> M medium bombers from Italy . These aircraft had been ordered and paid for by the Yugoslav Government for service in the VVKJ , but the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia prevented delivery . The ZNDH also purchased 20 <unk> <unk> basic trainers , nine Fiat G.50bis fighters and one Fiat <unk> two @-@ seat fighter trainer . The Fiat aircraft were to provide the ZNDH 's fighter pilots with some operational training on more modern aircraft . 
 Other batches of overhauled ex @-@ VVKJ aircraft also arrived from the Ikarus aircraft plant in Zemun , including 11 Dornier Do @-@ 17K , three Bristol Blenheim Mk I and one Caproni <unk> bombers , 15 Rogožarski PVT and 11 Rogožarski R @-@ 100 attack aircraft , which had been fitted with bomb racks to carry 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) bombs , plus a few Breguet 19s , Potez 25s , Zmaj Fizir <unk> and Zmaj Fizir FP @-@ 2s . From Prague in Czechoslovakia ( under German occupation ) , the ZNDH received seven Avia Fokker <unk> transports , one Avia Fokker F.9 and one Avia Fokker <unk> Of these , the <unk> and <unk> were pre @-@ war Czech airliners . As the ZNDH suffered from a total lack of transport aircraft , these were immediately pressed into service , after only minor adjustments . Some were even used to provide scheduled air @-@ line services . 
 The nine Fiat G.50bis fighters took off from Turin @-@ Fiat <unk> on 12 June 1942 , but before crossing the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore <unk> , that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft . The G.50 aircraft had to wait until 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka , but during the course of 1942 , five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital . Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft . Until that time , the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH @-@ <unk> biplanes and four Ikarus IK @-@ 2 gull wing fighters ( for which there were very few spares ) , as well as 11 Rogožarski R @-@ 100 parasol wing fighter @-@ trainers . 
 Thanks to this extended aircraft park the ZNDH could now form new units : in January the 1st Group , comprising the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 19th Squadrons was formed at Zagreb , and then the 2nd Group with the 4th , 5th and 6th squadrons and the 3rd Group with the 7th , 8th and 9th Squadrons at Sarajevo 's Rajlovac airfield , whilst the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka 's <unk> airfield in June 1942 to cover operations in central Croatia and western Bosnia . 
 These reinforcements came just in time to participate in a large German offensive against the Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia . Initially , the Regia Aeronautica also participated in this campaign , but after a tragic incident where an Italian bomber mistakenly attacked German positions near Vlasenica , the German command assigned the ZNDH the responsibility for providing the entire aerial support mission for formations on the ground . At this time there were no significant Luftwaffe forces based in Yugoslavian territory . In support of the ground forces , the ZNDH flew 121 combat missions in January , 100 missions in February and 350 in March . Although the Axis ground forces generally succeeded in their operations in January and February , in March they were forced to release the pressure as other Partisan units attacked several solitary NDH garrisons , threatening to destroy them . 
 Aside from constant bombing sorties , Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft were also used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica . They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip , unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible . On 23 March , a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed . Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely . As a result of the determined re @-@ supply effort by the ZNDH , the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German @-@ NDH forces on 17 April . 
 As the weather improved towards the summer , flying activity intensified . Some 325 missions were flown during April , with a further 350 sorties during May , including direct combat support , reconnaissance and supply missions , as well as leaflet dropping . Most of the missions were performed by the 2nd and 3rd Group 's squadrons based at Sarajevo , which was the strongest operational base at that time . The Zagreb air base was principally employed in attacking Partisan positions in western Slavonia and Bosnia . 
 The 10 new Caproni <unk> were tried out during the successive attacks on Partisan territory . They were equally divided between 3rd Squadron ( Zagreb ) and 7th Squadron ( Rajlovac ) . During September and October Blenheims from 8th Squadron and the Dornier Do 17Ks from 3rd and 9th Squadrons were extensively used to attack Partisan positions in Bihać , Bugojno , Livno and <unk> and Bosnia . Owing to the availability of increased numbers of aircraft , the 6th Group was formed at Banja Luka comprising the 13th , 16th , 17th and 18th Squadrons . Not only did this medium bomber force fly reconnaissance and bombing missions against Partisan forces , but also flew deep into territory under Partisan control and attacked railway stations , road traffic , agricultural depots and food stocks . The Partisan forces were aware of the threat to their operations that the ZNDH provided and were constantly trying to improve their anti @-@ aircraft defence , which relied mainly on machineguns . 
 December 1942 also saw the return of the HZL bomber squadron to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front , where they had flown more than 1 @,@ 500 sorties . Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1 . / ( Kroat . ) KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH . The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory right up to the end of 1944 . In late 1943 , a second squadron , 2 . / ( Kroat . ) KG was formed to provide operational training . It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat <unk> medium bombers . 
 During the course of 1942 , the ZNDH flew some 4 @,@ 800 sorties , of which 30 % were combat missions , with 35 aircraft being lost . Of these losses , 19 were to Partisan ground fire , 12 to accidents and four deserted . By the end of the year the ZNDH aircraft park consisted of 191 aircraft , formed into 14 squadrons . 
 1942 had seen the first desertions of aircraft from the ZNDH , the first on 23 May when a Breguet and a Potez had defected to the Partisan forces . The army conducted an intensive search for the aircraft and in response the Partisans produced two decoy scale @-@ model aircraft , made of wood and canvas , which were duly destroyed by ZNDH bombers . Both " destroyed " aircraft were able to perform a number of attacks on army units ( armed with hand @-@ made pipe bombs ) before either being shot down ( the Breguet on 4 June ) or destroyed on the ground ( the Potez on 6 July ) . The two other defections occurred in July and October , with a Blenheim bomber in each case flying to Turkey . 
 = = = = ZNDH paratroops = = = = 
 In January 1942 , the ZNDH formed a parachute unit , known as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Company ( Croatian : 1 <unk> <unk> sat , 1 PLS ) . It had a strength of 120 men and was based in the northern town of Koprivnica , near the border with Hungary . An Avia Fokker <unk> tri @-@ motor transport aircraft was assigned to the unit on a permanent basis , with other transports assigned as required . The paratroops were equipped with rifles , sub @-@ machine guns , light machine guns and light mortars . After a period of training , 1 PLS made a demonstration mass tactical jump on 6 July 1943 at Borongaj airfield , Zagreb . Forty five paratroopers made a successful jump from three Avia Fokker transports . 
 On 6 November 1943 , three brigades of the Partisans , supported by artillery and heavy machine @-@ guns mounted an attack on the town of Koprivnica , which they took on 9 November . The paratroops of 1 PLS held out at their base for three days before withdrawing into Hungary and continuing the battle with other NDH and German defending forces until 29 November . They received direct air support from ZNDH Dornier Do 17Ks , as well as supplies from light aircraft , but were unable to prevent the loss of their base , together with 20 men , all of their parachute equipment and their transport aircraft . The ZNDH also lost a Dornier Do 17K bomber and a Bücker Bü 131 biplane shot down during this period . 
 The unit was re @-@ deployed in 1944 to Borongaj airfield in Zagreb and in June 1944 grew in strength with the addition of three further companies and was re @-@ designated as the 1st Light Infantry Parachute Battalion ( Croatian : 1 <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1 <unk> ) . They were responsible for the ground defence of this important air base and also performed ceremonial guard duties in Zagreb itself . By late January 1945 the unit was equipped with white winter jackets for camouflage and attached to the NDH Motorized Brigade , seeing its first action on this new sector , south of Zagreb . 1 <unk> remained in constant action against the advancing Partisans until the last unit surrendered in Austria on 14 May 1945 , one week after the official end of World War II . 
 = = = 1943 = = = 
 At the beginning of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory . No aerial opposition of any kind was expected and that was the primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover , notwithstanding the fact that there was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH 's squadrons . However , the situation started to change by the beginning of 1943 . The Headquarters ( HQ ) of the ZNDH had plans to re @-@ arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin . The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi <unk> and Macchi C.202 fighters , as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in the beginning of 1943 . 
 This was because the situation began to change in favour of the Allies . They had landed in North Africa while the Soviets were undertaking their great winter offensive , endangering , and eventually defeating , the German 6th Army around Stalingrad . 
 The Partisan movement in Yugoslavia , aside from some smaller territories , established a large liberated territory extending west of the rivers Neretva and Bosna , in the direction of the cities of Zagreb and Rijeka . The Partisan force had grown stronger – it had more than 60 @,@ 000 armed fighters in this so @-@ called " Tito 's State " who were both well trained and supported by artillery . On 20 January 1943 , the German HQ in Yugoslavia launched an offensive codenamed Case White ( German : Fall Weiss ) , intending to regain the lost territory . The attack was supported by aircraft from the Luftwaffe , Regia Aeronautica and the ZNDH . Aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd Groups from Sarajevo and the 6th Group from Banja Luka were involved in bombing raids as well as leaflet dropping missions . 
 The Banja Luka air base was reinforced by a newly formed 5th Group after the end of Case White . The ZNDH now consisted of three air bases with six Groups and 14 squadrons . During 1943 new aircraft continued to arrive , with 30 overhauled Dornier Do 17E bombers delivered from Germany and divided between the 3rd Squadron ( Zagreb ) , and the 13th and 15th Squadrons ( Banja Luka ) . From Italy came 34 long promised ex @-@ VVKJ Bücker Bü 131 <unk> and 25 <unk> 200 light biplane trainers and liaison aircraft , which were dispatched to all three air bases . They were also used to deliver mail and fresh meat to isolated / surrounded towns and garrisons . 
 Although the ZNDH had a brief role in the subsequent anti @-@ Partisan offensive , Case Black ( German : Fall Schwarz ) in mid @-@ 1943 , its main involvement was on the front in the central NDH . As always , the Partisan resistance displayed frustrating survivability and effectiveness and new events started to influence the fighting in Yugoslavia . The Partisan forces were well aware of the constant threat of air attack posed by the ZNDH 's medium bomber force and on 10 August 1943 undertook a devastating night attack by a brigade on Sarajevo 's Rajlovac airfield . The three and a half hour assault on the airfield left 10 ZNDH bombers , plus another five Luftwaffe bombers and transports , destroyed , with another 17 aircraft damaged . Although some aircrews returned fire from the machine @-@ gun turrets of their aircraft , Partisan losses were less than 20 . Afterwards ZNDH Command complained that the German ordered dispersal of aircraft around the airfield 's perimeter , in case of air attack , made the aircraft especially vulnerable to just this type of ground attack . 
 By mid @-@ 1943 , following the capture of southern Italy , Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans . NDH military command was aware of this danger and was trying to persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH . However , instead of Bf 109s , the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October , plus another dozen which arrived in December . The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš @-@ <unk> Beta @-@ Minor sporting two seater monoplanes , which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty , as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident . 
 Mid @-@ September 1943 saw the dismissal of Kren from command of the ZNDH . He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Adalbert <unk> , who initiated a major reorganisation . 
 Following the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 , around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft were found at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 machines were incorporated into the ZNDH . This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters , as well as six Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters . Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat <unk> bombers were also added into the ZNDH . The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20 @-@ 25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans . 
 The capitulation of Italy also brought with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast . As a result , on 9 September , orders were received by 1 . / ( Kroat . ) KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon . On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy . All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier , which was shot down , the crew bailing out . One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea , killing its pilot . After this , reconnaissance sorties were confined to the vicinity of the Dalmatian coast . 
 Attacks on Partisan forces continued , and on 3 October seven Dornier Do @-@ 17Zs caught 2 @.@ <unk> of Brigada <unk> Radić ( 2nd battalion of the Radić Brothers Brigade ) on the move at <unk> , on the Varaždin @-@ Ludbreg road . In over one hour 's concentrated aerial bombardment , the battalion sustained some 60 casualties , including 42 dead . 
 Although the ZNDH was now able to mount a credible threat against the insurgents , by then a new menace was arriving from the other side of the Adriatic . On 30 June 1943 , the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported , followed by the first USAAF bombers , when 61 B @-@ 24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August . The ZNDH 's 3rd Flak Group , defending Brod na Savi ( Slavonski Brod ) , managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target . The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406s , 10 Fiat G.50s , six Fiat CR.42s , five Avia BH @-@ 33s and two Ikarus IK @-@ 2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940 . 
 By the end of 1943 the ZNDH was 9 @,@ 775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft , having lost 61 shot down , destroyed on the ground , in accidents and five desertions . 
 = = = 1944 = = = 
 With the capitulation of Italy , the ZNDH lost an important source of new aircraft and the tide turned significantly when Allied air raids on targets in the Balkans became a reality . The Luftwaffe fighter squadrons stationed in Ljubljana , Zagreb , southern Austria and northern Italy fought heavy battles to stop the American USAAF heavy bomber armada . The ZNDH was also included in the defence with the newly formed 11th Fighter Group ( Croatian : 11 <unk> <unk> ) consisting of the 21st , 22nd and 23rd Fighter Squadrons ( Croatian : <unk> jata ) equipped with Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 aircraft . 
 1944 also saw the return of the HZL fighter squadron to the NDH from service on the Eastern Front . It was redesignated Kroat . JGr 1 and its operational fighter squadron was redesignated 2 . / ( Kroat . ) JGr . Soon after arrival 2 . / ( Kroat . ) JGr sent its ZNDH pilots to collect 12 brand new Macchi C.202 fighters direct from the plant near Milan in Italy . The Italian designed and built Macchi C.202 fighter was the first up @-@ to @-@ date fighter available to the ZNDH . These aircraft retained their Luftwaffe markings whilst in service with the unit . A second training / operational conversion squadron was also formed , designated 3 . / ( Kroat . ) JGr and equipped with Fiat G.50 , Macchi <unk> and Fiat CR.42 fighters . After a period of operational conversion , the squadron commenced operations against the frequent incursions over the NDH by USAAF and RAF aircraft . During a period of intensive activity over the summer of 1944 , the squadron claimed some 20 Allied aircraft shot down , while at the same time receiving six further Macchi <unk> , as well as four brand new Macchi <unk> 
 The ZNDH 's long obsolete Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 and Fiat G.50 fighter aircraft also attempted to intercept the USAAF bomber formations , often stressing their old engines beyond the limit . They were no match for the escorting Mustang and Thunderbolt USAAF fighters and suffered heavy losses , both in the air and on the ground . 
 By the end of 1944 the HZL squadron had handed in its remaining worn @-@ out Macchis for brand new German Messerschmitt Bf 109G & K fighters . A total of 21 Bf 109s had been delivered to the ZNDH by year 's end . 
 Allied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the Seventh anti @-@ Partisan Offensive , including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944 . Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude . Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude . This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter @-@ bombers went low en @-@ masse for the first time , establishing full aerial superiority . Consequently , both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours . 
 In June , the ZNDH finally received from Germany the long @-@ promised airdrop containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment , constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons all over the NDH . They were immediately put to good use and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH . The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks . June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH . 
 Toward the end of June , the ZNDH received the first of 22 Bücker Bü 181 <unk> aircraft . The 19th and 20th Transport Squadrons received five each , with the remainder issued to the 1st Pilot School . Besides liaison duties , they were used to transport fresh meat from Bosnia to Zagreb , where there was a food shortage . 
 Fifteen Ju 87D dive bombers and a few Ju 87R @-@ 2 extended range dive bombers are known to have been supplied to the HZL , and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the late summer of 1944 . 
 In the second half of 1944 , the situation on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces . Soviet , Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons . In a surprise attack on 20 September , they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH 's airbase at <unk> airfield , including 11 unserviceable aircraft . In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield , a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment , some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors , using suppressing fire provided by their machine @-@ gun turrets , whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire . The city and airbase were re @-@ taken several days later in a heavy counter @-@ attack by NDH and German troops . 
 The Germans also continued to supply second @-@ line aircraft to the ZNDH , including between nine and 12 exotic Fieseler Fi 167 biplane torpedo bombers . These had been originally designed and intended for use aboard the German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin , which was never completed . After that they were sold to the NDH , where their short @-@ field and load @-@ carrying abilities made them ideal not only for attack missions , but also for transporting ammunition and other supplies to besieged army garrisons . Many of these missions were flown between their arrival in September 1944 and the end of the War ( under the right conditions , the aircraft could descend almost vertically ) . During one such mission , near Sisak on 10 October 1944 , an Fi 167 of the ZNDH was attacked by five P @-@ 51 Mustang Mk IIIs of 213 Squadron RAF . The crew of the Fieseler ( piloted by an ex @-@ HZL eight @-@ kill Flying ace ) , exploiting the aircraft 's extreme maneuverability to the fullest , had the distinction of shooting down one of the Mustangs before itself being shot down ; possibly one of the last biplane " kills " of the war . 
 = = = 1945 = = = 
 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH . Aircraft losses amounted to 234 , primarily on the ground , and it entered 1945 with 196 machines , including 17 Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs , 12 Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406s , seven Fiat G.50s and two Fiat CR.42 fighters and some 30 multi @-@ engined bombers , although shortages of fuel had begun to hamper operations . 
 Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses . Some 39 by the end of March . These included , in addition to regular Messerschmitt Bf 109G deliveries , the final dozen Dornier Do 17 medium bombers in January . In March , despite losses of 15 Bf 109G & Ks , ten Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 , three Fiat CR.42 and two Fiat G.50 , the ZNDH 's fighter force included 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109G & Ks , three Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 , six Fiat G.50 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110G fighters . With the Bf 109G the ZNDH were finally able to face the USAAF and RAF on equal terms , with two squadrons equipped with the type from late 1944 . The ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945 . 
 The Dornier Do 17 medium bombers of the ZNDH were still hitting back when and where they could and on 31 December 1944 a Dornier Do 17E attacked an RAF 148 Squadron Handley Page Halifax bomber on the ground at the Partisan airfield at <unk> near Čazma , destroying it with bombs . On 10 February 1945 , after a bridge @-@ busting sortie on the Drava river , a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z caught 1 . <unk> Brigada ( 1st Zagorje Brigade ) marching in the open near Daruvar . The Yugoslav Partisans ( by now known as the Jugoslovenska Armija - Yugoslav Army ) unit suffered some two dozen casualties . Late in the afternoon of 30 March , four Dornier Do 17Z bombers , escorted by four Bf 109G fighters attacked Jugoslovenska Armija positions near Gospić . On 15 April 1945 , a force made up of a Dornier Do 17Z , escorted by two Bf 109Gs destroyed two Partisan aircraft at their airfield at Sanski Most . 
 Despite these attacking raids , with the outcome of the war by now quite obvious , defections of ZNDH personnel and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified , including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April . 
 The last fighter delivery took place on 23 April 1945 . It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex @-@ HZL 16 @-@ kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P @-@ 51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs , one of which was confirmed . The last attack mission was flown on 6 May , when two ancient Rogožarski R @-@ 100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa River in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac , south of Zagreb . One of the Yugoslav @-@ built parasol wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash @-@ landed near his target . He was captured and shot on the spot . 
 That evening , with Partisan forces advancing upon the NDH capital of Zagreb , the commanding officer of the ZNDH fighter group gathered together his men at Zagreb 's <unk> airfield and released them from their oath of loyalty and announced that each was free to go . Some flew their aircraft and crews , including several Dornier Do 17s and a CANT Z.1007 to Italy and the Allied forces there . Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans , including several light aircraft and some Bf 109s , whilst others , also including Bf 109s , as well as at least one Dornier Do @-@ 17Z , a Messerschmitt Bf 110G @-@ 2 , a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav @-@ designed and built Zmaj Fizir FP @-@ 2 sought sanctuary at Klagenfurt in Austria . 
 The four @-@ year campaign of the ZNDH , during which it had on its charge at one time or another some 650 aircraft , thus ended with the capture of the airbases around Zagreb on 8 May 1945 and the ZNDH ceased to exist . Its colourful collection of often vintage aircraft , scattered on deserted airfields , received new markings , a red star , and formed the basis of the new Yugoslav Air Force .

 The Sumatran rhinoceros , also known as the hairy rhinoceros or Asian two @-@ horned rhinoceros ( Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ) , is a rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses . It is the only extant species of the genus Dicerorhinus . It is the smallest rhinoceros , although it is still a large mammal ; it stands 112 – 145 cm ( 3 @.@ 67 – 4 @.@ 76 ft ) high at the shoulder , with a head @-@ and @-@ body length of 2 @.@ 36 – 3 @.@ 18 m ( 7 @.@ 7 – 10 @.@ 4 ft ) and a tail of 35 – 70 cm ( 14 – 28 in ) . The weight is reported to range from 500 to 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 to 2 @,@ 200 lb ) , averaging 700 – 800 kg ( 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 800 lb ) , although there is a single record of a 2 @,@ 000 kg ( 4 @,@ 400 lb ) specimen . Like both African species , it has two horns ; the larger is the nasal horn , typically 15 – 25 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) , while the other horn is typically a stub . A coat of reddish @-@ brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino 's body . 
 Members of the species once inhabited rainforests , swamps , and cloud forests in India , Bhutan , Bangladesh , Myanmar , Laos , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and China . In historical times , they lived in southwest China , particularly in Sichuan . They are now critically endangered , with only five substantial populations in the wild : four on Sumatra and one on Borneo . Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range , but they are estimated to number fewer than 100 . Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt , and one of the Sumatran populations may already be extinct . Total numbers today may be as low as 80 . In 2015 , researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from the northern part of Borneo ( Sabah , Malaysia ) ; however , a new population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016 . 
 The Sumatran rhino is a mostly solitary animal except for courtship and offspring @-@ rearing . It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet , twisting saplings into patterns , and leaving excrement . The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros , in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species . The program was considered a disaster even by its initiator ; most of the rhinos died and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years , representing an even worse population decline than in the wild . In March 2016 , a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The first documented Sumatran rhinoceros was shot 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) outside Fort Marlborough , near the west coast of Sumatra , in 1793 . Drawings of the animal , and a written description , were sent to the naturalist Joseph Banks , then president of the Royal Society of London , who published a paper on the specimen that year . In 1814 , the species was given a scientific name by Johann Fischer von Waldheim , a German scientist and curator of the State Darwin Museum in Moscow , Russia . 
 The scientific name Dicerorhinus sumatrensis comes from the Greek terms di ( δι , meaning " two " ) , <unk> ( κέρας , meaning " horn " ) , and rhinos ( <unk> , meaning " nose " ) . <unk> signifies " of Sumatra " , the Indonesian island where the rhinos were first discovered . Carl Linnaeus originally classified all rhinos in the genus , Rhinoceros ; therefore , the species was originally identified as Rhinoceros sumatrensis or sumatranus . Joshua Brookes considered the Sumatran rhinoceros , with its two horns , a distinct genus from the one @-@ horned Rhinoceros , and gave it the name <unk> in 1828 . Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger proposed the name Dicerorhinus in 1841 . In 1868 , John Edward Gray proposed the name <unk> . Normally , the oldest name would be used , but a 1977 ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature established the proper genus name as Dicerorhinus . 
 The three subspecies are : 
 D. s. sumatrensis , known as the Western Sumatran rhinoceros , which has only 75 to 85 rhinos remaining , mostly in the national parks of Bukit Barisan Selatan and Gunung Leuser in Sumatra , but also in Way Kambas National Park in small numbers . They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia . The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching . A slight genetic difference is noted between the Western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos . The rhinos in the Malaysian Peninsular were once known as D. s. niger , but were later recognized to be a synonym of D. s. sumatrensis . Three males and four females currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas , the youngest male having been bred and born there in 2012 . Another calf , a female , was born at the sanctuary in May 2016 . The sanctuary 's two males were born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden . 
 D. s. <unk> , known as the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros , which was once common throughout Borneo ; now , only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive . The known population lives in East Kalimantan , with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah . Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed . This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson , who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s . The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two . The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah . 
 D. s. lasiotis , known as the Northern Sumatran rhinoceros or Chittagong rhinoceros , which once roamed India and Bangladesh , but has been declared extinct in these countries . Unconfirmed reports suggest a small population may still survive in Burma , but the political situation in that country has prevented verification . The name lasiotis is derived from the Greek for " hairy @-@ ears " . Later studies showed that their ear @-@ hair was not longer than other Sumatran rhinos , but D. s. lasiotis remained a subspecies because it was significantly larger than the other subspecies . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Ancestral rhinoceroses first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene . Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago . The extant family , the Rhinocerotidae , first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia , and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene . 
 The Sumatran rhinoceros is considered the least derived of the extant species , as it shares more traits with its Miocene ancestors . Paleontological evidence in the fossil record dates the genus Dicerorhinus to the Early Miocene , 23 – 16 million years ago . Many fossils have been classified as members of Dicerorhinus , but no other recent species are in the genus . Molecular dating suggests the split of Dicerorhinus from the four other extant species as far back as 25 @.@ 9 ± 1 @.@ 9 million years . Three hypotheses have been proposed for the relationship between the Sumatran rhinoceros and the other living species . One hypothesis suggests the Sumatran rhinoceros is closely related to the black and white rhinos in Africa , evidenced by the species having two horns , instead of one . Other taxonomists regard the Sumatran rhinoceros as a sister taxon of the Indian and Javan rhinoceros because their ranges overlap so closely . A third hypothesis , based on more recent analyses , however , suggests that the two African rhinos , the two Asian rhinos , and the Sumatran rhinoceros represent three essentially separate lineages that split around 25 @.@ 9 million years ago ; which group diverged first remains unclear . 
 Because of morphological similarities , the Sumatran rhinoceros is believed to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros ( <unk> <unk> ) . The woolly rhinoceros , so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros , first appeared in China ; by the Upper Pleistocene , it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain . The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age , but , like the woolly mammoth , most or all became extinct around 10 @,@ 000 years ago . Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship , recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa . 
 = = Description = = 
 A mature Sumatran rhino stands about 120 – 145 cm ( 3 @.@ 94 – 4 @.@ 76 ft ) high at the shoulder , has a body length of around 250 cm ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) , and weighs 500 – 800 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 – 1 @,@ 800 lb ) , though the largest individuals in zoos have been known to weigh as much as 2 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 4 @,@ 400 lb ) . Like the African species , it has two horns . The larger is the nasal horn , typically only 15 – 25 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) , though the longest recorded specimen was much longer at 81 cm ( 32 in ) . The posterior horn is much smaller , usually less than 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long , and often little more than a knob . The larger nasal horn is also known as the anterior horn ; the smaller posterior horn is known as the frontal horn . The horns are dark grey or black in color . The males have larger horns than the females , though the species is not otherwise sexually dimorphic . The Sumatran rhino lives an estimated 30 – 45 years in the wild , while the record time in captivity is a female D. lasiotis , which lived for 32 years and 8 months before dying in the London Zoo in 1900 . 
 Two thick folds of skin encircle the body behind the front legs and before the hind legs . The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck . The skin itself is thin , 10 – 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 63 in ) , and in the wild , the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat . Hair can range from dense ( the most dense hair in young calves ) to scarce , and is usually a reddish @-@ brown . In the wild , this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud . In captivity , however , the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier , likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation . The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair at the end of its tail . Like all rhinos , they have very poor vision . The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile ; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Sumatran rhinoceros lives in both lowland and highland secondary rainforest , swamps , and cloud forests . It inhabits hilly areas close to water , particularly steep upper valleys with copious undergrowth . The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited a continuous range as far north as Burma , eastern India , and Bangladesh . Unconfirmed reports also placed it in Cambodia , Laos , and Vietnam . All known living animals occur in Peninsular Malaysia , the island of Sumatra , and Sabah , Borneo . Some conservationists hope Sumatran rhinos may still survive in Burma , though it is considered unlikely . Political turmoil in Burma has prevented any assessment or study of possible survivors . The last reports of stray animals from Indian limits were in 1990s . 
 The Sumatran rhino is widely scattered across its range , much more so than the other Asian rhinos , which has made it difficult for conservationists to protect members of the species effectively . Only five areas are known to contain Sumatran rhinoceros : Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park , Gunung Leuser National Park , and Way Kambas National Park on Sumatra ; <unk> Valley in Sabah , Malaysia , on the island of Borneo , and on Indonesian Borneo west of <unk> . 
 The <unk> <unk> National Park , Sumatra 's largest , was estimated to contain a population of around 500 rhinos in the 1980s , but due to poaching , this population is now considered extinct . The survival of any animals in Peninsula Malaysia is extremely unlikely . 
 Genetic analysis of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages . The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia was not as significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains along the length of Sumatra , for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos on the other side of the mountains in western Sumatra . In fact , the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance , the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene , when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland . Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia , however , are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic . The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations . Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci . The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos , but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study . 
 Although the rhino had been thought to be extinct in Kalimantan since the 1990s , in March 2013 World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) announced that the team when monitoring orangutan activity found in West Kutai Regency , East Kalimantan , several fresh rhino foot trails , mud holes , traces of rhino @-@ rubbed trees , traces of rhino horns on the walls of mud holes , and rhino bites on small branches . The team also identified that rhinos ate more than 30 species of plants . On 2 October 2013 , video images made with camera traps showing the Sumatran rhino in Kutai Barat , Kalimantan , were released by the World Wildlife Fund . Experts assume the videos show two different animals , but aren 't quite certain . According to the Indonesia 's Minister of Forestry , <unk> Hasan called the video evidence " very important " and mentioned Indonesia 's " target of rhino population growth by three percent per year " . On 22 March 2016 it was announced by the WWF that a live Sumatran Rhino was found in Kalimantan ; it was the first contact in over 40 years . The rhino , a female , is being transported to a nearby sanctuary . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Sumatran rhinoceroses are solitary creatures except for pairing before mating and during offspring rearing . Individuals have home ranges ; bulls have territories as large as 50 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , whereas females ' ranges are 10 – 15 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 8 sq mi ) . The ranges of females appear to be spaced apart ; males ' ranges often overlap . No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting . Marking their territories is done by scraping soil with their feet , bending saplings into distinctive patterns , and leaving excrement . The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating , at dawn , and just after dusk . During the day , they wallow in mud baths to cool down and rest . In the rainy season , they move to higher elevations ; in the cooler months , they return to lower areas in their range . When mud holes are unavailable , the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns . The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from ectoparasites and other insects . Captive specimens , deprived of adequate wallowing , have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins , <unk> , eye problems , inflamed nails , and hair loss , and have eventually died . One 20 @-@ month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time . After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow , the rhino will abandon it . Typically , the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food . Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day , the study of wild animals found 80 – 300 minutes ( an average of 166 minutes ) per day spent in wallows . 
 There has been little opportunity to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros . Ticks and <unk> were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century . The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease <unk> , which can be spread by horse @-@ flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes ; in 2004 , all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18 @-@ day period after becoming infected by the disease . The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans . Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf , but calves stay close to their mothers , and the frequency of such killings is unknown . Although the rhino 's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs , the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat . Elephants ( Elephas maximus ) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails , and many smaller species such as deer , boars , and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create . 
 The Sumatran rhino maintains trails across its range . These trails fall into two types . Main trails will be used by generations of rhinos to travel between important areas in the rhino 's range , such as between salt licks , or in corridors through inhospitable terrain that separates ranges . In feeding areas , the rhinos will make smaller trails , still covered by vegetation , to areas containing food the rhino eats . Sumatran rhino trails have been found that cross rivers deeper than 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) and about 50 m ( 160 ft ) across . The currents of these rivers are known to be strong , but the rhino is a strong swimmer . A relative absence of wallows near rivers in the range of the Sumatran rhinoceros indicates they may occasionally bathe in rivers in lieu of wallowing . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Most feeding occurs just before nightfall and in the morning . The Sumatran rhino is a browser , with a diet of young saplings , leaves , fruits , twigs , and shoots . The rhinos usually consume up to 50 kg ( 110 lb ) of food a day . Primarily by measuring dung samples , researchers have identified more than 100 food species consumed by the Sumatran rhinoceros . The largest portion of the diet is tree saplings with a trunk diameter of 1 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 in ) . The rhinoceros typically pushes these saplings over with its body , walking over the sapling without stepping on it , to eat the leaves . Many of the plant species the rhino consumes exist in only small portions , which indicates the rhino is frequently changing its diet and feeding in different locations . Among the most common plants the rhino eats are many species from the Euphorbiaceae , Rubiaceae , and Melastomataceae families . The most common species the rhino consumes is Eugenia . 
 The vegetal diet of the Sumatran rhinoceros is high in fiber and only moderate in protein . Salt licks are very important to the nutrition of the rhino . These licks can be small hot springs , seepages of salty water , or mud @-@ volcanoes . The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos — males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus . Some Sumatran rhinos , however , live in areas where salt licks are not readily available , or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks . These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 The Sumatran rhinoceros is the most vocal of the rhinoceros species . Observations of the species in zoos show the animal almost constantly vocalizing , and it is known to do so in the wild , as well . The rhino makes three distinct noises : <unk> , whales , and whistle @-@ blows . The <unk> , a short , one @-@ second @-@ long yelp , is the most common sound . The whale , named for its similarity to vocalizations of the humpback whale , is the most song @-@ like vocalization and the second @-@ most common . The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds . The whistle @-@ blow is named because it consists of a two @-@ second @-@ long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession . The whistle @-@ blow is the loudest of the vocalizations , loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate . The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown , though they are theorized to convey danger , sexual readiness , and location , as do other ungulate vocalizations . The whistle @-@ blow could be heard at a great distance , even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives . A vocalization of similar volume from elephants has been shown to carry 9 @.@ 8 km ( 6 @.@ 1 mi ) and the whistle @-@ blow may carry as far . The Sumatran rhinoceros will sometimes twist the saplings they do not eat . This twisting behavior is believed to be used as a form of communication , frequently indicating a junction in a trail . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Females become sexually mature at the age of six to seven years , while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old . The gestation period is around 15 – 16 months . The calf , which typically weighs 40 – 60 kg ( 88 – 132 lb ) , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life . In the wild , the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years ; its natural offspring @-@ rearing behavior is unstudied . 
 The reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity . Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization , tail raising , urination , and increased physical contact , with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals . The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the black rhinoceros . Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females , sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship . In the wild , the female could run away from an overly aggressive male , but in their smaller captive enclosures , they cannot ; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive @-@ breeding programs . 
 The period of oestrus itself , when the female is receptive to the male , lasts about 24 hours , and observations have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days . Rhinos in the Cincinnati Zoo have been observed copulating for 30 – 50 minutes , similar in length to other rhinos ; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle . As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies , and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods , a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior . Though researchers observed successful conceptions , all these pregnancies ended in failure for a variety of reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001 ; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino 's ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable progesterone levels . Breeding success was finally achieved in 2001 , 2004 , and 2007 by providing a pregnant rhino with supplementary progestin . Recently , a calf was born in captivity of an endangered female in western Indonesia , only the fifth such birth in one and a quarter century . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Sumatran rhinoceroses were once quite numerous throughout Southeast Asia . Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain . The species is classed as critically endangered ( primarily due to illegal poaching ) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived . Until the early 1990s , the population decline was estimated at more than 50 % per decade , and the small , scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression . Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia . 
 Poaching of Sumatran rhinoceros is a cause for concern , as the price of its horn has been estimated as high as US $ 30 @,@ 000 per kilogram . This species has been overhunted for many centuries , leading to the current greatly reduced – and still declining – population . The rhinos are difficult to observe and hunt directly ( one field researcher spent seven weeks in a <unk> near a salt lick without ever observing a rhino directly ) , so poachers make use of spear traps and pit traps . In the 1970s , uses of the rhinoceros 's body parts among the local people of Sumatra were documented , such as the use of rhino horns in amulets and a folk belief that the horns offer some protection against poison . Dried rhinoceros meat was used as medicine for diarrhea , leprosy , and tuberculosis . " Rhino oil " , a concoction made from leaving a rhino 's skull in coconut oil for several weeks , may be used to treat skin diseases . The extent of use and belief in these practices is not known . Rhinoceros horn was once believed to be widely used as an aphrodisiac ; in fact traditional Chinese medicine never used it for this purpose . Nevertheless , hunting in this species has primarily been driven by a demand for rhino horns with supposedly medicinal properties . 
 The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia , which the Sumatran rhino inhabits , are also targets for legal and illegal logging because of the desirability of their hardwoods . Rare woods such as <unk> , meranti and <unk> are valuable on the international markets , fetching as much as $ 1 @,@ 800 per m3 ( $ 1 @,@ 375 per cu yd ) . Enforcement of illegal @-@ logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near many of the same forests as the rhino . The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging . Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction , the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami . However , while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance , apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting , as it can withstand more or less any forest condition . 
 The Bornean rhino in Sabah was confirmed to be extinct in the wild in April 2015 , with only 3 individuals left in captivity . 
 The <unk> Sumatran rhino in Malaysia was confirmed to be extinct in the wild in August 2015 . 
 In March 2016 there was a rare sighting of a Sumatran Rhino in Kalimantan , the Indonesian part of Borneo . The last time there was a Sumatran Rhino in the Kalimantan area was approximately 40 years ago . This optimism was met with despair as that very specific Sumatran Rhino was found dead several weeks later after the sighting . The reason of the death is currently unknown . 
 = = = In captivity = = = 
 Sumatran rhinoceroses do not thrive outside of their ecosystem . The London Zoo acquired a male and female in 1872 that had been captured in Chittagong in 1868 . The female named " Begum " survived until 1900 , the record lifetime for a captive rhino . Begum was one of at least seven specimens of the extinct subspecies D. s. lasiotis that were held in zoos and circuses . In 1972 , <unk> , the only Sumatran rhino remaining in captivity , died at the Copenhagen Zoo . 
 Despite the species ' persistent lack of reproductive success , in the early 1980s , some conservation organizations began a captive @-@ breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros . Between 1984 and 1996 , this ex situ conservation program transported 40 Sumatran rhinos from their native habitats to zoos and reserves across the world . While hopes were initially high , and much research was conducted on the captive specimens , by the late 1990s , not a single rhino had been born in the program , and most of its proponents agreed the program had been a failure . In 1997 , the IUCN 's Asian rhino specialist group , which once endorsed the program , declared it had failed " even maintaining the species within acceptable limits of mortality " , noting that , in addition to the lack of births , 20 of the captured rhinos had died . In 2004 , a <unk> outbreak at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre killed all the captive rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia , reducing the population of captive rhinos to eight . 
 Seven of these captive rhinos were sent to the United States ( the other was kept in Southeast Asia ) , but by 1997 , their numbers had dwindled to three : a female in the Los Angeles Zoo , a male in the Cincinnati Zoo , and a female in the Bronx Zoo . In a final effort , the three rhinos were united in Cincinnati . After years of failed attempts , the female from Los Angeles , Emi , became pregnant for the sixth time , with the zoo 's male <unk> . All five of her previous pregnancies ended in failure . Researchers at the zoo had learned from previous failures , though , and with the aid of special hormone treatments , Emi gave birth to a healthy male calf named Andalas ( an Indonesian literary word for Sumatra ) in September 2001 . Andalas 's birth was the first successful captive birth of a Sumatran rhino in 112 years . A female calf , named " <unk> " ( Indonesian for " pure " ) , followed on 30 July 2004 . On 29 April 2007 , Emi gave birth a third time , to her second male calf , named Harapan ( Indonesian for " hope " ) or Harry . In 2007 , Andalas , who had been living at the Los Angeles Zoo , was returned to Sumatra to take part in breeding programs with healthy females , leading to the siring and 23 June 2012 birth of male calf <unk> , the fourth captive @-@ born calf of the era ; Andalas had been mated with Ratu , a wild @-@ born female living in the Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas National Park . 
 Despite the recent successes in Cincinnati , the captive @-@ breeding program has remained controversial . Proponents argue that the zoos have aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits , raising public awareness and education about the rhinos , and helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra . Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great ; the program is too expensive ; removing rhinos from their habitat , even temporarily , alters their ecological role ; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well @-@ protected native habitats . In October 2015 <unk> , the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere , left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia . 
 = = Cultural depictions = = 
 Aside from those few individuals kept in zoos and pictured in books , the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained little known , overshadowed by the more common Indian , black and white rhinos . Recently , however , video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries . Extensive footage can be found in an Asia Geographic documentary The Littlest Rhino . Natural History New Zealand showed footage of a Sumatran rhino , shot by freelance Indonesian @-@ based cameraman Alain <unk> , in the 2001 documentary The Forgotten Rhino , which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos . 
 Though they were documented by droppings and tracks , pictures of the Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006 , when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo . On 24 April 2007 , it was announced that cameras had captured the first @-@ ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino . The night @-@ time footage showed the rhino eating , peering through jungle foliage , and sniffing the film equipment . The World Wildlife Fund , which took the video , has used it in efforts to convince local governments to turn the area into a rhino conservation zone . Monitoring has continued ; 50 new cameras have been set up , and in February 2010 , what appeared to be a pregnant rhino was filmed . 
 A number of folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were collected by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid @-@ 19th century to early 20th century . In Burma , the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire . Tales described the fire @-@ eating rhino following smoke to its source , especially campfires , and then attacking the camp . There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July , when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon . In Malaya , it was said that the rhino 's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water . In Malaya and Sumatra , it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground . In Borneo , the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice : after defecating in a stream , it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement . 
 = Yotsuba & ! = 
 Yotsuba & ! ( <unk> ! , Yotsuba to ! ) is an ongoing Japanese comedy manga series by Kiyohiko Azuma , the creator of Azumanga Daioh . It is published in Japan by ASCII Media Works , formerly MediaWorks , in the monthly magazine Dengeki Daioh and collected in thirteen tankōbon volumes . It depicts the everyday adventures of a young girl named Yotsuba as she learns about the world around her , guided by her father , the neighbors , and their friends . Several characters in Yotsuba & ! were previously featured in a one @-@ shot manga called " Try ! Try ! Try ! " The phrase Yotsuba to means " Yotsuba and , " a fact reflected in the chapter titles , most of which take the form " Yotsuba and [ something ] . " 
 The manga was licensed for English @-@ language distribution by ADV Manga , which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007 . Volume six was supposed to have been released in February 2008 , but was delayed indefinitely in order to focus on ADV 's core business of anime . At New York Comic Con 2009 , Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series ; it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009 , and is continuing with later volumes . 
 = = Story = = 
 Yotsuba & ! is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai , a five @-@ year @-@ old adopted girl who is energetic , cheerful , curious , odd , and quirky — so odd and quirky that even her own father calls her strange . She is also initially ignorant about many things a child her age would be expected to know , among them doorbells , escalators , air conditioners , and even playground swings . This naïveté is the premise of humorous stories where she learns about , and frequently misunderstands , everyday things . 
 At the start of the series , Yotsuba and her adoptive father , Koiwai , relocate to a new city with the help of Koiwai 's best friend , an impressively tall man nicknamed Jumbo . Yotsuba makes a strong impression on the three daughters of the neighboring Ayase family , Asagi , Fuuka , and Ena . Most of her daily activities and misadventures often originate from interactions with these characters . 
 The series has no continuing plot — the focus of the stories is Yotsuba 's daily voyage of discovery . Many chapters take place on successive days ( for details , see List of Yotsuba & ! chapters ) , so that the series follows , almost literally , the characters ' daily lives . The tone can be summarized by the motto , used on chapter title pages and advertising , " Today is always the most enjoyable day " , or in the original translation , " Enjoy Everything " ( <unk> 、 <unk> , <unk> kyō ga , <unk> <unk> hi ) . 
 = = Main characters = = 
 = = = Koiwai household = = = 
 Yotsuba Koiwai ( <unk> よつば , Koiwai Yotsuba ) / " Yotsuba " ( よつば , Yotsuba ) 
 Yotsuba is depicted as an energetic five @-@ year @-@ old girl with a child 's wonder towards the world . She is infectiously enthusiastic about nearly everything . Before moving to their present house , she and Koiwai used to live with his mother , and before that on an island that is , according to Yotsuba , " to the left " . Almost nothing is known about her biological parentage other than that she was orphaned somewhere outside Japan and then adopted by Koiwai . Hence , people often think she is a foreigner . She is an excellent swimmer and enjoys drawing , although others only praise her art to avoid hurting her feelings . 
 The name " Yotsuba " ( よつば ) can be translated as " four leaved clover , " and is part of the phrase <unk> no <unk> ( <unk> ? , " four @-@ leaf clover " ) . Her green hair is always styled into four pigtails ( even at bedtime ) , similarly to her namesake . 
 Yousuke Koiwai ( <unk> <unk> , Koiwai Yousuke ) / " Daddy " ( <unk> , tō @-@ chan ) 
 Yousuke Koiwai is Yotsuba 's adoptive father . The manga avoids the subject of her adoption or even her birth parents . When his neighbor Fuuka asks , he tells her that he found Yotsuba while visiting a foreign country and decided to adopt her and bring her back to Japan , with no further details . Although he often casually tells people that Yotsuba is a weirdo , he can be very offbeat and silly himself . He is depicted as a youthful dad with the carefree lifestyle of a slacker . He usually wears an undershirt and boxer shorts while at home , and apologizes when people see him in his " irresponsible " clothes . He works at home as a freelance translator , although the materials he translates are not described . When he does leave the house , usually shopping or with friends , he often brings Yotsuba . Despite his laid @-@ back personality and playful behavior , Koiwai does aim to be a good father and proper role model to Yotsuba and punishes her if he feels she has done something warranting it . 
 = = = Ayase household = = = 
 The Ayase family lives next @-@ door to the Koiwais . 
 Asagi Ayase ( 綾瀬 <unk> , Ayase Asagi ) 
 20 @-@ something years old and the oldest of the three Ayase sisters , Asagi lives at home while attending a nearby university . She is depicted as a very attractive young woman who enjoys creating mischief and teasing people , especially her parents ; her friend Torako once called her a horrible person for manipulating Ena . She often teases Yotsuba for entertainment , although not maliciously . Her mother claims Asagi was very much like Yotsuba when she was young . Mrs. Ayase is puzzled how such a cute child could turn out to be a delinquent , much to Asagi 's annoyance . Asagi 's irreverence may have come from her mother 's teasing when she was a child . For example , in the past when Asagi presented Mrs. Ayase with a four @-@ leaf clover , her mother asked for a five @-@ leaf clover instead . Unable to locate one , young Asagi was reduced to tears . Yotsuba often refers to her as the " Pretty one " . 
 Fuuka Ayase ( 綾瀬 <unk> , Ayase <unk> ) 
 The middle Ayase sister , Fuuka ( also romanized as Fuka ) is 16 years old and in her second year of high school . She appears to be the most dependable and responsible of the sisters . Fuuka usually buys the groceries and is active in the community . During Yotsuba 's eventful first visit to her school , one student calls her " vice @-@ president . " Fuuka often finds herself going out of her way to help out the Koiwais , even though she does not really intend to do so . Besides Jumbo , she has observed the Koiwais ' eccentricities and oddball tendencies more than anyone else . Other characters often lightly ridicule her for making ban puns and wearing t @-@ shirts with strange pictures on them ( such as Chiyo 's " father " from Azumanga Daioh , who also appears as a plushie in her room and as a keychain on her bag ) . Yotsuba has referred to her as " the one who is not pretty " , much to Fuuka 's dismay . 
 Ena Ayase ( 綾瀬 <unk> , Ayase Ena ) 
 The youngest Ayase sister , Ena is about 10 years old and goes to a nearby elementary school . As the one closest to Yotsuba 's age , she and her best friend Miura play with Yotsuba most frequently . Ena is generally well @-@ liked and is arguably the most earnestly kind character of the series . She tries to be eco @-@ friendly by telling people about the negative effects of global warming , limiting her use of air conditioning , and teaching Yotsuba the benefits of recycling . <unk> , level @-@ headed and smart , she serves as a big sister figure to Yotsuba . However , her attempts to spare the five @-@ year @-@ old 's fragile feelings sometimes lead her to say little white lies , like praising Yotsuba 's unspectacular drawings or letting Yotsuba believe that her friend Miura ( concealed in a cardboard costume ) is a real robot named <unk> ( in ADV 's translation ) or <unk> ( in Yen 's translation ) ( <unk> , <unk> ) , often landing herself and Miura in trouble as a result . During her free time , Ena often sketches ( she has very good drawing skills ) or plays with her finely @-@ dressed teddy bears . Eager and willing to try out new experiences , Ena is not squeamish and even enthusiastic about activities like holding large frogs and cleaning out live fish . Yotsuba once referred to her as the " small one " . 
 Mrs. Ayase ( <unk> , Ayase @-@ ke no Haha ) / " Mommy " ( <unk> , kā @-@ chan ) 
 The mother of the Ayase sisters . She frequently has Yotsuba over as a guest and even tells her to visit them every day . Yotsuba 's habit of calling her " Mom " is due to her generosity ( she is fond of giving Yotsuba treats because she likes to watch her eat ) and tolerant nature ( she doesn 't mind Yotsuba soaking her with a water pistol then acting dead to play the part ) . Nostalgia might why she dotes on Yotsuba so much , since during Yotsuba 's visits she often reminisces about Asagi 's younger years ( cuter and better days according to her ) . Asagi exasperates her constantly , although her husband comments that the two have very similar personalities , which both deny . She likes ice creams , cakes , and other sugary desserts . Yotsuba likes to come over to have them , since they 're always in the fridge - much to Mr. Koiwai 's embarrassment and disapproval . 
 Mr. Ayase ( <unk> , Ayase @-@ ke no Chichi ) 
 The father of the three sisters . Mr. Ayase is almost never seen at home , particularly during the regular workweek . While his profession is not yet revealed , it seems to be some sort of <unk> . Asagi teases him about his constant absences , even sometimes referring to him in the past tense as if he is dead . Still , Mr. Ayase is on very good terms with his family ; he dotes on Ena and tries to protect Fuuka . Fuuka and Ena seem to take after his personality : laid @-@ back , congenial , optimistic , and sentimental . Yotsuba seems to treat him with extra respect , although he , like the other <unk> , treat her as family . 
 = = = Friends = = = 
 Takashi Takeda ( <unk> <unk> , Takeda Takashi ) / " Jumbo " ( <unk> , <unk> ) 
 A friend of Koiwai and Yotsuba who has known Koiwai since they were children . He dwarfs the other characters at 210 centimeters ( 6 ft 11 in ) , especially Yotsuba . He is always referred to as " Jumbo " and works as a florist at his father 's flower shop , which Yotsuba and Fuuka only discover through chance . Jumbo helps the Koiwais move in and frequently visits their house ( usually with gifts for Yotsuba such as ice cream ) , and Yotsuba more or less sees him as family . He tends to make deadpan jokes that go over the heads of the younger children , like Yotsuba and Ena , but he means well . At the same time , he is rather impulsive , and often goes all @-@ out in organizing impromptu activities for the younger children such as catching cicadas , fishing and star @-@ gazing . He also develops a deep infatuation with Asagi at first meeting , but is too shy and awkward around beautiful women to directly act upon it . As a result , he often takes advantage of Yotsuba 's relationship with Asagi , but due to Yotsuba 's naïveté , these schemes are never effective . 
 Miura Hayasaka ( <unk> <unk> , Hayasaka Miura ) 
 Ena 's close friend and classmate who lives in a nearby high @-@ rise condo . Miura is tomboyish and brusque , in both her appearance and speech ( this is very noticeable in the Japanese version ; see gender differences in spoken Japanese ) . She wears short hair and boyish clothes , such as sports jerseys . She has an active nature - for instance , she can ride a unicycle and likes to wear roller shoes . Most of the time , she is frank and tends to reply in a <unk> @-@ like manner when she feels wronged or ridiculed . Miura also sometimes teases Yotsuba , even up to the point where Yotsuba is on the verge of tears , though Ena is always on hand to smooth things over . In the end , she is good at heart and the three are good friends . Miura is very squeamish . Unlike Ena , she hated the sight of gutting the fish and was scared by a large frog that Yotsuba caught . 
 Torako ( <unk> ) 
 A close friend of Asagi who also attends the same university as her . The two frequently plan trips and hang out together . Focused on being ' cool ' , Torako smokes cigarettes constantly and is very skinny . Her name means " tiger " ( <unk> , tora ) " girl " ( <unk> , ko ) and Yotsuba enjoys calling her just Tora ( " tiger " ) . She is fond of taking photos on her old SLR camera . Jumbo has yet to meet Torako and was quite apprehensive , assuming that she was male and Asagi 's boyfriend . Generally humorless and no @-@ nonsense , Torako was annoyed by Yotsuba at first , but she ended up liking her and now considers being around her " fun . " 
 Yanda ( <unk> ) , actual surname Yasuda ( <unk> ) 
 Yanda is a friend of Koiwai and Jumbo . Though he is mentioned in the first and fourth chapters , when Jumbo calls Yanda " no good " for making lame excuses for not helping the Koiwais move , he does not appear until chapter 30 . He is childish , as shown by the petty pranks he plays on Yotsuba , including bribing her with candy then taking it back when it does not work and prank @-@ calling her . He enjoys teasing Yotsuba and acting as her " nemesis " . Koiwai refers to Yanda as his kōhai , junior , but in what context he is Koiwai 's junior is unknown . He lives from paycheck to paycheck and eats instant ramen because he does not get paid until the end of the month , and only eats frozen meals the rest of the time . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) / " Miss Stake " ( <unk> , <unk> ) 
 A friend of Fuuka 's , given name unknown , who is in the same homeroom . Her first official appearance is in chapter 45 , when she visits Fuuka 's home and recognizes Yotsuba from her trip to their high school in chapter 40 . <unk> is a bit eccentric . Her nickname Miss Stake ( <unk> , <unk> ) comes from a " mistake " she made when she first introduced herself to her class ( in Japanese , <unk> used as an auxiliary verb can mean to do something by accident , hence the pun ) . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1998 , Azuma published a one @-@ shot manga and two webcomics called " Try ! Try ! Try ! " , in which Yotsuba , her father ( who is unnamed ) , Ena , Fuka , and Asagi first appeared . Although some of these characters , including Yotsuba herself , are largely the same as in Yotsuba & ! , Fuka has a different character design , a more mischievous personality , and a different spelling of her given name ( in " Try ! Try ! Try ! " , it is written with the kanji <unk> <unk> , meaning " wind @-@ summer " ; in Yotsuba & ! , it is <unk> <unk> , meaning " wind @-@ scent " ) .

 An anime " spin @-@ off " based on cat versions of Azuma 's character <unk> has been announced and is due to air in October 2016 as part of a " mini @-@ anime " program . This project will not adapt any of Yotsuba & ! . 
 Despite its popularity and the success of Azumanga Daioh , no plans have been announced for an anime adaptation of Yotsuba & ! . In an entry posted on his website on 15 May 2005 , Azuma said there were no plans for it to be animated ; he reiterated this on the 5 December 2008 , claiming that the stories and style of Yotsuba & ! are not well @-@ suited for animation . 
 = = = Manga = = = 
 The manga is written and illustrated by Kiyohiko Azuma , and published by ASCII Media Works in the monthly shōnen ( aimed at teenage boys ) manga magazine Dengeki Daioh since the March 2003 issue , with serialization on @-@ going . Chapters have been collected in thirteen tankōbon volumes . 
 In English , Yotsuba & ! was originally licensed by ADV Manga , who published five volumes between 2005 and 2007 before dropping the license . The North American license was picked up by Yen Press , which republished the first five volumes along with the sixth in September 2009 . All thirteen volumes have since been released . In addition , the series is licensed in France by Kurokawa , in Spain by Norma Editorial , in Germany by Tokyopop Germany , in Italy by Dynit , in Finland by <unk> <unk> , in Korea by Daiwon C.I. , in Taiwan by Kadokawa Media , in Vietnam by TVM Comics , and in Thailand by NED Comics . 
 Each chapter of Yotsuba & ! takes place on a specific , nearly sequential day of a common year starting on Wednesday . The year was initially believed to be 2003 , coinciding with the date of the manga 's serialization , but Azuma has stated that the manga always takes place in the present day . This allows the appearance of products created after 2003 , such as the Nintendo DS Mr. Ayase plays in chapter forty @-@ two . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Both monthly and daily Yotsuba & ! calendars have been released every year since 2005 , although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma 's schedule . The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions , zebras , and kangaroos . The 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon . The photographs were by Miho Kakuta , with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma . The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork , with occasional captions , as well as other fun items – for example , the 2006 calendar had a game of <unk> ongoing through the year . The daily calendars run from April to March , following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year . 
 The 2010 monthly calendar was released in November 2009 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Two Yotsuba & ! music CDs have been released , both purely instrumental , called " image albums " . The music is designed to elicit mental images of events described by the titles . Both albums are composed by Masaki Kurihara and performed by the <unk> Pops Orchestra , who also worked together on the Azumanga Daioh soundtrack . 
 The first album , Yotsuba & ♪ , released in April 2005 , follows Yotsuba throughout the course of a typical day . 
 The second album , Yotsuba & ♪ Music Suite ( General Winter ) , released in November 2006 , depicts the season of winter , including Christmas and New Year 's celebrations . " General Winter " ( <unk> , Fuyu Shōgun ) is a personification of harsh winters , similar to Jack Frost .

 A Yotsuba & ! picture book , Yotsuba & Monochrome Animals , was published on 16 December 2006 ( ISBN 978 @-@ 4 @-@ 8402 @-@ <unk> @-@ 7 ) . The book has pictures of Yotsuba playing with various black @-@ and @-@ white colored animals , such as pandas . The name of each animal is given in Japanese and English , along with the scientific classification of the species . Another book called Find Yotsuba was released in 2013 , which is actually a compilation of all the calendar illustrations released previously . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Yotsuba & ! is drawn not in the vertical four @-@ panel strips of Azuma 's earlier series , Azumanga Daioh , but in a full @-@ page format , giving him more artistic scope . Azuma 's work on Yotsuba & ! has been noted for its clean art , detailed backgrounds , and expressive faces . Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone , slice @-@ of @-@ life storytelling , comedic writing , and eccentric yet realistic characters , especially Yotsuba herself . 
 The Comics Reporter described the series as " read [ ing ] like a love letter to the way kids can be at the age of 2 – 5 , " and a reviewer at Anime News Network compared Azuma 's ability to capture " the wonder of childhood " to Bill Watterson 's in Calvin and Hobbes . Manga : The Complete Guide described it as " a light , feel @-@ good manga , like an endless summer day . " Nicholas <unk> of <unk> said " with Yotsuba , we find ourselves plunged into the wonderful world of childhood , " calling the French edition of volume eight , " A beautiful manga for children and adults . " BD Gest praised Azuma 's skill in making distinct secondary characters , calling them " immediately recognisable " , and saying that they each spice up the story in their own ways . However , Azuma has been criticized for creating characters that are " too clean , too perfectly functional , " for overusing " outrageous expressions and reactions , " and for dragging out jokes too long . 
 Yotsuba & ! has been popular with readers as well as reviewers . For example , on Amazon.co.jp , volume six was the third best @-@ selling comic in Japan for the first half of 2007 and volume eight was the second best @-@ selling comic in Japan for 2008 ; volumes seven and eight both were number two on the Tohan comics chart the week they debuted . Volume eight sold more than 450 @,@ 000 copies in 2008 , making it one of the top 50 bestselling manga volumes on the Oricon chart for the year . The first five volumes of the English translation were each among the top 100 selling graphic novels in the United States in the month of release . Volume six of the English edition reached number 3 on the New York Times best seller list for manga , and it stayed on the list for four weeks . Volume 8 debuted at No. 2 on the manga best seller list . 
 The series had sold a total of 13 million copies worldwide as of December 5 , 2015 , and 2 million of which are published outside of Japan , including the U.S. , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , Russia , Sweden , Finland , Korea , China , Taiwan , Indonesia , Thailand , and Vietnam .

 Yotsuba & ! received an Excellence Award for Manga at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival , where the jury citation praised the vivid characters and gentle atmosphere . In 2008 Yotsuba & ! was nominated for the 12th Osamu Tezuka Culture Award and the Eisner Award in the " Best Publication for Kids " category , but did not win either , and was runner @-@ up for the first annual Manga Taishō award . In 2016 , Yotsuba & ! won the Grand Prize at the 20th Osamu Tezuka Culture Awards , sharing it with Kei <unk> 's <unk> Sharaku . The English translation was listed as one of the best 20 comics of 2005 by Publishers Weekly , one of the best comics of 2006 by the staff of The Comics Journal , and one of the top graphic novels for teens in 2008 by YALSA . Volume one was named Book of the Month in the June 2005 issue of Newtype USA . 
 There was an exhibit of Yotsuba & ! artwork at the Gallery of Fantastic Art in Tokyo from 2 – 17 December 2006 . The lead article of the May 2009 issue of the Japanese design magazine Idea was a study of Yotsuba & ! , focusing on book design , interior layout , and how translated editions were handled . 
 = Menstrual cycle = 
 The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system like the uterus and ovaries that make pregnancy possible . The cycle is required for the production of <unk> , and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy . Up to 80 % of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation . Common symptoms include acne , tender breasts , bloating , feeling tired , irritability and mood changes . These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30 % of women . In 3 to 8 % , they are severe . 
 The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age , a point in time known as menarche . They may occasionally start as early as eight , and this onset may still be normal . The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world . The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults ( an average of 28 days ) . Menstruation stops occurring after menopause which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age . Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days . 
 The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes . These changes can be altered by using hormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy . Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary ( ovarian cycle ) or in the uterus ( uterine cycle ) . The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase , ovulation , and luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle is divided into menstruation , proliferative phase , and secretory phase . 
 Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase , discharges of blood ( menses ) flow stop , and the lining of the uterus thickens . Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones , and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant ( non @-@ dominant follicles shrink and die ) . Approximately mid @-@ cycle , 24 – 36 hours after the luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surges , the dominant follicle releases an <unk> , in an event called ovulation . After ovulation , the <unk> only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum ; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone . Under the influence of progesterone , the uterine lining changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy . If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks , the corpus luteum will involute , causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen . The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation . Menstruation also occurs in some other animals including shrews , bats , and other primates such as apes and monkeys . 
 = = Onset and frequency = = 
 The average age of menarche is 12 – 15 . They may occasionally start as early as eight , and this onset may still be normal . This first period often occurs later in the developing world than the developed world . 
 The average age of menarche is approximately 12 @.@ 5 years in the United States , 12 @.@ 7 in Canada , 12 @.@ 9 in the UK and 13 @.@ 1 years in Iceland . Factors such as genetics , diet and overall health can affect timing . 
 The cessation of menstrual cycles at the end of a woman 's reproductive period is termed menopause . The average age of menopause in women is 52 years , with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common . <unk> before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries . Like the age of menarche , the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors ; however , illnesses , certain surgeries , or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise . 
 The length of a woman 's menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat , with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles . A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles . It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of less than four days . Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately irregular cycles . Variation of 21 days or more between a woman 's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular . 
 The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days . The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest , that is , most regular , for ages 25 to 39 . Subsequently , the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44 . 
 The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is about the same length in most individuals ( mean 14 @.@ 13 days , SD 1 @.@ 41 days ) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability ( log @-@ normally distributed with 95 % of individuals having follicular phases between 10 @.@ 3 and 16 @.@ 3 days ) . The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age ( geometric mean 14 @.@ 2 days in women aged 18 – 24 vs. 10 @.@ 4 days in women aged 40 – 44 ) . 
 = = Health effects = = 
 Some women with neurological conditions experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle . For example , drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger migraines , especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill . Many women with epilepsy have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle ; this is called " catamenial epilepsy " . Different patterns seem to exist ( such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation , or coinciding with the time of ovulation ) , and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established . Using one particular definition , one group of scientists found that around one @-@ third of women with intractable partial epilepsy has catamenial epilepsy . An effect of hormones has been proposed , in which progesterone declines and estrogen increases would trigger seizures . Recently , studies have shown that high doses of estrogen can cause or worsen seizures , whereas high doses of progesterone can act like an antiepileptic drug . Studies by medical journals have found that women experiencing menses are 1 @.@ 68 times more likely to commit suicide . 
 Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function . During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest , the level of nerve @-@ cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high . Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory , nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors . During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels , the number of delta receptors decrease , increasing nerve cell activity , in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility . 
 Estrogen levels may affect thyroid behavior . For example , during the luteal phase ( when estrogen levels are lower ) , the velocity of blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase ( when estrogen levels are higher ) . 
 Among women living closely together , it was once thought that the onsets of menstruation tend to synchronize . This effect was first described in 1971 , and possibly explained by the action of pheromones in 1998 . Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question . 
 Research indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the pre @-@ ovulatory stage , than post @-@ ovulatory stage . 
 = = = Fertility = = = 
 The most fertile period ( the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse ) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation . In a 28 ‑ day cycle with a 14 ‑ day luteal phase , this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week . A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle ; these systems are called fertility awareness . 
 Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar @-@ based methods . Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs ( basal body temperature , cervical mucus , and cervical position ) are known as symptoms @-@ based methods . Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation ; these are known as ovulation predictor kits ( <unk> ) . Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures , urinary test results , or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors . 
 A woman 's fertility is also affected by her age . As a woman 's total egg supply is formed in fetal life , to be ovulated decades later , it has been suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems , breakage , and mutation than the chromatin of sperm , which are produced continuously during a man 's reproductive life . However , despite this hypothesis , a similar paternal age effect has also been observed . 
 As measured on women undergoing in vitro fertilization , a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates , even after age adjustment . Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days . A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality . 
 = = = Mood and behaviour = = = 
 The different phases of the menstrual cycle correlate with women ’ s moods . In some cases , hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females ; mild to severe mood changes can occur . The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women . The natural shift of hormone levels during the different phases of the menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores . When completing empathy exercises , women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase . A significant correlation between progesterone levels and the ability to accurately recognize emotion was found . Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels . Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts . Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage , perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase . Overall , it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits . 
 Fear response in women during two different points in the menstrual cycle has been examined . When estrogen is highest in the <unk> stage , women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating , which is when estrogen levels are lowest . The women were equally able to identify happy faces , demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response . To summarize , menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women ’ s fear processing . 
 However , the examination of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection . In comparison to levels of stress or physical health , the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood . This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood , on a day @-@ to @-@ day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do . 
 = = = = Eating behaviour = = = = 
 Females have been found to experience different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle , with food intake being higher during the luteal phase than the follicular phase . Food intake increases by approximately 10 % during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase . 
 Various studies have shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates , proteins and fats and that 24 @-@ hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2 @.@ 5 @-@ 11 @.@ 5 % . The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods , which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle . This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase . In particular , women tend to show a cravings for chocolate , with higher cravings during the luteal phase . 
 Females with premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) report changes in appetite across the menstrual cycle more than non @-@ sufferers of PMS , possibly due to their <unk> to changes in hormone levels . In women with PMS , food intake is higher in the luteal phase than follicular . The remaining symptoms of PMS , including mood changes and physical symptoms , also occur during the luteal phase . No difference for preference of food types has been found between PMS sufferers and non @-@ sufferers . 
 The different levels of ovarian hormones at different stages of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes . <unk> has been shown to promote fat storage , causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher . Additionally , with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline , a hormone which promotes eating , therefore decreasing appetite . In humans , the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating . 
 It is theorised that the use of birth control pills should affect eating behaviour as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels . The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought to play a role in food intake . Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size , among other things , and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones . 
 A number of factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes : age , weight loss and the diet itself . First , younger women are likely to experience menstrual irregularities due to their diet . Second , menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss . For example , anovulatory cycles can occur as a result of adopting a restricted diet , as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise . Finally , the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non @-@ vegetarian diet . 
 = = = = Substance abuse = = = = 
 Studies investigating effects of the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence . However , some evidence suggests that individuals consume more alcohol during the luteal stage , especially if these individuals are heavy drinkers or have a family history of alcohol abuse . 
 The level of substance abuse increases with PMS , mostly with addictive substances such as nicotine , tobacco and cocaine . One theory behind this suggests this higher level of substance abuse is due to decreased self @-@ control as a result of the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase . 
 = = = Menstrual disorders = = = 
 Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called <unk> . The absence of ovulation is called anovulation . Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it : an anovulatory cycle . In some cycles , follicular development may start but not be completed ; nevertheless , estrogens will be formed and stimulate the uterine lining . Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged , continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding . Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding . Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause ( perimenopause ) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . 
 Very little flow ( less than 10 ml ) is called <unk> . Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are <unk> ; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as <unk> . Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed <unk> . Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is <unk> . The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is <unk> . <unk> refers to more than three to six months without menses ( while not being pregnant ) during a woman 's reproductive years . 
 = = Cycles and phases = = 
 The menstrual cycle can be described by the ovarian or uterine cycle . The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus . Both cycles can be divided into three phases . The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase , ovulation , and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation , proliferative phase , and secretory phase . 
 = = = Ovarian cycle = = = 
 = = = = <unk> phase = = = = 
 The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle . During this phase , the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg . The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle . 
 Through the influence of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) during the first days of the cycle , a few ovarian follicles are stimulated . These follicles , which were present at birth and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as <unk> , compete with each other for dominance . Under the influence of several hormones , all but one of these follicles will stop growing , while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity . The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary , or <unk> , follicle , and it contains the ovum . 
 = = = = Ovulation = = = = 
 Ovulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct . During the follicular phase , estradiol suppresses production of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) from the anterior pituitary gland . When the egg has nearly matured , levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH . This process , known as the LH surge , starts around day 12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours . 
 The exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood . In animals , a gonadotropin @-@ releasing hormone ( GnRH ) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge , suggesting that estrogen 's main effect is on the hypothalamus , which controls GnRH secretion . This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus : estrogen receptor alpha , which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol @-@ LH loop , and estrogen receptor beta , which is responsible for the positive estradiol @-@ LH relationship . However , in humans it has been shown that high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH , even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant , suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge . 
 The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary , causing the fully developed follicle to release its secondary oocyte . The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an <unk> and then becomes a mature ovum . The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0 @.@ 2 mm . 
 Which of the two ovaries — left or right — ovulates appears essentially random ; no known left and right co @-@ ordination exists . Occasionally , both ovaries will release an egg ; if both eggs are fertilized , the result is fraternal twins . 
 After being released from the ovary , the egg is swept into the fallopian tube by the fimbria , which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube . After about a day , an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube . 
 Fertilization by a spermatozoon , when it occurs , usually takes place in the ampulla , the widest section of the fallopian tubes . A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of embryogenesis , or development . The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium . It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation . 
 In some women , ovulation features a characteristic pain called <unk> ( German term meaning middle pain ) . The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid @-@ cycle blood flow . 
 = = = = <unk> phase = = = = 
 The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle . During the luteal phase , the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum , which produces progesterone . The increased progesterone in the <unk> starts to induce the production of estrogen . The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself . Consequently , the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time , and the corpus luteum subsequently <unk> . Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle . From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin , the process typically takes about two weeks , with 14 days considered normal . For an individual woman , the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle ; by contrast , the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle . 
 The loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg . The <unk> , which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo @-@ containing structure ( the blastocyst ) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta , produces human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum . The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy . Most pregnancy tests look for the presence of hCG . 
 = = = Uterine cycle = = = 
 The uterine cycle has three phases . 
 = = = = Menstruation = = = = 
 Menstruation ( also called menstrual bleeding , menses , <unk> or a period ) is the first phase of the uterine cycle . The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become pregnant . ( However , this cannot be taken as certainty , as a number of factors can cause bleeding during pregnancy ; some factors are specific to early pregnancy , and some can cause heavy flow . ) 
 <unk> denotes normal , regular menstruation that lasts for a few days ( usually 3 to 5 days , but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal ) . The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10 – 80 ml considered normal . Women who experience <unk> are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the average person . An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid . 
 Painful cramping in the abdomen , back , or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation . Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as <unk> , and it is most common among adolescents and younger women ( affecting about 67 @.@ 2 % of adolescent females ) . When menstruation begins , symptoms of premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease . Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation . 
 = = = = <unk> phase = = = = 
 The proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow , or proliferate , during this time . As they mature , the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol , and estrogen . The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus , histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium . The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus , which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness . 
 = = = = Secretory phase = = = = 
 The secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle . During the secretory phase , the corpus luteum produces progesterone , which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy , by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus ; it also has the side effect of raising the woman 's basal body temperature . 
 = = Ovulation suppression = = 
 = = = Birth control = = = 
 While some forms of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle , hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it . <unk> negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin @-@ releasing hormone ( GnRH ) release by the hypothalamus , which decreases the release of follicle @-@ stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) by the anterior pituitary . Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development , preventing an increase in estradiol levels . <unk> negative feedback and the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid @-@ cycle LH surge . Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation . 
 The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen @-@ only contraceptives depends on the progestogen activity and dose . Low dose progestogen @-@ only contraceptives — traditional progestogen only pills , subdermal implants <unk> and <unk> , and intrauterine system <unk> — inhibit ovulation in about 50 % of cycles and rely mainly on other effects , such as thickening of cervical mucus , for their contraceptive effectiveness . Intermediate dose progestogen @-@ only contraceptives — the progestogen @-@ only pill <unk> and the subdermal implant <unk> — allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97 – 99 % of cycles . The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low @-@ dose progestogens . High @-@ dose , progestogen @-@ only contraceptives — the <unk> Depo @-@ Provera and <unk> — completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation . 
 Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen . Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH , which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation . Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding . Several combined hormonal contraceptives — the pill , <unk> , and the contraceptive patch — are usually used in a way that causes regular withdrawal bleeding . In a normal cycle , menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly . Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives ( a placebo week , not using patch or ring for a week ) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed . If withdrawal bleeding is not desired , combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously , although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding . 
 = = = Breastfeeding = = = 
 Breastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin @-@ releasing hormone ( GnRH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) . Depending on the strength of the negative feedback , breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development , but no ovulation , or normal menstrual cycle may resume . Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently . The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea . On average , women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum . There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women , however , with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining <unk> for up to 42 months postpartum . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Etymological = = = 
 The word " menstruation " is etymologically related to " moon " . The terms " menstruation " and " menses " are derived from the Latin <unk> ( month ) , which in turn relates to the Greek <unk> ( moon ) and to the roots of the English words month and moon . 
 = = = The Moon = = = 
 Even though the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle , in modern humans there is no relation between the two . The relationship is believed to be a coincidence . Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans . A meta @-@ analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle . 
 Dogon villagers did not have electric lighting and spent most nights outdoors , talking and sleeping ; so they were apparently an ideal population for detecting a lunar influence ; none was found . Other scholars counter , however , that the Dogon — unlike ancestral African hunter @-@ gatherer populations — are polygamous , meaning that reproductive synchrony would not be expected on theoretical grounds . 
 = = = Work = = = 
 In a number of countries , mainly in Asia , legislation or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid leave of absence from their employment while they are menstruating . Countries with policies include Japan , Taiwan , Indonesia , and South Korea . The practice is controversial due to it being seen to criticize women 's work efficiency , as well as being seen as possible sexism . 
 = Cowboys Are Frequently , Secretly Fond of Each Other = 
 " Cowboys Are Frequently , Secretly Fond of Each Other " ( 1981 ) is a song by Latin country musician Ned Sublette , whose music , according to Howard Cohen , features a " lilting West Texas waltz ( 3 / 4 time at about 60 – 90 beats per minute ) feel " . It is , according to Gene Tyranny , " the famous gay cowboy song " . The lyrics satirize the stereotypes associated with cowboys and gay men , such as in the lyrics relating western wear to the leather subculture with the line : " What did you think all them saddles and boots was about ? " 
 Country musician Willie Nelson 's cover ( iTunes single 14 February 2006 ) is the first LGBT @-@ themed mainstream country song by a major artist . The song has been recorded and released by Sublette ( GPS : Life is a Killer 1982 ) , Canadian alternative country band Lost Dakotas ( Cargo : Sun Machine , 1993 ) , and queercore band Pansy Division ( Lookout : Pile Up 1995 ) . 
 = = Original version = = 
 Sublette stated that the song is based on his experiences growing up in Portales , N.M. : " I sat down at the piano and … remembered what it felt like to feel different as a teenager , and the culture at that time , and I started to put those two things together and the song wrote itself " . The song was written during the Urban Cowboy fad while living with his wife in Manhattan next to a gay country bar on Christopher Street called Boots and Saddles . He explains , " Gay life in 1981 was very vibrant in those days . It was part of the culture of the city and cowboy imagery is a part of gay iconography . " He wrote the song with Nelson 's voice in mind : " I was at the beginning of my songwriting career … and used to like writing songs for my favorite voices . I 've been a Willie fan since the ' 60s . " 
 In 2006 , Ann Northrop of Gay USA described the lyrics as " the language of thirty years ago . " David Nahmod , however , stated that he felt the lyrics maintain currency and say " a lot about gender identity and heterosexual elitism " ; " The song aims to show Mr. Nelson 's support for gays , particularly to conservative country @-@ music fans , " and suggests that , in addition to other causes , he supports gay rights . 
 The reception of Sublette 's recording is hard to determine as the song was originally only available through the Dial @-@ A @-@ Poem , through which one could literally dial up a poem and listen on the phone . However , <unk> gave the album on which the song eventually appeared 4 ½ out of 5 stars . 
 = = Willie Nelson 's version = = 
 Nelson received a tape of the song from Saturday Night Live Band bassist Tony Garnier after performing on the show in the mid to late 1980s . According to Sublette , " Willie took it from there " though Nelson recently found that demo in a drawer among a stack of his own while recording unreleased songs for iTunes at his Spicewood , Texas home studio . Nelson says , " I thought it was the funniest goddamn song I 'd ever heard . I had it on the bus for 20 years , and people would come in and I 'd play it . When Brokeback Mountain come out , it just seemed like a good time to kick it out of the closet " . 
 There were plans to release the song on a future album and filming for the video featuring Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe occurred at Dallas ' gay cowboy bar , the Round Up Saloon ( in Oak Lawn ) , in February 2006 . Nelson 's publicist describes the release of the song , which debuted on Howard Stern 's satellite radio show : " Since everyone is talking about the acclaimed film Brokeback Mountain and its Academy Award nominations , Valentine 's Day seemed like the right time to let [ the song ] be heard . " Nelson appeared on the movie 's soundtrack with the traditional " He Was a Friend of Mine " which made the US charts at number 54 . 
 Nelson himself described the release in a prepared statement to Dallas Morning News : " The song 's been in the closet for 20 years . The timing 's right for it to come out . I 'm just opening the door . " The song 's release was encouraged by the coming out of his friend and tour manager of thirty years , David Anderson , two years ago . Says Anderson : " This song obviously has special meaning to me in more ways than one . I want people to know more than anything — gay , straight , whatever — just how cool Willie is and … his way of thinking , his tolerance , everything about him . " 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 Nelson 's version of the song is his highest charting solo single since his 1984 duet with Julio Iglesias " To All the Girls I 've Loved Before " ( number 5 ) , debuting at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart , which Nelson last appeared on with the Toby Keith duet " Beer for My Horses " . The song has also been well received by critics . Pitchfork Media 's Stephen M. Deusner rated the song four out of four stars despite calling it , " even more of a stunt than his reggae album " ( 2005 's Countryman ) . Saying that the song sounds written by Nelson , and that his performance raises the piece above the level of a cheap gag , he felt that it adds , " a whole new level of complexity to the outlaw mythology Willie helped to cultivate in the 70s . " 
 Nelson also says that he has received very few negative reactions : " Every now and then somebody might get a little offended . It 's got bad language in it , so I just don 't do it in my shows . Anybody wants to hear it can hear it on iTunes . But you know people are <unk> ' to it , likin ' it . Every now and then somebody don 't like it , but that 's okay . Similar to years ago , when the hippie thing come out and I started <unk> ' my hair and puttin ' the earring in , I got a little flak here and there . " 
 However , some sources speculate about the potential success and reception of the song . Nelson explains that he didn 't think , " it took a lot of balls to put the song out " saying , " first of all , I didn 't think anybody would play it . I didn 't think it would get on the air , but sure enough it did " though not on country stations : " Oh no , they 're not gonna play it " . 
 <unk> , a country station in Johnson City , Tenn . , devoted one morning show to a listener discussion of Nelson 's release , concluding that , " the audience was disappointed in [ Nelson ] " and , as Nelson thought , that they " probably wouldn 't be interested in much airplay " . <unk> offered the opinion that Nelson 's fan base is secure and broad enough ( including " hippies , rednecks and outlaws young and old " ) to take risks with LGBT @-@ themed songs and soundtracks , while the <unk> station manager pointed out that Nelson has not been a mainstream country star for a while . Nelson 's broad audience , and part of the appeal of the song , may be that , " Willie speaks his mind about any subject ... That 's one of those things that has made him so endearing to so many generations of fans " . 
 The song has been described variously as " deadpan " , " straight @-@ faced " , and " pointedly poignant " . Sublette , as expected , approves of Nelson 's performance and its potential impact , saying , " It 's supposed to be funny , that 's what gets people 's attention , but to get people to listen to it a second time [ you ] have to have something going on , and Willie beautifully brought out the tenderness there … [ It 's ] nice to have a funny song out there — it is challenging people to laugh . Everybody is so angry now . " Sublette speculated about the song 's reception : " Willie 's smart . We talked about recording it in the ' 90s but we needed some kind of context . It wouldn 't make sense to just put this on some normal Willie album … The movie provided the context . I don 't know if the public is any more or less ready than they were but I think the media is more ready . " 
 The song was featured in a Boondocks comic strip on 27 and 28 February and mentioned until March 2006 . According to Sublette , " the Monday and Tuesday strip consisted of my lyrics and dramatizing listeners ' response to my lyrics . What a compliment ! " 
 The reception of Nelson 's song may be compared to that of Garth Brooks ' 1992 single " We Shall Be Free " . The song 's line , " when we 're free to love anyone we choose " caused some radio stations to refuse to play the song , contributing to its peak at number 12 on Billboard 's country singles chart and marking the end of Brooks ' string of top ten hits . Nelson 's song has been lumped together with contemporaneous LGBT friendly country releases : his and Emmylou Harris 's appearance on the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack and the Dolly Parton 's song " Travelin ' Thru " appearing on the Transamerica soundtrack , for which she received an Oscar nomination . 
 When the song appeared as the penultimate track on Nelson 's 2009 compilation Lost Highway , it was followed by a previously unreleased version of Willie singing Ben <unk> 's Ain 't Goin ' Down On Brokeback Mountain , which includes the lyric , " ... that shit ain 't right . " 
 = Pondicherry shark = 
 The Pondicherry shark ( Carcharhinus hemiodon ) is an extremely rare species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae . A small and stocky gray shark , it grows not much longer than 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) , and it has a fairly long , pointed snout . This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth , which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth @-@ edged near the tip , and by its first dorsal fin , which is large with a long free rear tip . Furthermore , this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins , second dorsal fin , and caudal fin lower lobe . 
 The Pondicherry shark was once found throughout Indo @-@ Pacific coastal waters from the Gulf of Oman to New Guinea , and is known to enter fresh water . Currently , the only known sightings of this species since the 1980s are in rivers in Sri Lanka . Fewer than 20 specimens are available for study , and most aspects of its natural history are unknown . It probably feeds on bony fishes , cephalopods , and crustaceans , and gives birth to live young with the embryos forming a placental connection to their mother . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered . It is probably threatened by intense and escalating fishing pressure throughout its range . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first scientific description of the Pondicherry shark was authored by German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen . Their account was based on a 47 cm ( 19 in ) long immature male from Puducherry ( formerly Pondicherry ) , India and three more paratypes from the same region . Müller and Henle attributed the name for the new species , Carcharias ( Hypoprion ) hemiodon , to French zoologist Achille Valenciennes . The specific epithet hemiodon is derived from the Greek hemi ( " half " ) and odon ( " tooth " ) . 
 In 1862 , Theodore Gill elevated Hypoprion to the rank of full genus and also placed the Pondicherry shark in its own genus , <unk> , based on the relative positions of the dorsal and pectoral fins . Subsequent authors generally accepted Gill 's first revision but not his second , and thus this species became known as Hypoprion hemiodon . In 1985 , Jack Garrick followed up on earlier taxonomic work by Leonard Compagno and synonymized Hypoprion with Carcharhinus . Another common name for the Pondicherry shark is long nosed shark .

 The evolutionary relationships of the Pondicherry shark are uncertain . In a 1988 study based on morphological data , Compagno tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark ( C. porosus ) , blackspot shark ( C. sealei ) , spottail shark ( C. sorrah ) , creek whaler ( C. fitzroyensis ) , whitecheek shark ( C. dussumieri ) , Borneo shark ( C. borneensis ) , and hardnose shark ( C. macloti ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Pondicherry shark has a robust build and a moderately long , pointed snout . The large and circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes . Each nostril is broad with a small , narrow nipple @-@ shaped lobe on the anterior rim . The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners . The upper and lower jaws contain 14 – 15 and 12 – 14 tooth rows on either side respectively ; in addition , there are one or two rows of small teeth at the upper and lower symphyses ( jaw midpoints ) . The upper teeth have a single narrow , smooth @-@ edged central cusp , flanked on both sides by very large serrations . The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers , and may be smooth to finely serrated . The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long . 
 Originating below the fourth pair of gill slits , the pectoral fins are short , broad , and falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) with pointed tips . The first dorsal fin is tall and falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip , and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases . The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip , and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin . Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins , and when present the ridge is slight . The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent @-@ shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin . The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well @-@ developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip . 
 The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles ; each denticle has three horizontal ridges leading to three ( rarely five ) marginal teeth . This species is gray above and white below , with an obvious pale stripe on the flanks . The pectoral fins , second dorsal fin , and lower caudal fin lobe are prominently tipped in black , while the first dorsal fin and dorsal caudal fin lobe are narrowly edged in black . The maximum size reached by the Pondicherry shark is uncertain due to a lack of large specimens , but is probably not much greater than 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Pondicherry shark appears to have been broadly distributed in the Indo @-@ Pacific . It may have once been common , as it was reportedly a regular catch off India and Pakistan , but is now extremely rare . Most of the known specimens were collected from India , with more specimens from the Gulf of Oman , Borneo , and Java . There are also less reliable records from the South China Sea , other parts of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines , New Guinea , and northern Australia . This species inhabits inshore waters . Several older sources reported that it could be found in rivers such as the <unk> River and the Saigon River . These reports may have confused a river shark ( <unk> sp . ) for the Pondicherry shark ; if accurate , they would suggest this species to be tolerant of low salinity . As of 2016 , these reports have been confirmed ; the only documented Pondicherry sharks in the 21st century were found in the Sri Lankan Menik River . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The diet of the Pondicherry shark is thought to consist of small bony fishes , cephalopods , and crustaceans . A parasite documented from this species is the tapeworm Acanthobothrium <unk> . Like other requiem sharks , it is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to the mother , though specific details are unknown . The smallest known specimen is a female 32 cm ( 13 in ) long , which may be close to the birth size . Sexual maturity is attained at a length of over 60 cm ( 24 in ) . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Harmless to humans , the Pondicherry shark was caught and used for meat . Fewer than 20 specimens have been deposited in museum collections , most of which were collected prior to 1900 . This shark 's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct . However , in 2016 , the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and <unk> rivers . Two photographs of this species exist ; one taken from above by a group of nature <unk> , as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey . Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy , unregulated , and intensifying , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered and placed a high priority on locating any surviving populations . 
 = Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore = 
 Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore guarantees to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law . The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion , race , descent and place of birth – upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons . For example , discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . 
 Persons unable to show that one of the forbidden classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection . To succeed , they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test , which is a three @-@ stage test formulated by the courts . The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals . At the second stage , the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia or distinguishing feature . Finally , the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . However , the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate . The rational nexus test , as it is currently applied in Singapore , also tolerates over- and under @-@ inclusive classifications . It remains to be seen if local courts will consider other approaches to the issue , such as the three @-@ tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States , the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law , or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia . 
 The rational nexus test does not apply where a statute treats all persons equally , but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner . Instead , a modified rational nexus test is used , which requires a court to consider whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law . Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination . It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency , unless this occurs on a very substantial scale . In addition , inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . 
 Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion .

 Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore is entitled " Equal protection " and reads as follows : 
 12 . — ( 1 ) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law . 
 ( 2 ) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution , there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition , holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . 
 ( 3 ) This Article does not invalidate or prohibit — 
 ( a ) any provision regulating personal law ; or 
 ( b ) any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . 
 In the 1998 decision Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong , the Court of Appeal regarded the concept of equality as a component of the wider doctrine of the rule of law , and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states : " To none will we sell , to none will we deny , to none will we delay right or justice . " Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying " to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws " , and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying " to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India " . Article 12 ( 1 ) is identical to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Constitution of Malaysia , from which it was adopted following Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 . 
 In Lim Meng <unk> v. Attorney @-@ General ( 2013 ) , the High Court noted that the concept of equality before the law is derived from English common law which requires all classes of persons to be equally subject to the law , while the concept of equal protection of the law stems from the US Constitution 's Fourteenth Amendment and guarantees both procedural and substantive equality . The Court said : 
 It will be seen that equality before the law and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine – equal justice . The first expresses the immutable principle of equal subjection of all classes of persons to the law , and the second is the positive aspect of that principle which reaches out , when invoked , to strike down unequal laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional and void .

 = = = Forbidden classifications = = = 
 Article 12 ( 2 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against Singapore citizens ( unlike Article 12 ( 1 ) which applies to " all persons " ) " on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth " in the following situations : 
 In any law . 
 In the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority . 
 In the administration of any law relating to ( 1 ) the acquisition , holding or disposition of property ; or ( 2 ) the establishing or carrying on of any trade , business , profession , vocation or employment . 
 The word only raises the possibility that discrimination may be permissible on the basis of one of the proscribed grounds in combination with some other factor , such as age or state of health . 
 Article 12 ( 2 ) is subject to an express contrary authorization by the Constitution . Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure that members of the Malay , Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) . Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates , at least one of whom must be from a minority community . Article 39A ( 3 ) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12 . 
 Another provision that is rescued from potential invalidity by Article 12 ( 2 ) is the Government 's constitutional mandate to exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the Malays , who are the indigenous people of Singapore . The Government has a responsibility to " protect , safeguard , support , foster and promote their political , educational , religious , economic , social and cultural interests and the Malay language " . The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate Muslim religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the President concerning matters relating to Islam . The legislation in question is the Administration of Muslim Law Act . 
 = = = Other discriminatory classifications : the rational nexus test = = = 
 <unk> persons who cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by Article 12 ( 2 ) may try to argue that they are a member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . The rational nexus test , also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification , is a three @-@ stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory . The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept ; it does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Consequently , a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances , and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law . If there is no such relationship , the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid . 
 = = = = History = = = = 
 In 1909 , the Supreme Court of the United States propounded a test to determine the reasonableness of a classification , stating that the classification " must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made " . Based on this principle , the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two @-@ stage test to determine if a classification made by a law was constitutional . The relevant stages were ( 1 ) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia ; and ( 2 ) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question . 
 The Federal Court of Malaysia later adapted the rational nexus test by including an additional preceding stage , namely , whether the law was discriminatory . This three @-@ stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor ( 1996 ) . 
 = = = = Stages of the test = = = = 
 The test that is currently followed in Singapore was re @-@ expressed by the Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong ( 1998 ) as comprising three stages : 
 Whether the law differentiates – that is , prescribes different treatment – amongst classes of individuals . 
 Whether the differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia ( distinguishing feature ) . 
 Whether the basis of differentiation bears a reasonable relation to the object of the statute . 
 The purpose of the test is to ensure that the right to equal protection is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness . First , individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily . Secondly , the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary . Lastly , the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action . The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness . As such , a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional . 
 = = = = = Stage 1 : Whether the law differentiates = = = = = 
 The first stage of the test considers whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups . For example , in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor , Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the Prevention of Corruption Act differentiated between classes of people as it renders some , but not all , persons open to criminal prosecution in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore . 
 While earlier cases expressed this stage of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory , the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination . A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people . A discriminatory law or executive act , on the other hand , is one that contravenes Article 12 ( 1 ) and hence is unconstitutional . Therefore , the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory , as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration . If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure , it is a good law and the objection fails . 
 Even if a differentiating measure is found , there is a strong presumption that it is constitutional . The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy . Unless the law is plainly arbitrary , suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality . It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people , and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems , hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds . Therefore , to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily . 
 = = = = = Stage 2 : <unk> differentia = = = = = 
 The second stage of the rational nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group . To satisfy the second stage , there must be a discernible basis of classification . All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against . Examples of such features include gender , age , race , religion , seniority of professional qualification and area of residence . Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship . Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself , but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects , does not constitute classification . If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently , the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid . If there is an intelligible differentia , the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage . 
 Equality under Article 12 ( 1 ) does not require that all persons are treated alike , but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike . Similarly , failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality . As such , at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally . Article 12 ( 1 ) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others . However , the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against , and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against . The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution , whereas all non @-@ citizens are equally immune from it . The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where all members of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally . 
 = = = = = Stage 3 : Reasonable relation to statutory objective = = = = = 
 In this stage , it is necessary to inquire into , firstly , the object of the statute , and secondly , whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object . The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable , taking into consideration the object of the statute , to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation . As such , it is necessary to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute . The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved , and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional . 
 In Taw Cheng Kong , the respondent challenged his conviction for corruption on the ground that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act , which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens ( but not non @-@ citizens ) occurring outside Singapore , discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non @-@ citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act 's object , which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it . The exclusion of non @-@ citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations . 
 = = = = Criticisms of the test = = = = 
 = = = = = Unreasonable legislative objectives = = = = = 
 In equal protection cases , the purpose of the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged . When the purpose of the law is not explicitly stated , the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose , assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it , or draw some inferences as to what it is . When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated , the court may either accept it at face value ; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration , looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose . In the latter situation , what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation . The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the " <unk> aspects of judicial review " , because it must either " uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value " or " challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference " . The court must then " make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end " . 
 This step is necessary because the rational nexus test is not foolproof . The test is based on the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution . However , if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate , a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test . Hence , the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one . 
 In India , a solution was proffered by means of a more holistic approach to the constitutional promise of equality . In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India ( 1978 ) , the learned Justice <unk> Natwarlal Bhagwati noted that " an essential element of equality pervades Article 14 " , the equivalent of Singapore 's Article 12 . With that as a starting point , he went on to assert that " the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary " . The judge in Maneka Gandhi therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality , one that should not be " subjected to a narrow , pedantic or lexicographic approach " . This more liberal approach , which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives , was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan ( 1996 ) . It is unclear , though , if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter . 
 = = = = = <unk> and under @-@ inclusiveness = = = = = 
 Another problem encountered when applying the rational nexus test is that of over- and under @-@ inclusiveness . Under @-@ inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law . On the other hand , over @-@ inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective , but also persons outside it . Both over- and under @-@ inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test , as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires . 
 It has been argued that this results in the different treatment of persons in like situations , and thus violates Article 12 ( 1 ) . Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object , the effect of an under @-@ inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed . However , the courts have often justified under @-@ inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm , to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest , and to advance its policies step by step . Despite this , resort to legislative wisdom to justify under @-@ inclusiveness , if used indiscriminately , may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12 ( 1 ) . 
 Similarly , where an over @-@ inclusive classification is concerned , a rational relation still exists between the differentia adopted and the legislative object . Thus , it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore . While the effect of an over @-@ inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed , courts have nonetheless justified it on the ground that the exigencies of the situation require such classification . The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States ( 1943 ) is an example of this principle . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring , among other things , all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be " within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. " and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area . The defendant , Gordon Hirabayashi , was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement . The order was arguably over @-@ inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty . Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens solely on the basis of ancestry " are , by their very nature , odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality " , because the US was at war with Japan the race @-@ based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order , which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack . The Court said : " We cannot close our eyes to the fact , demonstrated by experience , that , in time of war , residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry . " 
 In Taw Cheng Kong , the High Court was of the view that section 37 ( 1 ) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over @-@ inclusive . It did not apply to non @-@ Singapore citizens such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore . On the other hand , it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction that had nothing to do with Singapore . For this reason , Karthigesu J. found section 37 ( 1 ) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37 ( 1 ) ' s objective was not reasonable enough to justify <unk> from Article 12 ( 1 ) . The High Court 's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal , which held that the under @-@ inclusiveness was not fatal because of the " overriding need to observe international comity " . In any case , " [ t ] he enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency . Such a demand would be legislatively impractical , if not impossible . " The over @-@ inclusiveness of section 37 ( 1 ) was deemed irrelevant to the constitutional issue because the provision applied equally to all Singapore citizens . 
 = = = = Applications of the rational nexus test = = = = 
 The rational nexus test was applied in Mohamed <unk> bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor ( 2008 ) , in which the High Court was faced with the issue of whether the failure to prosecute drug enforcement authorities in an entrapment case amounted to discrimination against the persons eventually charged with drug trafficking . The Court found that there was a " perfectly rational nexus between entrapment operations and the socially desirable and laudable objective of containing the drug trade " as convicting state agents who carried out covert operations would result in illicit drug suppliers prospering and flourishing while enforcement agencies would " wither and perish " . Further , the exercise of the Attorney @-@ General 's prosecutorial discretion was an executive act which satisfied the rational nexus test and was therefore not in contravention of Article 12 of the Constitution . 
 In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor ( 2010 ) , the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes . In that case , the differentiating factor was found in the Misuse of Drugs Act ( " MDA " ) , which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than 15 grams ( 0 @.@ 53 oz ) of <unk> ( heroin ) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction . Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor ( 2005 ) , which had applied Ong Ah Chuan , the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15 @-@ gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA . The Court also noted that the " quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market , but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and , hence , broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender 's crime . " Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case , the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong . 
 = = = = Alternatives to the rational nexus test = = = = 
 In other jurisdictions , courts have applied standards of judicial review more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional . It remains to be seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally . 
 = = = = = Three @-@ tiered scrutiny = = = = = 
 In footnote 4 of United States v. <unk> Products Co . ( 1938 ) , Justice Harlan F. Stone opined that where legislation was aimed at " discrete and insular minorities " who lack the normal protections of the political process , a more exacting standard of judicial review with no presumption of constitutionality should be applied . 
 At present in the United States there are three different levels of scrutiny . Firstly , if a law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin ( which are regarded as suspect classifications ) , or infringes a fundamental right , strict scrutiny is applied . Accordingly , the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest . In addition , there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest . Secondly , if the law categorizes on the basis of gender , legitimacy or similar quasi @-@ suspect classifications , intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest . Finally , the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other , non @-@ suspect , basis . In this case , the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest . 
 In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court of Malaysia referred to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not very different from the traditional rational nexus standard , which it then proceeded to apply . The Court 's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. <unk> Menon ( 1990 ) . It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights , and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review . As such , the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia . 
 There are several criticisms of the three @-@ tiered scrutiny analysis , the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being that it does not control judicial discretion : the identification of classifications as suspect , quasi @-@ suspect or non @-@ suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests , and political and social interests .

 The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it . 
 The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective . 
 It has been suggested that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three @-@ tiered scrutiny approach . The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over @-@ inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test . 
 = = = = = Test of reasonableness = = = = = 
 In Maneka Gandhi , Bhagwati J. appeared to suggest that the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution , which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law , because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision . He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested . In his view , the principle of reasonableness was an essential element of equality or non @-@ arbitrariness , and it pervaded Article 14 " like a brooding omnipresence " . 
 A test of reasonableness was applied to Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases , but it was later rejected by the Federal Court in <unk> <unk> Sdn . Bhd. v. <unk> Sdn . Bhd . ( 2004 ) . The Court noted that in cases subsequent to Maneka Gandhi the reasonable classification test had been applied , even by Bhagwati J. himself . Furthermore , equality under Article 8 ( 1 ) does not mean absolute equality , but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances . The rational nexus test is needed to determine if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group , and is therefore an " integral part " of Article 8 ( 1 ) . 
 = = Discriminatory application of laws = = 
 The traditional Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test is inappropriate where the issue is not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute , but discriminatory application of a neutral statute . This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons ( stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test ) will always be in the negative . In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney @-@ General ( 2009 ) , Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang , delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal , applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test , holding that " [ t ] he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law " . 
 Phang J.A. relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1980 ) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor ( 1990 ) , drawing the following salient points from them : 
 An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination . Thus , an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , though " something less might perhaps suffice " . 
 However , absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from " the application of a reasonable administrative policy " or " mere errors of judgement " are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12 ( 1 ) . <unk> due to " inadvertence or inefficiency " need to be on " a very substantial scale " to violate the Article . 
 Thio Li @-@ ann has expressed the view that Phang J.A. ' s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification . An important question is whether the " intentional and arbitrary discrimination " test , which implies the lack of any rationality , is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12 , or only one possible test . If it is the only test , then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy , compared to the " reasonable classification " test . She posits that it is preferable for both the " intentional and arbitrary discrimination " test and the " reasonable classification " test to apply to executive acts . 
 = = Restrictions on the right to equality and equal protection = = 
 Article 12 ( 3 ) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law ; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion , or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion , to persons professing that religion . 
 Personal law is the law governing a person 's family matters . In <unk> bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah <unk> <unk> bin Talib ( 2009 ) , the High Court identified a number of personal laws , including the <unk> Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims ; and regulations 103 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the Prisons Regulations , which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government , and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period . 
 A number of private Acts establishing religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions . For instance , a person may only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board , which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments , if he or she is Hindu . Similarly , one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board , which manages gurdwaras ( Sikh temples ) in Singapore , if one professes the Sikh faith . 
 Article 149 ( 1 ) <unk> the Internal Security Act from invalidity due to inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution , including Article 12 . The reference to Article 12 in Article 149 ( 1 ) was enacted by Parliament in 1989 to reverse the effect of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12 ( 1 ) . 
 = = Other constitutional provisions = = 
 Article 16 ( 1 ) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion , race , descent or place of birth in the administration of public educational institutions ( and , in particular , as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees ) , and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution . This provision is stated to be " [ w ] ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12 " . Article 16 ( 2 ) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions , but there must not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws . 
 Article 154 states that all persons who are in the same Government service grade must be treated impartially regardless of their race , subject to the terms and conditions of their employment and to other provisions of the Constitution . 
 The Constitution also establishes a procedure for ensuring that statutes do not contain " differentiating measures " , that is , measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community . Most bills that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non @-@ elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights ( PCMR ) , which must report to the Speaker of Parliament if it is of the view that any clause in a bill contains a differentiating measure . If the PCMR submits an adverse report , Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval , or decide to present the bill for the President 's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two @-@ thirds of all Members of Parliament . The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970 .

 = Better Out Than In = 
 Better Out Than In was a residency undertaken by pseudonymous graffiti artist and political activist Banksy in New York City during October 2013 . Banksy unveiled at least one work of art daily , documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account . The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political , a distinctive characteristic of Banksy . Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire . 
 The unpredictability of the show and Banksy 's elusive nature stirred excitement amongst fans , while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem . While Banksy 's works were inherently illegal , no official complaints were reported to the police ; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it . The month @-@ long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces , and received mixed reviews from critics . In 2014 , a documentary film called Banksy Does New York came out regarding the whole ' residency ' . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 1 October 2013 , Banksy announced on his website that he would be attempting to host a show in New York City for the entire month . This came after posters promoting an October event started showing up in Los Angeles . 
 The title Better Out Than In is a reference to a quote by impressionist Paul Cézanne , " All pictures painted inside , in the studio , will never be as good as those done outside . " 
 In an interview with The Village Voice , Banksy said " New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse . We all want to prove ourselves here , " and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places . 
 = = Works = = 
 The works Banksy has included in Better Out Than In primarily consist of stencil graffiti , much of which are political in nature . His first installment , which he captioned " the street is in play " , depicted a child reaching for a bottle of spray paint on a sign reading " graffiti is a crime " . The sign was stolen and later replaced by Queens @-@ based graffiti group Smart Crew with a new sign that read " street art is a crime " . Like most of his other works , the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll @-@ free 800 number . 
 On 2 October , Banksy stenciled a piece in Chelsea that read " This is my New York accent " in the traditional typography of New York street art and below in a more typical handwriting style read , " ... normally I write like this " . Allowing for the ironic abstraction between traditional graffiti style and regular writing . 
 In south Midtown Manhattan on 3 October , Banksy produced a piece that depicts the symbiotic relationship between a dog and a hydrant . This stencil artwork depicts a dog urinating on a hydrant with a thought bubble saying , " you complete me " . 
 On 4 October Banksy added " the musical " below seemingly already existing graffiti in the Lower East Side , Williamsburg , and Bushwick . Making them read " Occupy ! The Musical " , " Dirty underwear The Musical " and " Playground Mob The Musical " . 
 In the East Village , Banksy 's fifth work was housed in a delivery truck as a " mobile garden , " which included theatrical property showing a rainbow , waterfall and butterflies . The following day Banksy posted a photo of a tracking device he found under the vehicle . 
 Banksy 's installments are located all across the five boroughs , with some being purely multimedia exhibits . On 6 October , as a way to have made an installment in Dumbo , Brooklyn , a primary arts district of the city , Banksy posted a video featuring the Walt Disney character Dumbo being shot down by Syrian rebels , the meaning behind which puzzled many . 
 On 7 October Banksy unveiled a piece in Red Hook that stood out from his typical stencils . The piece was a beautifully shaded red heart balloon patched up with band @-@ aids . An homage to a piece he had done previously in response to the Syrian conflict which depicted a heart shaped balloon floating away from a little girl . 
 On 8 October , Banksy 's piece in Greenpoint was simply a quote , " I have a theory that you can make any sentence seem profound by writing the name of a dead philosopher at the end of it <unk> " . 
 On 9 October , Banksy unveiled one of the more elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series . It featured armed soldiers and horses spray @-@ painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side . Instead of commentary about the work , the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12 , 2007 Baghdad airstrike . After being dismantled , the car was towed away to prevent further defacement . 
 In East New York on 10 October a Banksy piece was found depicting a stenciled beaver who seemingly caused a street sign to fall . Indicative of people 's greed there were soon men charging the people to view and take pictures of the artwork . 
 Day 11 saw an elaborate political display questioning the " casual cruelty " of the meat industry . Entitled Sirens of the Lambs , Banksy drove around a military @-@ style cargo truck filled with squealing , stuffed animatronic livestock . The truck fittingly made its debut in Meatpacking District , Manhattan , but toured the rest of the city in the following weeks . 
 On 12 October the ' Concrete Confessional ' piece was done on 7th Street near the Cooper Union , depicting a religious figure framed by a hole in the concrete wall standing in front of it . 
 On 13 October , Banksy made headlines when it was revealed that the art an older man was selling outside Central Park was actually authentic , signed Banksy canvases , sold for only $ 60 each . Having not announced this beforehand , tourists and park goers were unaware of the value the paintings had , which the BBC estimated could be upwards of $ 32 @,@ 000 each . Banksy posted a video on his website chronicling the surprise sale , which revealed that a total of seven paintings were sold for $ 420 taking . 
 On day 14 Banksy made a piece in Queens depicting a stenciled cleaner wiping a quote from the movie Gladiator " What we do in life echoes in Eternity " . 
 Banksy unveiled one of his most controversial pieces of the series on 15 October , with a depiction of the Lower Manhattan skyline featuring the former Twin Towers , with a burnt @-@ orange chrysanthemum in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower . The silhouette appeared on the side of a building in TriBeCa , with an identical depiction along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade , facing the downtown skyline . The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city , requiring chemicals and a high @-@ powered pressure washer . The removal followed a taunt Banksy had directed toward the city on his website . Meanwhile , the sister piece in TriBeCa served as a shrine , people placing flowers next to it and as well as a letter asking no one to touch the painting . <unk> glass was eventually installed to protect the piece , before someone painted over it . 
 Banksy extended his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements , including on 16 October , when he crafted a giant fiberglass sculpture of Ronald McDonald , with a real live Banksy assistant shining its shoes . It was unveiled in the Bronx but was moved outside of a different McDonald 's restaurant across the city around lunch time for several days . The work criticized the " heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega @-@ corporation " , as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it . 
 On 17 October in East Williamsburg , Banksy 's Japanese Bridge piece was revealed and graffitied over . 
 On 18 October there was a pair of paintings Banksy collaborated on with Os <unk> depicting a single soldier amongst masked citizens and vice versa . " The audio commentary Banksy provided suggests that this piece functions both as situational criticism of the art world as well as a tribute to the Occupy movement . Yet it also recognizes that the installation may be unsuccessful at actually advancing any agenda " . 
 On 19 October Banksy released another video for his tour of New York potentially to convey the movement in nature that we are blind to but it is truly just a vagina with ants crawling out of it . 
 On 20 October in the Upper West Side , Banksy stencilled a picture of a young boy with a hammer swinging down towards a fire hydrant . This piece was one of the few from the Better Out Than In project that was preserved . The owners of the store on which this piece was placed put a fiberglass pane in order to protect and preserve the piece . 
 Banksy 's second trip to the South Bronx was on 21 October and resulted in a piece depicting a child spray @-@ painting the words " Ghetto 4 Life " on a wall , while a butler waited on him with a platter of spray paints . The work immediately drew a crowd from fans , despite angering many residents , who found the message offensive . The piece may insinuate appreciation of graffiti art by high society . 
 The Sphinx sculpture appeared on a worksite in Willets Point on 22 October and was quickly swarmed by eager Banksy fans . The attention caught the workers interest and onlookers watched as it was loaded into a truck and taken away . The fate of this piece was heavily chronicled by the HBO documentary Banksy Does New York . The piece was taken from its original site , kept in a garage and ultimately sold in an art show for hundreds of thousands if not millions . 
 The 23rd installment was cancelled due to police activity , according to Banksy 's official website , which stirred rumors that he had come under arrest . That same day , an outlined canvas with the caption " Better Out Than In # <unk> " appeared on a building in Red Hook . The idea of an open @-@ canvas collaborative piece was presented to Banksy two weeks prior by a community art director . The story then lead many to believe the " anonymous guestbook " was outlined by Banksy himself , however this was later debunked to have been the work of a group under the name Anonymous <unk> . 
 " Waiting in Vain " was the show 's 24th installment . Located outside a strip club in Hell 's Kitchen , it illustrated a man in a tuxedo holding flowers , presumably jilted by his date . After some of the club 's entertainers posed in front of the piece , the owner had it carefully cut from the shutter gate before vandals could deface it . It is planned to go on permanent display inside the club . 
 The 25th piece came suitably Halloween @-@ themed . Located on the Bowery , it exhibited a Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show , fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult 's ( Don 't Fear ) The Reaper . The accompanying audio guide offered a self @-@ mockery interpretation , with Banksy stating that often " the role of art is to remind us of our mortality , " implying that with this mounted art show that goes on " for so long we wish we were dead already . " The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop , some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months . This prompted other interpretations of the installations message , paying homage to the " ghosts of <unk> , " as the antique store owner suggested . 
 On 26 October Banksy 's work appeared in Sunset Park of the back of a truck and read , " The grumpier you are , the more assholes you meet ... " which was ultimately removed and sold in auction . 
 The 27 October piece was a message on a wall in Greenpoint that read " This site contains blocked messages . " It made reference to an unpublished column Banksy had submitted to The New York Times . The controversial essay criticized the city 's decision in approving the One World Trade Center , which he described as " vanilla " and looking like " something they would build in Canada . " In what became his second reference to the September 11 attacks , Banksy argued the building was a betrayal to everyone who lost their lives that day , and that its blandness is a sign the terrorist won . 
 Day 28 came with a simple stencil in Coney Island of a robot spray @-@ painting a barcode onto the wall . 
 On 29 October Banksy 's art was displayed in a shop window , unbeknownst to the owners . Banksy had purchased a very basic painting of a landscape , added his own special touch in the form of a Nazi in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view , and donated it back to the store , drastically increasing their patronage for the day . 
 On day 30 Banksy 's art could be found on Yankee Stadium in the form of a jaguar draped on a line on the wall . This piece was quickly covered up . 
 The final piece of the month @-@ long series was a group of balloons that together read " <unk> ! " , tied to the wall of a building alongside the Long Island Expressway in Queens . Banksy included the message " Save <unk> " in the caption for the piece on his website , referring to 5 <unk> , a nearby outdoor art exhibit considered to be a focal point of such culture that had recently been approved by the New York City Department of City Planning to be demolished to make way for condominiums . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Most of the works that make up the Better Out Than In series were defaced , some just hours after the piece was unveiled . At least one defacement was identified as done by a competing artist , <unk> NYC , who spray @-@ painted over Banksy 's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook . <unk> NYC also defaced some of Banksy 's work in May 2010 . 
 As a result of the continued defacement , fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced . A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York , charging money for people to take photographs . Some took matters into their own hands by guarding the works , others restoring them once defaced . In part because of the defacement , but also because of the great value of the artworks , property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art . Some hired security guards , others covered the art with acrylic glass , and yet others installed metal roll @-@ down gates . 
 = = Response = = 
 The month @-@ long show was widely publicized and covered by the media . Mayor Michael Bloomberg , while supporting the arts , criticized Banksy 's work , calling him a vandal , contending that defacing property was not his definition of art . 
 On 17 October the New York Post wrote under the front @-@ page headline " Get Banksy ! " that police were pursuing Banksy , but noted the hunt is difficult because he has never been positively identified in public . In response Banksy posted an image of the front page on his website with the caption " I don 't read what i believe in the papers . " The NYPD later denied they were actively looking for Banksy as no property owners had filed any formal complaints . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz , Jr. called Banksy a " modern @-@ day Picasso " and praised him for choosing to unveil his 16 October Ronald McDonald replica in the South Bronx . This came before Banksy 's 21 October piece , which brought discontent to the President and other residents . The piece featured a child spray @-@ painting the words " Ghetto 4 Life " on a wall . Díaz stated it reinforced " outdated negative stereotypes , " and defended that Banksy should become aware that graffiti art and culture originated in the Bronx . The owner of the graffitied wall and his partner , however , praised the work and its message , calling it " beautiful " and owning its preservation to the artist 's fame . 
 Banksy 's op @-@ ed article about One World Trade Center , posted on his website on 27 October , came as an insult to many across the city . Former FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote that it was a " disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9 / 11 . " Sally <unk> , a leading voice for families of 11 September victims , expressed concerns about Banksy 's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa , saying the piece was " horrific " and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion . A Century 21 department store near Ground Zero had planned to show Banksy 's work on 29 October , but cancelled due to the controversy . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Banksy 's Better Out Than In series has received mixed reviews . Many fans raved over his work , flocking to each site everyday of the show . 
 New York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz wrote Banksy 's well @-@ executed work stood out from other graffiti , but that the meaning behind the pieces aren 't as deep as fans like to believe . " No other graffiti artist has a PR machine remotely like Banksy 's , " he writes , arguing Banksy is more of a " promo man " than an artist . 
 Will Ellsworth @-@ Jones , author of Banksy : The Man Behind the Wall writes that Better Out Than In shows Banksy 's range of mediums has grown to incorporate multi @-@ media and performance @-@ based works . He pointed out the " wonderful commentary on money and art " displayed with hiring an anonymous salesman to sell Banksy paintings in Central Park for $ 60 . 
 = 28th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 28th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army . It was raised in early 1915 as part of the First Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War and formed part of the 7th Brigade , attached to the 2nd Division . It fought during the final stages of the Gallipoli campaign in late 1915 and then on the Western Front between 1916 and 1918 . At the end of the war , the 28th was disbanded in 1919 but was re @-@ raised in 1921 , as a part @-@ time unit based in Western Australia . During the Second World War , the 28th undertook defensive duties in Australia for the majority of the conflict , before seeing action against the Japanese in the New Britain campaign in 1944 – 45 . The battalion was disbanded in March 1946 but was re @-@ formed in 1948 as an amalgamated unit with the 16th Battalion , before being unlinked in 1952 and re @-@ raised as a full battalion following the reintroduction of national service . It remained on the Australian Army 's order of battle until 1960 when it was subsumed into the Royal Western Australia Regiment , but was later re @-@ raised in 1966 as a remote area infantry battalion . In 1977 , the 28th was reduced to an independent rifle company , and in 1987 was amalgamated into the 11th / 28th Battalion , Royal Western Australia Regiment .

 The 28th Battalion came into existence on 16 April 1915 when it was raised at Blackboy Camp , in Western Australia . Formed as part of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , an all volunteer formation raised for overseas service during the First World War , the 28th Battalion 's first batch of volunteers came from personnel who had originally been allocated to the 24th Battalion . The 24th was being raised at Broadmeadows in Victoria , and it had been intended that the 24th would be raised from all states of Australia with recruits travelling to Victoria to form the unit , but the higher than expected number of volunteers at Broadmeadows at the time meant that the 24th was raised as a Victorian battalion , and the Western Australians , who had been intended to form a sub unit within the 24th , were reallocated to the 28th which was subsequently raised mainly from Western Australian recruits . 
 The 28th Battalion was subsequently allocated to the 7th Brigade , which besides the 28th and several support units , also consisted of the 25th , 26th and 27th Battalions , which were drawn from the states of Queensland , Tasmania and South Australia , and which completed their training separately before joining each other in Egypt . With an authorised strength of 1 @,@ 023 men , the battalion 's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Collett . After completing rudimentary training , the 28th embarked on the transport Ascanius on 9 June and sailed from Fremantle to Egypt via the Red Sea . 
 The 28th arrived in Egypt in July and concentrated along with the rest of the 7th Brigade at Abbassia , near Cairo , where they were assigned to the newly formed Australian 2nd Division . Two months of training followed , as the division was readied for action ; this process was put on hold in September when elements of the division were dispatched to Gallipoli to provide reinforcements for the Australian and New Zealand forces that had been fighting around Anzac Cove since April . The campaign was almost over , but the decision to evacuate had not been confirmed and the 7th Brigade was dispatched in early September . Upon arrival the brigade was temporarily attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division as reinforcements , occupying positions north @-@ east of Anzac Cove around " Cheshire Ridge " . They remained on the peninsula for the next few months , manning the trenches , improving defences and defending the beachhead until the evacuation in mid @-@ December , when they were withdrawn back to Lemnos Island . Casualties during the 28th 's brief involvement in the campaign were described by the Australian War Memorial as " light " , and the battalion 's strength on departing the peninsula was 24 officers and 667 other ranks . 
 After spending Christmas on Lemnos , the 28th returned to Egypt in early January 1916 . Further training followed before the 7th Brigade was deployed in defence of the Suez Canal . At this time , the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for future operations . Two new infantry divisions were formed from the experienced troops of the 1st Division who had deployed to Gallipoli at the start of the campaign , while a third division was raised in Australia from scratch . The 2nd Division was largely left untouched , so that it could complete its formation which had been interrupted by its deployment to Gallipoli . The 7th Brigade subsequently returned to the command of the 2nd Division and the 28th Battalion – along with the rest of the 7th Brigade – would remain with that formation for the rest of the war . In mid @-@ March 1916 , the 28th was transferred to France , as part of the first body of Australian troops to deploy to the European battlefield . In early April , the 28th Battalion entered the front line around Armentières , holding the right hand sector of the 7th Brigade 's line . For the next two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , they would fight in the trenches of the Western Front in both Belgium and France and take part in numerous battles . 
 The 28th 's first major action came during the Battle of Pozières in late July and early August when they took part in two attacks . During the first attack , the 28th suffered heavily when they were committed to a night @-@ time attack on the heights that got held up in heavy wire entanglements that the preparatory bombardment had failed to destroy ; the battalion 's losses were the heaviest in the 7th Brigade , amounting to 10 officers and 360 other ranks . A follow up attack was undertaken on 4 August , which proved more successful , eventually securing the objective . The following day , the Australians were subjected to heavy shelling before they were withdrawn on 6 August . After this , the 28th was moved to a quieter sector around Ypres before returning to the Somme in the later part of 1916 , and taking part in further fighting around Flers . In early 1917 , the Germans began a surprise withdrawal along the front , which enabled them to hold the line with fewer troops , thus gaining a pool of reserves . When the Allies discovered this , a brief advance followed , before they came up against the strongly prepared defences of the Hindenburg Line . After this , a series of attacks followed with the 28th Battalion being utilised mainly in supporting roles for the remainder of the year . Actions were fought at Bullecourt , Menin Road , Broodseinde and Poelcappelle during this time . 
 The battalion wintered in Belgium , but early in 1918 was transferred to the Somme again in response to the German Spring Offensive . In late March and into April , they defended the line around Villers @-@ Bretonneux as the Allies fought to defend the vital railhead of Amiens , before providing support to the 6th Brigade 's attack on Ville @-@ sur @-@ Ancre in May . A brief lull followed in June and July as the Allies attempted to regain the initiative , during which the 28th was involved in a minor action around Morlancourt . On 8 August , the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive during which the 28th Battalion was initially engaged around Villers @-@ Bretonneux . It was there , on the first day of the offensive , that Lieutenant Alfred Gaby , performed the deeds that led to him becoming the 28th Battalion 's first , and only , Victoria Cross recipient . A series of advances followed as the Allies exploited their initial success and sought to break the Hindenburg Line . In late August , the Australian 2nd Division advanced to the Somme River , and on 29 August , as the 7th Brigade attacked around Biaches , the 28th was assigned the task of capturing the Amiens – Peronne railway bridge . The following day , they forced their way across the river around Peronne , and during the subsequent Battle of Mont St Quentin – Peronne , they joined the 7th Brigade 's advance towards <unk> @-@ le @-@ Haut . They continued fighting until early October 1918 when they were withdrawn from the line , just after an attack on the <unk> Line , around the village of Estrees . 
 The fighting throughout 1918 had heavily depleted the Australian units , which had been unable to make good their losses , and on 5 October , the entire Australian Corps was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation . The battalion remained out of the line until the war ended in November , after which they began to demobilise . The process was slow as personnel were repatriated back to Australia in drafts and consequently the battalion was not disbanded until March 1919 . Throughout the war , casualties amongst the 28th totalled 787 killed and 2 @,@ 241 wounded . The battalion received 17 battle honours for its war service , which were bestowed in 1927 . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war years = = = 
 The demobilisation of the AIF was completed in early 1921 , at which time Australia 's part @-@ time military force , the Citizens Force , was reorganised to reflect the divisional structure and numerical designations of the AIF . As a result , the 28th Battalion was re @-@ raised in Western Australia , as part of the 13th Brigade , within the 5th Military District . Upon formation , the new battalion drew personnel from parts of the 11th , 16th and 28th Infantry Regiments . In 1927 , when territorial designations were approved for all Citizen Forces infantry battalions , the 28th adopted the title of the " Swan Valley Regiment " , although in 1934 this was changed to the " Swan Regiment " . The battalion 's motto – the Latin word <unk> – was approved in 1927 . It was headquartered in Perth , but also had detachments in Northam and Western Australia . At the outset , in 1921 the Citizen Forces units were maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service , but in late 1929 , the scheme was suspended by the Scullin Labor government , and replaced by an all @-@ volunteer " Militia " scheme . Numbers fell sharply and training opportunities for those that did volunteer were limited throughout the 1930s . Activities during this period were limited with training consisting of just one six @-@ day annual camp , which was augmented by monthly half @-@ day parades , amounting to a further six days of training . Training was also hampered by the austerity measures that were necessitated by the economic hardships of the Great Depression , which meant that the equipment provided during this time was largely obsolete , being mainly First World War vintage , and provided in insufficient numbers . 
 = = = Second World War and beyond = = = 
 Throughout the early part of the Second World War , the 28th Battalion undertook brief periods of continuous service , providing training to recruits who were enlisted following the re @-@ establishment of conscription in January 1940 to improve the nation 's overall readiness . The provisions of the Defence Act precluded the Militia from being sent outside Australian territory to fight , so many of the battalion 's personnel volunteered to serve in the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) . After Japan 's entry into the war , the 13th Brigade 's units were mobilised for full @-@ time service and pressed into home defence with III Corps , undertaking garrison duties to defend Western Australia against a possible invasion . When that threat passed , they moved to the Northern Territory , and the 28th Battalion established itself around 49 @-@ Mile Creek . Late in the war , the 13th Brigade was reassigned from the 4th Division to the 5th , and in November 1944 they were committed to the New Britain campaign , landing at Jacquinot Bay the following month and later established themselves around Waitavalo . From then until the end of the war in August 1945 , the 28th took part in a containment campaign against the much larger Japanese force on the island , as the Australians attempted to confine them to the Gazelle Peninsula and Rabaul . The 28th kept up a program of patrolling through the jungle , but made little contact with the Japanese . After the war , the battalion remained on the island processing Japanese prisoners of war until being repatriated back to Australia in January 1946 . They were disbanded two months later as part of the demobilisation process . Throughout the war , the 28th lost six men killed on active service and one wounded . It received one battle honour for its service in 1961 , but was also entrusted with the 16 battle honours awarded to the 2nd AIF 's 2 / 28th Battalion . 
 Once Australia 's wartime military forces had been demobilised , the part @-@ time force was re @-@ established in the guise of the Citizens Military Force ( CMF ) , which was formed in 1948 . Within this , an amalgamated 16th / 28th Battalion was raised . This battalion existed until August 1952 when , following the reintroduction of national service , the 28th Battalion was re @-@ raised in its own right , based in East Perth with sub @-@ units at Albany , Katanning and Geraldton . Heart of Oak was approved as the battalion 's regimental march in 1953 , but it was replaced the following year by Colonel Bogey . In 1960 , following the introduction of the Pentropic organisation and the suspension of national service , this battalion was subsumed into the newly formed Royal Western Australia Regiment , providing three company @-@ sized elements to the regiment 's 1st Battalion ( 1 RWAR ) . The Australian Army ceased using the Pentropic organisation in July 1965 and at this time 1 RWAR was split into two smaller battalions : 1 RWAR and 2 RWAR . In early 1966 , these were renumbered 16 RWAR and 11 RWAR , with the companies that had originally come from the 28th Battalion being allocated to 16 RWAR . In October 1966 , when national service was reintroduced , the 28th Battalion was re @-@ formed as a full battalion known as 28 RWAR , and fulfilling the role of a remote area battalion , catering for the training needs of men eligible for call up who wished to exercise the option to serve in the CMF instead of the Regular Army , but who could not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held . The national service scheme ended in December 1972 , after which many who had joined the CMF to defer full @-@ time national service took their discharge . Numbers fell significantly and in 1977 the 28th Battalion was reduced to an independent rifle company , along with the 11th Battalion . This continued until October 1987 , when the two companies were amalgamated to form the current 11th / 28th Battalion , Royal Western Australia Regiment .

 = Inns of Chancery = 
 The Inns of Chancery or <unk> <unk> were a group of buildings and legal institutions in London initially attached to the Inns of Court and used as offices for the clerks of chancery , from which they drew their name . Existing from at least 1344 , the Inns gradually changed their purpose , and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors ( as the Inns of Court were to barristers ) and a place of initial training for barristers . 
 The practice of training barristers at the Inns of Chancery had died out by 1642 , and the Inns instead became dedicated associations and offices for solicitors . With the founding of the Society of Gentlemen <unk> in 1739 and the Law Society of England and Wales in 1825 , a single unified professional association for solicitors , the purpose of the Inns died out , and after a long period of decline the last one ( Clement 's Inn ) was sold in 1903 and demolished in 1934 . 
 = = History = = 
 It is believed that the Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the Inns of Court . During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the City of London , primarily by the clergy . During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education - firstly a decree by Henry III of England that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London , and second a papal bull that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law . As a result , the system of legal education fell apart , and the lawyers instead settled immediately outside the City of London as close as possible to Westminster Hall , where Magna Carta provided for a permanent court . This was the small village of Holborn , where they inhabited " hostels " or " inns " , which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question . 
 The Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court , and took their name and original purpose from the chancery clerks , who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs . As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown , but the one commonly said to be the oldest is Clifford 's Inn , which existed from at least 1344 . Thavie 's Inn , founded in 1349 , is considered to be the next oldest , and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all . 
 For several centuries , education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister . A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery , where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning . He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to , who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students . At the end of each legal term , particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education . By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time . 
 At the same time , the Inns of Chancery was used as accommodation and offices by solicitors , the other branch of the English legal profession . During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the purpose of the Inns changed . After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 , the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased , and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead , offering offices and accommodation . The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen <unk> and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs , and they were gradually dissolved and sold . In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that and an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins . The last Inn to be sold was Clement 's Inn , which was sold in 1903 , and demolished in 1934 . 
 = = Inns = = 
 John Fortescue wrote of ten Inns of Chancery , each one attached to an Inn of Court " like Maids of Honour to a Princess " . Only nine are known of in detail , others were " never acknowledged by anybody " and are not found in records . The nine Inns were : 
 Clement 's Inn , Lyon 's Inn and Clifford 's Inn attached to the Inner Temple , 
 Strand Inn and New Inn attached to the Middle Temple , 
 Furnival 's Inn and Thavie 's Inn attached to Lincoln 's Inn , and 
 Staple Inn and Barnard 's Inn attached to Gray 's Inn . 
 ( A tenth Inn of Chancery , the Outer Temple , was proven to exist by the legal historian John Baker in 2008 . ) 
 Many Inns were originally independent of the Inns of Court , and fell in and out of allegiance with them , with some claiming independence right up to the nineteenth century . Most Inns became directly attached to Inns of Court during the sixteenth century , however , when the Inns of Court began charging higher acceptance fees to students trained in independent Inns of Chancery than they did to students trained in " their " Inns of Chancery . 
 = = = Inner Temple attachments = = = 
 Clement 's Inn was the last to be dissolved , being shut down in 1903 . Located near St Clement Danes , the Inn was also named after Saint Clement and took as its coat of arms his , with a large letter C in sable . The buildings were completely rebuilt in the 19th century in the Queen Anne Style . Noted members included Sir Edmund Saunders , and William Shakespeare made Justice Shallow , a character in Henry IV , Part 2 , a member of the Inn . Members were noted as " a wild lot " known for their drinking and parties . In its later years the Inn was a poor one , and had no library or chapel , with most of the funds being spent on repairs and maintenance for the building . 
 Lyon 's Inn was " a place of considerable antiquity " , with records from 1413 . Originally a hostel , it was purchased by the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery . Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke , Lyon 's Inn became a disreputable institution that " perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick " . By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls , and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients , neither of whom had any idea what their duties were , and the Inn had not dined for over a century . The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third Globe Theatre . 
 Clifford 's Inn was the oldest of the Inns of Chancery , and was first mentioned in 1344 . Although generally considered a dependent of the Inner Temple , its members always maintained that they were independent . As a note of that " independence " it became custom for the Inner Temple to send them a message once a year , which would be received but deliberately not replied to . Their coat of arms was a modified form of the Clifford family arms , with " cheque or and azure , a fess gules , a bordure , <unk> , of the third . " Noted students include John Selden ; Sir Edward Coke was also said to have studied there , but historical records find no evidence of this , and he was always associated with Lyon 's Inn more than Clifford 's .

 Strand Inn , also called Chester Inn , was the shortest lived of the Inns of Chancery . Founded in the fifteenth century it was pulled down in the 1540s by Lord Somerset in his role as Lord Protector so that he could build Somerset House . The students instead went to New Inn , and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn . Thomas <unk> was said to have studied at Strand Inn . 
 New Inn , originally St. George 's Inn or Our Lady Inn , was founded in the 15th century from our Lady Inn , a hostel . Noted students included Sir Thomas More , who attended New Inn before going to Lincoln 's Inn . The buildings of New Inn were pulled down in 1902 to make way for a road between Holborn and the Strand . After the destruction of Strand Inn , New Inn was the only Inn of Chancery left attached to the Middle Temple .

 Furnival 's Inn was founded before or during the reign of Henry IV and named after the Lords Furnival . During the 1820s the Inn was completely rebuilt . Noted tenants include Charles Dickens , who began to write The Pickwick Papers whilst living there . The Inn was demolished in 1897 . 
 Thavie 's Inn was the second oldest Inn of Chancery , and was founded around 1349 . It was sold in 1769 . 
 = = = Gray 's Inn attachments = = = 
 Staple Inn dated from at least 1415 , and was originally an inn where wool merchants stayed and <unk> . In reference to this , the Inn coat of arms contained a bale of wool . During the reign of Elizabeth I it was the largest of the Inns of Chancery , with 145 students and 69 as permanent residents . The buildings survived the great fire of London and were rebuilt in the seventeenth century , and again in the nineteenth . The Inn was shut down and the building sold to the Prudential Assurance Company in 1884 , and part of it is now used as the headquarters of the Institute of Actuaries . 
 Barnard 's Inn , originally known as Mackworth 's Inn after its owner , John Mackworth , was established in 1454 as an Inn of Chancery . A large Inn , Barnard 's had 112 students a year during the reign of Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence . When it was an institute of legal education , it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong : a halfpenny for a defective word , a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word . Barnard 's was under the supervision of Gray 's Inn , who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year , who was treated with great respect . Noted pupils included Sir John Holt , later a distinguished jurist . The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door . In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of <unk> and used to house the <unk> ' School . 
 = The Boat Race 1876 = 
 The 33rd Boat Race between crews from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge took place on the River Thames on 8 April 1876 . Six of the Oxford crew had Boat Race experience while Cambridge 's crew contained three Blues . Umpired by Joseph William Chitty , Cambridge won the race " easily " in a time of 20 minutes 20 seconds , following confusion as to the positioning of the finish . The victory took the overall record to 17 – 16 in Oxford 's favour .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Cambridge by ten lengths in the previous year 's race , and led overall with seventeen wins to Cambridge 's fifteen . 
 Cambridge were coached by Constantine William Benson who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1872 , 1873 and 1875 races , and James Brooks Close who had represented the Light Blues in the 1872 , 1873 and 1874 races . There is no record of who coached Oxford . Joseph William Chitty was the umpire for the race . He had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in March and December ) and the 1852 race . The starter was Edward Searle .

Drinkwater stated that the placement of Tom Cottingham Edwards @-@ Moss , described as " one of the best sevens that ever rowed " , at stroke was a mistake . In contrast , Cambridge were " considered by many to be the finest seen at Putney up to that time . "

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge . Weather conditions were warm but with a " foul wind " in Corney Reach ( about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) along the course ) , and the race commenced at 2 : 02 p.m. The crews remained almost level for the first four minutes of the race , after which Cambridge began to pull ahead . By Hammersmith Bridge they had a clear water advantage and were three lengths up by Chiswick Eyot . Extending their lead , the Light Blues were five lengths ahead by The Ship pub . When Oxford finally passed the pub , they stopped , " apparently unaware that they had not completed the course " . Author and former Oxford rower Dickie Burnell suggested the course was approximately 60 yards ( 55 m ) too long . 
 Cambridge , having sprinted to the finish , received the finishing gun while eight lengths ahead . As a result of the confusion , the judge declared the winning distance as four lengths . However , official records state that Cambridge won the race " easily " , in a time of 20 minutes 20 seconds . It was their sixth win in seven years and took the overall record to 17 – 16 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = History of the bikini = 
 The history of the bikini can be traced back to antiquity . Illustrations of Roman women wearing bikini @-@ like garments during competitive athletic events have been found in several locations . The most famous of them is Villa Romana del Casale . French engineer Louis Réard introduced the modern bikini , modeled by Micheline Bernardini , on July 5 , 1946 , borrowing the name for his design from the Bikini Atoll , where post @-@ war testing on the atomic bomb was happening . 
 French women welcomed the design but the Catholic Church , some media , and a majority of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous . Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951 , but the bikini was then banned from the competition . Actress Bridget Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953 . Other actresses , including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner , also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis . During the early 1960s , the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated , giving it additional legitimacy . Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No ( 1962 ) . The deer skin bikini Raquel Welch wore in the film One Million Years B.C. ( 1966 ) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s . 
 The bikini gradually grew to gain wide acceptance in Western society . According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard , the bikini is perhaps the most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of " the power of women , and not the power of fashion " . As he explains , " The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women . " By the early 2000s , bikinis had become a US $ 811 million business annually , and boosted spin @-@ off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning .

 In the Chalcolithic era around 5600 BC , the mother @-@ goddess of Çatalhöyük , a large ancient settlement in southern Anatolia , was depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini . Two @-@ piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC . Active women of ancient Greece wore a breastband called a <unk> or an <unk> , which continued to be used as an undergarment in the Middle Ages . While men in ancient Greece abandoned the <unk> , partly high @-@ cut briefs and partly loincloth , women performers and acrobats continued to wear it .

 Artwork dating back to the Diocletian period ( 286 @-@ 305 AD ) in Villa Romana del Casale , Sicily , excavated by Gino <unk> Gentile in 1950 @-@ 60 , depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor . The images of ten women , dubbed the " Bikini Girls " , exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today , are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site . In the artwork " Coronation of the Winner " done in floor mosaic in the Chamber of the Ten Maidens ( Sala delle <unk> <unk> in Italian ) the bikini girls are depicted weight @-@ lifting , discus throwing , and running . Some activities depicted have been described as dancing , as their bodies resemble dancers rather than athletes . Coronation in the title of the mosaic comes from a woman in a toga with a crown in her hand and one of the maidens holding a palm frond . Some academics maintain that the nearby image of Eros , the primordial god of lust , love , and intercourse , was added later , demonstrating the owner 's predilections and strengthening the association of the bikini with the erotic . Similar mosaics have been discovered in <unk> in northern Italy and Patti , another part of Sicily . Prostitution , skimpy clothes and athletic bodies were related in ancient Rome , as images were found of female sex workers exercising with <unk> / clappers and other equipment wearing costumes similar to the Bikini Girls . 
 Charles <unk> , a fellow of Queens ' College , Cambridge , curator of the Archaeology Museum there and an editor of The Cambridge Ancient History , illustrated a chapter titled " The new woman " in his book Women in Antiquity with a 1950s model wearing an identical bikini against the 4th @-@ century mosaics from Piazza <unk> as part of a sisterhood between the bikini @-@ clad female athletes of ancient Greco @-@ Romans and modern woman . A photograph of the mosaic was used by Sarah Pomeroy , Professor of Classics at Hunter College and the Graduate Center , City University of New York , in the 1994 British edition of her book Goddesses , Whores , Wives , and Slaves to emphasize a similar identification . According to archeologist George M.A. <unk> the bikini girls made the learned observers realize " how modern the ancients were " . 
 In ancient Rome , the bikini @-@ style bottom , a wrapped loincloth of cloth or leather , was called a <unk> or subligaculum ( " little binding underneath " ) , while a band of cloth or leather to support the breasts was called <unk> or <unk> . The exercising bikini girls from Piazza Armenia wear <unk> , scanty briefs made as a dainty version of a man 's <unk> , and a <unk> band about the breasts , often referred to in literature as just fascia , which can mean any kind of bandage . Observation of artifacts and experiments shows bands had to be wrapped several times around the breasts , largely to flatten them in a style popular with flappers in the 1920s . These Greco @-@ Roman <unk> may have flattened big breasts and padded small breasts to look bigger . Evidence suggests regular use . The " bikini girls " from Piazza Armenia , some of whom sport the braless look of the late 20th century , do not depict any propensity of such popularity in style . One bottom , made of leather , from Roman Britain was displayed at the Museum of London in 1998 . There has been no evidence that these bikinis were for swimming or sun @-@ bathing . 
 Finds especially in Pompeii show the Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini . A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere , others were found in the front hall . A statue of Venus was recovered from the <unk> of the house of Julia Felix , and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell <unk> . Naples National Archaeological Museum , which opened its limited viewing gallery of more explicit exhibits in 2000 , also exhibits a " Venus in Bikini " . The museum 's exhibits include female statues wearing see @-@ through gold lamé brassiere , basque and knickers . The Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts , including the one meter tall , almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini . They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to " mature persons of secure morals " . Even after the doors were opened , only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time , and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents ' or a teacher 's permission . 
 There are references to bikinis in ancient literature as well . Ovid , the writer ranked alongside Virgil and Horace as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature , suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends , is a good place to hide love @-@ letters . Martial , a Latin poet from Hispania who published between AD 86 and 103 , satirized a female athlete he named <unk> , who played ball in a bikini @-@ like garb quite bluntly , making her drink , gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her lesbianism . In an epigram on <unk> , Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the bathhouse in a bikini , while it was more natural to go unclothed . Reportedly Theodora , the 6th century empress of the Byzantine Empire wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor Justinian I. 
 There is evidence of ancient Roman women playing <unk> <unk> , an early version of handball , wearing a costume that has been identified as bikinis .

Swimming or outdoor bathing were discouraged in the Christian West and there was little need for a bathing or swimming costume till the 18th century . The bathing gown in the 18th century was a loose ankle @-@ length full @-@ sleeve chemise @-@ type gown made of wool or flannel , so that modesty or decency was not threatened . In the first half of 19th century the top became knee @-@ length while an ankle @-@ length drawer was added as a bottom . By the second half of 19th century , in France , the sleeves started to vanish , the bottom became shorter to reach only the knees and the top became hip @-@ length and both became more form fitting . In the 1900s women wore wool dresses on the beach that were made of up to 9 yards ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) of fabric . That standard of swimwear evolved into the modern bikini in the first of half of the 20th century .

 In 1907 , Australian swimmer and performer Annette Kellerman was arrested on a Boston beach for wearing a form @-@ fitting sleeveless one @-@ piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe , a costume she adopted from England , although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910 . Even in 1943 , pictures of the Kellerman swimsuit were produced as evidence of indecency in Esquire v. Walker , Postmaster General . But , Harper 's Bazaar wrote in June 1920 ( vol . 55 , no . 6 , p . 138 ) - " Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable , daring beauty of fit that always remains refined . " The following year , in June 1921 ( vol . 54 , no . <unk> , p . 101 ) it wrote that these bathing suits were " famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite , plastic beauty of line . " 
 Female swimming was introduced at the 1912 Summer Olympics . In 1913 , inspired by that breakthrough , the designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two @-@ piece swimwear , a close @-@ fitting one @-@ piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top . Silent films such as The Water Nymph ( 1912 ) saw Mabel Normand in revealing attire , and this was followed by the daringly dressed Sennett Bathing Beauties ( 1915 – 1929 ) . The name " swim suit " was coined in 1915 by Jantzen Knitting Mills , a sweater manufacturer who launched a swimwear brand named the Red Diving Girl , . The first annual bathing @-@ suit day at New York 's Madison Square Garden in 1916 was a landmark . The swimsuit apron , a design for early swimwear , disappeared by 1918 , leaving a tunic covering the shorts . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , people began to shift from " taking in the water " to " taking in the sun , " at bathhouses and spas , and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features . Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight @-@ fitting swimsuits , but its durability , especially when wet , proved problematic , with jersey and silk also sometimes being used . Burlesque and vaudeville performers wore two @-@ piece outfits in the 1920s . The 1929 film " Man with a Movie Camera " shows Russian women wearing early two @-@ piece swimsuits which expose their midriff , and a few who are topless . Films of holidaymakers in Germany in the 1930s show women wearing two @-@ piece suits ,

 By the 1930s , necklines plunged at the back , sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away and tightened . With the development of new clothing materials , particularly latex and nylon , through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body , with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning . Women 's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure . Coco Chanel made <unk> fashionable , and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown . They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933 . The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases <unk> that featured bikinis . Dorothy Lamour 's The Hurricane ( 1937 ) also showed two @-@ piece bathing suits . 
 The 1934 film , Fashions of 1934 featured chorus girls wearing two @-@ piece outfits which look identical to modern bikinis . In 1934 , a National Recreation Association study on the use of leisure time found that swimming , encouraged by the freedom of movement the new swimwear designs provided , was second only to movies in popularity as free time activity out of a list of 94 activities . In 1935 American designer Claire McCardell cut out the side panels of a maillot @-@ style bathing suit , the bikini 's forerunner . The 1938 invention of the Telescopic <unk> in <unk> elastic cotton ushered into the end the era of wool . Cotton sun @-@ tops , printed with palm trees , and silk or rayon pyjamas , usually with a blouse top , became popular by 1939 . Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton , silk , nylon , wool , leather , and rubber . In 1942 the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L @-@ 85 , cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10 % reduction in the amount of fabric in women 's beachwear . To comply with the regulations , swimsuit manufacturers produced two @-@ piece suits with bare midriffs .

 Fabric shortage continued for some time after the end of the war . Two @-@ piece swimsuits without the usual skirt panel and other excess material started appearing in the US when the government ordered a 10 % reduction in fabric used in woman 's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing . By that time , two @-@ piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches . The July 9 , 1945 , Life shows women in Paris wearing similar items . Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner , Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear . Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed . The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy , a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces . What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms , which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around au naturel while keeping both parts of the suit afloat . Life magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote , " The name of the suit , of course , suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable . " 
 American designer Adele Simpson , a Coty American Fashion Critics ' Awards winner ( 1947 ) and a notable alumna of the New York art school Pratt Institute , who believed clothes must be comfortable and practical , designed a large part of her swimwear line with one @-@ piece suits that were considered fashionable even in early 1980s . This was when Cole of California started marketing revealing prohibition suits and Catalina Swimwear introduced almost bare @-@ back designs . Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured designs of midriff @-@ baring suits and tops . However , midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public . Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as Neptune 's Daughter ( 1949 ) in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as " Double Entendre " and " Honey Child " . Williams , who also was an Amateur Athletic Union champion in the 100 meter freestyle ( 1939 ) and an Olympics swimming finalist ( 1940 ) , also portrayed Kellerman in the 1952 film Million Dollar Mermaid ( titled as The One Piece Bathing Suit in UK ) . 
 Swimwear of the 1940s , 50s and early 60s followed the silhouette mostly from early 1930s . Keeping in line with the ultra @-@ feminine look dominated by Dior , it evolved into a dress with cinched waists and constructed <unk> , accessorized with earrings , bracelets , hats , scarves , sunglasses , hand bags and cover @-@ ups . Many of these pre @-@ bikinis had fancy names like Double Entendre , Honey Child ( to maximize small bosoms ) , <unk> ( to minimize large bosoms ) , Diamond Lil ( trimmed with rhinestones and lace ) , Swimming In Mink ( trimmed with fur across the bodice ) and <unk> ( heavy <unk> with a rope belt for carrying a knife ) , Beau Catcher , Leading Lady , Pretty Foxy , Side Issue , Forecast , and Fabulous Fit . According to Vogue the swimwear had become more of " state of dress , not undress " by mid @-@ 1950s .

 French fashion designer Jacques Heim , who owned a beach shop in the French Riviera resort town of Cannes , introduced a minimalist two @-@ piece design in May 1946 which he named the " Atome , " after the smallest known particle of matter . The bottom of his design was just large enough to cover the wearer 's navel . 
 At the same time , Louis Réard , a French automotive and mechanical engineer , was running his mother 's lingerie business near Les Folies Bergères in Paris . He noticed women on St. Tropez beaches rolling up the edges of their swimsuits to get a better tan and was inspired to produce a more minimal design . He trimmed additional fabric off the bottom of the swimsuit , exposing the wearer 's navel for the first time . Réard 's string bikini consisted of four triangles made from 30 square inches ( 194 cm2 ) of fabric printed with a newspaper pattern . 
 When Réard sought a model to wear his design at his press conference , none of the usual models would wear the suit , so he hired 19 year old nude dancer Micheline Bernardini from the Casino de Paris . He introduced his design to the media and public on July 5 , 1946 , in Paris at Piscine Molitor , a public pool in Paris . Réard held the press conference five days after the first test of a nuclear device ( nicknamed Able ) over the Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads . His swimsuit design shocked the press and public because it was the first to reveal the wearer 's navel . 
 To promote his new design , Heim hired <unk> to fly above the Mediterranean resort advertising the Atome as " the world 's smallest bathing suit . " Not to be outdone by Heim , Réard hired his own <unk> three weeks later to fly over the French Riviera advertising his design as " smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world . " 
 Heim 's design was the first to be worn on the beach , but the name given by Réard stuck with the public . Despite significant social resistance , Réard received more than 50 @,@ 000 letters from fans . He also initiated a bold ad campaign that told the public a two @-@ piece swimsuit was not a genuine bikini " unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring . " According to Kevin Jones , curator and fashion historian at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising , " Réard was ahead of his time by about 15 to 20 years . Only women in the vanguard , mostly upper @-@ class European women embraced it . "

 Bikini sales did not pick up around the world as women stuck to traditional two @-@ piece swimsuits . Réard went back to designing conventional knickers to sell in his mother 's shop . According to Kevin Jones , curator and fashion historian at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising , " Réard was ahead of his time by about 15 to 20 years . Only women in the vanguard , mostly upper @-@ class European women embraced it , just like the upper @-@ class European women who first cast off their corsets after World War I. " It was banned in the French Atlantic coastline , Spain , Belgium and Italy , three countries neighboring France , as well as Portugal and Australia , and it was prohibited in some US states , and discouraged in others . 
 In 1951 , the first Miss World contest ( originally the Festival Bikini Contest ) , was organized by Eric Morley . When the winner , Kiki Håkansson from Sweden , was crowned in a bikini , countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates . Håkansson remains the first and last Miss World to be crowned in her bikini , a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful . Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy . In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe <unk> on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls , though she did not mind French girls wearing them . Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette ( 1947 ) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two @-@ piece swimwear , not the bikini . 
 In 1950 , Time magazine interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole , owner of Cole of California , and reported that he had " little but scorn for France 's famed Bikinis , " because they were designed for " diminutive Gallic women " . " French girls have short legs , " he explained , " <unk> have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer . " Réard himself described it as a two @-@ piece bathing suit which " reveals everything about a girl except for her mother 's maiden name . " Even Esther Williams commented , " A bikini is a thoughtless act . " But , popularity of the charms of Pin @-@ up queen and Hollywood star Williams were to vanish along with pre @-@ bikinis with fancy names over the next few decades . Australian designer Paula <unk> introduced the bikini to Gold Coast in 1952 . In 1957 , Das moderne Mädchen ( The Modern Girl ) wrote , " It is unthinkable that a decent girl with tact would ever wear such a thing . " Eight years later a Munich student was punished to six days cleaning work at an old home because she had strolled across the central <unk> square , Munich in a bikini .
