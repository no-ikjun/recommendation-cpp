 In Norse mythology , Eir ( Old Norse " help , mercy " ) is a goddess and / or valkyrie associated with medical skill . Eir is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; and in skaldic poetry , including a runic inscription from Bergen , Norway from around 1300 . Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure , and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess and / or a valkyrie . In addition , Eir has been theorized as a form of the goddess Frigg and has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia .

 In the Poetic Edda poem Fjölsvinnsmál , the watchman Fjölsviðr presents a list of the maidens that attend the lady of the keep — Menglöð — that includes Eir , and states that they all sit on the hill Lyfjaberg ( Old Norse " hill of healing " or " healing mountain " ) . The exchange between the hero Svipdagr and Fjölsviðr mentioning Eir is as follows : 
 After the exchange , Svipdagr asks if these figures will give aid if blóts are made to them . Fjölsviðr responds that Svipdagr is correct :

 In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur . High lists Eir third , and says no more about her other than noting that " she is an extremely good physician . " In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál Eir appears within a list of valkyrie names , but Eir is not included in the list of ásynjur in the same chapter . 
 = = = <unk> poetry and runic inscription = = = 
 In skaldic poetry , the name Eir is frequent in kennings for women . A sample construction is Eir aura ( " Eir of riches " ) , occurring in <unk> saga . The name is already used in this way by the 10th century poets Kormákr Ögmundarson and Hallfreðr <unk> . Similarly , the name Eir is used in a woman kenning in a runic inscription inscribed on a stick from Bergen , Norway around the year 1300 . The stick records a common mercantile transaction followed by a verse from a displeased scribe ( edits applied per the translator 's notes ) : 
 <unk> Var of wire [ " woman of filigree , " meaning " wise bejeweled woman " ] makes ( me ) sit unhappy . 
 Eir [ woman ] of mackerels ' ground [ likely gold ] takes often and much sleep from me.' 
 Mindy Macleod and Bernard Mees posit that the first line of the inscription essentially means " women make me miserable " or potentially " marriage makes me miserable , " whereas the second line means " women often take a lot of sleep from me . " 
 The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in rímur poetry . 
 = = Theories = = 
 Regarding the seemingly three different , seemingly conflicting , mentions of Eir , Andy Orchard says that the etymology of the name Eir may appear to fit the role of Eir as a goddess and servant of Menglöð best , but that one should consider that the valkyries also have the ability to waken the dead . John Lindow is skeptical of there having been a belief in Eir as a goddess , stating that " whether we should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic " . Rudolf Simek says that Eir may originally have been simply a valkyrie rather than a goddess , and lists the servant of Menglöð by the same name as a separate figure . 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson comments that " virtually nothing " is known about Eir outside of her association with healing , and points out that she is " singled out as one of the Norns who shape the lives of children " . Davidson adds that " no satisfactory conclusions " have been drawn from her name , and considers all mentions of Eir as of the same figure . Davidson says that , in reference to Eir 's appearance among Menglöð 's maidens , that the names of these maidens " suggest that they are guardian spirits , and [ they are ] said to ' shelter and save ' those who make offerings of them . They could be akin to protective spirits of the house , guarding both men and women . " She additionally draws a link between these spirits and Lyfjaberg : 
 Lyfjaberg is where the goddess sits surrounded by her helpful spirits . Although healing by a goddess — or indeed by a god either — has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us , there is no doubt that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre @-@ Christian period , as was that of many women saints in Christian times . The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death , and was revered as a <unk> , both in the family home and in the courts of kings , though she might also pass sentence of death . 
 Henry Adams Bellows proposes a relationship between Eir and the place name Lyfjaberg , which he translates as " hill of healing " . Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name , and that he , like others , has followed 19th @-@ century scholar Sophus Bugge 's choice . Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg " implies that <unk> is a goddess of healing , and hence , perhaps an <unk> of Frigg , as already intimated by her name [ ... ] . In stanza 54 , Eir appears as one of <unk> 's handmaidens , and Eir , according to Snorri ( Gylfaginning , 35 ) is herself the Norse Hygeia . Compare this stanza to stanza 32 . "

 Esbjerg ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / ; Danish : [ <unk> ̥ <unk> ̯ ˀ ] ; West Jutish dialect : [ <unk> ̯ ] ) is a seaport town and seat of Esbjerg Municipality on the west coast of the Jutland peninsula in southwest Denmark . By road , it is 71 kilometres ( 44 mi ) west of Kolding and 164 kilometres ( 102 mi ) southwest of Aarhus . With an urban population of 71 @,@ 618 ( as of 1 January 2016 ) , it is the fifth @-@ largest city in Denmark , and the largest in west Jutland . 
 Before a decision was made to establish a harbour ( now the second largest in Denmark ) at Esbjerg in 1868 , the area consisted of only a few farms . Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13 @,@ 000 by 1901 and 70 @,@ 000 by 1970 . In addition to its fishing and shipping activities , it also became an important centre for agricultural exports . Over the years , many of the city 's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich , Essex , England , but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875 . The harbour facilities are being expanded to answer the needs of the wind @-@ turbine industry and container shipping traffic . Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen , Scotland and Stavanger , Norway . 
 The town has several notable museums and entertainment venues , including Esbjerg Art Museum , Esbjerg Museum and the privately owned Fisheries and Maritime Museum . The Esbjerg Performing Arts Centre was completed in 1997 to designs by Jan and Jørn Utzon . When approached by sea , the Man Meets the Sea is one of the prominent monuments , consisting of four 9 @-@ metre @-@ tall ( 27 feet ) white @-@ coloured men , overlooking <unk> Beach . The sculpture was designed by Svend Wiig Hansen and installed in 1995 . It hosts branches of the University of Southern Denmark and Aalborg University , Esbjerg is increasingly recognized for its university facilities and sporting activities . It is home to the Danish football club Esbjerg fB , who play their home matches at Blue Water Arena , and also has an ice hockey division called Esbjerg Elite <unk> , which plays at the Granly Hockey Arena . 
 = = History and economy = = 
 Esbjerg 's oldest existing house , on the corner of <unk> , was built around 1660 . The town itself was not established until 1868 when it was built as a replacement for the harbour in Altona , which had previously been Denmark 's most important North Sea port but came under German control after the Second Schleswig War in 1864 . At the time , Esbjerg consisted of only a few farms . Developed under royal decree from 1868 until 1874 , the harbour was officially opened in 1874 , with rail connections to Varde and to Fredericia , an important hub on the east coast of Jutland . Initial planning of the town was conducted by chartered surveyor H. Wilkens in 1870 with streets laid out in the form of a rectangular grid . The market square ( Torvet ) was positioned at the centre , midway between the harbour and the railway station . From only 400 inhabitants at the beginning of the 1870s , the town and its population grew rapidly , with 1529 residents mentioned in 1880 , and 4 @,@ 211 in 1890 . 
 In 1893 , Esbjerg became a municipality in its own right ( initially known as Esbjerg <unk> ) , receiving the status and privileges of a market town in 1899 and incorporating the parish of Jerne ( east of the centre ) in 1945 . A number of institutions and facilities were soon established , including the courthouse and town hall ( 1891 ) , the gas and waterworks ( 1896 ) and the power plant ( 1907 ) . From the beginning of the 20th century , Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country 's major export centres . Established in 1895 by nine local dairies , the butter @-@ packaging factory , Dansk Andels <unk> , employed some 150 workers until 1920 , packing and dispatching butter for the London market . It was later extended to include egg marketing under the name Dansk Andels <unk> . Ultimately , it handled produce from 140 dairies spread across the whole of Jutland . After the Second World War , the town developed several agricultural industries , especially meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300 . The slaughterhouse and meat packaging facility , Esbjerg Andels @-@ <unk> , established in 1887 , became Denmark 's sixth largest by 1962 . It later became part of <unk> <unk> in 1986 , and in 2001 , it was acquired by Danish Crown . 
 Once Denmark 's principal fishing port , the Port of Esbjerg is still a driving force for the town 's economy . While it has a long history of ferry services to England , the town is by no means a tourist destination . Lonely Planet remarked that " nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday , in fact , as with many industrial ports , most visitors rush through as quickly as possible " . Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark 's oil and offshore activities , with companies like Maersk , <unk> , <unk> Services , ABB , Schlumberger , <unk> and Atkins all having offshore @-@ related activities in the town . Halliburton has an office in Esbjerg . The port has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas were first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s . More recently , it has become a centre for shipping offshore wind turbines . In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines , which supply 3 gigawatts ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 hp ) of offshore wind power , components have been shipped to various British wind farms . In order to cope with enormous future increases in Danish offshore wind power , 12 companies , including <unk> Energy and Bluewater Energy Services are already planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg . In connection with this , in June 2013 , the port was significantly expanded with the opening of the Østhavn ( East Harbour ) , covering an area of 650 @,@ 000 m2 ( 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 Historically , in addition to its success as a fishing port , Esbjerg established its position as one of the country 's major export centres . Before World War II , there was a large butter factory , Dansk Andels <unk> , employing some 150 workers while after the war the town developed agricultural industries , especially for meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300 . Latterly owned by Danish Crown and employing 500 , the plant closed in May 2012 . 
 More recently , Esbjerg has grown into an important centre for education with campuses belonging to the University of Southern Denmark ( 1998 ) and Aalborg University ( 1995 ) . The town holds an annual music festival spanning two weekends ( nine days ) in mid @-@ August . It is focused around the central Torvet Square which hosts the main stage . The music includes everything from church concerts to opera and pop .

 The town is situated on the southwestern coast of Denmark , and is a port on the North Sea . By road , it is 71 kilometres ( 44 mi ) west of Kolding , 164 kilometres ( 102 mi ) southwest of Aarhus , 298 kilometres ( 185 mi ) west of Copenhagen and 274 kilometres ( 170 mi ) southwest of Aalborg . By sea , it is situated roughly 380 miles ( 610 km ) northeast of Harwich , England . As a result of planned development , the older sections of the town look like a chessboard with long , wide streets with rectangular corners . 
 The high ground of Esbjerg stretches along the east coast of the Wadden Sea ( now a UNESCO World Heritage Site ) between the rivers of Varde and <unk> , encompassing the coastal area of Ho Bugt and the seaside district of <unk> to the north . Opposite Esbjerg , across Fanø Bay , is the island of Fanø , 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) by 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , with Nordby as its principal settlement , connected to Esbjerg by ferry . To the west of Esbjerg , the town boundary is defined by a number of small streams . The highest point is some 25 m ( 82 ft ) above sea level . The town is located on top of steep slopes leading down to the flatlands of the harbour area . The built @-@ up area itself is not very hilly but there are considerable differences in terrain . Apart from the cliff in the town park overlooking the harbour , the valley of <unk> <unk> , 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) in length , is the main feature of the landscape , resulting in differences of up to 20 m ( 66 ft ) with the surroundings .

In 1896 , it was expanded with transepts and galleries on either side of the nave , doubling the seating capacity . Several more churches were established after the Second World War when there was a marked increase in the city 's population . The first of these , the yellow @-@ brick Trinity Church with its large triangular stained @-@ glass windows , was designed to accommodate a large congregation while offering additional facilities for both young and old . Breaking with tradition , its square @-@ shaped nave was built directly adjacent to lower ancillary buildings including a hall with a stage , meeting rooms and a kitchen . The bell tower stands alone , quite separate from the church . 
 St Nikolaj is a Roman Catholic church , built in 1969 . Unusual for a church , it is built of aerated concrete . Its innovative square @-@ shaped design by Johan Otto von <unk> served as a basis for his Grande Arche in Paris . The dimensions of the inner cube of St Nikolaj Church are very close to those of the " holy of <unk> " in Solomon 's Temple as described in Ezekiel 40 : 5 . 
 The modern red @-@ brick Grundtvig 's Church , southeast of the town centre , was designed by Ole Nielsen . With its strangely shaped , red @-@ tiled roof , it was completed in 1969 . Inside , the large wall surfaces are broken only by 12 narrow windows on the east side , creating a contrast with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high on the east side of the tower . 
 Designed by Inger and Johannes <unk> , <unk> Church with wave @-@ like folds in its red @-@ brick walls was inaugurated in 1978 .

 = Amanita gemmata = 
 Amanita gemmata , commonly known as the gemmed Amanita or the jonquil Amanita , is an agaric mushroom of the family Amanitaceae and genus Amanita . The fruit body has a cap that is a dull to golden shade of yellow , and typically 2 @.@ 5 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter . The cap surface is sticky when moist , and characterized by white warts , which are easily detached . It is initially convex , and flattens out when mature . The flesh is white and does not change colour when cut . Gills are white and closely spaced . The stem is pale yellow , and measures 4 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 7 in ) thick . The partial veil that covers the young fruit body turns into the ring on the stem at maturity . The spore print is white , while the spores are roughly elliptical , and measure 8 – 10 by 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 µm . 
 This species is a mycorrhizal fungus , widespread in the Americas and Europe . It can grow either singly , scattered , or in groups . It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths , where it fruits in summer and fall . It is a toxic mushroom that has muscarine , the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina as well as many species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera . It is often confused with various other European species . A. gemmata resembles the false death cap , tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms . Its cap is brighter in color than the former , and more yellow than the latter two . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by Swedish mycologist and botanist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus <unk> in 1838 . It was transferred to the genus Amanita in 1866 by the French statistician Louis Bertillon . The species has been transferred to several genera in its history , resulting in a number of synonyms , including Amanita muscaria var. gemmata ( 1886 , Lucien Quélet ) , Amanitopsis gemmata ( 1887 , Pier Andrea Saccardo ) , <unk> gemmata ( 1940 , Jean @-@ Edouard Gilbert ) , and <unk> <unk> ( 1948 , William Murrill ) . Amanita authority Rodham E. Tulloss considers A. amici ( published by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1891 ) to be synonymous with A. gemmata , as the macroscopic characteristics of the former fall within the limits of the range expected for the latter . 
 Within the genus Amanita , A. gemmata is classified in subgenus Amanita , section Amanita , subsection <unk> , and series <unk> . Tulloss places the species in a stirps ( an informal ranking above species level ) with A. <unk> and A. <unk> . Some mycologists believe that A. gemmata is not different from A. <unk> . Two molecular studies based on sequences of the large ribosomal subunit RNA gene ( <unk> @-@ rDNA ) and the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit RNA gene ( <unk> @-@ rDNA ) show that A. gemmata is part of a clade within Amanita with its close relatives A. muscaria , A. farinosa and A. <unk> . 
 The mushroom is commonly known as the " gemmed Amanita " , the " jonquil Amanita " , or the " European gemmed Amanita " .

The cap is typically 2 @.@ 5 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , and initially convex before flattening out in maturity . The flesh is white , and shows no change when sliced . 
 The gills are adnate to adnexed , and white ; they are close together , with little intervening space . The pale yellowish stem is 4 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 7 in ) thick , and either roughly equal in width throughout , or slightly thicker at the base . Young mushrooms have a membranous partial veil extending from the upper stem to the cap margin ; as the mushroom grows , the partial veil tears to leave a flimsy , skirt @-@ like , easily lost ring on the stem . At the base of the stem is a white volva ( a remnant of the universal veil that covered the immature mushroom ) that usually forms a small , free rim . Spore prints are white .

The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium ) are usually four @-@ spored , club shaped , and measure 30 – 40 by 8 – 11 µm . 
 The gill tissue is divergent , meaning that the cells are more or less parallel near the center of the gill , but bend outwards near the end of the gill . The hyphae in this tissue are cylindrical to inflated , thin walled , hyaline ( translucent ) to yellowish , and measure 2 @.@ 2 – 9 µm wide ; the hyphae in the central strand are narrower and typically cylindrical . The hyphae of the subhymenium ( a layer of tissue directly under the hymenium ) are interwoven . These hyphae are branched , cylindrical to slightly inflated , hyaline , and 6 – 9 µm wide . The hyphae of the cap cuticle are filamentous , interwoven , and radially arranged . They are cylindrical , 2 @.@ 7 – 4 µm wide , thin @-@ walled , hyaline to yellowish , and gelatinize when mounted in potassium hydroxide . The cap tissue is also interwoven , with hyphae that are cylindrical to somewhat inflated , 3 @.@ 7 – 14 @.@ 6 µm wide , thin @-@ walled , branched , and hyaline to yellowish . Caulocystidia are abundant on the apex of the stem ; they are club @-@ shaped to cylindrical , thin @-@ walled , hyaline , and measure 3 – 9 µm wide . The annulus tissue comprises interwoven cylindrical hyphae measuring 3 – 9 µm wide . <unk> ( inflated , spherical cells ) are also present in the annulus tissue ; they are club shaped to ellipsoidal , with dimensions of 29 – 55 by 30 – 70 µm . The warts on the cap surface ( remnants of the universal veil ) comprise loosely interwoven cylindrical to inflated thin @-@ walled hyphae that are 3 @.@ 5 – 8 µm wide . <unk> in this tissue are 58 @.@ 5 – 70 @.@ 2 by 17 @.@ 5 – 40 µm , ellipsoidal , and hyaline . The volval tissue is interwoven , with cylindrical , hyaline hyphae that are 4 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 3 µm wide . The sphaerocysts here are ellipsoidal to roughly spherical , hyaline , and measure 35 – 70 by 20 – 35 µm . In A. gemmata , where they are most abundant in the region just below the cap cuticle , these refractive cells are scattered , and have a width of 3 @.@ 7 – 6 µm . Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of A. gemmata ; they are present in the annulus , gill tissue , subhymenium , and cap tissue . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 There are numerous forms in North America that tend to intergrade with A. pantherina . In 2005 , mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita <unk> , a species that has been confused with A. gemmata several times in the past . According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge <unk> , the Mediterranean species A. amici ( synonymous with A. gemmata f. amici ) is similar in appearance to A. gemmata but is larger . According to Tulloss however , their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A. amici fell within the range expected for A. gemmata , and for this reason , the two taxa should be considered conspecific . Neville and <unk> suggest that the name A. gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A. <unk> , which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004 . A. <unk> , a mushroom ranging from Japan to China , is a lookalike , but has clamps , unlike A. gemmata . Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A. <unk> , and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Toxicity is suspected to be due to the presence of muscimol and <unk> acid . 
 Generally , symptoms of poisoning appear within three hours of ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , diarrhea , irregular and slow heart beat and agitation . Severe cases involving coma , convulsions , or death are extremely rare . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Amanita gemmata is a mycorrhizal fungus , meaning it forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants . Through the association , the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source , and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens . Largent and collaborators ( 1980 ) document mycorrhizal associations of A. gemmata with Manzanita ( Arctostaphylos spp . ) and Lodgepole Pine ( Pinus contorta ) , and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine ( Pinus pinaster ) in Spain . The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils , and is often found in association with Norway Spruce ( Picea abies ) . The mushroom grows either singly , scattered , or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests , especially along paths and roads . 
 The species is distributed in areas of Asia , the Americas , and Europe . It fruits in summer and fall ( fall and winter in California ) . It is widely distributed ( as a species cluster ) in North America , where it has been found as far south as Ixtlán de Juárez , Mexico . The species has been reported from the Dominican Republic . In South America , it is known from Chile . In Asia , the mushroom has been collected from Iran and China . 
 = HMS Zealous ( 1864 ) = 
 HMS Zealous was one of the three ships ( the others being HMS Royal Alfred and HMS Repulse ) forming the second group of wooden steam battleships selected in 1860 for conversion to ironclads . This was done in response to the perceived threat to Britain offered by the large French ironclad building programme . The ship was ordered to the West Coast of Canada after she was completed to represent British interests in the Eastern Pacific Ocean . Zealous became the flagship for the Pacific Station for six years until she was relieved in 1872 . She was refitted upon her arrival and subsequently became the guard ship at Southampton until she was paid off in 1875 . The ship was in reserve until she was sold for scrap in 1886 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 HMS Zealous was given a straight stem and a rounded stern , but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form ; it had been found that lengthening the hull , as was done in the earlier Prince Consort class , led to longitudinal weakness . Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries , though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside . She also carried less armour than the earlier class , and was nearly a knot slower ; however , as she was built to serve in distant waters , and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force , these shortcomings were thought acceptable . 
 Zealous was 252 feet ( 76 @.@ 8 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 58 feet 7 inches ( 17 @.@ 9 m ) . The ship had a draught of 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) forward and 25 feet 9 inches ( 7 @.@ 8 m ) aft . She displaced 6 @,@ 096 long tons ( 6 @,@ 194 t ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Zealous had a simple horizontal 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting @-@ rod steam engine driving a single four @-@ bladed , 19 @-@ foot @-@ 1 @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) propeller . Steam was provided by eight rectangular boilers at a working pressure of 22 psi ( 152 kPa ; 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engine produced 3 @,@ 623 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 702 kW ) during the ship 's sea trials in November 1866 which gave the ship a maximum speed of 11 @.@ 7 knots ( 21 @.@ 7 km / h ; 13 @.@ 5 mph ) . Zealous carried a maximum of 660 long tons ( 670 t ) of coal . She was ship rigged with three masts and had a sail area of 29 @,@ 200 square feet ( 2 @,@ 710 m2 ) . Her best speed with the propeller disconnected and under sail alone was 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ; 12 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 All of the available 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) and 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) guns had already been earmarked for other , more powerful ships . Zealous therefore received an armament of 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) guns , which were deemed adequate for her expected service activity , and which , indeed , she retained for the whole of her active career . She was the only battleship ever to have a uniform armament of this calibre , and she , and her half sister HMS Repulse , were the only Victorian ironclads to retain their original armament unchanged through their entire active careers . 
 Zealous was armed with twenty 7 @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Four of these guns were mounted on the upper deck as chase guns , two each fore and aft . The 16 @-@ calibre 7 @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 @-@ pound ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Zealous had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick amidships and tapered to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick at the bow and stern . From the level of the main deck , it reached 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below the waterline . The guns on the main deck amidships were protected by a section of 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch armour , 103 feet ( 31 @.@ 4 m ) long , with 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads at each end which left the chase guns unprotected . The armour was backed by the sides of the ship which consisted of 30 @.@ 5 inches ( 770 mm ) of teak . The total weight of her armour was 790 long tons ( 800 t ) . 
 = = Service history = = 
 HMS Zealous was laid down on 26 October 1859 as a wooden two @-@ deck , 90 @-@ gun ship of the line by Pembroke Royal Dockyard , but her construction was suspended pending experience with the conversion of her half @-@ sisters of the Prince Consort class to broadside ironclads . The Admiralty ordered on 2 July 1862 that she be cut down one deck and converted to an armoured frigate for the price of £ 239 @,@ 258 . The ship was launched on 7 March 1864 and commissioned in September 1866 , but was not completed until 4 October 1866 . 
 In order to match the French deployment of armored corvettes of the Belliqueuse and Alma classes in the Pacific Ocean the Admiralty ordered Zealous to sail for the west coast of Canada shortly after she was completed . Upon her arrival the ship became the flagship , and reached her operational base at Esquimalt in July 1867 ( Esquimalt was the headquarters of the Pacific Station ) ; she remained moored there , at the end of a telegraph link with Britain , until April 1869 . During this time her only sea service was for gunnery practice on two days every quarter . In January 1870 she picked up a fresh crew at Panama brought out by the two @-@ decker HMS Revenge . After six years on station she was relieved by Revenge as flagship and started for home . Her bottom had not been cleaned since she had left Great Britain and she could only make a maximum of 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 mph ) under sail or steam so her return voyage took five months . Zealous struck a rock while sailing through the Straits of Magellan , but was only slightly damaged . She was refitted in Plymouth in April 1873 and then became guard ship at Southampton until 1875 , when she was paid off . The ship was placed in reserve in Portsmouth until sold for scrap in September 1886 . 
 As coal was extremely expensive on the West Coast of the Americas , HMS Zealous generally used her sails and covered more miles under sail than any of the other Victorian sailing ironclads , and in her whole career never once travelled in company with another ironclad . She was also the first British ironclad to sail further from Britain than the Mediterranean . 
 = M. P. Bajana = 
 Manek <unk> Bajana ( 14 September 1886 – 28 April 1927 ) was an Indian amateur cricketer who played 55 first @-@ class cricket matches between 1911 and 1920 . Originally a member of the Indian team which toured England in 1911 , he remained in the country and joined Somerset County Cricket Club , for which he played as an opening batsman until 1920 . During his nine @-@ year first @-@ class cricket career , Bajana scored 1 @,@ 975 runs at an average of 20 @.@ 78 . He scored three centuries , and made his highest score in 1920 , scoring 115 runs against Cambridge University . 
 = = Early life and Indian tour = = 
 Manek <unk> Bajana was born on 14 September 1886 in India . Leading up to 1911 , he was employed in India by Maharaja <unk> Narayan of Cooch Behar , and early that year , Bajana travelled as part of the Maharajah 's retinue to England , where Narayan was attending the coronation of King George V. In England , he joined up with the touring Indian cricket team , as one of seven Parsi players in the side . The 1911 tour was the first by a representative Indian team , and included a mix of Hindus , Parsis , Muslims , and two members of the untouchable <unk> caste . Bajana appeared in seven matches during the tour , of which four had first @-@ class status . The team did not fare very well in their contests ; the captain of the side , Maharaja <unk> Singh of Patiala , only played three matches and spent the rest of his time socialising with the British high society , and there were rumours of sectarianism between the Parsi and Hindu members of the team . In twenty @-@ three matches , they won six and lost fifteen , the remaining two being drawn . Bajana was one of four batsmen to score a first @-@ class century for the Indians ; he struck 108 against Somerset at Taunton . On his first @-@ class debut , Bajana suffered the ignominy of a pair – dismissed without scoring in both innings . During the tour , Bajana made it known that he was looking to remain in England and play county cricket . His century against Somerset drew the attention of that county , and he joined them in 1912 . 
 = = County cricketer = = 
 At the time of Bajana 's arrival in the Somerset team , the county were struggling to compete in the County Championship , and were making a financial loss . In three of the four years prior to 1912 , Somerset had finished bottom of the championship table , and there was little improvement in the final three years before the First World War , each of which resulted in a bottom @-@ three finish . The Somerset cricket historian , David Foot , records that at this time , the county 's recruitment policy was " susceptible to exotic grandeur and haughty lineage , " and suggested that a player 's cricketing ability was often a secondary consideration to their social standing . Bajana made his debut for Somerset in May 1912 , opening the batting for the county against Sussex . He scored twenty @-@ two and seven in a six @-@ wicket victory for his county . In the subsequent match , against Hampshire , Bajana scored his first half @-@ century in county cricket , hitting 71 runs in the second innings ; the highest score of any Somerset batsman in the match . He passed 50 on three further occasions that year , and along with Len Braund and Ernie Robson , was ever @-@ present in the Somerset team that season . His year 's aggregate of 575 runs in the County Championship , and his score of 95 , made against Worcestershire in August , were both the county 's best that season , in a year in which no player scored a century for Somerset . 
 Bajana appeared less frequently for Somerset in 1913 , playing ten matches for the county . He only scored one half @-@ century , accruing 78 runs against Derbyshire . His batting average of 19 @.@ 75 in 1913 placed him fourth in the Somerset batting averages . He did not play for Somerset in 1914 , and the outbreak of the First World War suspended county cricket until 1919 . During the war Bajana played , and captained , a number of matches for the Indian Gymkhana Cricket Club , and scored a century for the team against a New Zealand APS side in 1918 . 
 In 1919 , Bajana returned to the Somerset team , playing in six of their twelve County Championship matches . His batting average of 27 @.@ 55 in that competition was the second @-@ highest amongst his team , bettered only by Jack <unk> . Bajana hit two half @-@ centuries during the season , scoring 77 against Derbyshire , and 59 against Essex . The following 1920 season was Bajana 's last with Somerset . He appeared fifteen times for the county in first @-@ class cricket , averaging just over twenty . In a match against Cambridge University , he achieved his highest first @-@ class score , hitting 14 fours on his way to a total of 115 runs in 135 minutes . In his next match , he scored a second century for Somerset , and his only one in the County Championship , scoring 106 runs against Warwickshire . Bajana played his final first @-@ class match against Middlesex in August 1920 , scoring six and a duck . In all , Bajana scored 1 @,@ 975 first @-@ class runs at an average of 20 @.@ 78 . He scored three centuries and seven half @-@ centuries in 96 innings . He was rarely used as a bowler , and took four wickets at an average of 33 @.@ 00 . 
 = = Personal and later life = = 
 In his history of Somerset cricket , David Foot describes Bajana as a " smallish solidly built opening bat " . During his time at Somerset , he was known as " Pyjamas " , which sounds similar to his surname . He played for Shepherd 's Bush Cricket Club from his arrival in England , and was part of a strong batting line @-@ up for the club . For a time , he ran an antiques and art dealership in Bayswater , London with Constantine Diamandis , but they dissolved their partnership in early 1920 . After the conclusion of his first @-@ class cricket career , he continued to play for Indian Gymkhana , including matches at Lord 's against the Marylebone Cricket Club in each of 1922 , 1923 and 1924 . He died in Bethnal Green , London on 28 April 1927 at the age of 40 . 
 = Rosecroft Raceway = 
 Rosecroft Raceway , nicknamed the " Raceway by the Beltway " for being close to Interstate 495 , is a harness racing track in Fort Washington , Maryland . It first opened in 1949 and was owned by William E. Miller , a horse trainer and breeder . Rosecroft quickly became Prince George 's County 's political and social center , drawing thousands of people there each racing day . In the early 1950s , average attendance was more than 7 @,@ 000 per day . After Miller died in 1954 , his son John owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969 . Rosecroft hosted memorial stake races annually for both William and John until 1995 . Following the death of John Miller , Earle Brown controlled operations until he moved to a different position in 1980 ; William E. Miller II took over following Brown . 
 Rosecroft was sold to Mark Vogel in 1987 . Vogel made several mistakes that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland . Three years later , he was arrested for possession of cocaine , and his company went into bankruptcy . Rosecroft was sold to Weisman 's Colt Enterprises in 1991 . In that same year , the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $ 3 @.@ 6 million . In 1995 , after losing millions , the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises . In the 2000s , Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times , but due to lawsuits and politics , all the potential buyers became uninterested . Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks . Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle ( daily betting turnover ) , and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money . After filing for bankruptcy once again , Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010 . The next year , Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a <unk> , and Rosecroft reopened in 2011 . 
 Throughout Rosecroft 's history , it has featured notable races . From 1984 to 1988 , it hosted segments of the Breeders Crown . Starting in 1990 and ending in 1995 , the racetrack hosted the Messenger Stakes , the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers . Rosecroft hosted the Potomac Stakes , Maryland most successful harness race , from 1990 to 1992 . Rosecroft features the Maryland Sire Stakes , which showcases the best <unk> horses in Maryland . Besides the races , Rosecroft has had famous people and horses work and race at the track . John Wager , Maryland 's all @-@ time most winning driver , has been working at Rosecroft since 1974 . Several famous people — Lyndon B. Johnson , Elizabeth Taylor , and Nancy Pelosi , among others — have visited Rosecroft . Cam 's Card Shark raced at Rosecroft in 1994 and challenged the single @-@ season record for most money won in a season by winning over $ 2 million , and Robust Hanover set a track record while winning the Breeders Crown in 1985 .

 In September 1947 , a meeting was held about bringing a harness racetrack to Maryland , specifically Prince George 's County , and Rosecroft was chosen to be the site . William E. Miller — a future harness racing Immortal and horse breeder — founded Rosecroft Raceway in 1949 . It was the first raceway to be owned by horse owners , horse trainers , and jockeys . Rosecroft was originally the WE Miller Stables and was located next to the Rosecroft Stock Farm , where horses were bred . The racetrack cost $ 800 @,@ 000 to construct and was " first class in every respect " . The Washington Post estimated a crowd of 12 @,@ 000 on its opening day of May 26 , 1949 , but rain cancelled the races . Rosecroft 's first night of racing was May 27 , 1949 when 6 @,@ 000 people showed up and $ 164 @,@ 501 was wagered . The handle was the second @-@ highest ever recorded for a night trotting track on an opening night . 
 For years , Rosecroft Raceway held an annual sale of yearling Standardbred horses . It hosted the annual Maryland Sire Stake Races to promote the best of Maryland @-@ bred horses . When Rosecroft opened , it became the political and social center for Prince George 's County , Maryland . Each year during the Miller era , several thousand people traveled from across the country to wager on and watch the horses . In 1953 , Rosecroft 's attendance of 192 @,@ 585 was the highest among all harness tracks in Maryland . Owners , trainers , and drivers from across the United States moved their farms to Maryland in the 1950s following the opening of Rosecroft , hoping to compete with the best horses . 
 In 1954 , William E. Miller died from a heart attack while driving a horse at Harrington Raceway . After Miller 's death , Rosecroft hosted the William E. Miller Memorial race . Over the years , this race attracted several notable horses , including Cam 's Card Shark , the 1994 Horse of the Year . John W. Miller , William 's son , owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969 . In 1961 , the owners of Rosecroft resurfaced and regraded the track . Following John , Earle Brown owned the racetrack . John Wager , Maryland 's all @-@ time most winning driver , started to work at Rosecroft in 1974 . Earle Brown moved to a different position at the racetrack in 1980 and William E. Miller II , William E. Miller 's grandson , took over operations . 
 In 1984 , the Hambletonian Society created the Breeders Crown , a traveling series of races to showcase the best 2 @-@ year @-@ old and 3 @-@ year @-@ old horses throughout North American and Canada . In the inaugural year , Rosecroft was awarded with a race . Rosecroft hosted the 2 @-@ Year @-@ Old Pace of the 1985 Breeders Crown , where Robust Hanover won . 
 = = = Mark Vogel : 1987 – 1990 = = = 
 Mark Vogel , a Maryland real estate agent , purchased both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs Racetrack in 1987 for $ 6 million in cash plus $ 5 @.@ 5 million in debt . Rosecroft was awarded another Breeders Crown race in 1988 , making it their fifth straight — but final — year of hosting them . Vogel had three main goals when he became owner : to construct a $ 10 million grandstand , simulcast Rosecroft races at other racetracks throughout Maryland to attract a larger market , and have more racing days . In 1989 , Vogel purchased Freestate Raceway . Freestate was sold to a development firm the next year , and Rosecroft was awarded more racing days . 
 According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder , Vogel did not know the horse racing business and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland . The year @-@ round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals . Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market , and attendance figures declined . He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft . Instead , Vogel focused more on his real estate business . As a result , the attendance dropped . Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business . Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners . Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing , more specially to allow off @-@ track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools . 
 Starting in 1990 , Rosecroft Raceway hosted the Messenger Stakes , one of the races for the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers . Rosecroft attracted the Potomac Stakes , Maryland 's most successful race , starting in that year . The Potomac Stakes was previously held at Freestate Raceway and generated one @-@ million @-@ dollar @-@ plus handles on several occasions . On a September 1990 night , $ 1 @,@ 195 @,@ 681 was wagered by bettors , becoming the then @-@ largest handle in Rosecroft 's history . This record was broken on May 3 , 2003 when $ 1 @,@ 564 @,@ 150 was wagered . Vogel was arrested in September 1990 for possession of cocaine , and his company filed for bankruptcy protection . 
 = = = Weisman 's Colt Enterprises : 1991 – 1995 = = = 
 In 1991 , two people were interested in buying the track : Fred Weisman , a California businessman , and former National Football League player Mark May . Weisman out @-@ bid May and purchased Rosecroft out of bankruptcy for $ 18 @.@ 2 million . On November 23 of the same year , the grandstand caught fire a few hours before live racing began . In Weisman 's first full season of operations , Rosecroft experienced a 10 @.@ 5 percent increase in handle and an 8 @.@ 3 percent increase in attendance . In 1992 , Western Hanover , the richest horse of that year , won two of the three Triple Crown races , including the Messenger Stakes at Rosecroft . Rosecroft Raceway went into the record books on October 10 , 1992 , when a three @-@ horse dead heat occurred in the seventh race . It was the 17th time in harness @-@ racing history and the first time in Maryland history . 
 The new grandstand was completed for $ 3 @.@ 6 million in 1993 . Since Rosecroft had expanded its simulcasting rights , the new grandstand incorporated large @-@ screen televisions and betting windows . For the 1993 season , Rosecroft 's officials decided to stop hosting the five stake races — The Potomac , the Lady Baltimore , The <unk> , The Turtle Dove , and The North American — inherited when Freestate Raceway closed . The handle was decreasing , and the officials could not afford the purses for the races . To help increase the handle , Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter @-@ track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off @-@ track betting parlors throughout the state . 
 In September 1994 , Weisman died from pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles , California , and his relatives took over the racetrack . Although attendance and handle were increasing , the owners were losing money . Reports by independent auditors stated Rosecroft and Ocean Downs combined to lose $ 1 @.@ 1 million in fiscal year ( FY ) 1992 , $ 1 @.@ 4 million in FY 1993 , and $ 6 @.@ 2 million in FY 1994 . According to Rosecroft 's racing official Allan Levey , Weisman 's relatives did not want to operate the track and their only goal was to sell it . For the 1995 season , Rosecroft could not afford the payment to host five stake races — including the Messenger Stakes — and dropped them from the racing schedule . 
 = = = Cloverleaf Enterprises : 1995 – 2010 = = = 
 Throughout 1995 , Rosecroft was forced to cut costs . Its owners lowered the amount of purse money , eliminated stake races , and reduced the number of racing days . They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to Cloverleaf Enterprises , a horseman 's organization , in mid @-@ 1995 for $ 11 million . Weisman 's Colt Enterprises reported that if the racetrack could not be sold , the company would have to file for bankruptcy . Cloverleaf accepted a $ 10 @.@ 6 million loan from Bally Entertainment in hopes that a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft . 
 In 1994 , the Delaware General Assembly approved slot machines for the state 's three racetracks , and the first <unk> opened in December 1995 . This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware , as approximately 10 percent of all gross revenue is used to increase the purses . This drew competition away from Maryland . Rosecroft could not fill up a 12 @-@ race card for its opening night during the 1996 season . An estimated $ 80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware 's casinos . Throughout the years , various politicians tried to bring slot machines or table games to Rosecroft , but all were unsuccessful . 
 In the 2000s , Cloverleaf tried to sell Rosecroft multiple times . In mid @-@ 2002 , several buyers became interested in the track , but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits , so the track could not be sold . One bidder was Peter Angelos , the owner of the Baltimore Orioles , but he withdrew in 2005 . All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006 , and only one remaining bidder was left — Penn National Gaming . Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007 , but Rosecroft was not one of the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law . As a result , Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track . From the gambling revenue , 7 percent goes to the horse @-@ racing industry . 
 Cloverleaf announced Rosecroft would close on July 1 , 2010 . Live racing ended in 2009 , and the track only had simulcasts as revenue from off @-@ track betting . After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos , Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business . Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009 . Mark Vogel loaned the track $ 350 @,@ 000 and offered to buy the track , but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan . Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino @-@ style gambling at Rosecroft , but that did not occur . In early June 2010 , Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy .

Penn National said it planned to return live racing and simulcast wagering to the track as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games . Penn National said it was hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track , even though voters did not approve Prince George 's County as a gambling location . On July 28 , 2011 , the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $ 1 @.@ 4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 . Penn National said it was likely to incur $ 2 @.@ 3 million in losses through 2013 . 
 Penn National wanted Rosecroft to begin simulcasting races in late August 2011 . Disputes between tracks and <unk> about revenues , however , led to a delay in reaching new agreements on broadcast rights . In the 2011 , the Maryland legislature passed a bill that required all parties to enter into mediation . If mediation was not successful by October 1 , 2011 , then an arbitrator was required to help . To resolve a conflict of interest , Penn National sold its financial stake in the Maryland Jockey Club 's in July 2011 . In August 2011 , Rosecroft made public its plans for adding a casino at Rosecroft . It planned to destroy the grandstand and build a casino with approximately 4 @,@ 700 slot machines alongside the track . 
 An agreement on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25 , 2011 . Rosecroft owed $ 1 @.@ 24 million in unpaid disbursements under its previous simulcast license , and the parties were negotiating about how much of this debt Penn National would pay . Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day . Penn National also announced its intent to spend $ 1 million in the coming year to renovate the property , which would include razing old horse barns , putting a new roof on the betting parlors , and upgrading the HVAC system . 
 A bill was introduced into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George 's County . The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft . The bill passed the Senate , but the House did not vote on it . The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George 's County , which was passed via referendum in November 2012 . After one season of live racing , Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft for the next two years . The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George 's County casino .

 = Rainbow ( Mariah Carey album ) = 
 Rainbow is the seventh studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was released on November 2 , 1999 , by Columbia Records . The album followed the same pattern as Carey 's previous album , Butterfly ( 1997 ) , in which she began her transition into the R & B market . Rainbow contains a mix of hip @-@ hop @-@ influenced R & B jams , as well as a variety of slow ballads . On the album , Carey worked with David Foster and Diane Warren , who , as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis , replaced Walter Afanasieff , the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 90s . As a result of her separation from her husband , Tommy Mottola , Carey had more control over the musical style of this album , so she collaborated with several artists such as Jay @-@ Z , Usher , and Snoop Dogg , as well as Missy Elliott , Joe , Da Brat , Master P , Eve , Lil ' Kim , 98 ° , Phil Collins and Mystikal . 
 On Carey 's previous album , Butterfly , she began incorporating several other genres , including R & B , soul and hip @-@ hop , into her musical repertoire . In order to further push her musical horizons , Carey featured Jay @-@ Z on the album 's lead single , the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles . Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R & B than pop for this album , and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as " Crybaby " and " How Much " , both of which featured strong R & B beats and grooves . Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period , including " Thank God I Found You " ( written with Terry Lewis ) and " After Tonight " ( written with Diane Warren ) , mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life . 
 Upon release , Rainbow received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics . While many celebrated Carey 's continued musical departure from her adult contemporary past , some felt the album was not as strong or as distinct as Butterfly . The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 , with first week sales of 323 @,@ 000 . It was her first album in years to not reach number one . Rainbow was certified triple @-@ platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States . Outside the US , the album debuted atop the charts in France , and within the top five in Australia , Austria , Belgium , the Netherlands , Germany , Japan , and Switzerland . In Europe , Rainbow was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , denoting shipments of one million copies throughout the continent . As of 2004 , the album has sold in excess of seven million copies worldwide . 
 Five singles were released from the album . The album 's lead single , " Heartbreaker " featuring Jay @-@ Z , became Carey 's fourteenth number @-@ one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 , and topped the charts in Canada , New Zealand , France and Spain . " Thank God I Found You " , featuring Joe and 98 Degrees , also topped the Hot 100 , but achieved moderate international charting . The next two singles , " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) and " Crybaby " featuring Snoop Dogg , were released as a double A @-@ side . The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony due to Sony 's alleged weak promotion of the singles . Carey 's cover of Phil Collins " Against All Odds ( Take a Look at Me Now ) " with Westlife peaked at number one in Brazil , Ireland and the United Kingdom . 
 = = Background = = 
 Since her debut in 1990 , Carey 's career was heavily calculated and controlled by her husband and head of her label Sony Music Entertainment , Tommy Mottola . For years , Carey 's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads , devoid of any guest appearances or hip @-@ hop . In January 1995 , as she recorded Daydream , Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences . She enlisted the production skills and rap styles of Ol ' Dirty Bastard , who was featured on the remix of her song " Fantasy " . While Mottola was hesitant at first , Carey 's influence paid off : the song became an international chart topper , with critics calling their joint performance one of the pioneering songs of pop and R & B musical collaborations . 
 During the recording and production of Carey 's Butterfly in 1997 , the couple separated , leaving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album . Following their separation , Carey began working with younger hip @-@ hop and R & B producers and songwriters , aside from her usual work with balladeers Walter Afanasieff and Kenneth Edmonds . While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey 's previous releases , Butterfly also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R & B @-@ infused jams . While Sony accepted Carey 's new collaborations with writers and producers such as P. Diddy and Bone Thugs @-@ n @-@ Harmony , they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads . After " Honey " , the debut single from Butterfly , was released in August 1997 , Sony halted the release of the succeeding R & B @-@ influenced jams , and released the ballad " My All " as the second worldwide single . Rainbow followed in its predecessors ' footsteps , becoming even more drenched in modern hip @-@ hop and R & B. 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 During the spring of 1999 , Carey began working on the final album of her record contract with Sony , her ex @-@ husband 's label . Carey 's lover at the time , Luis Miguel , was in the midst of a European tour . In order to spend more time with him , she opted to record the album on the secluded island of Capri , Italy , figuring the seclusion would also help her complete the album sooner . During this time , Carey 's strained relationship with Sony affected her work with writing partner Afanasieff , who had worked extensively with Carey throughout the first half of her career . Aside from their growing creative differences , Mottola had given Afanasieff more opportunities to work with other artists . She felt Mottola was trying to separate her from Afanasieff , in hopes of keeping their relationship permanently strained . Due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had now developed with Sony , she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999 , quicker than any of her other albums . In an interview with Blitz TV , Carey spoke of her decision to record the album in Capri : 
 I love New York . But if I 'm there , I want to go out , friends come to the studio , the phone rings constantly . But in Capri , I am in a remote place , and there is no one I can run into . I felt that in Capri I would be able to effectively finish the album on a shorter schedule . And I did . I made it in three months , I was like ' Get me off this label ! ' I couldn 't take it . The situation there [ Sony ] was becoming increasingly difficult . 
 Like her previous releases , Carey co @-@ wrote and co @-@ produced the album 's material , working with several hip @-@ hop and R & B producers such as Jay @-@ Z , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , Usher , Snoop Dogg , Missy Elliott , Jermaine Dupri , and Brian Michael Cox . For the album 's debut single release , Carey collaborated with Jay @-@ Z and DJ Clue . During the spring of 1999 , Carey began working with Clue on several hooks and melodies for the lead single . After a few hours , they decided to include a hip @-@ hop star on the track , which eventually led to Jay @-@ Z. Carey 's longtime friend and back @-@ up vocalist Trey Lorenz , who was featured on her remake of the Jackson 5 song " I 'll Be There " , added " some soft male [ back @-@ up ] vocals . " Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad " Thank God I Found You " . She had already been in the studio with the duo several times when she contacted them to meet her at the studio , where she told them that she had come up with the title , hook , and melody . Usually , when Carey was writing the songs for Rainbow , James " Big Jim " Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the " right melody " . However , since Wright was not present , Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her lower registers , providing the chord progression . They composed the song and recorded Carey 's vocals . Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track , Lewis brought R & B singer Joe and pop group 98 Degrees into the studio . After a few hours , the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete . In an interview with Bronson , Lewis discussed the night Carey wrote " Thank God I Found You : " 
 It all happened that night . She told us the title of the song , the concept and sang us the melody . We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the <unk> he wasn 't there so I had to work on the chord myself . So I was playing and there was a part where I said ' Man , what chord am I supposed to do here ? ' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord . 
 While the album was immersed further into mainstream R & B territory , Carey included some of her classic ballads and tender love songs on the album , working with writers and producers such as David Foster and Diane Warren . The idea to work with Warren was suggested by Foster , who thought that the two would be able to " hammer out one hell of a ballad " together . The two wrote and produced the song titled " After Tonight " . Carey felt the song was a perfect metaphor for her relationship with Miguel , describing their romance in Capri . While the song was deemed a success by both parties , they described their working relationship with mixed feelings . According to Foster , who was involved in the writing session , Carey and Warren would not always agree on the lyrics and melodious structure of the song . He described it as a " give and take relationship " ; Warren would offer lyrics and Carey would not like them ; she wanted something more intricate and detailed . Carey would produce a hook or lyrics that Warren did not feel were a perfect fit . In the end , Foster felt that they worked " well together " . After recording the song , Carey invited Miguel to record the song with her as a duet . However , after recording his verses several times , Foster and Carey realized that the song would not turn out the way they planned . Foster said the song 's key was " too high for him " ; the voices did not harmonize well . Carey did not have time to re @-@ record her vocals in a lower key to accommodate Miguel 's verses . Miguel , furious over the failed collaboration , later sent a cut @-@ up tape of the demo to Foster . Carey , Warren , and Foster also wrote " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " , one of the other ballads featured on Rainbow . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 As with Butterfly , songs for Rainbow were chosen to solidify Carey 's reputation as a multi @-@ genre artist . Throughout the first phase of her career , Carey 's albums predominantly consisted of pop and adult contemporary ballads . Rainbow mixed hip hop and R & B @-@ flavored upbeat songs with softer and lyrically intense ballads resembling those that Carey had previously recorded . " Heartbreaker " , Carey 's first collaboration with Jay @-@ Z , used a sample from " Attack of the Name Game " , recorded by Stacy Lattisaw , as its hook . The loop originated from " The Name Game " by Shirley Ellis ; Ellis and co @-@ writer Lincoln Chase are credited as songwriters on the track . Carey incorporated the hook into the song 's melody , and added instrumentation . Lyrically , the song chronicles the heartbreak the protagonist feels after learning of her lover 's infidelity . " Thank God I Found You " features vocals from Joe and 98 Degrees , as well as songwriting and production from Carey and Lewis . According to Carey , the song reflects on events in her own life at the time , with the lyrics describing the completion the protagonist feels after " finding " their lover . Joe provides the main male vocal throughout each verse , and 98 Degrees sing the background vocals and the bridge . 
 Prior to the album 's recording , Mariah and her sister , Alison Carey had a falling out in their relationship . Alison had contracted AIDS in 1988 , when she was 27 , and in 1994 she blamed Mariah for many of her problems and heartbreaks throughout the years . Her children were taken away while she received treatment for AIDS and for mental health issues . Carey wrote a song titled " Petals " , which she describes as the most honest lyrics she has ever written . The song tells of Carey 's feelings for her sister , while illustrating the pain Allison 's betrayal and suffering have caused . In an interview with Bronson , Carey described the meaning of the lyrics of " Petals " : 
 It is a great outlet for me to go into the studio and write a song like ' Petals ' , which is one of my most personal songs and remains one of my favorites . I think [ it had the most ] honest lyrics I 've ever written . The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I 've felt to certain people close to me , and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally . For that reason , I sang in my lower registers , trying to add that breathy effect to go hand in hand with the song 's composition . 
 " After Tonight " was a song Carey wrote with David Foster and Diane Warren . Carey had strong feelings about the song , as she wrote it about her relationship with Luis Miguel . The song was compared instrumentally to " My All " from Butterfly , which features traces of Latin and guitar instrumentation . In the lyrics , the protagonist asks her lover if he will still love her and come back to her " after tonight " . Carey 's cover of the Phil Collins song " Against All Odds ( Take a Look at Me Now ) " was originally intended to be a solo ballad . The song was re @-@ done after the album was released , with music by the Irish band Westlife replacing the song 's instrumental bridge . " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " was one of the album 's most uplifting ballads , lyrically serving as an anthem for fans and listeners . The message , Carey said , was a personal theme of hers growing up , of not letting others " bring her down " and not allowing them to take away the light inside her . " How Much " is a duet with Usher and features a sample from Tupac Shakur 's " Me and My Girlfriend " . 
 = = Conflict with Sony = = 
 As with Butterfly two years earlier , Rainbow became the center of conflict between Carey and her label . After her divorce from Sony record official and Columbia CEO Tommy Mottola , Carey 's working relationship with the label deteriorated . She intended for " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " to be the third single from Rainbow , as it held very personal lyrical content . However , Sony made it clear that they intended the third single should be a more upbeat and urban track . The difference in opinion led to a very public feud , as Carey began posting messages on her webpage in early and mid @-@ 2000 , telling fans inside information on the dispute , as well as instructing them to request " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " on radio stations . One of the messages Carey left on her page read : 
 Basically , a lot of you know the political situation in my professional career is not positive . It 's been really , really hard . I don 't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don 't know if they want you to hear this . I 'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people . But I am not willing to give up . 
 Carey 's actions were given mixed reception , with critics and executives commending her bold actions regarding a song she felt needed to be heard , while others criticized her for publicizing the dispute further . Soon after , Sony stripped Carey 's webpage of messages and began negotiations . Fearing to lose their label 's highest seller and the best @-@ selling artist of the decade , Sony chose to release the song . Carey , initially content with the agreement , soon found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low @-@ promotion release , which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart , and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Rainbow garnered mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics . The album 's main criticism was its lack of originality , as it failed to improve upon her previous opus , Butterfly . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic awarded the album three out of five stars , complimenting it as " the first Carey album where she 's written personal lyrics , and allusions to her separation from Mottola . " He called the lyrics " true " and " deep " , but criticized the lack of originality . Erlewine alluded to Rainbow as " ballad @-@ heavy " and " repetitious " , writing how the album followed the formula of Carey 's previous album too precisely . Erlewine ended his review on a mixed note , writing " Rainbow proves that she can still pull off that difficult balancing act , but it 's hard not to be a little disappointed that she 'd didn 't shake the music up a little bit more – after all , it would have been a more effective album if the heartbreak , sorrow , and joy that bubbles underneath the music were brought to the surface . " 
 Arion Berger , an editor from Rolling Stone , also gave the album three out of five stars . He felt Rainbow was a genuine R & B and hip @-@ hop album , calling it a " sterling chronicle of the state of accessible hip @-@ hop balladeering at the close of 1999 . " Aside from calling some of the ballads " banal " , Berger concluded his review with " Rainbow is at its best — and Carey at her most comfortable — when urbane hip @-@ hop stylings and faux R & B coexist in smooth middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road harmony . " Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a two @-@ star honorable mention ( ) , indicating a " likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy . " Christgau cited " Heartbreaker " and " Crybaby " as highlights and quippedly called Carey " not a ' real ' r & b thrush , but good enough to fake it . " Amy Linden from Vibe was unimpressed with the album , writing " I don 't care about it anymore . " While complimenting the album 's genre influences and featured musical guests , Linden felt Rainbow was not original . She concluded her review with " ' Rainbow ' will garner her even more adoration . As for me ? I 'll be okay . " Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly gave Rainbow a B + , and concluded " what began on Butterfly as a departure ends up on Rainbow a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey 's true colors as an artist . " Elysa Gardner from the Los Angeles Times gave Rainbow three and a half out of four stars . She complimented the album 's strong blend of breezy R & B cuts , as well as the lyrically , vocally , and melodically strong ballads . " Exhibiting an emotional authority to match her technical prowess , Carey gives us a vision of love that 's dynamic without being ostentatious , " she wrote . Steve Jones from USA Today gave Rainbow three out of four stars , calling it " colorful " and " some of her most compelling work . "

The song received mixed reviews from critics . Arion <unk> from Rolling Stone called the song Carey 's " most insinuating : nasal , silken , declarative , riding the percolating beat . " However , while dismissing some of the song 's vocals and the incorporation of the hook , he complimented its marriage of pop and hip @-@ hop through Jay @-@ Z 's verses . Robert Christgau named the song one of his favorites from Rainbow , calling it " real R & B " . The song 's music video became one of the most expensive music videos of all time , costing an estimated $ 2 @.@ 5 million .

 " Crybaby " and " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " were released simultaneously as a double A @-@ side , with very limited promotion from Sony .

 The San Giorgio class consisted of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the first decade of the 20th century . The second ship , San Marco , was used to evaluate recently invented steam turbines in a large ship and incorporated a number of other technological advances . The ships participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , although San Giorgio was under repair for most of the war . San Marco supported ground forces in Libya with naval gunfire and helped them to occupy towns in Libya and islands in the Dodecanese . During World War I , the ships ' activities were limited by the threat of Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines , although they did bombard Durazzo , Albania in 1918 . 
 San Giorgio spent several years in the Far East and Italian Somaliland after the war and became a training ship in 1931 . After a brief deployment to Spain in 1936 , she was reconstructed to better serve her role as a training ship . The ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was augmented when she was deployed to Tobruk , Libya to reinforce the port 's defenses after Italy declared war on Britain in May 1940 . San Giorgio was scuttled in early 1941 when Allied forces were poised to capture the port . Her wreck was salvaged in 1952 , but sank while under tow . San Marcos was converted into a target ship in the early 1930s and was found sunk at the end of the war . She was scrapped in 1949 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The San Giorgio class was ordered almost immediately after the preceding Pisa @-@ class ships , and was an improved version of that design . The forecastle was extended to improve seaworthiness , turret armor was increased , habitability was improved and the propulsion machinery was redistributed . San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship for comparative purposes with San Giorgio , which retained the traditional vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines ( VTE ) . San Marco was a very innovative ship as she was the first turbine @-@ powered ship in any navy to have four propeller shafts , the first with a gyroscopic compass , the first with <unk> tanks , and the first not to use wood in any way . 
 The San Giorgio @-@ class ships had a length between perpendiculars of 131 @.@ 04 meters ( 429 ft 11 in ) and an overall length of 140 @.@ 89 meters ( 462 ft 3 in ) . They had a beam of 21 @.@ 03 meters ( 69 ft 0 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 35 – 7 @.@ 76 meters ( 24 ft 1 in – 25 ft 6 in ) . The ships displaced 10 @,@ 167 – 10 @,@ 969 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 006 – 10 @,@ 796 long tons ) at normal load , and 11 @,@ 300 – 11 @,@ 900 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 100 – 11 @,@ 700 long tons ) at deep load . The ships had a complement of 32 officers and 666 to 673 enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The machinery installation of this class was changed in comparison to that of the Pisa class , with the engines amidships with the 14 mixed @-@ firing water @-@ tube boilers fore and aft of the engines . Their exhausts were trunked together into two widely spaced pairs of funnels . Designed for a maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) , the two ships were given different types of propulsion machinery for evaluation . San Giorgio 's two shafts , pair of 19 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 500 kW ) VTE steam engines and Blechynden boilers differed only slightly from those used by the <unk> . In contrast , San Marco 's four shafts , each driven by a license @-@ built Parsons steam turbine , was a first for the Regia Marina . The turbines used steam provided by Babcock & Wilcox boilers at a working pressure of 210 psi ( 1 @,@ 448 kPa ; 15 kgf / cm2 ) to reach their designed output of 23 @,@ 000 shp ( 17 @,@ 000 kW ) . Both ships exceeded their designed speeds , with San Giorgio reaching 23 @.@ 2 knots ( 43 @.@ 0 km / h ; 26 @.@ 7 mph ) and San Marco 23 @.@ 75 knots ( 43 @.@ 99 km / h ; 27 @.@ 33 mph ) during their sea trials . The biggest difference between the sisters was that the turbines of San Marco proved to be significantly less economical in service ( a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and 2 @,@ 480 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 590 km ; 2 @,@ 850 mi ) at 21 @.@ 25 knots ( 39 @.@ 36 km / h ; 24 @.@ 45 mph ) ) compared to San Giorgio 's VTE steam engines ( 6 @,@ 270 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 610 km ; 7 @,@ 220 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and 2 @,@ 640 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 890 km ; 3 @,@ 040 mi ) at 21 @.@ 25 knots ( 39 @.@ 36 km / h ; 24 @.@ 45 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament of the San Giorgio @-@ class ships consisted of four Cannone da 254 / 45 A Modello 1907 guns in electrically powered , twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The turrets had an arc of fire of 260 ° . The 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) gun fired 204 @.@ 1 – 226 @.@ 8 @-@ kilogram ( 450 – 500 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 870 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 850 ft / s ) . At maximum elevation of + 25 ° , the guns had a range of about 25 @,@ 000 meters ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) . The ships mounted eight Cannone da 190 / 45 A Modello 1908 in four electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets , two in each side amidships , as their secondary armament . Their arc of fire was 160 ° . These Armstrong Whitworth 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) guns fired 90 @.@ 9 @-@ kilogram ( 200 lb ) AP shells at 864 – 892 m / s ( 2 @,@ 835 – 2 @,@ 927 ft / s ) . At maximum elevation of + 25 ° , the guns had a range of about 22 @,@ 000 meters ( 24 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 For defense against torpedo boats , the San Giorgios mounted 18 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 40 @-@ caliber 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns . Eight of these were mounted in embrasures in the sides of the hull and the rest in the superstructure . The ships were also fitted with a pair of QF 40 @-@ caliber 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns . The San Giorgio @-@ class ships were equipped with three submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . During World War I , eight of the 76 mm guns were replaced by six 76 mm anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns and one torpedo tube was removed . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The ships were protected by an armored belt that was 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) at the bow and stern . The belt was 2 @.@ 2 m ( 7 ft 3 in ) high , of which 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 ft 11 in ) was below the waterline . The armored deck was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick and the conning tower armor was 254 mm thick . The 254 mm gun turrets were protected by 200 mm of armour while the 190 mm turrets had 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) .

 San Giorgio ran aground in August 1911 off Naples @-@ Posillipo ; heavily damaged , she was under repair until June 1912 , missing most of the Italo @-@ Turkish War . San Marco supported the occupations of Benghazi and Derna , Libya during the war and bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the Dardanelles . She also supported the forces occupying the island of Rhodes in May 1912 . In February 1913 , San Giorgio cruised the Aegean Sea and made a port visit to Salonica , Greece , the next month . She ran aground again on 21 November in the Strait of Messina , but was only slightly damaged . 
 During World War I , the activities of the ships were restricted by the threat of submarine attack after the armored cruisers Giuseppe Garibaldi and Amalfi were sunk by submarines shortly after Italy joined the war in May 1915 , although the ships did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo , Albania in late 1918 . 
 After the war , San Giorgio was deployed to the Far East while San Marcos played a minor role in the Corfu incident in 1923 . San Giorgio , escorted by San Marco , ferried Crown Prince Umberto to South America in July – September 1924 , and then supported operations in Italian Somaliland in 1925 – 26 . The ship was disarmed and converted into a radio @-@ controlled target ship in 1931 – 35 ; her old boilers were replaced by four oil @-@ burning ones which reduced her maximum speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She was captured by the Germans when they occupied La Spezia on 9 September 1943 ; San Marcos was found at the end of the war half @-@ sunk in the harbor there and was broken up in 1949 . 
 From 1930 to 1935 , San Giorgio was based in Pola as a training ship , and was sent to Spain after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936 to protect Italian interests . In 1937 – 38 she was reconstructed to serve as a dedicated training ship for naval cadets at the Arsenale di La Spezia : six boilers were removed and the remaining eight were converted to burn fuel oil which reduced her speed to 16 – 17 knots ( 30 – 31 km / h ; 18 – 20 mph ) . Each pair of funnels was trunked together and her 76 / 40 guns were replaced by 47 @-@ caliber 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns in four twin turrets abreast the funnels . Her torpedo tubes were also removed while she received a light AA suite for the first time , with the addition of six 54 @-@ caliber Breda 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , a dozen 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Breda Model 35 autocannon and four 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) Breda Model 31 machine guns in two twin mounts . 
 Prior to her being sent to reinforce the defenses of Tobruk in early May 1940 , a fifth 100 / 47 gun turret was added on the forecastle and five more twin 13 @.@ 2 mm machine gun mounts were added to better suit her new role as a floating battery . Two days after Italy declared war on Britain on 10 June , the British light cruisers Gloucester and Southampton bombarded Tobruk and attacked San Giorgio , which was not hit during the engagement . A British submarine fired two torpedoes at San Giorgio on 19 June , but these detonated before reaching the ship . The ship 's guns engaged Allied aircraft attacking Tobruk many times , destroying several . She was scuttled in shallow water on 22 January 1941 to prevent her capture during the Battle of Tobruk . San Giorgio was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour ( Medaglia d 'Oro al Valore Militare ) for her performance at Tobruk . Her wreck was refloated in 1952 , but sank under tow en route to Italy .

 Oxford United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Oxford , Oxfordshire , England . The team play in League One , the third tier of English football . The chairman is Darryl Eales , the head coach is Michael Appleton and the team captain is John <unk> . 
 Founded in 1893 as Headington United , Oxford United adopted their current name in 1960 . They joined the Football League in 1962 after winning the Southern Football League , reaching the Second Division in 1968 . After relegation in 1976 , between 1984 and 1986 the club earned successive promotions into the First Division , and won the League Cup in 1986 . Oxford were unable to enter the 1987 UEFA Cup because of the UEFA ban on English clubs in European competitions . Relegation from the top flight in 1988 began an 18 @-@ year decline which saw the club relegated to the Conference in 2006 . This was the first time in the history of English football that a team that had won a major trophy was relegated from the Football League . After four seasons , Oxford were promoted to League Two in 2010 via the playoffs , and six seasons later were promoted to League One , after finishing 2nd in League Two in 2016 . 
 Ron Atkinson holds the club record for the most overall appearances with 560 , John Shuker holds the record for the most appearances in the Football League with 478 and Ron 's brother Graham Atkinson holds the record for the most goals scored with 107 . In total , nineteen players have made international appearances while playing for the club . United 's home ground is the Kassam Stadium in Oxford and has a capacity of 12 @,@ 500 . United moved to the stadium in 2001 after leaving the Manor Ground , their home for 76 years . Swindon Town is the club 's main rival .

 = = = Headington United = = = 
 Oxford United were formed as Headington in 1893 , adding the suffix United in 1911 after merging with Headington Quarry . The club was founded by Rev. John Scott @-@ Tucker , the vicar at Saint Andrew 's Church in Headington , and a local doctor named Robert <unk> . A football team was a way for the cricketers of Headington Cricket Club to maintain their fitness during the winter break . The first football match played was against Cowley Barracks . Headington had no regular home until 1913 , when they were able to purchase Wootten 's Field on London Road , but this was redeveloped in 1920 , forcing the club to move . A permanent home was found in 1925 , when they purchased the Manor Ground site on London Road . The facility was used as a cricket pitch in the summer , and a football pitch in the winter . In 1899 , six years after their formation , Headington United joined the Oxfordshire District League Second Division , where they competed until the outbreak of the First World War ; the Second Division was renamed the Oxfordshire Junior League after the resumption of football in 1919 . In 1921 the club was admitted into the Oxon Senior League . The first season included a 9 – 0 victory , with eight of those goals coming from P. <unk> . This remains a record for the highest number of goals scored by an Oxford player in a first @-@ team match . At this time a small rivalry existed with Cowley F.C. , who were based a few miles south of Headington . During a league game on May Day , the referee gave two penalties to Cowley ; supporters broke past security and players , resulting in the referee being " freely baited " . The first FA Cup tie played was in 1931 , against Hounslow F.C. in the Preliminary Round , ending in an 8 – 2 defeat for Headington . United spent two seasons in the Spartan League in 1947 and 1948 , finishing fifth and fourth respectively . It was around this time that the cricket team left the Manor and moved to new premises near Cowley Barracks . 
 A move into professional football was first considered during the 1948 – 49 season . Vic <unk> , the president at the time , had applied for Headington to become a member of a new Second Division in the Southern League . Other teams that applied included Weymouth , Kettering Town and future league side Cambridge United . Although the plans were postponed , the First Division was going to be expanded by two clubs ; Weymouth and Headington were elected . It was later discovered that Llanelli had just one vote fewer than Headington . Oxford played its first season in the Southern League in 1949 , the same year they turned professional . Former First Division forward Harry Thompson was hired as manager . In 1950 , Headington United became the first professional club in Britain to install floodlights , and used them on 18 December against Banbury Spencer . They initially played in orange and blue shirts , but changed to yellow home shirts for the 1957 – 58 season . The reason for the change is unknown . In 1960 , Headington United was renamed Oxford United , to give the club a higher profile . 
 = = = Football League rise = = = 
 Two years later , in 1962 , the club won the Southern League title for the second successive season and was elected to the Football League Fourth Division , occupying the vacant place left by bankrupt Accrington Stanley . Two successive eighteenth @-@ place finishes followed , before promotion to the Third Division was achieved in 1965 . A year before the promotion , Oxford became the first Fourth Division club to reach the sixth round of the FA Cup , but have not progressed that far in the competition since . Oxford won the Third Division title in 1967 – 68 , their sixth season as a league club , but after eight years of relative stability the club was relegated from the Second Division in 1975 – 76 . 
 In 1982 , as a Third Division side , Oxford United faced closure because of the club 's inability to service the debts owed to Barclays Bank , but were rescued when businessman Robert Maxwell took over the club . In April 1983 , Maxwell proposed merging United with neighbours Reading , to form a new club called the Thames Valley Royals , to play at Didcot . Jim Smith would have managed the club and been assisted by Reading boss Maurice Evans . The merger was called off as a result of fans of both clubs protesting against the decision . Furthermore , the Reading chairman stepped down and was replaced by an opponent of the merger . Maxwell also threatened to fold the club if the merger did not go through . Oxford won the Third Division title after the 1983 – 84 season under the management of Jim Smith , who also guided them to the Second Division title the following year . This meant that Oxford United would be playing First Division football in the 1985 – 86 season , 23 years after joining the Football League . Smith moved to Queens Park Rangers shortly after the promotion success , and made way for chief scout Maurice Evans , who , several seasons earlier , had won the Fourth Division title with Reading . 
 = = = First Division and cup success = = = 
 Oxford United finished eighteenth in the 1985 – 86 First Division , avoiding relegation on the last day of the season after defeating Arsenal 3 – 0 . They also won the Football League Cup , known at the time as the Milk Cup under a sponsorship deal . As winners , Oxford would have qualified for the following season 's UEFA Cup , had it not been for the ban on English teams that had resulted from the previous year 's Heysel Stadium disaster . After beating fellow First Division side Aston Villa in the semi @-@ final 4 – 3 on aggregate , Oxford faced Queens Park Rangers in the final , which was held at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1986 . The game finished 3 – 0 with goals from Trevor <unk> , Ray Houghton and Jeremy Charles . After the match long @-@ serving physiotherapist , 72 @-@ year @-@ old Ken Fish , collected one of the winners medals , instead of manager Maurice Evans . Evans felt that Fish deserved the medal for his service to the club , and so gave him his , in what was seen as an " unprecedented gesture " . It was the last time the League Cup was played under the name " Milk Cup " , with sponsors Littlewoods taking over the following season . The 1986 – 87 season saw Oxford United narrowly survive relegation and stay in the First Division . Robert Maxwell resigned as chairman in May 1987 , to take over at Derby County , handing the club to his son Kevin . Maurice Evans was sacked in March 1988 with Oxford bottom of the First Division . 
 Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson was named as Oxford 's new manager , but was unable to prevent relegation to the Second Division . He was sacked three months into the 1988 – 89 Second Division campaign after a dispute with the chairman over the £ 1 million sale of striker Dean Saunders to Derby County ; Derby were owned by Robert Maxwell , father of the then Oxford United chairman , Kevin Maxwell . Following Robert Maxwell 's death in 1991 , his personal estate , including the club , became insolvent . After a long search for a new owner , during which <unk> Recycling Ltd took over the club , Brian Horton was named as Oxford 's new manager . He remained in charge until September 1993 , when he moved to Manchester City in the recently formed FA Premier League . Horton led United to mid @-@ table finishes during his management spell , apart from a 21st @-@ place finish at the end of the 1991 – 92 season . A 2 – 1 win over Tranmere Rovers , and a win for Blackburn Rovers over Plymouth Argyle , meant United survived relegation by two points . Oxford , now in the renamed Football League Division One , briefly restored Maurice Evans as manager , before turning to Bristol City manager Denis Smith . Despite Smith 's efforts , Oxford was relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1993 – 94 season , with just four wins in the last eleven games . 
 = = = Financial problems = = = 
 Denis Smith brought in two strikers who were experienced in the top division : Southampton 's Paul Moody and Nottingham Forest 's Nigel Jemson . Oxford finished seventh in 1994 – 95 season , and in the following season gained promotion by finishing runners @-@ up to rivals Swindon Town , despite not winning an away game till the end of January . Robin Herd , co @-@ owner of the March Racing Team , took control of the club in 1995 . In June of that year , the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stadium at <unk> Farm , to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground . The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998 – 99 season , but construction was suspended during the preceding season , because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not been paid for the work already undertaken . 
 = = = Dropping through the divisions = = = 
 The 1996 – 97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth , and included the sale of Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City . Despite Smith 's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997 , United finished twelfth the following season under his successor , and former captain , Malcolm Shotton . Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League . During October 1998 , the backroom staff at the club went unpaid , due to United 's financial situation with the new stadium , and the threat of administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United 's Life ( <unk> ) . The group began to publicise the club 's plight through a series of meetings and events , including a ' Scarf of Unity ' , which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch around the perimeter of the pitch . Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects , and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd 's 89 @.@ 9 % controlling interest in Oxford United for £ 1 , with which he also inherited the club 's estimated £ 15 million debt . Kassam reduced the £ 9 million of the debt to just £ 900 @,@ 000 , by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement , by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £ 1 @,@ 000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed . Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies , for £ 6 million . Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium , gaining planning permission for a bowling alley , multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium , following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled . The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division . 
 Oxford 's poor form continued into the 1999 – 2000 season and , with the team in the relegation zone , Shotton resigned in late October . After a few months with Mickey Lewis as player @-@ manager , former manager Denis Smith returned to the club , managing a twentieth @-@ place finish , one place clear of relegation . Smith 's second spell didn 't last long , and he was replaced by David Kemp a few weeks into the following campaign . At the end of the 2000 – 01 season , Oxford were relegated back to the Third Division after a 35 @-@ year absence , with 100 goals conceded . They suffered 33 league defeats , the second @-@ highest number of league defeats ever endured by a league club in a single season . 
 = = = Division Three years = = = 
 Oxford began the next season with a new manager and a new stadium , with the relocation to the Kassam Stadium completed after six years of speculation . Former Liverpool and England defender Mark Wright was given the manager 's job , but resigned in late November , after being accused of making racist remarks to referee Joe Ross . Wright 's successor , Ian Atkins , was unable to make an immediate impact and Oxford finished in 21st position in the league , at the time their lowest @-@ ever league position . United missed out on the play @-@ off places the following season , by one place and one point . Fifteen wins at the start of the 2003 – 04 season saw Oxford top of the table at the end of January . However , Ian Atkins was sacked in March after agreeing to take charge at rivals Bristol Rovers . His replacement , Graham Rix , could only manage a ninth @-@ place finish at the end of the season , and was sacked the following November . Oxford replaced him with Argentine Ramón Díaz , who managed the team to a mid @-@ table finish . Diaz and his team of assistants left the club at the beginning of May 2005 , after being banned from the ground by the chairman due to failed negotiations . During his time at the club , Diaz brought in a number of South American players including his own sons , and Juan Pablo <unk> . Ex @-@ England midfielder and former West Bromwich Albion manager Brian Talbot signed a two @-@ year contract to replace Rix . Talbot found little success and was sacked in March 2006 , with the club in 22nd place . He was replaced by youth team coach Darren Patterson . 
 On 21 March 2006 , Firoz Kassam sold the club for approximately £ 2 million , including the club 's debts , to Florida @-@ based businessman Nick Merry , who had played for United 's youth team in the mid @-@ 1970s . Merry immediately made changes to the club , including the hiring of former manager Jim Smith in his second spell . Despite signing five new players on his first day in charge , Smith was unable to prevent relegation at the end of the 2005 – 06 season . After 44 years in English league football , Oxford were relegated to the Conference National after finishing in 23rd place , becoming the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the league . Coincidentally , Accrington Stanley , the side who went bankrupt in 1962 allowing United to be elected into the League , were one of the two teams promoted to replace them . 
 = = = Non @-@ league football = = = 
 Jim Smith was retained as manager for the following season , and it started positively for Oxford , with 14 wins and 8 draws from the opening 25 games . A run of eleven league games without a win followed , and saw United drop to second , where they remained until the end of the season . On Boxing Day 2006 , a crowd of 11 @,@ 065 watched United draw 0 – 0 with Woking at the Kassam Stadium , the largest @-@ ever attendance for a Conference match ( excluding play @-@ offs ) . Oxford qualified for the play @-@ offs by finishing second , but lost on penalties in the semi @-@ final to Exeter City . 
 On 9 November 2007 , Jim Smith resigned as manager and first @-@ team coach Darren Patterson returned as manager . In a lacklustre season which included defeats to Droylsden and Tonbridge Angels , camouflaged by a belated run of eight wins in the last eleven games , Oxford finished 9th in the Conference National in 2007 – 08 , 10 points off the last play @-@ off place . 
 On 2 October 2008 , Nick Merry stepped down as chairman to be replaced by Kelvin Thomas , who had been part of the management team at the time of Merry 's takeover . Just under two months later , Patterson was sacked after a poor run of form , and was replaced by former Halifax Town manager Chris Wilder . Following Wilder 's arrival , the team won 15 of the remaining 21 league matches that season . A 5 @-@ point deduction for fielding an unregistered player resulted in a seventh @-@ place finish , four points and two places short of the play @-@ offs . 
 Oxford led the table for most of the first half of the 2009 – 10 season , but dropped into the play @-@ off places after a poor run of form , finishing third . They beat Rushden & Diamonds over two legs to advance to the play @-@ off final against York City on 16 May 2010 . Oxford won the final 3 – 1 , to return to the Football League for the 2010 – 11 season . The attendance was 42 @,@ 669 , a new record for the final , with around 33 @,@ 000 being United fans . 
 = = = Return to the Football League = = = 
 Oxford 's first game back in the Football League was away to Burton , which finished in a 0 – 0 draw ; their first League win was on 4 September against Morecambe at the Kassam Stadium , with James Constable scoring a hat @-@ trick in a 4 – 0 victory . They finished the season in 12th place . 
 The team spent much of the 2011 – 12 season in or around the playoff places , and achieved the double over rivals ( and eventual champions ) Swindon Town for the first time since the 1973 – 74 season . However , they failed to win any of their last seven matches and finished the season in 9th place , two places and four points outside the play @-@ offs . 
 Chairman Kelvin Thomas stepped down during the 2012 close season , to be replaced by owner Ian Lenagan . The 2012 – 13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form : after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table , United lost their next six games , a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season . United finished outside the play @-@ offs for the third consecutive season , but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one @-@ year contract in April 2013 . Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder 's contract , having pressed for his sacking during the second half of the 2012 – 13 season . 
 After another bright start , Oxford led the table several times in the first half of the 2013 – 14 season . On 25 January 2014 , with the club faltering though still in the play @-@ off places , Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation @-@ threatened Northampton . Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club . On 22 March 2014 , Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process , leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons . Under Lewis and Waddock , Oxford slipped out of the play @-@ off places in the final few weeks of the season , finishing a disappointing eighth in the table , nine points off the last playoff place . 
 In July 2014 , Waddock 's contract was terminated after a change of ownership and he was replaced by Michael Appleton . Waddock 's surprise sacking ensured he had the worst record of any Oxford manager , winning only once and losing seven times in his eight games in charge of the club . After an indifferent first season under Appleton , Oxford achieved promotion to League One in his second year in charge , finishing the 2015 – 16 season in 2nd place with 86 points .

 Oxford United had no regular home until 1913 , switching between the Quarry Recreation Ground , Wootten 's Field , Sandy Lane and Britannia Field , all in Headington . In 1913 they were able to purchase Wootten 's Field on London Road , however , this was redeveloped in 1920 before a stadium could be built . Having purchased the Sandy Lane site , the club developed and played at the Manor Ground between 1925 and 2001 . The ground was originally shared with Headington Cricket Club until 1949 , when they moved to Cowley Barracks . The capacity at closure was 9 @,@ 500 , but hosted United 's record crowd of 22 @,@ 750 against Preston North End in an FA Cup sixth @-@ round match on 29 February 1964 . The four stands were named after the roads they were positioned on : The North , East , South and West stands were called Cuckoo Lane , Osler Road , London Road and Beech Road respectively . In the 1990s , the Taylor Report was published calling for the improvement of football stadiums . The Manor Ground 's terracing was becoming redundant and redeveloping the ground was too costly , so the club decided to move to a purpose @-@ built all @-@ seater stadium on the outskirts of the city , costing in the region of £ 15 million . Construction work began in the early part of 1997 , but was suspended later that year due to the club 's financial problems . Construction of the new stadium resumed in 1999 following a takeover deal and the last league match at the Manor on 1 May 2001 saw a 1 – 1 draw with Port Vale . The site was sold for £ 12 million and the stadium was later demolished . The land is now occupied by a private hospital . 
 Since 2001 , Oxford United have played at the Kassam Stadium . The all @-@ seater stadium has a capacity of 12 @,@ 500 and has only three stands instead of the usual four ; when first planned in 1995 it was originally going to have a 16 @,@ 000 @-@ seat capacity , but by the time the stadium opened Oxford was playing in a lower division , so the smaller capacity was deemed adequate . Construction of the fourth stand is not expected to take place for several years , although foundations have already been put in place . The record attendance is 12 @,@ 243 , which was achieved in the final game of the 2005 – 06 season , when a defeat against Leyton Orient condemned them to relegation from the Football League . The average attendance in the previous season was 7 @,@ 415 , which was the second highest in League Two and the thirty @-@ fourth highest in the whole Football League . The average attendance was highest in the Conference in two out of the four years the team spent in the division , with the average in the other two years placing second , behind Exeter City and Cambridge United respectively . The stadium has also hosted rugby union matches , a woman 's international football match ( England v Sweden ) , an Under @-@ 17 international football tournament and music concerts . 
 = = Crest and colours = = 
 The club crest depicts an ox above a representation of a ford to symbolise the location . It reflects the name and history of the city , as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis , which was used by cattle . In 2008 , a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand . It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011 , being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity . The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced . When playing as Headington and during the early years of Oxford United , the crest included a full ox crossing the ford , as well as the initials <unk> ( pre @-@ 1962 ) or the name Oxford United ( post name @-@ change ) . Between 1972 and 1980 , the crest became circular , showing just the ox 's head on a yellow and black background . The words ' Oxford United Football Club ' were placed around the ox . For the next 17 years , the crest was simply the ox 's head coloured blue , with various combinations of wording surrounding it . For example , in the 1987 – 88 season , the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest . In 1996 , the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox 's head over the ford , on a yellow background . This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 , when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version . It has a similar design to the preceding crest , but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background , with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue . 
 While playing as Headington United , orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks . The design of the shirt changed regularly , with the stripes being changed every few seasons . After joining the Southern League , the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange was used for the shirt . The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957 – 58 season , with black shorts and yellow socks . During the late 1970s and early 1980s , the black shorts were first replaced with yellow ones , and then with light blue shorts . Since the early 1990s , the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks . A large variety of away kits has been used over the years , ranging from red and black stripes on the shirts , to a fully white kit . The first sponsor to appear on the shirt was Sunday Journal , a local newspaper , in 1982 . Between 1983 and 1985 , there were three sponsors : <unk> , Pergamon and the Sunday People . Following those were Wang Laboratories ( 1985 to 1989 ) , Pergamon ( 1989 to 1991 ) , <unk> ( 1991 to 2000 ) , Domino ( 2000 to 2001 ) and <unk> ( from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010 ) . Following the return to the Football League , Bridle Insurance were announced as new shirt sponsors . The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012 – 13 season . The home sponsor for the 2013 – 14 season was announced as <unk> , with the away kit being sponsored by Isinglass Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw . That one @-@ year deal with Isinglass was extended for the 2014 – 15 season , again featuring on the away kits only . 
 = = Supporters and rivals = = 
 Oxford have a number of independent supporters ' clubs and groups such as <unk> ( the Oxford United Supporters ' Trust ) with a current membership of over 400 , and the Oxford United Exiles . <unk> was formed in 2002 , to replace the disbanded <unk> group , which broke up after the immediate future of the club was secured . It was the fiftieth supporters trust created under the Supporters ' trust banner . The club itself also runs a Juniors club , aimed at younger fans and offering a number of bonuses to the club 's members such as birthday cards and a free T @-@ shirt . The official matchday programme for home games costs £ 3 and was voted best Conference Premier Programme of the Year for the 2007 – 08 season . A number of songs are sung during home games , such as " Yellow Submarine " ( with adapted lyrics ) and songs relating to the old Manor Ground . 
 The club have a number of celebrity supporters , including Richard Branson , Timmy Mallett , Tim Henman and Jim Rosenthal . The club 's mascot is Ollie the Ox . United were the best @-@ supported club in the Conference National before Luton Town joined the division . The home match between Oxford and Luton , which drew a crowd of 10 @,@ 600 , was used to highlight the passion for English football during the 2018 World Cup bid . In 2009 , a " 12th man fund " was set up by a group of supporters in order to provide additional transfer funds to the club . As a result , the number 12 shirt was retired at the start of the 2009 – 10 season . The fund raised over £ 40 @,@ 000 and resulted in the signings of Mehdi <unk> ( on loan ) and Jamie Cook , amongst others . 
 Oxford 's main rivals are Swindon Town , with Reading seen as the other rival team . To a lesser extent , Wycombe Wanderers and Luton Town are also seen as rivals . The rivalry with Swindon stems from the clubs ' close proximity , as well as the fact they have played each other 55 times since 1962 . Oxford ( Headington ) and Swindon met a few times in non @-@ competitive fixtures before 1962 . The earliest match on record was a friendly in the 1950 – 51 season at Headington . They also played each other in 1954 – 55 both home and away , and at Headington during 1958 – 59 . All programmes are fairly scarce , with the single sheet issued at Swindon being very rare . The 1962 – 63 game was a testimonial , with the first league meetings coming in 1965 – 66 . During the height of football hooliganism , trouble flared up between the sets of fans . In 1998 , 19 Swindon supporters were arrested during a match at the County Ground , while in 2002 there was an incident between supporters after Oxford fans returned from an away fixture . In 2011 , vandals burned the initials STFC into the Kassam Stadium 's pitch . Oxford fans use nicknames when talking about Swindon such as <unk> , in reference to the myth that they tried to rake the reflection of the moon out of a pond . The rivalry with Reading was heightened during the chairmanship of Robert Maxwell , because of his desire to merge the two clubs . This was met with strong opposition from both sets of fans , with United supporters staging a " sit @-@ in " on the pitch before a game against Wigan in protest . Despite being the second team in the city , there is less rivalry with Oxford City because of their lower position in the pyramid system ( there have been no competitive matches between the two since 1959 ) .

 The first manager appointed was Harry Thompson in July 1949 , soon after the club turned professional . In a nine @-@ year spell he led the team to the Southern League title in 1953 , as well as the Southern League Cup in 1953 and 1954 . He was replaced by Arthur Turner in 1958 , who would become the longest @-@ serving manager in the club 's history , serving more than a decade in charge . Turner led United to back @-@ to @-@ back Southern League titles , of which the second , in 1962 , resulted in their election to the Football League . Promotion followed from the Fourth Division in 1965 , and the club were crowned Third Division champions three years later . Turner left the club nine months after this success . Over the next thirteen years , five managers took charge . Ron Saunders was in charge for only a dozen games , moving to Norwich City at the end of the 1968 – 69 season . Gerry Summers was manager for six years , before being replaced by Mick Brown . During Brown 's four @-@ year run , United were relegated back to the Third Division after spending eight years in the Second . 
 Jim Smith started his first spell as manager in 1981 , and led Oxford into the top tier of English football after consecutive promotions as champions in 1984 and 1985 . However , he moved to Queens Park Rangers before the 1985 – 86 season . New manager , former chief scout Maurice Evans , had immediate success winning the 1986 League Cup , beating his predecessor 's new club in the final . For the next 24 years , the only manager to guide the club to promotion was Denis Smith , who won promotion from the Second Division in 1996 . Ramón Díaz , the club 's first and only non @-@ British manager , took charge for five months between December 2004 and May 2005 . Jim Smith returned as manager in 2006 , the year that Oxford United were relegated to the Football Conference after 44 years in the Football League . Having missed out on promotion in the 2006 – 07 season , Smith resigned and Darren Patterson was promoted to the post on 9 November 2007 . Patterson was sacked over a year later and was replaced by Chris Wilder , who lead the club back into the Football League by winning the 2010 Conference playoff Final and remained with the club for five years before resigning in January 2014 . Gary Waddock was appointed head coach on 22 March 2014 , but was sacked on 4 July 2014 following a change of shareholding in the club , to be replaced by Michael Appleton . 
 Since turning professional , the club has had 23 full @-@ time managers , of whom three ( Jim Smith , Denis Smith and Darren Patterson ) have had more than one spell in the post , and nine periods of caretaker @-@ management .

 No. 86 Wing is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) transport and air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling wing . Coming under the control of Air Mobility Group , it is headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . The wing comprises No. 33 Squadron , operating Airbus KC @-@ 30 tanker @-@ transports , No. 36 Squadron , operating Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy transports , No. 38 Squadron , operating Beech King Air 350 light transports , and the Australian Army 's 68 Ground Liaison Section . Its aircraft support Australian military and humanitarian operations worldwide . 
 Formed in the last year of World War II to undertake ground attack missions with de Havilland Mosquitos and Bristol Beaufighters in the South West Pacific theatre , No. 86 Wing was reorganised in 1946 as a transport formation headquartered at RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . It relocated to RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales , in 1949 and began operating Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules in 1958 . Disbanded in 1964 , the wing was re @-@ established at Richmond in 1987 , flying Boeing 707 tanker @-@ transports as well as the Hercules . No. 36 Squadron converted to Globemasters in 2006 . No. 33 Squadron retired its 707s in 2008 , and did not become operational with the KC @-@ 30 until 2013 . Having previously flown de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 4 Caribous , No. 38 Squadron converted to the King Airs in 2009 . The Hercules were transferred to No. 84 Wing in 2010 .

 Established in March 1945 under the command of Group Captain J.M. Whyte , No. 86 ( Attack ) Wing comprised two flying units , No. 1 Squadron operating de Havilland Mosquitos and No. 93 Squadron operating Bristol Beaufighters . The wing was initially based on the island of Morotai in the South West Pacific theatre , as part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force . Its order of battle for Operation Oboe Six , the assault on north @-@ west Borneo commencing in June , included Nos. 1 and 93 Squadrons , No. 84 Operational Base Unit , No. 30 Air Stores Park , No. 29 Medical Clearing Station , and No. 1 Repair and Servicing Unit — a total of over 1 @,@ 400 personnel . Delays getting the aircraft operational at their forward base on Labuan meant that the wing only completed three combat missions before the end of the Pacific War , conducting rocket and machine @-@ gun attacks on targets in Sarawak during August 1945 . No. 1 Squadron took part in one operation and No. 93 Squadron in two ; each unit lost one aircraft in action . 
 No. 86 Wing was originally to have been augmented by a third combat unit , No. 94 Squadron , flying Mosquitos . Formed in May 1945 , the squadron was still undergoing training when the war ended , and it was disbanded at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales , in January 1946 . In December 1945 , shortly after the end of the Pacific War , the commanding officer of No. 93 Squadron , Squadron Leader <unk> Gulliver , crashed his Beaufighter on takeoff at Labuan , colliding with two P @-@ 51 Mustangs of No. 77 Squadron parked at the airfield ; Gulliver and five people on the ground died in the accident , including the then @-@ Officer Commanding No. 86 Wing , Group Captain <unk> <unk> . Between January and March 1946 , the Beaufighters escorted Mustangs of No. 81 Wing to Japan for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . In August that year , Nos. 1 and 93 Squadrons disbanded at Narromine , New South Wales .

 Re @-@ formed at RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , in July 1946 , No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing was assigned control of Nos. 36 , 37 , and 38 Squadrons , flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . The wing was augmented by No. 386 ( Base ) Squadron and No. 486 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , formed in August . The Dakotas initially flew supply missions to the Australian @-@ administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea , as well as three @-@ times weekly courier flights to Japan in support of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . The latter schedule continued until December 1947 , when the service was taken over by Qantas Avro Lancastrians . No. 37 Squadron disbanded in February 1948 . In August that year , crews from Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons departed for Europe to take part in the Berlin Airlift , a commitment that lasted almost a year . The Australians were responsible for delivering over 16 million tons of supplies , and almost 8 @,@ 000 passengers . No. 386 Squadron disbanded in March 1949 and re @-@ formed as Station Headquarters at Schofields . On 22 June , No. 86 Wing , comprising Nos. 36 , 38 and 486 Squadrons , relocated to the nearby RAAF Station Richmond . Following the return of crews from Berlin , the wing was able to release No. 38 Squadron and its Dakotas to participate in the Malayan Emergency , under the control of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing , commencing in June 1950 . Having airlifted more than 17 @,@ 000 passengers and evacuated over 300 injured troops , the squadron left Malaya in November 1952 and returned to No. 86 Wing at Richmond . A month earlier , the wing 's Dakotas had flown supply and observation flights in connection with the British atomic test on Montebello in Western Australia . No. 36 Squadron disbanded at Richmond on 9 March 1953 , re @-@ forming the next day from No. 30 Transport Unit at Iwakuni , Japan . Here it was part of No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing , which controlled the RAAF 's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath . The squadron returned to Australia and the aegis of No. 86 Wing two years later , following the disbandment of No. 91 Wing . 
 In 1954 , No. 86 Wing relocated to Canberra to help satisfy the Federal government 's VIP transport needs . It returned to Richmond four years later , leaving behind its VIP contingent , No. 34 Flight , which in July 1959 was re @-@ formed as No. 34 Squadron and left the control of No. 86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by Home Command and tasked by RAAF Canberra . Having earlier augmented its complement of Dakotas with Convair 440 Metropolitans , in December 1958 the wing began operating Lockheed Hercules medium transports , when No. 36 Squadron took delivery of the first of twelve C @-@ 130As . They remained in service for twenty years , clocking up 147 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours . The official history of the post @-@ war Air Force described the Hercules as " probably the biggest step @-@ up in aircraft capabilities " the RAAF had ever received , considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota , taking into account the improvements in payload , range , and speed . When No. 78 ( Fighter ) Wing and its two squadrons of CAC Sabres deployed to RAAF Base Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959 , seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of No. 3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya , compared to two Hercules for No. 77 Squadron . In 1962 , Air Movements and Training Flight ( AMTF ) , previously under No. 38 Squadron and responsible for developing and imparting new techniques in aerial transport , came directly under the control of No. 86 Wing headquarters . That December , the Hercules made their first troop @-@ carrying flights into a combat zone , when one of No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia ; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years . 
 No. 38 Squadron received the RAAF 's first de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 4 Caribou tactical transports in April 1964 , replacing its Dakotas . The first six Caribous were despatched that August to South East Asia for service in the Vietnam War as RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam ( <unk> ) . The same month , No. 86 Wing was disbanded . Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the Australian Army , an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was now considered inappropriate . No. 486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons , which along with AMTF became independently operating units under the command of Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond . Following the re @-@ establishment at Richmond of No. 37 Squadron in February 1966 , flying C @-@ 130E Hercules , No. 486 Squadron was re @-@ formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons . As No. 36 Squadron 's tasking was mainly tactical and No. 37 Squadron 's strategic ( owing to the longer range of its C @-@ 130Es ) , forming the Hercules units into a new wing was not deemed necessary . Continuing to be based at Richmond , the Hercules provided long @-@ range transport and medical evacuation services to and from South East Asia during the Vietnam War . No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130As were replaced by C @-@ 130H models in 1978 . <unk> was re @-@ formed as No. 35 Squadron in June 1966 , and continued to serve in Vietnam until Australian forces were withdrawn in 1972 ; it was then based in Richmond until 1976 , when it relocated to RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland . No. 38 Squadron meanwhile continued to operate Caribous out of Richmond until 1992 , when it transferred to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . In the Vietnam and post @-@ Vietnam eras , along with their military transport duties , the Hercules and Caribou undertook disaster relief operations throughout Australia and the Pacific . 
 = = = Current transport formation ( 1987 – ) = = = 
 No. 86 Wing re @-@ formed at Richmond on 2 February 1987 , under the newly established Air Lift Group ( ALG ) , which replaced Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond . Commanded by Group Captain G.I. Lumsden , the wing 's flying units consisted of No. 33 Squadron , operating Boeing 707 tanker @-@ transports , and Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons , operating C @-@ 130H and C @-@ 130E Hercules , respectively ; No. 486 Maintenance Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit ( AMTDU ) , which had evolved from AMTF in 1965 , were also under its control . No. 486 Squadron was responsible for day @-@ to @-@ day maintenance of the 707s as well as the Hercules . No. 34 Squadron , the VIP transport unit based at RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra , and No. 32 Squadron , flying Hawker Siddeley HS 748 air navigation trainers at RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria , became part of No. 86 Wing in June 1988 and July 1989 , respectively . In 1992 , the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons clocked up a grand total of 500 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours ; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone . During 1994 – 95 , the wing was commanded by Group Captain ( later Air Chief Marshal ) Angus Houston , who in 2005 was appointed Chief of the Defence Force , only the third RAAF officer to be raised to the top position in the Australian armed services . By mid @-@ 1996 , No. 32 Squadron had been transferred to No. 84 Wing , which was also controlled by ALG . In 1998 , No. 86 Wing received the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the most proficient wing in RAAF Air Command . No. 486 Squadron was disbanded in October that year , after transferring its functions to Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons . By then , Nos. 35 and 38 Squadrons , flying Caribous out of RAAF Bases Townsville and Amberley , respectively , had joined the Hercules squadrons and AMTDU under the aegis of No. 86 Wing , while Nos. 33 and 34 Squadrons had been transferred to No. 84 Wing , now also headquartered at Richmond . Later , AMTDU became part of No. 85 Wing at Richmond . No. 37 Squadron 's C @-@ 130Es were replaced by C @-@ 130J models in 1999 . No. 35 Squadron transferred its Caribous to No. 38 Squadron in 2000 , and was " formally deactivated " in March 2002 . RAAF C @-@ 130 operations were concentrated in No. 37 Squadron in November 2006 , when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C @-@ 130Hs prior to re @-@ equipping with the Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy transports and relocating to Amberley . No. 38 Squadron 's Caribous were retired at the end of 2009 , and replaced by Beech King Air 350 light transports . No. 37 Squadron was transferred to No. 84 Wing in October 2010 . 
 The aircraft operated by No. 86 Wing became well known to the general public through their involvement in disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region , along with their participation in overseas peacekeeping efforts . Hercules and 707s were employed by the Federal government to provide air transport during the pilots ' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines in 1989 , evacuated Australian nationals from the Middle East during the first Gulf War in 1990 – 91 , and transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993 . Since the end of the Vietnam War , much of the RAAF 's transport tasking had been relatively routine in nature , or involved humanitarian relief ; the Somalia operation marked the beginning of a shift for No. 86 Wing towards a more combat @-@ ready or " operational " focus . Six Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the coup in July 1997 . Two detachments from the wing , one of Hercules and one of Caribous , supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2001 . Wing operations staff accompanied Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons on relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002 . In February 2003 , a rotating detachment of three Hercules deployed to the Persian Gulf to support the Australian contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , amassing 20 @,@ 000 operational flying hours by March 2010 . From July 2003 to July 2004 , Caribous undertook reconnaissance and transport missions during the Solomon Islands intervention . No. 36 Squadron Hercules took part in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami . The RAAF 's contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist , following Cyclone Guba in November 2007 , included a Globemaster , two Hercules , and three Caribous . In September 2008 , a Globemaster undertook the type 's first aeromedical evacuation in RAAF service , transporting five injured Australian troops to Amberley from Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan . Globemasters , Hercules and King Airs were all employed for flood relief in Queensland and Victoria early in 2011 . In February that year , Globemasters and Hercules transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the Christchurch earthquake . The following month , a Globemaster flew 23 sorties in Japan supporting relief efforts after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami , while two other Globemasters delivered a water cannon to help contain damage at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant . 
 On 1 January 2012 , No. 86 Wing headquarters relocated from Richmond to Amberley . ALG was renamed Air Mobility Group on 1 April 2014 . No. 86 Wing 's current complement is : No. 33 Squadron , which became operational with the Airbus KC @-@ 30 tanker @-@ transport after receiving the fourth of its aircraft in March 2013 ; No. 36 Squadron , which took delivery of its eight and last Globemaster in November 2015 ; No. 38 Squadron , operating King Airs ; and the Australian Army 's 68 Ground Liaison Section . All units are based at Amberley , with the exception of No. 38 Squadron , located at Townsville . 
 = John von Neumann = 
 John von Neumann ( / <unk> <unk> / ; Hungarian : Neumann János Lajos , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; December 28 , 1903 – February 8 , 1957 ) was a Hungarian @-@ American pure and applied mathematician , physicist , inventor , computer scientist , and polymath . He made major contributions to a number of fields , including mathematics ( foundations of mathematics , functional analysis , ergodic theory , geometry , topology , and numerical analysis ) , physics ( quantum mechanics , hydrodynamics and quantum statistical mechanics ) , economics ( game theory ) , computing ( Von Neumann architecture , linear programming , self @-@ replicating machines , stochastic computing ) , and statistics . 
 He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics , in the development of functional analysis , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . He published 150 papers in his life : 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics . His last work , an unfinished manuscript written while in the hospital , was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain . 
 His mathematical analysis of the structure of self @-@ replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA . In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the National Academy of Sciences , he stated " The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics , which developed in Göttingen in 1926 , and subsequently in Berlin in 1927 – 1929 . Also , my work on various forms of operator theory , Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935 – 1939 ; on the ergodic theorem , Princeton , 1931 – 1932 . " 
 During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project , developing the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . After the war , he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission , and later as one of its commissioners . He was a consultant to a number of organizations , including the United States Air Force , the Army 's Ballistic Research Laboratory , the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller , mathematician Stanislaw Ulam , and others , he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah ( in Hungarian the family name comes first and his given names equate to John Lewis in English ) . His Hebrew name was Yonah . Von Neumann 's place of birth was Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary which was then part of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . He was the eldest of three children . He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 . His father , Neumann Miksa ( English : Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law . He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s . Miksa 's father and grandfather were both born in <unk> ( now part of the town of <unk> ) , <unk> County , northern Hungary . John 's mother was Kann Margit ( English : Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were <unk> Kann and Katalin <unk> . Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann @-@ Heller offices in Budapest ; von Neumann 's family occupied an 18 @-@ room apartment on the top floor . 
 In 1913 , his father was elevated to the nobility for his service to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph . The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai , meaning of <unk> . The family had no connection with the town ; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret , as was those chosen coat of arms depicting three <unk> . Neumann János became Margittai Neumann János ( John Neumann of <unk> ) , which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann . 
 Formal schooling did not start in Hungary until the age of ten . Instead , governesses taught von Neumann , his brothers and his cousins . Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential , so the children were tutored in English , French , German and Italian . By the age of 8 , von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus , but he was particularly interested in history , reading his way through Wilhelm <unk> 's 46 @-@ volume Allgemeine Geschichte in <unk> . A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased . One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room , with bookshelves from ceiling to floor . 
 Von Neumann entered the Lutheran <unk> <unk> Gimnázium in 1911 . This was one of the best schools in Budapest , part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite . Under the Hungarian system , children received all their education at the one gymnasium . Despite being run by the Lutheran Church , the majority of its pupils were Jewish . The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement , that included Theodore von Kármán ( b . 1881 ) , George de Hevesy ( b . 1885 ) , Leó Szilárd ( b . 1898 ) , Eugene Wigner ( b . 1902 ) , Edward Teller ( b . 1908 ) , and Paul Erdős ( b . 1913 ) . Collectively , they were sometimes known as Martians . Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School . When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses , Wigner , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 , replied that von Neumann was the only genius . 
 Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age , he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude . At the age of 15 , he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő . On their first meeting , Szegő was so astounded with the boy 's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears . Some of von Neumann 's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő , sketched out on his father 's stationery , are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest . By the age of 19 , von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers , the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers , which superseded Georg Cantor 's definition . At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium , von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize , a national prize for mathematics . 
 Since there were few posts in Hungary for mathematicians , and those were not well @-@ paid , his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into industry and therefore invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics . Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer . This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of , so it was arranged for him to take a two @-@ year non @-@ degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin , after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich , which he passed in September 1923 . At the same time , von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest , as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics . For his thesis , he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor 's set theory . He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926 . He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert . 
 = = Early career and private life = = 
 Von Neumann 's habilitation was completed on December 13 , 1927 , and he started his lectures as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928 . By the end of 1927 , von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics , and by the end of 1929 , thirty @-@ two papers , at a rate of nearly one major paper per month . His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize a column from the telephone book and recite the names . In 1929 , he briefly became a privatdozent at the University of Hamburg , where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better , but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University in Princeton , New Jersey . 
 On New Year 's Day in 1930 , von Neumann married Mariette <unk> , who had studied economics at the Budapest University . Before his marriage he was baptized a Catholic . Max had died in 1929 . None of the family had converted to Christianity while he was alive , but afterwards they all did . Von Neumann and Mariette had one child , a daughter , Marina , who as of 2015 is a distinguished professor of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan . The couple divorced in 1937 . In October 1938 , von Neumann married Klara Dan , whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of World War II . 
 In 1933 , von Neumann was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study when the institute 's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl fell through . He remained a mathematics professor there until his death , although he announced his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the University of California shortly before . His mother , brothers and in @-@ laws followed von Neumann to the United States in 1939 . Von Neumann anglicized his first name to John , keeping the German @-@ aristocratic surname of von Neumann . His brothers changed theirs to " Neumann " and " <unk> " . Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937 , and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the United States Army 's Officers Reserve Corps . He passed the exams easily , but was ultimately rejected because of his age . His prewar analysis of how France would stand up to Germany is often quoted . He said : " Oh , France won 't matter . " 
 The von <unk> , Klara and John , were active socially within the Princeton academic community . His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of the largest in Princeton . He took great care over his clothing , and would always wear formal suits , once riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule in a three @-@ piece pin @-@ stripe . Hilbert is reported to have asked at von Neumann 's 1926 doctoral exam : " Pray , who is the candidate 's tailor ? " as he had never seen such beautiful evening clothes . 
 Von Neumann liked to eat and drink ; his wife , Klara , said that he could count everything except calories . He enjoyed Yiddish and " off @-@ color " humor ( especially limericks ) . He was a non @-@ smoker . At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including Albert Einstein , from their work . Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy , chaotic environments , and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in . He never used it , preferring the couple 's living room with its television playing loudly . Despite being a notoriously bad driver , he nonetheless enjoyed driving — frequently while reading a book — occasioning numerous arrests , as well as accidents . When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to IBM , Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets . 
 Von Neumann 's closest friend in the United States was mathematician Stanislaw Ulam . A later friend of Ulam 's , Gian @-@ Carlo Rota , wrote : " They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling , swapping Jewish jokes , and drifting in and out of mathematical talk . " When von Neumann was dying in hospital , every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend . He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively , and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved , and know the answer immediately upon waking up . 
 = = Mathematics = = 
 = = = Set theory = = = 
 The axiomatization of mathematics , on the model of Euclid 's Elements , had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century , particularly in arithmetic , thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce , and geometry , thanks to Hilbert 's axioms . But at the beginning of the 20th century , efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell 's paradox ( on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves ) . The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel . Zermelo – Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics , but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself . In his doctoral thesis of 1925 , von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets — the axiom of foundation and the notion of class . 
 The axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel . If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession . This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself . To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions , von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration , called the method of inner models , which later became an essential instrument in set theory . 
 The second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class , and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes , while a proper class is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes . Under the Zermelo – Fraenkel approach , the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves . In contrast , under the von Neumann approach , the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed , but it is a proper class and not a set . 
 With this contribution of von Neumann , the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems , and became usable as a foundation for mathematics , despite the lack of a proof of its consistency . The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it , or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems . A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg , in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness : the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete , in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language . Moreover , every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete . 
 Less than a month later , von Neumann , who had participated at the Congress , communicated to Gödel an interesting consequence of his theorem : that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency . However , Gödel had already discovered this consequence , now known as his second incompleteness theorem , and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems . Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel 's priority in his next letter . He never thought much of " the American system of claiming personal priority for everything . " 
 = = = <unk> theory = = = 
 Von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory , in a series of articles published in 1932 . Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory , Paul Halmos writes that even " if von Neumann had never done anything else , they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality " . By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on operator theory , and the application of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic theorem . 
 = = = Operator theory = = = 
 Von Neumann introduced the study of rings of operators , through the von Neumann algebras . A von Neumann algebra is a * <unk> of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator . The von Neumann <unk> theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as an algebra of symmetries . The direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann . One of von Neumann 's analyses was to reduce the classification of von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of factors . 
 = = = Measure theory = = = 
 In measure theory , the " problem of measure " for an n @-@ dimensional Euclidean space Rn may be stated as : " does there exist a positive , normalized , invariant , and additive set function on the class of all subsets of Rn ? " The work of Felix Hausdorff and Stefan Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n 
 = 1 or n = 
 2 and a negative solution ( because of the Banach – Tarski paradox ) in all other cases . Von Neumann 's work argued that the " problem is essentially group @-@ theoretic in character " : the existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the properties of the transformation group of the given space . The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two , and the negative solution for higher dimensions , comes from the fact that the Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two , and is not solvable for higher dimensions . " Thus , according to von Neumann , it is the change of group that makes a difference , not the change of space . " 
 In a number of von Neumann 's papers , the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results . In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators , von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition , and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions . In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory , he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert 's fifth problem in the case of compact groups . In 1938 , he was awarded the <unk> Memorial Prize for his work in analysis . 
 = = = Lattice theory = = = 
 Between 1937 and 1939 , Von Neumann worked on lattice theory , the theory of partially ordered sets in which every two elements have a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound . Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed complemented modular topological lattices ( properties that arise in the lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces ) : " Dimension is determined , up to a positive linear transformation , by the following two properties . It is conserved by perspective mappings ( " <unk> " ) and ordered by inclusion . The deepest part of the proof concerns the equivalence of <unk> with " <unk> by decomposition " — of which a corollary is the transitivity of <unk> . " Garrett Birkhoff writes : " John von Neumann 's brilliant mind blazed over lattice theory like a meteor " . 
 Von Neumann founded the field of continuous geometry based on lattice theoretic principles . Earlier , Menger and Birkhoff had <unk> complex projective geometry in terms of the properties of its lattice of linear subspaces . Von Neumann , following his work on rings of operators , weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices , the continuous geometries . While the dimensions of the subspaces of projective geometries are a discrete set ( the non @-@ negative integers ) , the dimensions of the elements of a continuous geometry can range continuously across the unit interval [ 0 @,@ 1 ] . Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions , and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the <unk> type II factor . 
 Additionally , " [ I ] n the general case , von Neumann proved the following basic representation theorem . Any complemented modular lattice L having a " basis " of n ≥ 4 pairwise perspective elements , is isomorphic with the lattice <unk> ( R ) of all principal right @-@ ideals of a suitable regular ring R. This conclusion is the culmination of 140 pages of brilliant and incisive algebra involving entirely novel axioms . Anyone wishing to get an unforgettable impression of the razor edge of von Neumann 's mind , need merely try to pursue this chain of exact reasoning for himself — realizing that often five pages of it were written down before breakfast , seated at a living room writing @-@ table in a bathrobe . " 
 = = = Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics = = = 
 Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics , known as the Dirac – von Neumann axioms , with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics . After having completed the axiomatization of set theory , he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics . He realized , in 1926 , that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a ( complex ) Hilbert space that , in general , could be infinite @-@ dimensional even for a single particle . In this formalism of quantum mechanics , observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system . 
 The physics of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them . For example , the uncertainty principle , according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa , is translated into the non @-@ commutativity of the two corresponding operators . This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger . When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a self @-@ adjoint operator and one that was merely symmetric , Heisenberg replied " Eh ? What is the difference ? " 
 Von Neumann 's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non @-@ determinism , and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined " hidden variables , " as in classical statistical mechanics . In 1966 , John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid . However , in 2010 , Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann 's proof , and pointed out that the proof , though not valid for all hidden variable theories , does rule out a well @-@ defined and important subset . Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation , and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories . 
 In any case , the proof inaugurated a line of research that ultimately led , through the work of Bell in 1964 on Bell 's theorem , and the experiments of Alain Aspect in 1982 , to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a notion of reality substantially different from that of classical physics , or must include <unk> in apparent violation of special relativity . 
 In a chapter of The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics , von Neumann deeply analyzed the so @-@ called measurement problem . He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the universal wave function . Since something " outside the calculation " was needed to collapse the wave function , von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter ( although this view was accepted by Eugene Wigner , the Von Neumann – Wigner interpretation never gained acceptance amongst the majority of physicists ) . 
 Though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day , there is a basic framework for the mathematical formalism of problems in quantum mechanics which underlies the majority of approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical <unk> and techniques first used by von Neumann . In other words , discussions about interpretation of the theory , and extensions to it , are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations . 
 = = = Quantum logic = = = 
 In a famous paper of 1936 with Garrett Birkhoff , the first work ever to introduce quantum logics , von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics . The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann 's 1932 work , but in 1936 , the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs . For example , photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly ( e.g. , one horizontally and the other vertically ) , and therefore , a fortiori , it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two , either before or after them in the succession , but if the third filter is added in between the other two , the photons will , indeed , pass through . This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the non @-@ commutativity of conjunction <formula> . It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic , <formula> and <formula> , are not valid for quantum theory . 
 The reason for this is that a quantum disjunction , unlike the case for classical disjunction , can be true even when both of the <unk> are false and this is , in turn , attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case , in quantum mechanics , that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate , while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate . This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example . Suppose we are dealing with particles ( such as electrons ) of semi @-@ integral spin ( angular momentum ) for which there are only two possible values : positive or negative . Then , a principle of <unk> establishes that the spin , relative to two different directions ( e.g. , x and y ) results in a pair of incompatible quantities . Suppose that the state ɸ of a certain electron verifies the proposition " the spin of the electron in the x direction is positive . " By the principle of indeterminacy , the value of the spin in the direction y will be completely indeterminate for ɸ . Hence , ɸ can verify neither the proposition " the spin in the direction of y is positive " nor the proposition " the spin in the direction of y is negative . " Nevertheless , the disjunction of the propositions " the spin in the direction of y is positive or the spin in the direction of y is negative " must be true for ɸ . In the case of distribution , it is therefore possible to have a situation in which <formula> , while <formula> . 
 Von Neumann replaced classical logic with a logic constructed in <unk> lattices ( isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of a given physical system ) . 
 = = = Game theory = = = 
 Von Neumann founded the field of game theory as a mathematical discipline . Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928 . This theorem establishes that in zero @-@ sum games with perfect information ( i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far ) , there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses , hence the name minimax . When examining every possible strategy , a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary . The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss . 
 Such strategies , which minimize the maximum loss for each player , are called optimal . Von Neumann showed that their <unk> are equal ( in absolute value ) and contrary ( in sign ) . Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players , publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior ( written with Oskar Morgenstern ) . Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject . He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it . This was repeated a couple of times , and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long . Then it became a book . The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front @-@ page story . In this book , von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods , especially convex sets and topological fixed @-@ point theorem , rather than the traditional differential calculus , because the maximum @-@ operator did not preserve differentiable functions . 
 Independently , Leonid Kantorovich 's functional analytic work on mathematical economics also focused attention on optimization theory , non @-@ differentiability , and vector lattices . Von Neumann 's functional @-@ analytic techniques — the use of duality pairings of real vector spaces to represent prices and quantities , the use of supporting and separating <unk> and convex sets , and fixed @-@ point theory — have been the primary tools of mathematical economics ever since . 
 = = = Mathematical economics = = = 
 Von Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several stunning publications . For his model of an expanding economy , von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed @-@ point theorem . Von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencil A − <unk> with nonnegative matrices A and B ; von Neumann sought probability vectors p and q and a positive number λ that would solve the complementarity equation 
 <formula> 
 along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency . In this model , the ( transposed ) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the " intensity " at which the production process would run . The unique solution λ represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the rate of growth of the economy ; the rate of growth equals the interest rate . 
 Von Neumann 's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming , where von Neumann 's model uses only nonnegative matrices . The study of von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics . This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors , who recognized its introduction of fixed @-@ point theorems , linear inequalities , complementary slackness , and <unk> duality . In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann 's growth model , Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists , but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself . 
 Von Neumann 's famous 9 @-@ page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in German , which was eventually translated into English . His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows : When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest , and so did the economist Nicholas Kaldor , and they hit it off . Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist Léon Walras . Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them , for example , replacing equations by inequalities . He noticed that Walras 's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras ' Law , which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations , could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product . He replaced the equations by inequalities , introduced dynamic equilibria , among other things , and eventually produced the paper . 
 = = = Linear programming = = = 
 Building on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy , von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming , after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes , when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point . Then , Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets , fixed @-@ point theory , and duality , conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming . 
 Later , von Neumann suggested a new method of linear programming , using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan ( 1873 ) , which was later popularized by <unk> 's algorithm . Von Neumann 's method used a pivoting algorithm between <unk> , with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative least squares <unk> with a convexity constraint ( projecting the zero @-@ vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex ) . Von Neumann 's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming . 
 = = = Mathematical statistics = = = 
 Von Neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics . In 1941 , he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables . This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin – Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order <unk> . 
 Subsequently , Denis <unk> and Alok Bhargava extended the results for testing if the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian random walk ( i.e. , possess a unit root ) against the alternative that they are a stationary first order <unk> . 
 = = = Fluid dynamics = = = 
 Von Neumann made fundamental contributions in exploration of problems in numerical hydrodynamics . For example , with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves . When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems , they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity ( shock waves ) . The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics . Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves , and the co @-@ discovery of the <unk> detonation model of explosives . 
 = = = Mastery of mathematics = = = 
 Stan Ulam , who knew von Neumann well , described his mastery of mathematics this way : " Most mathematicians know one method . For example , Norbert Wiener had mastered Fourier transforms . Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress someone who knows only one of them . John von Neumann had mastered three methods . " He went on to explain that the three methods were : 
 A facility with the symbolic manipulation of linear operators ; 
 An intuitive feeling for the logical structure of any new mathematical theory ; 
 An intuitive feeling for the combinatorial superstructure of new theories . 
 Edward Teller wrote that " Nobody knows all science , not even von Neumann did . But as for mathematics , he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology . That is , I think , something unique . " 
 = = Nuclear weapons = = 
 = = = Manhattan Project = = = 
 Beginning in the late 1930s , von Neumann developed an expertise in explosions — phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically . During this period von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of shaped charges . This led him to a large number of military consultancies , primarily for the Navy , which in turn led to his involvement in the Manhattan Project . The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project 's secret research facilities in Los Alamos , New Mexico . 
 Von Neumann 's principal contribution to the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki . While von Neumann did not originate the " implosion " concept , he was one of its most persistent proponents , encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues , who felt such a design to be unworkable . He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of " assembly " . 
 When it turned out that there would not be enough uranium @-@ 235 to make more than one bomb , the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann 's idea was implemented . Implosion was the only method that could be used with the plutonium @-@ 239 that was available from the Hanford Site . He established the design of the explosive lenses required , but there remained concerns about " edge effects " and imperfections in the explosives . His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5 % from spherical symmetry . After a series of failed attempts with models , this was achieved by George Kistiakowsky , and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945 . 
 In a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944 , von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90 ° and some limiting angle . As a result , it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target , rather than at ground level . 
 Along with four other scientists and various military personnel , von Neumann was included in the target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb . Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts , estimated death tolls , and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect . The cultural capital Kyoto , which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities , was von Neumann 's first choice , a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves . However , this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson . 
 On July 16 , 1945 , with numerous other Manhattan Project personnel , von Neumann was an eyewitness to the first atomic bomb blast , code named Trinity , conducted as a test of the implosion method device , at the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield , 35 miles ( 56 km ) southeast of Socorro , New Mexico . Based on his observation alone , von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to 5 kilotons of TNT ( 21 TJ ) but Enrico Fermi produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn @-@ up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered . The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons . It was in von Neumann 's 1944 papers that the expression " kilotons " appeared for the first time . After the war , Robert Oppenheimer remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had " known sin " . Von Neumann 's response was that " sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it . " 
 Von Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became , along with Edward Teller , one of those who sustained the hydrogen bomb project . He collaborated with Klaus Fuchs on further development of the bomb , and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on " Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy " , which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate nuclear fusion . The Fuchs – von Neumann patent used radiation implosion , but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design , the Teller – Ulam design . Their work was , however , incorporated into the " George " shot of Operation Greenhouse , which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design . The Fuchs – von Neumann work was passed on to the Soviet Union by Fuchs as part of his nuclear espionage , but it was not used in the Soviets ' own , independent development of the Teller – Ulam design . The historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that ironically , " John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs , produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb , but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made . " 
 For his wartime services , von Neumann was awarded the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award in July 1946 , and the Medal for Merit in October 1946 . 
 = = = Atomic Energy Commission = = = 
 In 1950 , von Neumann became a consultant to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group ( <unk> ) , whose function was to advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of Defense on the development and use of new technologies . He also became an adviser to the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project ( AFSWP ) , which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons . Over the following two years , he became a consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission , a consultant to the newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force . 
 In 1955 , von Neumann became a commissioner of the AEC . He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery . He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons , and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted . He was adamant that H @-@ bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible , and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn 't be a problem with an H @-@ bomb . He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system , which turned out to be the case . Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb , he testified on the latter 's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing , at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal , and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead . 
 Shortly before his death , when he was already quite ill , von Neumann headed the United States government 's top secret ICBM committee , and it would sometimes meet in his home . Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon . Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable , they could be overcome in time . The SM @-@ 65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959 , two years after his death . The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved , smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry , and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable . 
 = = = Mutual assured destruction = = = 
 Von Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction , providing the deliberately humorous acronym , MAD . ( Other humorous acronyms coined by von Neumann include his computer , the Mathematical Analyzer , Numerical <unk> , and Computer — or MANIAC ) . He also " moved heaven and earth " to bring MAD about . His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR , and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany , and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA . The Russians considered that bombers would soon be vulnerable , and they shared von Neumann 's view that an H @-@ bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons ; they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world , without necessarily using them . He was afraid of a " missile gap " and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets : 
 He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H @-@ bomb calculations verifying that the Teller @-@ Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further . 
 Through the Atomic Energy Commission , he promoted the development of a compact H @-@ bomb that would fit in an ICBM . 
 He personally interceded to speed up the production of lithium @-@ 6 and tritium needed for the compact bombs . 
 He caused several separate missile projects to be started , because he felt that competition combined with collaboration got the best results . 
 Von Neumann 's assessment that the Soviets had a lead in missile technology , considered pessimistic at the time , was soon proven correct in the Sputnik crisis . 
 Von Neumann entered government service ( Manhattan Project ) primarily because he felt that , if freedom and civilization were to survive , it would have to be because the US would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism , Fascism and Soviet Communism . During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as " violently anti @-@ communist , and much more militaristic than the norm " . He was quoted in 1950 remarking , " If you say why not bomb [ the Soviets ] tomorrow , I say , why not today ? If you say today at five o 'clock , I say why not one o 'clock ? " 
 On February 15 , 1956 , von Neumann was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Dwight D. Eisenhower . His citation read : 
 Dr. von Neumann , in a series of scientific study projects of major national significance , has materially increased the scientific progress of this country in the armaments field . 
 Through his work on various highly classified missions performed outside the continental limits of the United States in conjunction with critically important international programs , Dr. von Neumann has resolved some of the most difficult technical problems of national defense . 
 = = Computing = = 
 Von Neumann was a founding figure in computing . Donald Knuth cites von Neumann as the inventor , in 1945 , of the merge sort algorithm , in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged . Von Neumann wrote the sorting program for the EDVAC in ink , which was 23 pages long ; traces can still be seen on the first page of the phrase " TOP <unk> " , which was written in pencil and later erased . He also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with Alan Turing when the latter visited Princeton in the 1930s . 
 Von Neumann 's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing , where he and Stanislaw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann 's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations . During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method , which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers . His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the " software whitening " stage of some hardware random number generators . Because using lists of " truly " random numbers was extremely slow , von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers , using the middle @-@ square method . Though this method has been criticized as crude , von Neumann was aware of this : he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal , writing that " Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is , of course , in a state of sin . " Von Neumann also noted that when this method went awry it did so obviously , unlike other methods which could be subtly incorrect . 
 While consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project , von Neumann wrote an incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . The paper , whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly , described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer 's memory in the same address space . This architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design , unlike the earliest computers that were " programmed " using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard . Although the single @-@ memory , stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann 's paper , the architecture 's description was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly , inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania . 
 John von Neumann consulted for the Army 's Ballistic Research Laboratory , most notably on the ENIAC project , as a member of its Scientific Advisory Committee . The electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one @-@ sixth the speed , but this in no way degraded the ENIAC 's performance , since it was still entirely I / O bound . Complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for <unk> the old ENIAC . Some of von Neumann 's early computer programs have been preserved . The next computer that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey . He arranged its financing , and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby . John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701 , nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum . It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704 . 
 Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953 . However , the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s . He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers , constructing the first self @-@ replicating automata with pencil and graph paper . The concept of a universal constructor based on the von Neumann cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata . The von Neumann neighborhood , in which each cell in a two @-@ dimensional grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors , continues to be used for other cellular automata . Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large @-@ scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self @-@ replicating spacecraft , taking advantage of their exponential growth . His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self @-@ replication ( of the semiotic relationship between constructor , description and that which is constructed ) , preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA . Beginning in 1949 , von Neumann 's design for a self @-@ reproducing computer program is considered the world 's first computer virus , and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology . 
 Von Neumann 's team performed the world 's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer ; von Neumann published the paper Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation in 1950 . Von Neumann 's interest in weather systems and meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the polar ice caps to enhance absorption of solar radiation ( by reducing the albedo ) . thereby inducing global warming . Noting that the Earth was only 6 ° F ( 3 @.@ 3 ° C ) colder during the last glacial period , he said that the burning of coal and oil would result in " a general warming of the Earth by about one degree Fahrenheit . " 
 = = Cognitive abilities = = 
 Von Neumann 's ability to instantaneously perform complex operations in his head stunned other mathematicians . Eugene Wigner wrote that , seeing von Neumann 's mind at work , " one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch . " Paul Halmos states that " von Neumann 's speed was awe @-@ inspiring . " Edward Teller admitted that he " never could keep up with him " . Teller also said " von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3 @-@ year @-@ old son , and the two of them would talk as equals , and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us . Most people avoid thinking if they can , some of us are addicted to thinking , but von Neumann actually enjoyed thinking , maybe even to the exclusion of everything else . " 
 Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described von Neumann as the " fastest mind I ever met " , and Jacob Bronowski wrote " He was the cleverest man I ever knew , without exception . He was a genius . " George Pólya , whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student , said " Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of . If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem , the chances were he 'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper . " Halmos recounts a story told by Nicholas Metropolis , concerning the speed of von Neumann 's calculations , when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle : 
 Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other , each going at a steady rate of 10 mph . At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one , then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again , and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels . Question : what total distance did the fly cover ? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first , northbound , leg of the trip , then on the second , southbound , leg , then on the third , etc . , etc . , and , finally , to sum the infinite series so obtained . The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start , so that the fly had just an hour for his travels ; the answer must therefore be 15 miles . When the question was put to von Neumann , he solved it in an instant , and thereby disappointed the questioner : " Oh , you must have heard the trick before ! " " What trick ? " asked von Neumann , " All I did was sum the geometric series . " 
 Eugene Wigner told a similar story , only with a swallow instead of a fly , and says it was Max Born who posed the question to von Neumann in the 1920s . 
 Herman Goldstine wrote : 
 One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall . As far as I could tell , von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim ; moreover , he could do it years later without hesitation . He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English . On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started . Whereupon , without any pause , he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes . 
 Ulam noted that von Neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one . 
 " I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann 's does not indicate a species superior to that of man " , said Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe of Cornell University . " It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper , then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived , " wrote Miklós <unk> in " Selected Letters . " James <unk> wrote : " he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics " . The mathematician Jean Dieudonné said that von Neumann " may have been the last representative of a once @-@ flourishing and numerous group , the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions " , while Peter Lax described him as possessing the " most scintillating intellect of this century " . 
 = = Death = = 
 In 1955 , von Neumann was diagnosed with what was either bone or pancreatic cancer . 
 He invited a Roman Catholic priest , Father Anselm Strittmatter , O.S.B. , to visit him for consultation . Von Neumann reportedly said in explanation that Pascal had a point , referring to Pascal 's Wager . Father Strittmatter administered the last rites to him . Some of von Neumann 's friends ( such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern ) said they had always believed him to be " completely agnostic . " " Of this deathbed conversion , Morgenstern told <unk> , " He was of course completely agnostic all his life , and then he suddenly turned Catholic — it doesn 't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude , outlook and thinking when he was healthy . " Father Strittmatter recalled that von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it , as he still remained terrified of death . 
 On his deathbed , Von Neumann entertained his brother by reciting , by heart and word @-@ for @-@ word , the first few lines of each page of Goethe 's Faust . He died at age 53 on February 8 , 1957 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. under military security lest he reveal military secrets while heavily medicated . He was buried at Princeton Cemetery in Princeton , Mercer County , New Jersey .

 = Great spotted kiwi = 
 The great spotted kiwi , great gray kiwi , or <unk> ( Apteryx <unk> ) is a species of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand . The great spotted kiwi , as a member of the ratites , is flightless . It is the largest of the kiwi . The rugged topography and harsh climate of the high altitude , alpine , part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators , which include dogs , ferrets , cats and stoats . Because of this , populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi . Nonetheless , there has been a 43 % decline in population in the past 45 years , due to these predators and habitat destruction . This has led it to be classified as vulnerable . There are less than 16 @,@ 000 great spotted kiwis in total , almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson , the northwest coast , and the Southern Alps . A minority live on island reserves . 
 This kiwi is highly aggressive , and pairs will defend their large territories ( 49 acres ) against other kiwi . Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal , and will sleep during the day in burrows . At night , they feed on invertebrates and will also eat plants . Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March . The egg is the largest of all birds in proportion to the size of the bird . Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch , and after hatching , they are abandoned by their parents . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 This large kiwi is one of five species of kiwis residing in New Zealand . The other four are the <unk> ( Apteryx australis ) , <unk> brown kiwi ( Apteryx <unk> ) , little spotted kiwi ( Apteryx owenii ) , and North Island brown kiwi ( Apteryx mantelli ) . Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi . The kiwi genus , Apteryx , is endemic to New Zealand , 44 % of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic . Kiwis are placed in the ratite family , which also includes the emu , ostrich , rhea , and cassowary . All ratites are flightless . Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand . 
 Relationships in the genus Apteryx 
 Before the great spotted kiwi was known to science , several stories circulated about the existence of a large kiwi called the Maori <unk> . In 1871 , two specimens were brought to the Canterbury Museum , where they were identified as a new species and were named after the museum 's curator , Dr. Haast . 
 The great spotted kiwi was first described as Apteryx <unk> by Thomas Potts , in 1872 , based on a specimen from Westland , New Zealand . It is a monotypic species . 
 The genus name , Apteryx , comes from the Ancient Greek words a " without " or " no " , and pteryx , " wing " and <unk> is the Latin form of the last name of Sir Julius von Haast .

 Great spotted kiwis are the largest of the kiwis ; the male is 45 cm ( 18 in ) tall , while the female is 50 cm ( 20 in ) tall . Bill length ranges from 9 to 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) , while weight ranges between 1 @.@ 2 and 2 @.@ 6 kg ( 2 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 7 lb ) for males and 1 @.@ 5 and 3 @.@ 3 kg ( 3 @.@ 3 and 7 @.@ 3 lb ) for females . The body is pear @-@ shaped , while the head and neck is small with a long slender ivory bill . The great spotted kiwi , along with the other kiwi species , is the only bird with nostrils at the end of its bill . The eyes are small and do not see well , as it relies mostly on its sense of smell . The legs are short , with three toes per foot . It has a plumage composed of soft , hair @-@ like feathers , which have no <unk> . The plumage can range from charcoal gray to light brown . They have large vibrissae around the gape , and they have no tail , only a small pygostyle . The common name of this bird comes from black spots on its feathers . They use their powerful legs and claws for defense against predators like stoats or ferrets . Kiwis are flightless birds , and hence lack hollow bones , lack a keel to which wing muscles anchor , and have tiny wings . This species also has a low body temperature compared to other birds . Average lifespan is 30 to 40 years . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Greater spotted kiwis once lived in numerous areas throughout the South Island , but because of predation by invasive species , the remaining kiwi are now restricted to three localities . These kiwi live in higher altitude areas . Populations are present from northwestern Nelson to the Buller River , the northwest coast ( <unk> River to Arthur 's Pass ) , and the <unk> Range , as well as within the Lake Rotoiti Mainland Island . The Southern Alps population is particularly isolated . Great spotted kiwis reside in complex , maze @-@ like burrows that they construct . Up to fifty burrows can exist in one bird 's territory . They will often move around , staying in a different burrow every day . Bird 's Nest Fungus sometimes grows in these burrows . Their habitat ranges in elevation from sea level to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) , but the majority are concentrated in a range from 700 to 1 @,@ 100 m ( 2 @,@ 300 – 3 @,@ 600 ft ) in a subalpine zone . These kiwis will live in tussock grasslands , scrubland , pasture , and forests .

 The great spotted kiwi population started declining when European settlers first arrived in New Zealand . Before settlers arrived , about 12 million great spotted kiwis lived in New Zealand . This bird is often preyed upon by invasive pigs , dogs , ferrets and stoats , leading to a 5 % chick survival rate . It has more of an advantage than other kiwi species over these predators because it lives in high altitude areas , where the wet upland population thrives . However , there has been a decrease in population of 43 % in the past 45 years , and has declined 90 % since 1900 . Humans have also endangered the species by destroying their habitat by logging forests and building mines . Previously , humans hunted these kiwis for feathers and food . In 1988 , the species was listed as Least Concern species . It is currently classified by the IUCN as a vulnerable species . This kiwi has an occurrence range of 8 @,@ 500 km2 ( 3 @,@ 300 sq mi ) , and in 2000 an estimated 22 @,@ 000 adult birds remained . They have been trending down about 5 @.@ 8 % a year . The main threat is from invasive predators including mustelids , brush @-@ tailed possum <unk> <unk> , feral cats , dogs and pigs The most threatened populations are in the southern areas of the species ' range . Less than 16 @,@ 000 great spotted kiwis remain . Movements for saving the kiwi are in place , and sanctuaries for the great spotted kiwi have been made . Thanks to intensive trapping and poisoning efforts the chick survival rate has been raised to about 60 % in areas where mammalian pest control is undertaken . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behavior . If the kiwis live in an area lacking predators , they will come out in the day . At night , they come out to feed . Like other species of kiwi , they have a good sense of smell , which is unusual in birds . Males are fiercely territorial . At most , four to five kiwis live in a square kilometer . One pair 's territory can be 25 hectares ( 62 acres ) in size . It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size . They will call , chase , or fight intruders out . Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls , hisses , and bill snapping . Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a warbling whistle , while the female call is harsh raspy , and also warbling . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 In the ground , they dig for earthworms and grubs , and they search for beetles , cicada , crickets , flies , weta , spiders , caterpillars , slugs and snails on the ground . They will also feed on berries and seeds . To find prey , the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations caused by the movement of their prey . To do the latter , a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground , then use its beak to dig into the ground . As they are nocturnal , they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt . Kiwis will also swallow small stones , which aid in digestion . 
 = = = Predation = = = 
 Because adult great spotted kiwis are large and powerful , they are able to fend off most predators that attack them , such as stoats , ferrets , weasels , pigs , brush possums and cats , all of which are invasive species in New Zealand . However , dogs are able to kill even adults . <unk> , ferrets , possums , cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks , meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life . Before the arrival of mammalian predators , the great spotted kiwi 's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast 's eagle and Eyles ' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Great spotted kiwis are monogamous , with pairings sometimes lasting twenty years . Nests are made in burrows . The breeding season begins in June and ends in March , as this is when food is plentiful . Males reach sexual maturity at 18 months in captivity , while females are able to lay eggs after three years . In the wild , sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five . Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate . The pair mates about two to three times during peak activity . The gestation period is about a month . Females do not eat during this period , as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi 's body mass . The yolk takes up 65 % of the egg . In most bird eggs , the yolk takes up about 35 to 40 % of the egg . This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body . Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive . Because of the large size of the egg , gestation is uncomfortable for the female , and they do not move much . To relieve the pain , females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles . The egg @-@ laying season is between August and January . 
 After the female lays the egg , the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest . Males only leave the nest for a few hours to hunt , and during this time , the female takes over . It takes 75 to 85 days for the egg to hatch . The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg . Kiwi chicks are precocial , and are abandoned by their parents after hatching . After ten days , chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt . Most chicks are killed by predators in the first six months of their life . Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six . Unlike most birds , female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries . Most birds have only one . Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year , as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg . 
 = Potamon fluviatile = 
 Potamon fluviatile is a freshwater crab found in or near wooded streams , rivers and lakes in Southern Europe . It is an omnivore with broad ecological tolerances , and adults typically reach 50 mm ( 2 in ) in size during their 10 – 12 year lifespan . They inhabit burrows and are aggressive , apparently outcompeting native crayfish . 
 P. fluviatile has been harvested for food since classical antiquity , and is now threatened by overexploitation . Many of the island populations are particularly vulnerable , and the Maltese subspecies has become a conservation icon . A population in Rome may have been brought there before the founding of the Roman Empire . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult Potamon fluviatile may reach a carapace length of 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) , with females being generally smaller than males . As with other crabs , the body is roughly square , with the reduced abdomen tucked beneath the thorax . The thorax bears five pairs of legs , the first of which is armed with large claws . 
 The life span of P. fluviatile is typically 10 – 12 years . Moulting does not occur in winter . Mating lasts between 30 min and 21 hours , with spawning usually taking place in August . Females carry the eggs on their pleopods ( appendages on the abdomen ) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs , having passed through the larval stages inside the egg . 
 Potamon fluviatile is edible , as indicated by its alternative specific epithet edulis , and was known to the ancient Greeks ; it is probably this species which they depicted on medals found at Agrigento , Sicily . More recently , the species was depicted on the 5 ¢ coin in the last series of Maltese coins before the introduction of the Euro there in 2007 . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Potamon fluviatile has a generalist diet , feeding on vegetable debris , scraping algae from surfaces , or preying on frogs , tadpoles , and various invertebrates , such as insect larvae , snails or worms . No predator seems to specialise on P. fluviatile , but a number of animals take it opportunistically , including rats , foxes , weasels , birds of prey and jays . The most significant predator may be mankind , with individual prospectors able to catch 3 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 in one season . 
 Adults occupy burrows , while smaller individuals shelter under stones . The entrances to the burrows may be more than 5 m ( 16 ft ) from the stream 's edge and are always above water level . The burrows may be more than 80 cm ( 31 in ) long , and probably serve to protect the crabs from extreme cold . 
 Potamon fluviatile is an aggressive species , mostly attacking with the larger right claw , since 90 % of individuals are right @-@ handed . 
 In the <unk> @-@ Emilian Apennines , P. fluviatile is only found south of the watershed , in contrast with the crayfish <unk> pallipes , which occurs on both sides on the mountains . Although their ranges overlap , the two species do not inhabit the same water courses , apparently because the crab <unk> the crayfish , which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where the crab cannot survive . Non @-@ indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to P. fluviatile than native crayfish , although the greatest threats remain pollution , overfishing and the draining of wetlands . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The natural range of Potamon fluviatile is highly fragmented , and covers parts of many countries with a Mediterranean coastline . It is found in mainland Italy and on the Balkan Peninsula from Dalmatia to the Axios River in Greece . It is also found on a number of islands , including Sicily , Malta and Gozo , the Ionian Islands , Aegean Islands , <unk> and Andros in the Cyclades . Although the species as a whole is widespread , it is declining in numbers , and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable . 
 = = = Italy = = = 
 Potamon fluviatile is widely distributed in much of mainland Italy , especially in the provinces of Trento , Lombardy , Veneto , Liguria , Tuscany , Umbria , Lazio , Campania , Apulia , and Calabria , as well as on the island of Sicily . Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda , P. fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po . 
 In 1997 a population of P. fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan 's Forum in the heart of Rome , living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the <unk> Maxima . Based on a genetic analysis , which demonstrated that these crabs were similar to those in Greece , researchers believe that they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city , some 3000 years ago . The crabs ' unusual size , up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) , and longevity ( up to 15 years ) are also interpreted as evidence of a long @-@ established population , by analogy with island gigantism . 
 = = = Malta = = = 
 On the island of Malta , Potamon fluviatile is rare and restricted to a few locations in the west of the island . On Gozo , there is a single population which inhabits a stretch of river only 700 metres ( 770 yd ) long . 
 = = = Balkans = = = 
 In the Balkan Peninsula , Potamon fluviatile is known to occur in Croatia , Montenegro , the Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Greece . There are four species of Potamon in the Balkans , and P. fluviatile is replaced by Potamon <unk> in northeastern Greece . In mainland Greece , P. fluviatile is found in the drainages of the Axios , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> and Evrotas rivers . 
 In the Ionian Islands , P. fluviatile is known to occur at only one site on Corfu , as well as on Kefalonia , Lefkada and Zakynthos . In the Aegean Islands , it is found on Skiathos and Skopelos ( <unk> ) , on Euboea and Skyros , and at a single site on Andros in the Cyclades . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Potamon fluviatile is at the western distributional limit of the genus Potamon . Other species in the genus occur through Eastern Europe and the Middle East , and across Central Asia as far east as northwestern India . The populations of P. fluviatile on the Peloponnese , Kefalonia , and Zakynthos may represent a separate , cryptic species , and the population from the Peloponnese was described in 2010 as P. <unk> . 
 P. fluviatile was formerly divided into three subspecies : P. f. <unk> , P. f. <unk> and P. f. fluviatile . The first two of these live in North Africa , and were later combined and separated from P. fluviatile as the species Potamon <unk> . By 1983 , the nominate subspecies ( equivalent to the current circumscription of the species P. fluviatile ) had been divided into six <unk> , or " tribes " . <unk> fluviatilis was found in northern Italy , natio <unk> in southern Italy , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were found in parts of Greece . The geographical distribution of natio <unk> was not reported , and it was suggested that a further ( undescribed ) tribe inhabited the Greek island of Andros . Despite this wealth of infraspecific taxa , they are rarely used by scientists , and some have questioned directly the value of defining infraspecific taxa within P. fluviatile . In 1990 , the population on Malta was described as a separate subspecies , Potamon fluviatile <unk> , and that taxon has become a conservation icon in Malta following its legal protection in 1993 , although not all scientists recognise the taxon . 
 = BGM @-@ 75 AICBM = 
 The ZBGM @-@ 75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile , also known as Weapons System 120A ( WS @-@ 120A ) , was a program to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) , proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s as a replacement for the LGM @-@ 30 Minuteman as the Air Force 's standard ICBM . Funding was not allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Department of Defense began the STRAT @-@ X study on 1 November 1966 to evaluate a new ballistic missile proposal from the Air Force , which was designated the Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ( AICBM ) . The project was intended to provide a successor to the LGM @-@ 30 Minuteman ICBM then in United States Air Force service . The program was officially launched in April 1966 , and in June the project received the designation ZBGM @-@ 75 , the " Z " prefix indicating a project in the planning stage . 
 The specifications for the ZBGM @-@ 75 called for a large solid @-@ fuel @-@ powered missile , which would be fitted with between 10 and 20 multiple independently <unk> reentry vehicles ( <unk> ) . The missiles would be based in silo launchers , which were specified to be hardened by a factor of 10 over the existing silos used by Minuteman missiles . In addition , there was also a plan to develop a railroad @-@ based deployment system for the AICBM . Improvements in accuracy over existing missiles , combined with penetration aids under development to enhance the effectiveness of each missile , were expected to make the AICBM capable of defeating existing and projected Soviet anti @-@ ballistic missile systems . 
 = = Cancellation = = 
 Ultimately , the Navy won the STRAT @-@ X competition with the design that would become the Ohio @-@ class ballistic missile submarines . Nevertheless , the final report , issued in August 1967 , recommended that the ZBGM @-@ 75 also be developed . Accordingly , the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara that the ZBGM @-@ 75 be funded starting in Fiscal Year ( FY ) 1969 , with a projected entry into service by 1973 . This recommendation came after the Air Force had completed the preliminary studies on the missiles and the new , hardened silos . McNamara instead kept the missile in " advanced development " , which stopped all work on the project . Only development of the new super @-@ hardened silos was approved for funding ; these would be used by the Minuteman missiles . As a result , the missile 's development was cancelled . McNamara 's rationale for cancelling the program was the destabilizing influence of the new missile , which could have rendered existing Soviet anti @-@ ballistic missile defenses ineffective . McNamara saw relative parity between the two powers — the strategic basis for mutually assured destruction — as the best method to keep the Soviet Union in a position where it must negotiate with the United States . 
 After the cancellation of WS @-@ 120A , the Air Force made no further development of new ICBMs until 1972 . In that year the M @-@ X project was begun , which resulted in the development of the LGM @-@ 118 Peacekeeper . The Peacekeeper entered service in the mid @-@ 1980s and served until 2005 ; the Minuteman III is still in service , and has outlasted both of its planned replacements . 
 = Lactarius sanguifluus = 
 Lactarius sanguifluus , commonly known as the bloody milk cap , is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae . First described from France in 1811 , the species was given its current name by Elias Fries in 1838 when he transferred it to Lactarius . Found in Asia , Mediterranean Africa , and Europe , fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under conifers , especially Douglas fir . When bruised or cut , the fruit bodies ooze a blood @-@ red to purple latex that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air . The caps are orangish to reddish @-@ brown , and become funnel @-@ shaped with age . The gills are pinkish to purplish . Different forms have been described from Italy , but these are not universally accepted as distinct . L. sanguifluus mushrooms are edible , and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia . Fruit bodies grown in polluted soil , including roadsides subject to heavy traffic , can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals . Several sterols and pigment have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The fungus was first described by French mycologist Jean @-@ Jacques Paulet as <unk> <unk> in 1811 . It was given its current name by Elias Magnus Fries when he transferred it to Lactarius in his 1838 work Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici . In 1892 , Otto Kuntze called it a Lactifluus , a genus that until 2010 was considered a synonym of Lactarius . Because Paulet 's 1811 type illustration of the species did not represent the typical morphology of the fruit bodies , <unk> <unk> and Annemieke Verbeken designated an <unk> in 2005 . 
 Giovanni <unk> and Giorgio Lalli described the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003 ; roseus has a greyish @-@ whitish cap discolouration , while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones , and gills with a lilac @-@ pinkish sheen . However , form vinosus , originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety ( Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus ) in 1881 , was invalid , because Quélet 's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym of a species named in 1855 by Jean @-@ Baptiste Barla . Later authors did not agree with the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa , suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age , and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity . Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L. sanguifluus , but morphological ( especially macroscopic characters and spore @-@ ornamentation ) and molecular evidence ( based on internal transcribed spacer @-@ sequencing ) has confirmed that they are separate species . 
 Lactarius sanguifluus is classified in the section <unk> of the genus Lactarius . This section , which also includes other popular edible species such as L. deliciosus , and the less popular L. deterrimus , is characterized by mushrooms with orange or red latex that often impart a greenish stain on the flesh and gills , an often sticky cap , and association with conifers . The specific epithet sanguifluus is derived from the Latin words <unk> ( " blood " ) and <unk> ( " flowing " ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies have convex caps with a central depression , reaching a diameter of 4 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) . The cap surface is smooth and sticky , and the margins are curved downward , even as the mushroom matures . Its color is pinkish @-@ buff to orangish , sometimes with patches of grayish or pale greenish @-@ gray , especially where the surface has been bruised . The somewhat crowded gills have an adnate to slightly decurrent attachment to the stipe . They are pale vinaceous with a pale pinkish @-@ buff edge . The cylindrical stipe measures 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) long by 1 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . Its smooth surface is colored pale pinkish @-@ buff to pale greyish @-@ buff , sometimes with brownish irregular dots . The flesh ranges from firm to fragile : in the stipe , it is soft and pale pinkish buff ; under the cap cuticle it is brick colored , or brownish @-@ red just above the gills . Its taste ranges from mild to slightly bitter , and it lacks any significant odor . 
 The spores are roughly spherical to ellipsoidal , measuring 7 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 5 by 8 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 8 µm . They feature surface ornamentations up to 0 @.@ 8 µm high and an almost complete reticulum comprising broad , rounded ridges . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are somewhat cylindrical , four @-@ spored , and measure 50 – 70 by 9 – 11 µm . The cap cuticle is an ixocutis ( made of gelatinous hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface ) up to 60 µm thick , with hyphae that are 2 – 6 wide that are usually branched and interwoven . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lactarius vinosus , formerly considered a variety of L. sanguifluus , is quite similar in appearance . In general , L. vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous @-@ red color ( lacking orange tones ) of its cap , stipe , and gills , the more distinctly downwards @-@ tapered stipe , and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue . The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces . L. vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface , with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness . Another potential lookalike , L. semisanguifluus , has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine @-@ red in 5 – 10 minutes after exposure to air . Compared to L. sanguifluus , the fruit bodies of L. semisanguifluus are smaller , have tinges of violet in the cap , and develop a greenish discolouration with age . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 An ectomycorrhizal species , Lactarius sanguifluus fruit bodies grow on the ground in association with pine trees on calcareous soils . L. sanguifluus is widely distributed in Himachal Pradesh in India , where it has been noted to grow in mixed coniferous forests , usually under the fern <unk> <unk> . It is widespread in Southern Europe , where it fruits between September and November ( extending to December in the southernmost regions of the continent ) . In the Netherlands , it was found in calcareous dunes , growing in a warm , sunny and sheltered place at the edge of a woods dominated in pine species . From Europe , it has also been recorded in Belgium , Estonia , Greece , Cyprus , France , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Russia , Spain , Slovakia , Sweden , and Switzerland . In Africa , the species has been collected in Morocco ; in Asia , it occurs in Vietnam and China . It is listed in the Red Data Book of the Ukraine , and appeared in a draft red list for Spain as an endangered edible species considered vulnerable due to uncontrolled commercial picking . To illustrate , a September 1998 newspaper report was cited , which reported that 82 @.@ 5 kg ( 182 lb ) of L. sanguifluus mushrooms picked in <unk> were seized from a van . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 The fruit bodies of Lactarius sanguifluus are edible , and choice . This was noted by Paulet in his original description of the species , who wrote : " This fungus is highly prized for use by those who are acquainted with it , it keeps well : I kept them for a whole year , it hardens without spoiling , then it takes on a taste of morels . The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt : it does not take long to cook " . The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France , Spain , Turkey , and Yunnan Province , China . They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy . In Spain , where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalonian cuisine , it is known as <unk> or <unk> . In Cyprus , it is known as <unk> ( meaning " the bloody one " ) and it is widely collected by the locals , but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap ( Lactarius deliciosus ) . In India , young specimens are consumed along with L. deliciosus ; and some consider L. sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well @-@ known relative . Its English common name is the " bloody milkcap " . 
 Fruit bodies can bioaccumulate heavy metals , including toxic ones , from polluted soil . For this reason , consuming mushrooms harvested from potentially contaminated sites — such as near roadsides subject to heavy traffic — is not recommended . In a Turkish study of various edible mushroom species collected from lawns , near roads , and the inner parts of forests , the fruit bodies of L. sanguifluus were determined to have accumulated high levels of zinc , manganese , nickel , cobalt , cadmium , and lead . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Lactarius sanguifluus contains a mixture of sterols .

 The latex contains sesquiterpene pigments with <unk> skeletons ; these include the compounds given the common names <unk> and <unk> . Some of these chemicals are thought to undergo enzymatic conversions when the fruit body becomes injured . Fruit body extracts have been shown to have some antimicrobial activity against Gram @-@ positive and Gram @-@ negative bacteria .
