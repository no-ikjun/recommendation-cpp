 The attack on Sydney Harbour ended in failure on both sides , and revealed flaws in both the Allied defences and the Japanese tactics . During the primary attack , the Japanese lost all three midget submarines in exchange for the sinking of a single barracks ship . The subsequent operations were no more successful as the five large Japanese submarines sank only three merchant ships and caused minimal property damage during the two bombardments . The performance of the Allied defenders was equally poor . However , one historian states that the lack of damage in Sydney Harbour was due to " a combination of good luck and aggressive counter @-@ attack " . 
 The main impact of the midget submarine attack and subsequent operations was psychological ; dispelling any belief that Sydney was immune to Japanese attack and highlighting Australia 's proximity to the Pacific War . There was no official inquiry into the attacks , despite demand from some sections of the media , as there was concern that an inquiry would lead to defeatism and reduce faith in John Curtin 's government , particularly after the damaging inquiry into Australian defences that had followed the Japanese aerial attack on Darwin three months earlier . 
 = = = Failures in Allied defences = = = 
 The Allies failed to respond adequately to several warnings of Japanese activity off the east coast of Australia prior to the attack ; they simply ignored the warnings or explained them away . They attributed the unsuccessful attack on the freighter Wellen on 16 May to a single submarine , and assumed it had departed Australian waters immediately after the attack . The first reconnaissance flight went unnoticed , and although FRUMEL intercepted the report and distributed it to Allied commanders on 30 May , Muirhead @-@ Gould apparently did not react . New Zealand naval authorities detected radio chatter between the Japanese submarines on 26 and 29 May , and although they could not decrypt the transmissions , radio direction finding indicated that a submarine or submarines were approaching Sydney . The Allies considered dispatching an anti @-@ submarine patrol in response to the 29 May fix , but were unable to do so as all anti @-@ submarine craft were already committed to protecting a northbound troop convoy . The only response to the second reconnaissance flight on 29 May was the launching of search planes . No other defence measures were put into place . Although the midget attack on Diego Suarez in Madagascar occurred on the morning of 31 May ( Sydney time ) , the Allies sent no alert to other command regions , as they believed that Vichy French forces had launched the attack . 
 Historians have questioned the competence of the senior Allied officers . Muirhead @-@ Gould had been hosting a dinner party on the night of the attack , and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour , Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago . Both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place . Muirhead @-@ Gould arrived aboard HMAS Lolita at approximately midnight , an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation . But members of Lolita 's crew later recounted that when Muirhead @-@ Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat 's skipper and crew , and quickly dismissed their report . Junior officers on Chicago provided similar descriptions of Bode 's return on board , and members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead @-@ Gould and Bode were intoxicated . It was only after the destruction of HMAS Kuttabul that both officers began to take the attack seriously . 
 During the attack , there were several delays between events and responses to them . Over two hours passed between the observation of M @-@ 14 in the boom net and Muirhead @-@ Gould 's first order for ships to commence anti @-@ submarine actions . It took another two hours to mobilise the auxiliary patrol boats , which did not leave their anchorage for a further hour . Part of these delays was due to a lack of effective communications . None of the auxiliary patrol craft in the harbour had radio communications , so all instructions and reports came from signal lights via the Port War Signal Station or Garden Island , or by physical communication via launches . In Muirhead @-@ Gould 's preliminary report on the attack , he stated that the Port War Signal Station was not designed for the volume of communications traffic the attack caused . Telephone communications with Garden Island were unreliable during the early part of the attack , and then the first torpedo explosion disabled them completely . 
 The need to keep information secret may also have contributed to the delays and the defenders ' scepticism . As the auxiliary patrol boat crews , the indicator loop staff , and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside ' need to know ' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack , they would not have been alert , contributing to the disbelief demonstrated in the early hours of the attack . 
 = = = Flaws in Japanese tactics = = = 
 The main flaw in the Japanese plans was the use of midget submarines for the primary attack . Midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions : they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to run amok through the enemy fleet . This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier @-@ supported aerial combat . As a result , the midget program 's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours , where they would attack vessels at anchor . This concept failed completely during the attack on Pearl Harbor , where the midgets had no effect , and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further midget submarine attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources . 
 Moreover , the failures at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez demonstrated that the improvements to the midget submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the midget program . The modifications had various effects . The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines . However , the midgets were still difficult to control , unstable , and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably . These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M @-@ 14 's entanglement in the anti @-@ submarine net , and the repeated detection of M @-@ 21 and M @-@ 24 . 
 Beyond the use of the unreliable midgets , historians have identified areas in the plan of attack where the Japanese could have done significantly more damage . If the Japanese midget submarines had conducted a simultaneous , co @-@ ordinated attack , they would have overwhelmed the defences . A chance for more damage came following the destruction of Kuttabul , when several naval vessels headed to sea , including USS Chicago , USS Perkins , Dutch submarine K @-@ IX , HMAS Whyalla , and <unk> Bombay . The five mother submarines were already en route to the Port Hacking recovery position , and although Sasaki 's plan at Pearl Harbor had been to leave some submarines at the harbour mouth to pick off fleeing vessels , he did not repeat this tactic . 
 = = = USS Chicago 's survival = = = 
 Several factors beyond the control of any of the combatants contributed to the survival of USS Chicago . At the time of M @-@ 24 's attack on Chicago , the latter had spent some time preparing to depart from Sydney Harbour , and although still moored and stationary , was producing large volumes of white smoke as the boilers warmed up . This smoke , streaming aft under the influence of the wind , and contrasting against the dark , low @-@ lying cloud , may have given the impression that Chicago was moving , causing M @-@ 24 to lead the target when firing its torpedoes , and consequently sending its torpedoes across the bow . Another factor that may have influenced Chicago 's survival was the extinguishing of Garden Island 's floodlights minutes before M @-@ 24 fired its first torpedo , impeding targeting . 
 = = = Bombardment impact = = = 
 The bombardments failed to cause significant physical damage , but had a major psychological impact on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle . Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines ' range @-@ finding equipment , coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea , specific targeting was impossible . The intention of the submarine bombardment was to frighten the population of the target area . 
 The failure of the majority of the shells to detonate may have had various causes . As the submarines fired armour piercing shells , intended for use against steel ship hulls , the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses . Sea water may have degraded the shells , which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks . The age of the shells may also have been a factor ; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture ; surplus munitions from World War I. 
 In Sydney , fear of an impending Japanese invasion caused people to move west ; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped , while those beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly . The attack also led to a significant increase in the membership of volunteer defence organisations , and strengthening of defences in Sydney Harbour and Port Newcastle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The papers did not publish news of the submarine attack until 2 June , as most of the attack occurred after the newspapers went to press on the morning of 1 June . Instead , on the morning after the attack , the front pages carried news of Operation Millennium , the Royal Air Force 's first 1 @,@ 000 @-@ bomber raid , although several newspapers included a small interior article mentioning the final reconnaissance flyover . The Federal Censor ordered total censorship of the events , issuing an official statement on the afternoon of 1 June which reported that the Allies had destroyed three submarines in Sydney Harbour , and described the loss of Kuttabul and the 21 deaths as the loss of " one small harbour vessel of no military value " . Smith 's Weekly finally released the real story on 6 June , and follow @-@ up material in the 13 June issue caused more political damage , prompting the Royal Australian Navy to attempt to charge the newspaper with releasing defence information . 
 It was several days before the 21 dead sailors aboard Kuttabul could all be recovered . On 3 June , Muirhead @-@ Gould and over 200 Navy personnel attended a burial ceremony for these sailors . On 1 January 1943 , the Navy base at Garden Island was commissioned as HMAS Kuttabul in commemoration of the ferry and the lives lost . 
 The Australians recovered the bodies of the four Japanese crew of the two midget submarines sunk in Sydney Harbour and had them cremated at Rookwood Cemetery . For the cremation , the Allies draped the Japanese flag over each coffin and rendered full naval honours . Muirhead @-@ Gould was criticised for this , but defended his actions as respecting the courage of the four submariners , regardless of their origin . Australian politicians also hoped that the Japanese Government would notice the respect paid to the sailors and improve the conditions Australian prisoners @-@ of @-@ war were experiencing in Japanese internment camps . Japanese authorities noted the funeral service , but this did not lead to any major improvement in conditions for Australian POWs . Following the use of the midget submariners ' funeral by the Japanese for propaganda purposes , the Australian High Command forbade similar funerals for enemy personnel in the future . 
 An exchange of Japanese and Allied diplomatic personnel stranded in the opposing nations occurred in August 1942 , which allowed Tatsuo Kawai , the Japanese ambassador to Australia , to return home with the ashes of the four Japanese submariners . When the exchange ship Kamakura Maru arrived in Yokohama , several thousand people were present to honour the four men . 
 The two main targets of the attack , USS Chicago and HMAS Canberra , were both lost within the next year : Canberra sinking on 9 August 1942 during the Battle of Savo Island , and Chicago on 30 January 1943 following the Battle of Rennell Island . None of the Japanese submarines involved in the attack survived the war . USS Charrette and Fair sank I @-@ 21 on 5 February 1944 off the Marshall Islands . An American torpedo boat sank I @-@ 22 on 25 December 1942 off New Guinea . An American patrol craft sank I @-@ 24 on 10 June 1943 near the Aleutian Islands . HMS Paladin and Petard sank I @-@ 27 on 12 February 1943 off the Maldives . Lastly , USS Sawfish sank I @-@ 29 on 26 July 1944 in the Philippines . 
 = = = M @-@ 14 and M @-@ 21 = = = 
 The Allies located and recovered M @-@ 21 on 3 June and M @-@ 14 on 8 June . Although both were damaged during the attack , it was possible to assemble a complete submarine from the two vessels . The centre section of the rebuilt submarine was mounted on a trailer and taken on a 4 @,@ 000 km ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) tour throughout southern New South Wales , Victoria , and western South Australia . The purpose of the tour was twofold ; it allowed Australians to see a Japanese midget submarine up close , and was used to raise A £ 28 @,@ 000 for the Naval Relief Fund and other charities . The submarine arrived at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 28 April 1943 , flying the White Ensign and a paying @-@ off pennant . The submarine was originally displayed outside the museum in three separate pieces , but was moved inside in the 1980s due to heavy vandalism ; on one occasion in 1966 , a group of university students painted it bright yellow in response to The Beatles ' song Yellow Submarine . The composite submarine was restored and remains on display inside the Memorial as part of a permanent exhibition on the attack , next to the recovered wheelhouse of HMAS Kuttabul . The conning tower from M @-@ 21 is on display at the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre on Garden Island . Leftover material from M @-@ 21 was melted down and made into souvenirs following the construction of the combined vessel . 
 = = = M @-@ 24 = = = 
 Over the 64 years following the disappearance of M @-@ 24 after the attacks , more than 50 people approached the Royal Australian Navy claiming to have found the submarine . All of these claims were found to be false . One early theory about the midget 's fate was that it was damaged or destroyed , along with M @-@ 21 , in or around Taylors Bay , which would account for reports from Steady Hour and Yarroma of multiple submarines during their three @-@ hour attack against M @-@ 21 . A second theory was that the midget attempted to return to the mother submarines but exhausted its battery power before reaching the Port Hacking recovery point and would therefore be outside and to the south of Sydney Heads . The third theory was that the midget 's crew decided to avoid endangering the five larger submarines during the recovery process , and either ran straight out to sea or headed north . 
 A group of seven amateur scuba divers solved the mystery in November 2006 , when they found a small submarine sitting upright on the seabed , 55 metres ( 180 ft ) below sea level and approximately 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 7 nmi ; 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from <unk> Head , off Sydney 's Northern Beaches . Commander Shane Moore , the officer responsible for the Royal Australian Navy 's heritage collection , confirmed that the wreck was M @-@ 24 after viewing footage from multiple dives , along with measurements the group had taken . The wreck had several bullet holes in it , most likely from Chicago 's quadruple machine @-@ gun mount . The location of the wreck was kept secret by both the divers and the navy , with Defence Minister Brendan Nelson promising to have the wreck protected as a war grave . The wreck was gazetted on 1 December 2006 as a heritage site . A 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) exclusion zone was established around the wreck site , and any vessel entering the zone is liable to a fine under New South Wales law of up to A $ 1 @.@ 1 million , with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under Commonwealth law . <unk> and buoy @-@ mounted surveillance cameras and a sonar listening device further protect the site . 
 On 7 February 2007 , during JMSDF Admiral Eiji Yoshikawa 's visit to Australia , Yoshikawa and RAN Vice Admiral Russ <unk> presided over a ceremony held aboard HMAS Newcastle to honour M @-@ 24 's crew . Relatives of the midget submarines ' crews , one of the survivors from Kuttabul , and dignitaries and military personnel from Australia and Japan attended another ceremony on 6 August 2007 at HMAS Kuttabul . HMAS Melbourne then carried relatives of M @-@ 24 's crew to the wreck site , where they poured sake into the sea before being presented with sand taken from the seabed around the submarine . 
 In May 2012 , the NSW state government announced that , with the approval of the Japanese government and the submariners ' families , divers would be allowed to observe the M @-@ 24 wreck for a short period of time . Divers would enter a ballot for places on controlled dives run on several days . If successful , opening the site would become an annual event to commemorate the attack . 
 = Beeston Castle = 
 Beeston Castle is a former Royal castle in Beeston , Cheshire , England ( grid reference <unk> ) , perched on a rocky sandstone crag 350 feet ( 107 m ) above the Cheshire Plain . It was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , ( 1170 – 1232 ) , on his return from the Crusades . In 1237 , Henry III took over the ownership of Beeston , and it was kept in good repair until the 16th century , when it was considered to be of no further military use , although it was pressed into service again in 1643 , during the English Civil War . The castle was slighted ( partly demolished ) in 1646 , in accordance with Cromwell 's destruction order , to prevent its further use as a stronghold . During the 18th century the site was used as a quarry . 
 It is rumoured that treasure belonging to Richard II lies undiscovered in the castle grounds , but the many searches that have been carried out have failed to find any trace of it . The castle is now in ruins . The walls of the outer bailey , and the walls , gatehouse of the inner bailey are separately recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade I listed buildings . The castle is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument , owned by English Heritage . 
 = = Prehistory = = 
 Beeston crag is one of a chain of rocky hills stretching across the Cheshire Plain . Pits dating from the 4th millennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period . Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag , as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community , and of an Iron Age hill fort . The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270 – 830 BC ; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin . It may have been a specialist metalworking site . 
 = = Design = = 
 Beeston was built by Ranulf de Blondeville , 6th Earl of Chester , as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power . The siting of the castle 's outer bailey walls was chosen to take advantage of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart . In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de <unk> , the Castle on the Rock . It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s , shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade . The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire , and Chartley , Staffordshire , both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston ; in particular the design of the towers . 
 Unlike many other castles of the period , Beeston does not have a keep as its last line of defence . Instead the natural features of the land together with massive walls , strong gatehouses , and carefully positioned towers made the baileys themselves the stronghold . The defences consisted of two parts . Firstly , a rectangular castle on the summit of the hill , with a sheer drop on three sides and a defensive ditch up to 30 feet ( 9 m ) deep in places cut into the rock on the fourth side . Secondly , an outer bailey was built on the lower slopes , with a massive gatehouse protected by a 16 feet ( 5 m ) wide and 10 feet ( 3 m ) deep ditch . 
 The outer bailey was roughly rectangular , with 6 feet ( 2 m ) thick walls faced in sandstone and infilled with rubble . The walls , parts of which still remain , contain a number of D @-@ shaped towers , an innovation in English castles at that time . The towers allowed defenders to fire across the walls as well as forwards , and their open @-@ backed design meant that they would not offer cover to any attackers who gained access to the outer bailey . The inner bailey was situated on the rocky summit at the western end of the crag . 
 To provide the castle 's inhabitants with a supply of fresh water two wells were dug into the rock , one of them , at 370 feet ( 113 m ) deep , one of the deepest castle wells in England . 
 = = Royal castle = = 
 Although most of the defences were in place by the time of Ranulph 's death in 1232 , there were no living quarters , and neither were there on the death of Ranulph 's successor John in 1237 . John died without a male heir , allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire . Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales , and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives . No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers ; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey . 
 In 1254 Henry gave Beeston , together with other lands in Cheshire , to his son Prince Edward . He also gave the title Earl of Chester to the prince , a title that has been conferred on the heir to the throne of England ever since . Edward was crowned king of England in 1272 , and completed the conquest of Wales . 
 In the middle of the 14th century there are references to men of Cheshire who were made constables of the royal castle . The constable would probably have lived in or near the gatehouse . The habitation was described in an account of the castle in 1593 by Samson <unk> , which describes , " a goodly strong gatehouse , and strong wall with other buildings , which when they flourished were a convenient habitation for any great personage . " 
 Beeston was kept in good repair and improved during Edward 's reign , and throughout the 14th century . However , by the 16th century , the castle was considered to be of no further use to the English Crown , and in 1602 it was sold to Sir Hugh Beeston ( c . 1547 – 1626 ) of Beeston Hall . 
 There have been persistent rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II somewhere in the castle grounds . Richard is supposed to have hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399 , before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there . On his return , Richard was deposed by Henry , Duke of Lancaster , the future Henry IV , and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered . Many searches have been carried out , most of them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey , but nothing has ever been found . The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well @-@ founded , as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard 's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places . 
 = = Civil war = = 
 During the English Civil War many neglected castles were pressed into service . Beeston was seized on 20 February 1643 by Parliamentary forces commanded by Sir William Brereton . The walls were repaired and the motte was cleaned out . During 1643 part of the royal army of Ireland landed at Chester . On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night ( possibly aided by treachery ) and surprised the castle governor , Captain Thomas Steele , who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise that he would be allowed to march out of the castle with honours . Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle . 
 The Royalists survived a siege by parliamentary forces from November 1644 until November 1645 , when their lack of food forced them to surrender . The castle was partially demolished in 1646 , to prevent its further use as a stronghold . 
 = = Later history = = 
 Quarrying was carried out in the castle grounds during the 18th century , and the gatehouse leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones to be removed from the site . In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache , 1st Baron Tollemache , at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire , as part of a larger estate . In the mid @-@ 19th century the castle was the site of an annual two @-@ day fete , raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3000 visitors a day . 
 = = Present day = = 
 The castle is owned by English Heritage , and although in ruins , enough of the walls and towers are still in place to provide a clear picture of how it would have looked in its prime . It is open to visitors and has a small museum and visitor 's centre . A lodge house was built by Tollemache in the 19th century , and was expanded in the 20th century . The lodge is two storeys high , with two circular towers either side of a central archway . It is designated as a Grade II listed building . 
 Beeston offers one of the most spectacular views of any castle in England , stretching across eight counties from the Pennines in the east to the Welsh mountains in the west . 
 = Tonkin Highway = 
 Tonkin Highway is a 44 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 27 mi ) north @-@ south highway in Perth , Western Australia , linking Perth Airport and Kewdale with the city 's north @-@ eastern and south @-@ eastern suburbs . The northern terminus is at Reid Highway in Malaga , and the southern terminus is at Thomas Road in Oakford . It forms the entire length of State Route 4 , and connects to several major roads , including Great Eastern Highway , Leach Highway , Roe Highway , and Albany Highway . 
 Planning for the route began in the 1950s , but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980 . Over the next five years , the highway was extended north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway , and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River . In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections , and three years later , Reid Highway became the northern terminus . The next major works on the highway , between 2003 and 2005 , extended the highway south to Thomas Road . 
 The Gateway WA project plans to improve the road network around Perth Airport , including upgrading the central section of Tonkin Highway to a six @-@ lane freeway @-@ standard road . Construction began in 2013 , and completion is scheduled for 2017 . Further extensions to both the northern and southern extents of the highway are planned , which would connect the highway to the proposed Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura , and to South Western Highway south of Byford . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Tonkin Highway forms the entire length of State Route 4 . It is maintained by Main Roads Western Australia , and subject to control of access along its entire length . Some sections of the highway are freeway @-@ standard , with grade @-@ separated interchanges ; however , most junctions on the highway are at @-@ grade and traffic light controlled . The highway is a dual carriageway , primarily four lanes wide , though near some junctions the width briefly increases to six lanes . The speed limit is 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) near intersections , and 90 or 100 km / h ( 55 or 60 mph ) along the stretches in between . A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside part of Tonkin Highway , between Collier Road and Great Eastern Highway , as well as south of Mills Road East . In most other sections , the highway 's sealed shoulders also function as bicycle lanes . 
 Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state 's road network , including several locations along Tonkin Highway . The section near Perth Airport , south of Great Eastern Highway , is the busiest , averaging over 56 @,@ 000 vehicles per weekday in 2007 – 08 , and over 57 @,@ 000 in 2008 – 09 . North of the Swan River , the traffic volume gradually decreased to under 40 @,@ 000 vehicles per weekday near the northern terminus , in 2007 – 08 . Measurements in 2008 – 09 showed the lowest volume to be under 10 @,@ 000 vehicles per weekday near the southern terminus , north of Thomas Road . 
 As of 2013 , intersections in and around Kewdale , Forrestfield and Perth Airport carry traffic volumes beyond their capacity during peak periods . Average peak period traffic speeds in this part of Tonkin Highway were measured as 20 km / h ( 12 mph ) or less in 2013 . The slowest section was from Leach Highway to Horrie Miller Drive , which recorded an average of 14 km / h ( 9 mph ) during the afternoon peak period . Traffic volume , exceeding 50 @,@ 000 vehicles per day in 2012 , is forecast to almost double by 2031 . Traffic modelling has shown that leaving the current network of traffic light controlled intersections in place would result in gridlock by 2021 . An upgraded road network , after the Gateway WA project is completed , is expected to have an average speed in peak periods of between 55 and 75 km / h ( 35 and 45 mph ) in 2021 .

 Tonkin Highway begins at a traffic light controlled T junction with Reid Highway , at the southern edge of Malaga , eastern edge of Noranda , and western edge of Beechboro , within the City of Swan local government area ( LGA ) . Tonkin Highway is the southern leg of the T junction , while Reid Highway forms both the northern and eastern legs . The highway heads south forming the border between the residential suburbs of Beechboro and Noranda . The Lightning Park sporting reserve is located immediately west of Tonkin Highway , and can be accessed from a northbound exit ramp 400 metres ( 0 @.@ 25 mi ) south of the T junction . After 150 metres ( 490 ft ) , the highway enters the City of Bayswater LGA . East of the highway , the LGA boundary is also the boundary between the suburbs of Beechboro and Morley .

 = = History = = 
 A proposal for a highway along a similar alignment was first proposed in 1955 , as part of a network of arterial roads under a metropolitan @-@ wide plan produced for the Western Australian government by Gordon Stephenson and Alastair Hepburn . The road reservation was formally gazetted in the 1963 Metropolitan Region Scheme . It was first named " Beechboro @-@ Gosnells Highway " , the name coming from the two suburbs it was originally planned to link . Like most Perth arterial road projects , the highway was built in stages . It was initially constructed as a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) dual carriageway , from Welshpool Road , Wattle Grove to Hardey Road in Cloverdale , which opened on 16 June 1980 . A further 12 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 6 mi ) , that linked the new highway to Albany Highway in Gosnells , was completed in December 1980 . This $ 6 @.@ 1 million section , which officially opened on 22 December 1980 , was the start of a new route between Gosnells and Bellevue , and reduced traffic volume and congestion on Albany Highway . 
 The third segment to be constructed was a 3 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) section north of the Swan River , from Railway Parade in Bayswater to Morley Drive , which opened on 11 July 1984 . This # 3 @.@ 5 million section was constructed by <unk> Contractors Pty Ltd , with Taylor Woodrow International Ltd responsible for constructing the Broun Avenue bridge . Stage 4 linked Hardey Road and Great Eastern Highway , and included the construction of four bridges over the Forrestfield railway marshalling yards , the first bridges in Australia to be constructed using the incremental launch technique . Upon opening on 1 May 1985 , Beechboro @-@ Gosnells Highway was renamed " Tonkin Highway " , in honour of former Western Australian premier John Tonkin . Tonkin had also been the Minister for Works during the planning and construction of the Narrows Bridge and Kwinana Freeway in the 1950s . A ceremony was held at Redcliffe on 1 May by the Premier Mr Brian Burke , who unveiled a plaque . Mr Tonkin , who at the time was aged 83 , cut the ribbon at the ceremony to officially open the new Forrestfield to Redcliffe section of the highway . A grade @-@ separated interchange was constructed at Great Eastern Highway in 1986 , which included a six lane road bridge over Tonkin Highway and a pedestrian subway . It was constructed earlier than initially planned , as heavy traffic from Perth Airport was expected during the 1987 America 's Cup . 
 Construction on a link between the northern and southern sections of Tonkin Highway began in 1988 . Included in this $ 48 million stage was the Redcliffe Bridge over the Swan River , and an interchange with Guildford Road , north of the bridge . The 270 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 890 ft ) Redcliffe Bridge , also built using the incremental launching technique , was designed to carry six traffic lanes , as well as pedestrian and cycle paths that could be converted into traffic lanes when required . The bridge deck is supported by a narrow central section with cantilever extensions on each side , as a " big heavy bridge would have looked out of place " at a relatively narrow section of the river . The bridge opened on 16 April 1988 , and received awards for engineering excellence from both the national and state branches of the Institute of Engineers , Australia . 
 The highway was then extended northwards , reaching Benara Road on 18 December 1989 , and Reid Highway on 11 November 1991 . Tonkin Highway spent a decade remaining largely unchanged , linking Reid Highway in Malaga with Albany Highway in Gosnells . In 2003 , construction of a new southern extension commenced . Planning and Infrastructure Minister Alannah MacTiernan and the Member for <unk> , Martin <unk> , participated in a sod turning ceremony on 27 June 2003 , to mark the start of the project . At the time , the $ 140 million extension was the largest single road project in Western Australia . The project was completed in two stages , with Armadale Road as the midpoint . The first 11 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) section , including a new interchange at Albany Highway , was opened by Premier Geoff Gallop and Alannah MacTiernan on 2 April 2005 . The original connection to Albany Highway was renamed <unk> Drive . The Forrestdale Business Park and the Champion Lakes precinct were constructed concurrently with the project , to encourage industrial and residential development alongside the new highway section . The remaining seven kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) , from Armadale Road through to Thomas Road , opened a year ahead of schedule on 16 December 2005 . The new extension improved links with Kwinana , Armadale , Rockingham and Byford . It also provided a new freight route , diverting heavy vehicle traffic away from the existing road network and residential areas . 
 On 16 April 2012 , an intersection with Dunreath Drive was opened . This traffic light controlled at @-@ grade intersection allowed access to and from the international terminal of Perth Airport , bypassing Tonkin Highway 's intersections with Leach Highway and Kewdale Road / Horrie Miller Drive . The intersection was later removed on 16 July 2015 upon the commissioning of two nearby interchanges as part of Gateway WA . 
 = = Future works = = 
 A number of improvement works are planned for Tonkin Highway , which will see most of the central and northern sections upgraded to a freeway @-@ standard road with grade separated interchanges . Extensions are also planned at both ends of the highway , which would see the southern end extended to South Western Highway south of Byford , and link the northern end to the future Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura . 
 = = = Gateway WA = = = 
 The Gateway WA Perth Airport and Freight Access Project is a $ 1 billion project that will upgrade the road network around Perth Airport . It is the largest project Main Roads Western Australia has ever undertaken , covering the upgrade of Tonkin and Leach highways , and the construction of four new interchanges . The project is jointly funded by state and federal governments , which are providing $ 317 @.@ 5 million and $ 686 @.@ 4 million respectively . 
 As part of the project , Tonkin Highway will be expanded from two to three lanes in both directions , between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway , and the existing intersections in this section will be grade separated . A new diamond interchange will be constructed at <unk> Avenue ( <unk> renamed the Dunreath Drive Interchange ) , to provide access to the domestic terminal precinct . International terminal access will be provided via a new freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway , and a single @-@ point urban interchange to be constructed at Tonkin Highway 's intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road . The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway will only be upgraded to a partial freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange , but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free @-@ flowing interchange in the future . 
 In January 2013 , works was undertaken to protect or relocate sections of the Canning Trunk water main and the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline in the vicinity of the project . Construction on the Gateway WA project officially began on 1 February 2013 with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the state and federal transport ministers , Troy Buswell and Anthony Albanese . The first section being constructed is an entrance ramp from Abernethy Road to Tonkin Highway southbound . Work on the Leach Highway interchange is expected to commence at the end of 2013 , with construction of the other interchanges scheduled to start at the end of 2014 . The whole project was due to be completed by 2017 . However it was moved to March 2016 , due to construction moving faster than expected . 
 = = = Southern extension = = = 
 Tonkin Highway reaches past the edge of suburbia at its southern extent . Planning provides for it to be extended when required . The initial plans indicated the extension would continue south through undeveloped or semi @-@ rural areas such as Mundijong , <unk> & Jarrahdale . South of Mundijong , the planned route would deviate east to terminate at South Western Highway near Jarrahdale Road , which would then be upgraded . Following the 2001 state election , the new government abandoned the Jarrahdale Road option , preferring a shorter route that deviated to South Western Highway near Orton Street , closer to Byford . In July 2012 , seven years after the previous extension was completed , the Minister for Transport announced the formation of a community working group to investigate an extension of Tonkin Highway beyond Thomas Road . The group met several times to identify and evaluate possible solutions to traffic congestion in the area , and prepare a strategic business case for the next extension . As of 19 February 2013 , the preferred options are to extend the highway to South Western Highway , at a location either south of Lakes Road or south of Mundijong Road .

 NorthLink WA is a project that will see both the northern section of Tonkin Highway upgraded , and the road extended northwards to bypass Great Northern Highway within Perth . These two component projects are separately funded , with both the state and federal governments contributing to each project . Construction is expected to begin in 2016 , and be completed by 2019 .

 Planning is in place for a future extension north . Such an extension would bring the highway to Hepburn Avenue , near the north @-@ eastern corner of Ballajura . These plans see the extension linking to the proposed new Perth Darwin National Highway ( <unk> ) Swan Valley Bypass , which would continue north towards Ellenbrook . The previously planned route of the <unk> , prior to 2012 , followed Lord Street , east of Whiteman Park . While still in the planning stages , the state and federal governments have allocated funding to the project , with construction scheduled to start in 2016 .

 The federal government has allocated $ 140 @.@ 6 million to grade @-@ separate Tonkin Highway 's intersections with Benara Road , Morley Drive and Collier Road . The funding is part of the next five @-@ year phase of the Nation Building Program , from 2014 – 15 to 2018 – 19 . The upgrades are intended to improve freight transportation along the highway . The total cost is expected to be $ 281 @.@ 2 million . In the lead up to the 2013 Australian federal election , which resulted in a change a government , Labor candidate for Perth , Alannah MacTiernan , accused the then @-@ opposition 's candidate of lying to the electorate over their commitment to the upgrade . The official policy costings did not contain specific funding for the project .

 = Tôn Thất Đính = 
 Lieutenant General Tôn Thất Đính ( 20 November 1926 – 21 November 2013 ) was a retired officer who served in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) . He is best known as one of the key figures in the November 1963 coup that deposed and resulted in the assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm , the first president of the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) . 
 A favourite of the ruling Ngô family , Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as being more capable . He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm , and headed the military wing of the Cần Lao party , a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs ' grip on power . At the age of 32 , Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and the commander of the II Corps , but he was regarded as a dangerous , egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying . 
 In 1962 , Đính was appointed commander of the III Corps , which oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon . He was given the post because Diệm regarded him as one of his most loyal officers . This position meant that Đính would be a critical factor in the success or failure of any coup . In late 1963 , with Diệm becoming increasingly unpopular , Đính 's colleagues recruited him into a coup by playing on his ego . They convinced him to ask Diệm for a cabinet post , knowing that the president was adamantly opposed to military officers serving as ministers and would chastise him . Diệm promptly rebuffed Đính , who became upset and was lured into the plot . Diệm and his brother and chief advisor Ngô Đình Nhu were aware of a coup plot , but did not know of Đính 's involvement . Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and generate positive publicity for his family 's regime . He put Đính in charge of the fake coup , and the general promptly redeployed loyal units outside Saigon and rebel forces near the capital . On 1 November 1963 , the rebels ' actual coup proceeded , and the Ngô brothers were deposed and executed . 
 After the coup , Đính became one of the 12 members of the Military Revolutionary Council ( MRC ) , serving as the interior minister . However , the MRC lasted only three months before being ousted in a bloodless coup by General Nguyễn Khánh . Đính and his colleagues were put under house arrest by Khánh and falsely accused of promoting a neutralist plot . The subsequent military trial collapsed . The generals were convicted of " lax morality " , but were eventually allowed to resume their military service , albeit in meaningless desk jobs . Following Khánh 's exile by another group of generals , Đính was appointed to command the I Corps in 1966 in order to put down the Buddhist Uprising , but Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ disapproved of his reconciliatory policies . Kỳ launched a successful surprise attack against Đính , who fled , but was later captured and briefly imprisoned by Kỳ . After his release , Đính worked in the media and was elected to the Senate in 1967 . He served in the upper house until the fall of Saigon in April 1975 , when he fled Vietnam . 
 = = Early years = = 
 A native of central Vietnam , Đính enlisted in the Vietnamese National Army ( VNA ) of the French @-@ backed State of Vietnam at Phu Bai in 1949 and trained as a paratrooper in France . He became a protege of Ngô Đình Cần , a younger brother of Prime Minister Diệm . Cần , who unofficially controlled the region of central Vietnam near Huế , was impressed by what he considered to be an abundance of courage on the part of Đính . Within six years of enlisting in the military , Đính had risen to the rank of colonel and was made the inaugural commander of the newly formed 32nd Division based in Da Nang in the centre of the country on 1 January 1955 . Đính led the unit until November 1956 , during which time it was renamed the 2nd Division . 
 Diệm deposed head of state Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam ( commonly known as South Vietnam ) . The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) . Born into a nominally Buddhist family , Đính had converted to Catholicism in the hope of advancing his career . The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers . A devout member of the Catholic minority , Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority . 
 Đính once described himself as " fearless and arrogant " and Diệm 's adopted son — the president was a lifelong bachelor . In August 1957 , he was appointed commander of the 1st Division based in Huế , the old imperial capital and Cần 's base . Đính served there for one year , until he became a one @-@ star general and received a wider @-@ reaching command in August 1958 , making him the youngest ever ARVN general . Đính 's favour among the Ngô family saw him appointed in 1958 to head the military wing of the Cần Lao , the secret organisation of Vietnamese Catholics loyal to the Ngô family that maintained the family 's grip on power . 
 Despite the high regard in which the Ngô family held him , Đính had a poor reputation among his colleagues . Regarded by his peers as ambitious , vain and impulsive , he was known mainly for heavily drinking in Saigon 's nightclubs , and the Central Intelligence Agency labelled him a " basic opportunist " . He was known for always wearing a paratrooper 's uniform with a red beret at a steep angle , and being accompanied by a tall , uncommunicative Cambodian bodyguard . Senior Australian Army officer Ted Serong , who worked with Đính , called him " a young punk with a gun — and dangerous " . 
 = = Xá Lợi Pagoda = = 
 In August 1958 , Đính was made the commander of the II Corps , which oversaw the Central Highlands region mainly inhabited by indigenous tribes . He was based in the mountainous town of Pleiku and oversaw the surrounding region and the lowlands to the north of the capital of Saigon . This put him in control of the 5th , 22nd and 23rd Divisions , one third of the divisions in the country . At the time , the CIA had been training Montagnard tribesmen under the Village Defense Program ( later to become the Civilian Irregular Defense Group ) with the stated intention of resisting communist infiltration , but Đính regarded it was an attempt to divide and conquer and undermine him . He estimated that 18 @,@ 000 tribesmen had been armed , and said to Ngô Đình Nhu — one of Diệm 's younger brothers and his chief adviser — that " the Americans have put an army at my back " . CIA agent Lucien Conein admitted years afterwards that Đính 's claim was correct ; that Nhu and Diệm had no previous idea of what the Americans had been doing . Đính wrote to Diệm to complain that his units were being weakened by the policy of promoting officers for political reasons , despite having been a beneficiary himself of this non @-@ merit @-@ based policy . 
 The reorganisation of the corps boundaries in December 1962 created a fourth region . The entire region surrounding the capital , Saigon , came under the purview of the III Corps , whereas the previous arrangement saw two corps controlling the regions to the north and south of the capital . As a key supporter of Diệm , Đính was named commander of the III Corps , because the Ngô family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts . Under the III Corps were the 5th and the 25th Divisions . 
 In August 1963 , Nhu , who controlled the special forces and secret police , allowed Đính to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the Xá Lợi pagoda , Saigon 's largest . The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division , based in the town of Biên Hòa on Saigon 's northern outskirts , into the capital . Although the execution of the raids — which left hundreds dead — was primarily the responsibility of Colonel Lê Quang Tung , the special forces head , Đính privately took responsibility , stating to a journalist , " I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [ the US ambassador to South Vietnam ] . He came here to stage a coup d 'etat , but I , Tôn Thất Đính , have conquered him and saved the country . " In the aftermath of the raids , Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest , shaved his head like a monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India ; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him . At the urging of another general , Đính put Mẫu under house arrest instead . 
 During this period , Đính told a dinner guest that he had the pleasure of dining with a great national hero . When the guest asked Đính where the hero was , Đính said " it is me " and claimed to have defeated the Americans . Đính 's ego had been played upon by the Ngô brothers , who had themselves reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids . In the heady times after the attacks , Đính had a " somewhat incoherent " debate with his American advisor , claiming " he [ Đình ] was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN , the saviour of Saigon ... and soon he would be the top military man in the country . " In a press conference after the raids , Đính claimed to have saved South Vietnam from Buddhists , communists and " foreign adventurers " , a euphemism for the United States . 
 After being questioned sharply , Đính quickly became angry . Ray Herndon of United Press International asked him to name the country that he was referring to , but Đính dodged the question . Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero should be able to identify the national enemy , and asked him to call Madame Nhu , the de facto First Lady known for her anti @-@ American comments , to get help in identifying the hostile country in question . After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments , Đính stormed out of the conference . 
 = = Defection and coup = = 
 Embarrassed by the events at the press conference , Đính returned to the officers ' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters . His colleagues , led by General Trần Văn Đôn , were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis , and attempted to play on Đính 's ego to convince him to join them . They knew that without Đính 's assistance , a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital . In a series of meetings , the other generals assured Đính that he was a national hero worthy of political authority , and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country . Đính 's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power . The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm 's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics , and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN . They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister , Dương Văn Minh to defence minister , and Trần Văn Minh to education minister . The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride . As a result , Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace , where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister . Diệm bluntly chastised Đính in front of his colleagues , and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest . Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed , having promised his colleagues that he would be successful . The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính 's request , and put him under surveillance . Đính found out , further straining his relationship with the palace . Đính agreed to join the coup , although with his ambitious nature , the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides . 
 With Đính and the Ngô family 's increasing focus on the political usage of the army , the military situation in the III Corps deteriorated badly in the second half of 1963 , as personnel were redeployed into the cities . In August , he moved a unit away from Bến <unk> , which had been portrayed as a model settlement in the Strategic Hamlet Program that was supposed to isolate peasants into fortified villages to keep the Viet Cong out . While the unit was in Saigon cracking down on the Buddhists , the communists overran Bến <unk> . A year earlier , the American media contingent had been invited to the opening ceremony of the settlement , which was supposed to be the flagship of the hamlet program . As Đính spent most of October in the capital plotting instead of inspecting the countryside , the communists began to systematically dismantle the strategic hamlets . 
 = = = Plotting a fake coup = = = 
 By mid @-@ October , Diệm and Nhu knew of the coup plans , but did not know that Đính was firmly among them , although they were wary of him . Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter @-@ plot . The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him . The other generals were still suspicious of Đính , fearing he would betray them . Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them , and not sure which side he was really on , they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers . 
 As part of the generals ' plot , Đính sent Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có , his deputy corps commander , to Mỹ Tho to talk to the 7th Division commander , Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm , and two regimental commanders , the armoured unit commander , both subordinate to Đạm , and the chief of Mỹ Tho province . <unk> them to join the coup , he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao , and that Đính would soon join . According to one account , Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có 's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace . 
 Nhu 's agents soon reported Có 's activities to the palace . When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho , Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy 's behaviour . He began crying and said " This is my fault , because you have suspected me . I have not really gone to work for the last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad . But I am not against you . I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you . So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble . " Đính claimed to know nothing of Có 's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed . Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters , and tried to use Đính to this end . Nhu ordered Đính and Tung , both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command , to plan a fake coup against the government . One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated . Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime . 
 Codenamed Operation Bravo , the first stage of the scheme would involve some of Đính and Tung 's loyalist soldiers , disguised as insurgents led by apparently renegade junior officers , faking a coup and vandalising the capital . Tung would then announce the formation of a " revolutionary government " consisting of opposition activists who had not consented to joining the new administration , while Diệm and Nhu would pretend to be on the run . During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup , the disguised loyalists would riot and in the ensuing mayhem , kill the leading coup plotters , such as Generals Minh , Đôn , Lê Văn Kim and junior officers that were helping them . The loyalists and some of Nhu 's underworld connections would also kill some figures who were assisting the conspirators , such as the titular but relatively powerless Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ , CIA agent Lucien Conein , who was on assignment in Vietnam as a military adviser , and Ambassador Lodge . These would then be blamed on " neutralist and pro @-@ communist elements " . A fake " counter @-@ coup " was to follow , whereupon Tung 's special forces , having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists , as well as Đính 's regulars , would triumphantly re @-@ enter Saigon to reaffirm the Diệm regime . Nhu would then exploit the scare to round up dissidents . 
 Đính was put in charge of the fake coup and was allowed the additional control of the 7th Division based in Mỹ Tho , which was previously assigned to Diệm loyalist Cao , who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta . The reassignment of the 7th Division gave Đính and his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon , and would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Diệm as he had done during the coup attempt in 1960 . 
 Nhu and Tung , however , were unaware that Đính was part of the real coup plot . Đính told Tung that the fake coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force . He said that tanks were required " because armour is dangerous " . In an attempt to outwit Tung , Đính claimed fresh troops were needed , opining , " If we move reserves into the city , the Americans will be angry . They 'll complain that we 're not fighting the war . So we must camouflage our plan by sending the special forces out to the country . That will deceive them . " The loyalists were unaware that Đính 's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung 's men in the countryside where they could not defend the president . Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon @-@ based special forces companies out of the capital on 29 October . 
 Not trusting Có , Diệm put a Catholic loyalist , Colonel Phát , in command of the 7th Division on 31 October . According to tradition , Phát had to pay the corps commander a courtesy visit before assuming control . Đính refused to see Phát and told him to come back on Friday at 14 : 00 , by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start . In the meantime , Đính had Đôn sign a counter @-@ order transferring command of the 7th Division to Có . The next day , Có took the division 's incumbent officers prisoner and used the unit to block loyalists from storming the capital from the south . 
 = = = Diệm 's downfall = = = 
 On 1 November 1963 , the coup went ahead , with Cao 's troops isolated in the far south , and Tung 's forces outside Saigon , unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement . Tung was called to the Joint General Staff ( JGS ) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting , and was seized and executed . Attempts by Diệm and Nhu to make contact with Đính were blocked by other generals , who claimed that Đính was elsewhere . This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured , still unaware that he had rebelled . The following morning , Đính was allowed to have the final word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested , allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause . Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers . 
 Đính alleged that Nhu 's contacts with the communists and threats to make a peace deal with North Vietnam had motivated the coup . When Diệm and Nhu were shot dead by the arresting officers against the orders of the generals , Đính claimed he " couldn 't sleep that night " . He boasted to the media that he and his troops were responsible for seizing broadcasting studios , the police headquarters , Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base , and the release of hundreds of political prisoners such as monks and students . He also claimed that he led the successful siege on Gia Long Palace , although the 5th Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu had actually carried it out . 
 Đính saved the life of Colonel Cao Văn Viên , the commander of the Airborne Brigade , who was a Diệm loyalist . Viên 's fate had been discussed during the planning phase . Đính , who played mahjong with Viên 's wife , convinced Minh to spare the paratroop commander , saying that Viên would not oppose the coup . At the JGS meeting , Viên , who had not known of the plot , removed his insignia and resigned , and was arrested for refusing to join the coup . Viên was allowed to return to his command a month later , and later became the chief of JGS for eight years . 
 = = Post @-@ Diệm = = 
 Following the coup , a Military Revolutionary Council ( MRC ) was formed , comprising 12 generals including Đính , each of whom had equal voting power . They appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of civilians led by Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ , who had been the titular Vice President under Diệm . Đính was initially made interior minister , but Thơ was said to have personally opposed the appointment . Eventually Minh , the head of the military junta , struck a compromise whereby Đính was made Security Minister and Administrative Affairs , which partially covered the interior ministry . He was the 2nd Deputy Chairman of the MRC behind Minh and Đôn . However , tension persisted as Thơ 's civilian government was plagued by infighting . According to Thơ 's assistant , Nguyễn Ngọc Huy , the presence of Đôn and Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process . Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the civilian government , but as members of the MRC they were superior to him . When Thơ gave a cabinet order with which the generals disagreed , they went to the MRC and gave a counter @-@ order . Đính and the new national police chief , General Xuân , were accused of arresting people en masse , before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty . The junta performed indecisively and was heavily criticised , especially Minh , who was viewed as being too apathetic towards his country 's situation . During the MRC 's tenure , South Vietnam suffered more and more losses to the Vietcong . 
 = = = Policies = = = 
 Đính was reported to have celebrated his new positions by making conspicuous appearances at Saigon nightclubs and dancing , having lifted Madame Nhu 's bans on such activities . He reportedly kissed the bar dancers and ordered champagne for all present . Đính 's brash behavior caused public relations problems for the junta . In interviews with the Washington Post and The New York Times , he claimed that he took a leading role in the coup because " we would have lost the war under Diệm " and saying that he participated " not for personal ambition , but for the population , the people and to get rid of Nhu " . He claimed to have been the " specialist ... [ who ] gave the orders in only thirty minutes " , keeping the plans " all in his head " . In an exclusive interview with Herndon , he said " You are the one who started it all , who drove me into making the coup . You are the hero of the revolution . " This was a reference to Herndon 's sarcastic reference to Đính as a " great national hero " after the general took credit for the pagoda raids . He also courted controversy with anti @-@ American remarks , stating " On August 21 , I was governor of Saigon and loyal to Diem ; on November 1 , I was governor of Saigon and fighting Diem ; maybe in the future I 'll be governor of Saigon and fighting against the Americans . " 
 Đính and the leading generals in the MRC also had a secret plan to end the communist insurgency , which called itself the National Liberation Front ( NLF ) and claimed to be independent of the government of North Vietnam . They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm . The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible . The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground , which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner . However , the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed . 
 During his time on the MRC , Đính persistently raised eyebrows with his volatile behaviour . The Americans and his colleagues found him difficult to control . General Paul Harkins , the head of the US military presence in Vietnam , advised Đính to relinquish his control of the III Corps on the grounds that he was already serving as the interior minister and that a corps needed a full @-@ time leader , but Đính refused . As the III Corps surrounded the capital , the most economically productive region in South Vietnam , it had the most scope for corruption and graft . Đính told U.S. embassy officials in December 1963 he was preparing to " accommodate himself to a neutralist solution for Vietnam " . This reportedly perturbed the Americans and was interpreted as a threat to not cooperate with the anti @-@ communist struggle if his power was wound back . US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara criticised the arrangement , and in early January 1964 , Đính was relieved by General <unk> , who had been the head of the armed forces until being demoted after the coup against Diệm , and he set about overthrowing the MRC . 
 = = Deposed by Nguyễn Khánh = = 
 Đính 's political stay was brief , as General Nguyễn Khánh , who was disgruntled at not receiving a high position after Diệm 's removal , deposed the MRC with the support of <unk> on 30 January 1964 , without firing a shot . Khánh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals Đôn , Đính , Xuan and Lê Văn Kim . Khánh had them arrested , claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a peace deal with North Vietnam that would not end communism . Khánh noted they had all served in the French @-@ backed VNA prior to 1955 , although he had as well . He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle 's party during a dinner , although Đính and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting was anything more than social . The generals were flown to Mỹ Khe beach , near Đà Nẵng . 
 Khánh presided over their trial of Đính and his colleagues on 28 May 1964 . The generals were interrogated for five and a half hours , mostly about details of their coup against Diệm , rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism . As all of the officers were involved in Diệm 's overthrow , the hearings did not reveal any new information . The court deliberated for over nine hours , and when it reconvened for the verdict , Khánh stated , " We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army , you do not take revenge on anybody " . The tribunal then " congratulated " the generals , but found that they were of " lax morality " and unqualified to command due to a " lack of a clear political concept " . They were chastised for being " inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility " and of letting " their subordinates take advantage of their positions " . Đính 's quartet were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance . 
 The four generals were barred from commanding troops and offices were prepared so they could participate in " research and planning " . Worried that the idle group would plot against him , Khánh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the U.S. for military study , but this failed . When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965 , he handed over dossiers proving that Đính and the other generals were innocent and that his charges were dishonest , before going into exile . Historian Robert Shaplen said that " the case ... continued to be one of Khánh 's biggest embarrassments . " During the period of house arrest , Khánh briefly released Đính and Kim when the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races , known by its French acronym of FULRO , launched an uprising in the central highlands calling for autonomy for indigenous people . Đính and Kim were sent to Ban <unk> Thuột in an attempt to end the standoff in September 1964 , but after negotiations stalled , they conferred with Khánh and decided to order ARVN troops to crush the rebellion , which was carried out successfully . 
 = = 1966 Buddhist protests and senate career = = 
 With the rise to power of Nguyễn Cao Kỳ — head of the Vietnam Air Force — following Khánh 's departure , returned to a command role in the army . In April 1966 , he was appointed to lead the I Corps , based in central Vietnam . Đính was the third commander of the corps within five weeks . This upheaval came about after the dismissal of Lieutenant General Nguyễn Chánh Thi due to his sympathies towards Buddhist activists and because Kỳ viewed him as a personal threat . In response , Buddhist protesters brought the region to a standstill with anti @-@ American and anti @-@ war demonstrations , some of which descended into rioting . The protests were supported by groups of rebel I Corps soldiers and the mayor of Đà Nẵng , Nguyễn Văn Man , who had been appointed by Thi . These anti @-@ Kỳ groups formed a coalition known as the Struggle Movement . Thi 's replacement , General Nguyễn Văn Chuan , refused to confront the dissidents or shut them down . He was content to allow protests provided there was no insurrection . 
 Prime Minister Kỳ disapproved of Chuan 's approach and replaced Chuan with Đính . Prime Minister Kỳ felt Đính 's aggressive attitude following the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in 1963 indicated a willingness to suppress Buddhist dissidents . Moreover , Đính was a native of central Vietnam and would have been popular with those who thought along parochial lines . Đính arrived in Huế on 15 April and , after a week , announced that he had restored Saigon 's authority over the region . He proclaimed that he had regained control of the radio stations in Đà Nẵng and Huế from the dissidents , and that he had convinced the mayor of Đà Nẵng to remain loyal to Saigon . Đính announced a deal whereby the Buddhists would have regular air time in return for relinquishing control of the radio station . This move was interpreted in different ways . Some felt that Đính was attempting to gain favour with the Buddhists in anticipation of Kỳ 's fall from power , while Frances FitzGerald felt it was the only sensible government action during the crisis . On 19 April , clashes erupted in Quảng Ngãi between the Buddhists and the VNQDĐ ( Vietnamese Nationalist Party ) , which supported the continuation of the anti @-@ communist war , prompting Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups . 
 Soon after , Kỳ made a surprise attack to assert government control over central Vietnam . He flew out to Đà Nẵng with his own units , without consulting the Americans or officials in I Corps . At this time , Đính was pursuing a policy of reconciliation Đà Nẵng and negotiation with the dissident I Corps units , and making contact with the Struggle Movement . Kỳ decided to attack and sent his forces to overrun Dinh 's headquarters on 15 May , forcing the latter to abandon his post and flee to the headquarters of U.S. General Lewis Walt . Fearing Kỳ 's forces would kill him , Đính asked Walt for help and was flown to Huế , where the pro @-@ Thi and pro @-@ Buddhist elements were still in control . Đính was then formally replaced by General Cao . Walt 's assistance to Đính provoked a reaction from General William Westmoreland , the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam . Walt and Westmoreland were often in conflict , and the latter responded to his subordinate 's evacuation of Đính by imploring Kỳ to attack Huế . 
 Kỳ 's surprise attack led to conflict between the ARVN rebels and loyalists , with the American ground forces caught in the middle , effectively creating a civil war within a civil war . Kỳ eventually quelled the rebellion and briefly jailed Đính , who claimed he was incarcerated for refusing to back up Kỳ 's account of the conflict with the Buddhists . Đính left the army and won election to the newly created Senate in 1967 , serving there until the fall of Saigon in 1975 , when he fled to the United States . In February 1968 , while serving in the Senate , Đính founded a newspaper , Công <unk> while also serving as head of the Vietnamese Publishers Association . In 1998 , Đính claimed he felt remorse for the deposal and assassinations of the Ngô brothers , and also claimed he had opposed their policies of religious discrimination against Buddhists , which had fomented national disunity and the eventual Communist victory .

 B. Nagi Reddy of Vijaya Vauhini Studios helped B. Vittalacharya in the production of Mane Thumbida Hennu ( 1958 ) , the latter 's directorial debut in Kannada cinema . As an act of gratitude , Vittalacharya sold the remake rights to Nagi Reddy . Mane Thumbida Hennu revolves around the life of a rich woman whose brother marries off her daughter to a criminal when she chooses a mentally challenged person as her step @-@ daughter 's life partner . Nagi Reddy chose to remake the film in Telugu and discussed it with D. V. Narasa Raju ; it was the first time Vijaya Vauhini Studios decided to remake a film . After the script was ready , Nagi Reddy approached C. Pullaiah to direct the remake after considering Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy . Pullaiah was not appreciative of Narasa Raju 's treatment of the script and Nagi Reddy met his partner Aluri Chakrapani to develop the script further . 
 Chakrapani decided to retain only the background of Gundamma 's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script , taking inspiration from William Shakespeare 's comedy , The Taming of the Shrew . Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma 's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife 's questions is not eligible to be included . Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film . Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake after one of the characters in the original , despite a lack of nativity . Nagi Reddy 's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ( " What is the progress in Gundamma 's story ? " ) , which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options .

 The production phase of Gundamma Katha lasted nearly a year . A house set was erected in Vijaya Vauhini Studios , Madras ( now Chennai ) where scenes featuring Gundamma and other key characters were filmed . C. <unk> Naidu and K. Srinivasan supervised the erection of sets . The film 's shooting was severely affected by scheduling conflicts ; Chakrapani would make telephone calls to all the key artistes , and sequences were filmed based on their availability . The filming of the song " Kolo <unk> " was significantly affected by this ; all four lead actors were supposed to take part in the song 's shoot ; the film 's editor took care to ensure a smooth flow in the sequences during the post @-@ production phase . The scene before the song that features Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao communicating with whistles was conceptualised by Narasaraju . <unk> Singh supervised the film 's special effects . 
 Since Vijayalakshmi was a trained dancer , an elaborate dance sequence with no connection to the film 's story was introduced as a stage performance and Nageswara Rao , Jamuna , and Haranath were made to sit along with the audience . The song " Prema <unk> " was filmed in the gardens near the Vijaya Vauhini Studios after abandoning plans to film it in either Ooty or Brindavan Gardens , Srirangapatna . During the film 's shoot , a kickboxing tournament was held in Madras ; this inspired Chakrapani and <unk> Rao to add a fight sequence between Rama Rao and Kaleswara Rao . Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences . The film was processed at Vijaya Laboratory and was recorded on Western Electric equipment .

 Gundamma Katha is based partially on William Shakespeare 's play The Taming of the Shrew . It focuses on a widow named Gundamma and her two daughters . The film 's main theme is the step @-@ daughter Lakshmi facing problems because of the widow , and the former 's suitor teaching the latter a lesson . Using the first conversation between Gundamma and Lakshmi , in which the former abuses the latter for disturbing her sleep , Narasaraju introduces Gundamma 's mindset and behaviour . Further incidents include the dismissal of a server fired from a hotel after refusing to work as a servant in Gundamma 's house , and Ghantaiah explaining Gundamma 's character to Ramabhadraiah . 
 Most of the film 's dialogue , especially that between Ramana Reddy and Allu Ramalingaiah , are satirical and provide references to Indian society during the 1960s . The song " <unk> Nidra " is about the empowerment of women and their role in areas of the government . In her article " Manifestation of devotion " about the importance of the Krishna Janmashtami festival , Rajeswari Kalyanam of The Hans India said the lyrics and photography of the song " <unk> <unk> <unk> " recalls the romantic side of Krishna that every woman sees in her husband or the person she loves .

 Gundamma Katha was remade in Tamil as Manithan Maravillai ( 1962 ) by Vijaya Vauhini Studios . Chakrapani directed the remake and Gemini Ganesan reprised Rama Rao from the original . M. S. Sundari Bai , K. Sarangkapani , and E. R. <unk> reprised the roles of Suryakantam , Ramana Reddy and Kaleswara Rao respectively . Manithan Maravillai was Nageswara Rao 's 100th film as an actor ; Gundamma Katha became a notable film for both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao as they completed 100 films as actors with two versions of the same film . Unlike the original film , Manithan Maravillai was a commercial failure . 
 Rama Rao 's son Nandamuri Balakrishna and Nageswara Rao 's son Akkineni Nagarjuna , who established themselves as actors in Telugu cinema , planned to remake Gundamma Katha but withdrew after failing to find a suitable replacement for Suryakantam . In 2012 , D. Ramanaidu planned to produce the remake of the film with Rama Rao 's grandson N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Nagarjuna 's son Naga Chaitanya playing the leading male characters but the plans were cancelled . In April 2016 , Mohan Babu expressed interest in remaking the film with his son Manchu Vishnu and Raj Tarun in the lead roles . He added that G. Nageswara Reddy would direct the remake which he would announce after acquiring the rights .

 After Gundamma Katha 's release , Chakrapani wrote a story named " Gundamma Gari <unk> Katha " ( " The Story of Gundamma 's Daughters " ) . It was serialised in Bharathi magazine . Its plot involves Ghantaiah creating a rift between Lakshmi and Saroja . Readers expected Chakrapani to produce a sequel to Gundamma Katha but he showed no interest . In 1982 , Rama Rao and Krishna acted in a film , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose story resembled " Gundamma Gari <unk> Katha " . 
 In November 2007 , a Hyderabad @-@ based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios , including Mayabazar ( 1957 ) and Gundamma Katha , to release colourised , digitally remastered versions . The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar , released in January 2010 , was commercially successful but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 13 films , including Gundamma Katha , saying most of the producers who sold the rights to the negatives to television channels lost control over them . Goldstone further explained that a number of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues arise whenever producers try to do something on their own . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Gundamma Katha is regarded as the last film of Vijaya Vauhini Studios ' " Golden Age " . In commemoration of the Centenary of Indian Cinema , The Hindu listed Gundamma Katha , Pathala Bhairavi ( 1951 ) , Missamma ( 1955 ) , Mayabazar , Maduve Madi Nodu ( 1965 ) , Ram Aur Shyam ( 1967 ) , Julie ( 1975 ) , and Shriman Shrimati ( 1982 ) as the iconic films produced by Nagi Reddy . Gundamma Katha is a notable film in the careers of Suryakantam and Ramana Reddy ; Nagi Reddy said the latter played a key role in the film 's success . 
 In an interview with The Hindu in December 2005 , Telugu actor Mallikarjuna Rao cited the film and Mayabazar as examples of incidental comedy , arguing that the situation and the subject should go " hand in hand " . In May 2012 , Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned Gundamma Katha for the letter G in her list , " The A to Z of Telugu Cinema " , calling it an " unforgettable film " . In November 2012 , The Times of India listed Gundamma Katha alongside unrelated films Missamma , Mayabazar , Narthanasala , and Bommarillu ( 2006 ) in its list of " Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali " . The commentator for The Times stated that Gundamma Katha " touches many layers of human [ emotions ] and situations " and features " top class actors , a strong script , melodious and meaningful songs " . Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu ( 2013 ) , which was rumoured to be a remake of Gundamma Katha , adapted the style of its opening credits — use of images rather than text to credit its principal cast . In their 2013 book Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas , K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake wrote that Gundamma Katha , along with Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu ( 1959 ) , Missamma and Ramudu Bheemudu ( 1964 ) , " represented the scope comedy had in the 1950s and 60s . " 
 The story and treatment of Gundamma Katha inspired many other Telugu films , resulting in stereotypes in narration . The filmmaker Kadiri Venkata Reddy stated that Gundamma Katha had good dialogue and production design but lacked a proper story to narrate . In her review of screenwriter Trivikram Srinivas ' film Attarintiki Daredi ( 2013 ) , Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu expressed hope that Srinivas " will give us something more innovative than relying on a story that ’ s been rehashed since the time of Gundamma Katha " . In August 2015 , the filmmaker Teja admitted that the Telugu film industry is stuck with two types of narratives and concepts — hero @-@ centric films and those similar to Gundamma Katha . During the promotion of <unk> ( 2015 ) , its director A. S. Ravikumar Chowdary said comedy is a dominant element in Telugu films , citing Gundamma Katha and Aha Naa Pellanta ( 1987 ) as examples .

 Meet the Parents is a 2000 American comedy film written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg and directed by Jay Roach . Starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller , the film chronicles a series of unfortunate events that befall a good @-@ hearted but hapless man while visiting his girlfriend 's parents . Teri Polo , Blythe Danner , and Owen Wilson also star . 
 Meet the Parents is a remake of a 1992 film of the same name directed by Greg Glienna and produced by Jim Vincent . Glienna — who also played the original film 's main protagonist — and Mary Ruth Clarke co @-@ wrote the screenplay . Universal Studios purchased the rights to Glienna 's film with the intent of creating a new version . Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time . Jay Roach read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct the film but Universal declined him . At that time , Steven Spielberg was interested in directing the film while Jim Carrey was interested in playing the lead role . The studio only offered the film to Roach once Spielberg and Carrey left the project . 
 Released in the United States and Canada on October 6 , 2000 and distributed by Universal Studios , the film earned back its initial budget of $ 55 million in only eleven days . It went on to become one of the highest grossing films of 2000 , earning over $ 160 million in North America and over $ 330 million worldwide . Meet the Parents was well received by film critics and viewers alike , winning several awards and earning additional nominations . Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People 's Choice Awards . The success of Meet the Parents inspired two film sequels , namely Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers released in 2004 and 2010 respectively . Meet the Parents also inspired a reality television show titled Meet My Folks and a situation comedy titled In @-@ Laws , both of them debuting on NBC in 2002 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Gaylord " Greg " Focker ( Ben Stiller ) is a nurse living in Chicago , who intends to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes ( Teri Polo ) , a schoolteacher . His plan is disrupted when Pam 's sister Debbie becomes engaged and he finds out that Debbie 's fiance , Dr. Robert " Bob " Banks had asked Pam 's father for permission before proposing . Greg and Pam travel to Pam 's parents ' house in Oyster Bay , Long Island to attend the wedding . Greg hopes to propose to Pam in front of her family after receiving her father 's permission , but this plan is put on hold when the airline loses his luggage , including the engagement ring . 
 When they arrive at the Byrnes ' home , Greg meets Pam 's father Jack ( Robert De Niro ) , her mother Dina ( Blythe Danner ) and their beloved cat Mr. Jinx . Jack immediately takes a dislike to Greg and openly criticizes him for his chosen career of nursing and anything else he sees as a sign of weakness . Greg 's attempts to impress Jack either go unnoticed or fail : He inadvertently leads Jack to think he does drugs , while mentioning the possible subtle drug references in Puff , the Magic Dragon , recites the lyrics from the song " Day by Day " from the musical " Godspell " as a blessing , and makes up a story about milking a cat . Greg then presents the Byrnes family with a bottle of champagne which he had purchased at a local convenience store . However , upon finding out Pam was previously engaged , the cork pops off and knocks over an urn containing the ashes of Jack 's beloved mother and Pam 's grandmother , and Jinx subsequently urinates in them . Greg becomes further uncomfortable after receiving an impromptu lie detector test from Jack and later discovers that Jack is actually a retired CIA counterintelligence officer . 
 Meeting the rest of Pam 's family and friends , including Debbie , her fiance , his parents , and Pam 's highly successful , both financially and spiritually , ex @-@ fiancee Kevin ( Owen Wilson ) , Greg still feels like an outsider . Things between Greg and Jack go from bad to worse during a game of water volleyball , where Jack becomes irritated with Greg 's incompetent playing , and in an attempt to play more seriously , Greg accidentally hits Debbie while spiking the ball , giving her a bloody nose and black eye . After that , because Greg had earlier used a malfunctioning toilet ( and telling Jack that Jinx had flushed the toilet , which Jack didn 't buy ) , the Byrnes 's yard floods with sewage . The airline arrives with the luggage that Greg lost , but it turns out to not be his , and while Greg is on the phone , attempting to solve this issue , he accidentally causes Jinx to get loose . While chasing Jinx , Greg accidentally starts a fire in the yard , destroying a wedding altar that Kevin had <unk> for Debbie 's wedding . 
 Jack himself conducts a background check on Greg 's MCAT scores and finds nothing on anyone named Greg Focker ever taking the MCAT 's . Then he inspects Greg 's found luggage ( which is actually someone else 's ) containing sexual toys and gimmicks . Jack , at this point is willing to bet Greg is not even a real nurse , but a drug dealer posing as a hospital worker for easy access , per their previous discussion about " Puff the Magic Dragon " , Later , the Byrnes family realizes Jinx is missing and Greg , in a last @-@ ditch effort to win Jack over , finds a stray cat who looks exactly like Jinx , except for a white tip on the tail , and he spray paints its tail to match Jinx 's tail . While the entire family is out to dinner , Jack gets a voicemail that Jinx is at their neighbor 's house . As they 're heading home , Greg realizes that Jack knows about Jinx , and desperately tries to beat Jack home to hide the evidence , but ultimately fails . The family returns home to find the stray cat has completely trashed the house . Jack calls Greg out in front of the entire family for his lack of honesty , and demands that he call off his relationship with Pam and leave immediately . 
 By now , the entire Byrnes family , including Pam , agree with Jack that Greg needs to leave . Desperate to save himself , Greg reveals that he has seen Jack talking to strange characters , and is planning a secret mission after Pam 's sister 's wedding , thus lying about being retired from the CIA . Jack angrily explains that the secret mission was a surprise honeymoon for the newlywed couple , and Greg realizes that he only dug himself deeper into a hole . Pam and Greg break up , and Greg starts to leave . Just as Greg 's leaving an airport employee arrives with Greg 's actual missing bag , under the name ' Gaylord Focker ' much to the amusement of the Byrnes . Greg goes to the airport but finds himself detained by airport security after causing a scene on the plane and using the word bomb . 
 Back at the Byrnes ' household , Jack still believes that Greg would be an unsuitable husband , as he is completely dishonest and incompetent . Upon receiving retribution from his wife , who claims that Jack never warmed up to Kevin until after he and Pam broke up , and Pam ( as well as confirmation that Greg actually aced the MCAT 's ) , Jack realizes that Pam truly loves Greg . Jack rushes to the airport , convinces airport security to release Greg , and demands that he be honest about everything that transpired . Greg admits that he loves Pam , and everything he did before was out of desperation to win Jack 's approval . Jack admits that maybe he had been too hard on Greg , and he brings him back to the Byrnes ' household . 
 Greg proposes to Pam . She accepts , and her parents agree that they should now meet Greg 's parents . After Debbie 's wedding , Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed strategically around their house .

 Greg Focker is a middle @-@ class Jewish nurse whose social and cultural position is juxtaposed against the Byrnes family of upper @-@ class White Anglo @-@ Saxon Protestants . With respect to Greg as a Jew and a nurse when compared to the Byrnes and Banks families , a distinct cultural gap is created and subsequently widened . The cultural differences are often highlighted and Greg is repeatedly made aware of them . This serves to achieve comedic effect through character development and has also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters ' roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media . Speaking about character development in Meet the Parents , director Jay Roach stated that he wanted an opportunity to " do character @-@ driven comedy " and " to create realistic characters , but heighten the comedic situations and predicaments . " 
 Vincent Brook observes mainstream Hollywood cinema 's tendency since the 1990s of incorporating Jewish liminality and " popularizing the Jew . " He explains the " manly Jewish triumph " of characters like Jeff Goldblum 's David Levinson in Independence Day and labels it as a " certain answer to America 's yearnings for a new Jewish hero . " This stands in direct contrast to the schlemiel or " the Jewish fool " which was seen to have been revitalized in the mid @-@ 1990s after faltering since the 1960s . The schlemiel , Brook explains , is an anti @-@ hero in whose humiliation the audience finds supreme pleasure . Within that context , Brook describes Greg Focker 's character as " the quintessential example of the postmodern schlemiel . " The repeated embarrassing encounters that Greg faces with his girlfriend 's all @-@ American family is compared to the example of Jason Biggs 's character Jim Levenstein of the American Pie film series where Levenstein is often the comedic centerpiece due to his repeated sexual embarrassments . 
 Anne Bower writes about Jewish characters at mealtime as part of the broader movement she believes started in the 1960s where filmmakers started producing work that explored the " Jewish self @-@ definition . " She postulates that the dinner table becomes an arena where Jewish characters are often and most pointedly put into " conflicts with their ethnic and sexual selves . " She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food . In this scene , Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and , in doing so , launches into a recital of the song " Day by Day " from Act I of Godspell . Bower notes this scene as " particularly important for establishing the cultural distance " between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes . She also noted that the social gap is further widened next morning at breakfast when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table ; he shows up to breakfast wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed . Here Greg is shown as the only person eating a bagel , which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness . 
 Based on common misconceptions and stereotypes about men in nursing , Greg 's profession is repeatedly brought up by Jack Byrnes in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker has come to be one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse . Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times , there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media . A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice , either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one . Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non @-@ masculine attributes . Jack Byrnes is often seen openly criticizing Greg 's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession . In their book Men in Nursing : History , Challenges , and Opportunities authors Chad O <unk> and Russell <unk> present this as an example of a negative portrayal . Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing , Barbara Cherry in her book Contemporary Nursing : Issues , Trends , & Management called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse " one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses " and commented that Greg " humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession . " Sandy and Harry Summers in the book Saving Lives : Why the Media 's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk postulate that Greg 's character , although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession , " might have done more to rebut the stereotypes " while also reporting that " some men in nursing " expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all .

 Meet the Parents is a remake of a 1992 independent film of the same name . Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke wrote the original story and screenplay . Glienna also directed and starred in the 76 minute film which was filmed on 16 mm film in 1991 and released the following year . The 1992 film also marked one of only several film roles played by comedian Emo Philips which he also helped produce . Film producer Elliot Grove , founder of Raindance Film Festival and the British Independent Film Awards , listed the original Meet the Parents on his personal Top Ten list of favorite films where he called it " much funnier and tighter than the Hollywood version " . The 1992 film was a featured entry in the 1995 Raindance Film Festival . 
 Producer Nancy Tenenbaum acquired the rights to the short film . After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest , filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake . He brought it to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned the rights to the film in 1995 . Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight .

 Universal approached screenwriter Jim Herzfeld to expand the screenplay . Herzfeld expanded the modest script , completing the first draft as early as 1996 . He initially presented it to Roach who had , up to that point , directed the first two Austin Powers films . Roach admits to have liked the script from the beginning and was very much willing to make the film even though he thought " it needed more work . " Universal initially declined to have relatively inexperienced Roach take on the project . The studio was skeptical of Roach 's ability to direct a " less @-@ cartoony , character @-@ driven script " compared to a comedy like Austin Powers . Universal 's reluctance to give the project to Roach was also due to new interest from Steven Spielberg who wanted to direct and produce the film with Jim Carrey playing the role of Greg Focker . However , Spielberg and Carrey never took the project past the planning stages . The script was then returned to Roach who had by now taken on his next project of Mystery , Alaska but was still interested in making Meet the Parents . 
 The drafts of the script were written by Herzfeld and , once De Niro and Stiller were confirmed as stars , John Hamburg was brought on board " to help fit the script to their verbal styles . " Due to changes in directorial and acting line @-@ ups after the early drafts of the script were written , Hamburg kept adjusting and re @-@ writing the script well after production had already begun . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Upon the suggestion of Universal Studios , Roach cast De Niro in the role of Jack Byrnes due to critical acclaim of De Niro 's recent comedy work in films such as Analyze This and in the live @-@ action / animated film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle . De Niro 's character Jack Byrnes is Pam 's father and a retired CIA operative who is overly protective of his family and has a hard time warming up to his daughters ' love interests . The script was not written with De Niro in mind as Jack Byrnes ; the first draft of the script was completed in 1996 , three years before De Niro appeared in Analyze This . However , shortly after De Niro finished filming The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle , Universal suggested to Roach that he should cast De Niro for the role to which Roach agrees that he had " no reservations whatsoever . " In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , De Niro stated that he was in active pursuit of comedic roles since Analyze This . Admitting that he had initial reservations about starring in Meet the Parents , De Niro said that he felt " pushed into it " due to insistence by Jane Rosenthal — De Niro 's partner in TriBeCa Productions who also acted as one of the producers of Meet the Parents . Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld and director Jay Roach both confirmed that , after committing to the project and reviewing the script , Robert De Niro was actually the person who came up with the idea for the famous polygraph test scene . Asked about working with De Niro given the serious nature of his previous roles , Ben Stiller said that " it was a little bit intimidating working with De Niro " but that he " has a great sense of humor and I think that 's the biggest surprise about him . " 
 Explaining how Ben Stiller came to be cast in the role of Greg , Roach states : " I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream , and in my view nobody plays that kind of material better than Ben . " Additionally , Roach was impressed with Stiller 's creative and ad lib abilities stating that " he has lots of great ideas and he 's very skilled at loose improvisation . " Stiller 's character Gaylord " Greg " Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover @-@ up schemes . The film 's script was initially written with Jim Carrey in the role of Greg and contained much more physical comedy , something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role . This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller . Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role . 
 The consideration to play the character of Pam Byrnes — Greg 's girlfriend who acts as a mediator between Greg and the Byrnes family , especially her father Jack — was initially given to Australian actress Naomi Watts . She ultimately lost the role to Teri Polo because the filmmakers " didn 't think [ Watts ] was sexy enough " . 
 Other characters in the film were played by Blythe Danner ( as Dina Byrnes , Jack 's wife and Pam 's mother ) , Owen Wilson ( as Kevin <unk> , Pam 's ex @-@ fiancee ) , Nicole <unk> ( as Debbie Byrnes , Pam 's sister ) , Jon Abrahams ( as Denny Byrnes , the youngest child of Jack and Dina Byrnes ) , Thomas McCarthy ( as Bob Banks , Debbie 's fiancé ) , and James Rebhorn ( as Larry Banks , Bob Banks ' father and a close friend of Jack 's ) . Phyllis George , who is a former Miss Texas and Miss America pageant winner and has appeared on numerous television programs as a guest and a host , made her acting debut as Linda Banks , Larry 's wife and Bob 's mother . 
 The role of Mr. Jinx the cat was played by two five @-@ year @-@ old Himalayan cats named Bailey and Misha ( sometimes written as <unk> ) . The American Humane Association oversaw the filming of all scenes where the cats were used and ensured the animals ' obedience and well @-@ being by keeping two trainers and a veterinarian on set at all times .

 Greg Glienna did not come up with the surname Focker ; Greg 's character in the original film did not have a last name . The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey came up with the idea for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project . Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation , the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and , due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film , the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system . The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists . The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG @-@ 13 rating .

Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called the script " unforced " and concluded that the film " goes down like a flute of Champagne , leaving an aftertaste of giggles . " 
 However , Internet film critic James Berardinelli , in spite of awarding it two and a half stars out of four , gave the film a somewhat scathing review . On his website , Berardinelli wrote that " Meet the Parents is put together like a TV sit @-@ com , " that Roach " strings together a series of hit @-@ and @-@ miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent , interesting , or enjoyable ( in most cases , it 's none of those three ) " and concluding that " even with Stiller and De Niro , Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it 's available on video . " Jeff Vice of the Deseret News , another detractor of the film , proclaimed Meet the Parents " only erratically funny " and accused Roach of taking " the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes . " Critic Peter Bradshaw 's review of the film in The Guardian concludes that Meet the Parents " is somehow less than the sum of its parts . It strains to come to life , but never quite makes it . " After the film was released on home media , DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book Doug Pratt 's DVD : Movies , Television , Music , Art , Adult , and More ! stated that " perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical , but in the quieter venue of home video , it just seems sadistic , and as the humor evaporates , the holes in the plot become clearer .

 The success of Meet the Parents was initially responsible for a 2002 NBC reality television show entitled Meet My Folks in which a young woman 's love interest , vying for her family 's approval , is interrogated by the woman 's overprotective father with the help of a lie detector machine . In September 2002 , NBC also aired a situation comedy entitled In @-@ Laws . During the development of the sitcom , NBC called it " a Meet the Parents project " which prompted an investigation by Universal into whether NBC was infringing on Universal 's copyright . Universal did not pursue any action against NBC but neither show lasted more than one season . 
 In 2004 , Meet the Fockers was released as a sequel to Meet the Parents . Directed again by Jay Roach with a screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg , the sequel chronicles the events that take place when the Byrnes family meets Bernie and Roz Focker , Greg 's parents , played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand . The producers intended for Greg 's parents to be the opposite of the Byrnes ' conservative , upper class , <unk> demeanor ; to that effect , producer Jane Rosenthal explains that " Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were our dream team . " Meet the Fockers proved to be another financial success grossing $ 280 million domestically and $ 516 million worldwide , outperforming Meet the Parents by a large margin and finishing as the fourth highest grossing film of 2004 . 
 In February 2007 , Universal Studios announced that they would be making a second sequel in the franchise , titled Little Fockers . The film was to be directed by Roach with the screenplay written by Larry Stuckey , Roach 's former assistant . The sequel brings back De Niro , Stiller , Polo , Danner as well as Hoffman and Streisand . 
 On July 18 , 2005 , a regularly scheduled American Airlines flight from Fort Lauderdale @-@ Hollywood International Airport to San Juan , Puerto Rico had to be diverted back to Fort Lauderdale shortly after take @-@ off due to a bomb threat . The pilot turned the airplane around approximately 40 minutes into the flight after a flight attendant found a crumpled napkin that read " Bomb , bomb , bomb ... meet the parents , " a clear reference to the scene in which Ben Stiller 's character repeatedly shouts the word " bomb " while being detained by airport security . The airplane was met by a bomb squad of the local sheriff 's office as well as the FBI whose agents questioned the plane 's 176 passengers about the note . 
 = Arlington Senior High School = 
 Arlington Senior High School was a public high school in Saint Paul , Minnesota . It was located north of Downtown Saint Paul on Rice Street , west of Interstate 35E in the city 's North End neighborhood . Arlington opened on September 3 , 1996 as the newest high school for the Saint Paul Public School district . The school was the first high school to be built since Humboldt Senior High School in 1976 . The school was closed after the 2010 @-@ 2011 school year . 
 By its final year , the school enrolled only 875 students in grades 9 @-@ 12 , despite having operated near its capacity of 2 @,@ 000 most of the years it was open . The school consistently served a population that was around 95 % students of color , 50 @-@ 60 % <unk> , and 90 @-@ 95 % students on free / reduced price lunch . 
 Arlington was the only high school in Saint Paul with no attendance boundaries and enrolled students from throughout the city . Beginning in the 2009 school year , the school 's main educational focus was " Bio @-@ SMART , " a program that emphasizes bioscience and the use of technology in health care . The school offered several Advanced Placement classes as well as several College in the Schools classes , in conjunction with the University of Minnesota . 
 = = History = = 
 As early as 1991 the school district began to plan for an additional high school . Initial projections were to add 2 new high schools to the then 6 operating by 2000 . However a lack of funds allowed the construction of only one high school . The increasing number of children who attend public rather than non @-@ public schools was attributed to part of the need . In 1974 , 53 % of children born in St. Paul later entered kindergarten in the city public schools . In 1990 , 67 % of the city 's children attended public schools . Overcrowding was so severe that in 1992 a citizen 's group recommended moving 9th grade back into junior high buildings . The overcrowding was blamed on a surge in the birthrate in Saint Paul and a sudden influx of students from the suburbs , an unusual occurrence in an inner city school district . Plans for a " high tech " high school were put in place in as early as 1992 . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 In order to accommodate an estimated 4 @,@ 000 additional students , existing commercial buildings were sought to convert into high school buildings . After scouring the city , two possible sites were chosen . One near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds and the other near the school 's current location . The proposed area was the former site of an auto scrap yard . Officials were worried that the location would be polluted and would require an expensive cleanup . As a result , the location was moved to a site approximately .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) west . Of the current 29 acres ( 0 @.@ 05 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 12 km2 ) acre campus , roughly 20 acres ( 0 @.@ 03 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 08 km2 ) were from a failed housing project and the other 9 acres ( 0 @.@ 01 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 04 km2 ) were from homes that were bought and cleared . Some of the soil on the site was unstable and was replaced . Critics considered the location for being too close to Como Park and Johnson high schools and for being located in a residential neighborhood . Original estimates for the project cost $ 54 @.@ 3 million and as a result the Saint Paul school district authorized a $ 20 million bond . Knutson Construction Co. was chosen for the project . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 The high school was the first new high school to be built in Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s . The school district was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after . As a result , the competition to name the school was fierce . The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions . Two names , Arlington and Mechanic Arts , were quickly favored . Mechanic Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned for the name to be reused after the first Mechanic Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years . The alumni created a lobbying group and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun , a 1925 graduate of Mechanic Arts . However , the school board 's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5 @-@ 2 vote . The chosen school colors , blue and white , were the colors of Mechanic Arts . 
 = = = Closing = = = 
 In the spring of 2010 Saint Paul Public schools faced a $ 27 @.@ 2 million budget shortfall . To save money , plans to close the school began . The school 's projected enrollment would only be 650 students . 2009 @-@ 2010 Juniors would have been allowed to graduate from Arlington as the high school 's last class but only half of the required number of students committed to attending Arlington for the 2010 @-@ 2011 school year . The district set a goal of 150 Junior students staying for a viable program . 2009 @-@ 10 Juniors and Sophomores were required to transfer to other schools with Freshmen able to stay on as part of Washington Middle School 's <unk> program . 
 The high school was closed for the 2010 @-@ 2011 school year with Washington Middle School 's grades 7 @-@ 10 taking over the school 's space . Eventually Washington Middle School will add grades each year until it is a 7 @-@ 12 grade school . 
 = = Campus = = 
 Before the school was built many of the high schools in the Saint Paul Public Schools District were not up to date in technology . Consequently , an emphasis was placed on technology being built into the school and providing the ability to add to the existing facilities in the future . The school has extensive high tech facilities . The entire campus comprises 29 acres ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) in a residential neighborhood . The outside of the building is composed of tall narrow windows and a curving facade which has led to one architectural critic comparing it to a suburban office park . The " houses " that the freshmen and sophomores are divided into can be seen as wings projecting from the building . The houses were planned to separate the school into manageable sections so that the school does not seem as large to the students . 
 = = Students = = 
 Students were enrolled from throughout the city . Often the school was used to reassign students who could not be enrolled into other high schools . As of the 2006 @-@ 2007 school year , Arlington enrolled 1 @,@ 825 students . The plurality were Asian , at 48 % , with Black , 35 % and Hispanic , 11 % being the other major ethnic groups . 5 % of students identified as White . The school has the highest rate of poverty in high schools from the Saint Paul Public School system with 89 % of students qualifying for Free and Reduced Price Lunch . Free and Reduced Price Lunch is the measure of poverty for the district . The school has a large percentage of students who have limited English proficiency ( 58 % ) . 14 % of students qualify for special education . The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 83 % while roughly three out of five students who initially enroll graduate within 4 years . 35 % of students had grade level reading proficiency and 13 % of students had proficiency in mathematics . Enrollment dropped considerably in the last years with only 875 students enrolled in 2010 and projections of only 650 for 2011 . 
 = = Education = = 
 As the first new high school built in several years , many unorthodox ideas were suggested . After many of the ideas were criticized the school district requested parental input on the direction of the school 's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum . School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs . The school was planned as and is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary . An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school . 
 Arlington offers language classes in French and Spanish . The school also participates in the University of Minnesota 's College in the Schools program . Advanced Placement classes are also offered . Arlington uses a teaching program called " Small Learning Communities " . These smaller learning communities separate particular student interests into different areas of the school . They provide goal- or interest @-@ oriented learning . Freshmen and sophomores are separated into " houses " of smaller learning groups . Upper classmen follow specified career paths . Originally the school was opened with four focus areas ; liberal arts , medical and environmental sciences , informational technologies and communication and policy @-@ making and government but beginning with the 2008 @-@ 2009 school year those career paths will change . 
 In October 2007 , the school received a three @-@ year , $ 6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to help transform the school . The grant will be used to create a " Bio @-@ Smart " school for grades 11 @-@ 12 . The money will be use for hiring additional staff and adding more high @-@ tech equipment and supplies to the school 's " extensive " existing facilities . Students will choose between three career pathways : bioengineering and technology , bio @-@ business and marketing or biomedical and health sciences . Students will take elective classes related to their pathway as well as core classes , such as math and English . The grant was sought to help reinvent the school . Arlington has the lowest test scores and highest concentration of poverty for Saint Paul Public Schools . In addition , the school has been described as an " academically struggling high school " . As a result of not meeting Adequate Yearly Progress as a part of No Child Left Behind Arlington faced restructuring . However , the school 's restructuring is already underway with the biotech program .

 After joining the " No Labels Problem Solvers " caucus , Maloney supported the " No Budget , No Pay Act of 2013 " . Leading up to the 2013 government shutdown , Maloney faced criticism for voting with Republicans to pass a budget which included provisions delaying the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .

 " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1967 in Woodstock , New York , during the self @-@ imposed exile from public appearances that followed his July 29 , 1966 motorcycle accident . A recording of Dylan performing the song in September 1971 was released on the Bob Dylan 's Greatest Hits Vol . II album in November of that year , marking the first official release of the song by its author . An earlier 1967 recording of the song , performed by Dylan and The Band , was issued in 1975 on the album The Basement Tapes . 
 The Byrds also recorded a version of the song in 1968 and issued it as a single . The Byrds ' version is notable for being the first commercial release of the song , predating Dylan 's first release by three years . A later cover by Byrds members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman reached the top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts in 1989 . The song has also been covered by many other artists , including Joan Baez , Unit 4 + 2 , Earl Scruggs , Old Crow Medicine Show , Phish , Counting Crows , The Dandy Warhols , Bill and Bonnie Hearne , and Glen Hansard with Markéta Irglová .

 Starting in June 1967 and ending in October 1967 , Bob Dylan 's writing and recording sessions with the Band ( then known as the Hawks ) in Woodstock , New York , were the source of many new songs that were circulated as demos by Dylan 's publisher for fellow artists to record . " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " was written and recorded during this period and features lyrics that allude to the singer waiting for his bride to arrive and possibly , a final premarital fling . The original version found on 1975 's The Basement Tapes album was recorded with the Band ( minus Levon Helm who had temporarily left the group at this point ) in the basement of their house in West Saugerties , New York , called " Big Pink " . A first take recorded during the Basement Tapes sessions includes improvised nonsense lyrics such as " Just pick up that oil cloth , cram it in the corn / I don 't care if your name is Michael / You 're gonna need some boards / Get your lunch , you foreign bib " . This alternate take was released in 2014 on The Bootleg Series Vol . 11 : The Basement Tapes Complete .

Traum notes that " they were very popular songs ... that [ Dylan ] wanted to put his own stamp on . " The lyrics of this performance of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " differed significantly from both the Basement Tapes versions , and also played upon a mistaken lyric in The Byrds ' cover of three years earlier ( see below ) .

Although it is not as famous as their cover version of " Mr. Tambourine Man " , The Byrds ' recording of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " is often considered by critics to be the band 's best Dylan cover . 
 The song was selected as a suitable cover by The Byrds after their record label , Columbia Records , sent them some demos from Dylan 's Woodstock sessions . Included among these demos were the songs " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " and " Nothing Was Delivered " , both of which were recorded by The Byrds in March 1968 , during the Nashville recording sessions for Sweetheart of the Rodeo . Despite the change in musical style that the country @-@ influenced Sweetheart of the Rodeo album represented for The Byrds , the inclusion of two Dylan covers on the album forged a link with their previous folk rock incarnation , when Dylan 's material had been a mainstay of their repertoire . 
 The Byrds ' recording of the song caused a minor controversy between the band and its author . Dylan 's original demo of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " contained the lyric " Pick up your money , pack up your tent " , which was mistakenly altered in The Byrds ' version , by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn , to " Pack up your money , pick up your tent " . Dylan expressed mock @-@ annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 recording of the song , singing " Pack up your money , put up your tent McGuinn / You ain 't goin ' nowhere . " McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new recording of the song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band 's Will the Circle Be Unbroken : Volume Two album , adding the word " Dylan " after the same " Pack up your money , pick up your tent " lyric . McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band 's 1989 recording of the song , which also featured The Byrds ' former bass player Chris Hillman , was released as a single and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989 , as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by RPM . In spite of the involvement of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band , the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone . 
 After its appearance on Sweetheart of the Rodeo , the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds ' live concert repertoire , until their final disbandment in 1973 . The Byrds also chose to re @-@ record " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " in 1971 with Earl Scruggs , as part of the Earl Scruggs , His Family and Friends television special , and this version was included on the program 's accompanying soundtrack album . The song was also performed live by a reformed line @-@ up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn , David Crosby , and Chris Hillman in January 1989 . McGuinn continues to perform the song in his solo concerts and consequently it appears on his 2007 album , Live from Spain . 
 In addition to its appearance on the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album , The Byrds ' original recording of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " also appears on several of the band 's compilations , including The Best of The Byrds : Greatest Hits , Volume II , History of The Byrds , The Byrds Play Dylan , The Original Singles : 1967 – 1969 , Volume 2 , The Byrds , and There Is a Season . Live performances of the song are included on the expanded edition of The Byrds ' ( Untitled ) album and on Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971 . 
 = = Other covers = = 
 The British beat group Unit 4 + 2 released a recording of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " as a single in 1968 but it suffered poor sales as a result of the version released by The Byrds and consequently it did not chart . Joan Baez included a gender @-@ switched version of the song , in which she sings " Tomorrow 's the day my man 's gonna come " , on her 1968 album of Dylan covers , Any Day Now . Australian band The Flying Circus included this song on their self @-@ titled debut album released in August 1969 . 
 Roots rock quartet The Rave @-@ Ups covered the song on their 1985 album , Town and Country . Shawn Colvin , Mary Chapin Carpenter , and Rosanne Cash also performed the song at Madison Square Garden in 1992 , for eventual release on the Bob Dylan tribute album The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration . 
 Phish covered the song during their July 30 , 2003 concert at the Tweeter Center at the Waterfront in Camden , New Jersey . This is the only time that Phish has performed the song , coming in the show before their IT music festival in Maine ( particular emphasis was put on the lyric " We 'll climb that hill , no matter how steep ... when we get up to it . " ) 
 The e Brothers covered " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " on their 1998 live album , Marquee Mark and Counting Crows recorded the song as a bonus track on their Hard Candy album in 2002 as well as performing it live with Augustana . Maria Muldaur recorded the song , with slightly altered lyrics , on her 2006 Heart of Mine : Maria Muldaur Sings Love Songs of Bob Dylan album and Marty Raybon , former vocalist of Shenandoah , also covered the song on his 2006 album , When the Sand Runs Out . 
 Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová recorded the song for the soundtrack album to Todd Haynes ' Dylan biopic , I 'm Not There , using the lyrics from Dylan 's 1971 version , including the reference to Roger McGuinn . The Dandy Warhols have covered the song on the 2009 digital download edition of their album The Dandy Warhols Are Sound and for their September 1 , 2011 Daytrotter session . Actor Oscar Isaac ( with Kate Mara and Chad Fischer ) performed a version of the song in the 2011 film 10 Years , which also appeared on the film 's soundtrack . In 2012 , Brett <unk> released a version of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " on the Chimes of Freedom : Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International album .

 = Nisei ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Nisei " is the ninth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on November 24 , 1995 . It was directed by David Nutter , and written by Chris Carter , Frank Spotnitz and Howard Gordon . " Nisei " featured guest appearances by Steven Williams , Raymond J. Barry and Stephen McHattie . The episode helped explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Nisei " earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 8 , being watched by 16 @.@ 36 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received largely positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the origins of an alien autopsy Mulder believes is real . The investigation uncovers Japanese involvement and sees Mulder smuggle himself onto a secret cargo train to find out more . " Nisei " is a two @-@ part episode , with the plot continuing in the next episode , " 731 " . 
 Inspired by the atrocities committed by Unit 731 , a Japanese research program during World War II , " Nisei " was originally intended to be a stand @-@ alone mythology episode , but was lengthened into two separate parts . The episode featured several scenes that required stunt work , which David Duchovny performed himself . The episode 's title refers to the term nisei , meaning the son or daughter of an Issei couple born outside Japan . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Knoxville , Tennessee , a mysterious train car is left in a rail yard . After dark , a group of Japanese scientists enter the car and conduct an autopsy on an alien body . The scene is recorded and transmitted via satellite . Suddenly , a strike team storms the car and kills the scientists , taking the alien corpse away in a body bag . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) purchases an edited video of the autopsy . He believes the tape is authentic , but Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is skeptical . 
 When the agents go to Allentown , Pennsylvania to track down the distributor of the tape , they find him murdered . At the scene , they pursue and capture a Japanese man , Kazuo Sakurai , who is identified as a high @-@ ranking diplomat . Walter Skinner appears and orders Sakurai released . Before doing so , Mulder searches his briefcase and finds both a list of Mutual UFO Network members and satellite images of a ship . The Lone Gunmen identify the ship as the Talapus , a salvage vessel docked in Newport News , Virginia . Meanwhile , Sakurai is killed by an assassin called the Red @-@ Haired Man . 
 Scully investigates the MUFON group , discovering several women who claim to recognize her from her abduction experience . They have similar implants to Scully 's , and inform her that they are all dying of cancer . Meanwhile , Mulder goes to the Newport News shipyard and searches the Talapus . Armed men arrive and scour the ship , but Mulder manages to escape . That night , he discovers a warehouse where a craft is being fumigated by a hazmat team . Mulder believes the craft to be of alien origin , recovered by the Talapus . 
 Skinner later confronts Mulder over the briefcase , the absence of which has caused an international incident with Japan . He refuses to assist Mulder any further with his case . Mulder meets with Senator Richard Matheson , who gives him the details on the autopsy and links it with the larger conspiracy of the alien @-@ human hybrids . Mulder investigates further , discovering that the Japanese scientists were members of the notorious Unit 731 during World War II ; like Victor Klemper , they were recruited by the U.S. government to develop the hybrids . Mulder believes that the scientists killed on the videotape were working on a secret railway , transporting test subjects . 
 After sharing her MUFON findings with Mulder , Scully runs her implant through the FBI labs to gather technological information about it . She analyzes the autopsy video , realizing that one of the scientists seen , Dr. <unk> , experimented on her during her abduction . Meanwhile , Mulder goes to West Virginia and tracks down the secret train car , watching a group of Japanese men place what seems to be an alien @-@ human subject on board . Meanwhile , another Japanese scientist , Dr. Shiro Zama , waits for the train at a station in Ohio ; he is forced to board after his bodyguard is killed by the Red @-@ Haired Man in the restroom . The Red @-@ Haired Man follows Zama aboard the train , which is headed for Vancouver , Canada . 
 Mulder tracks the train to the Ohio station , but learns it has just left when he arrives . Meanwhile , Scully goes to Mulder 's apartment and is met by X , who warns her to keep Mulder from getting on the train . Scully calls Mulder , who has managed to drive ahead of the train and is just about to jump onto it from a bridge . Despite Scully 's pleas , Mulder jumps onto the top of the train as it speeds past below .

 The idea to create a story involving the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter . He noted , " Unit 731 first came to my attention at the same time as it did for a lot of other people , when I read it in the New York Times about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during the Second World War . " Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received " clemency so [ Americans ] could use their science " would be " interesting " . 
 Frank Spotnitz was assigned writing duties for " Nisei " , which was originally intended to be a stand @-@ alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season . However , as Spotnitz developed his script , the episode hit several logistical snags . Most notably , Spotnitz 's script featured several scenes filmed on trains : Chris Carter explained , " We found that we were going to have some trouble shooting with trains . " Eventually , the sheer scope of the episode caused co @-@ executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story . Spotnitz explained , " Goodwin called Chris and said , ' This is <unk> . [ … ] you 've got to throw out the script , basically . ' I was devastated , and Chris [ said ] ' Let 's make it a two @-@ parter . ' " So , the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter , resulting in it being delayed several weeks . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 A co @-@ executive producer called this episode and its second part " 731 " logistically huge . The stunt where Mulder jumped on a moving train was worked on for six weeks . While there was some alarm in having David Duchovny do the stunt , the actor , who had previously performed his own stunts in the episode " Ascension " was willing to do it and considered it a fun experience . The producers used trained rangers to play the soldiers in the teaser , part of an attempt to keep the show grounded in reality at all times . An 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy was used to play the dead alien on the autopsy table . The boy 's twin sister was used to play the alien on the train car . Both underwent extensive makeup including oversized dark contact lenses to create the effect of the alien eyes . 
 After watching the video bought by Mulder , Scully criticizes it citing the 1995 alien autopsy video — a hoax made by Ray <unk> , a British video producer . Coincidentally , Fox ended up re @-@ airing the alien autopsy video the night following this episode 's original air date . The episode features the first appearance of Agent Pendrell , who appeared in several other episodes in the third and fourth seasons . Pendrell was named after a street in Vancouver . The title , " Nisei " , refers to the term used , in countries of North and South America , to specify the son or daughter of an Issei couple born outside Japan . The term nisei Japanese American refers to nisei living in the United States . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Jan Delasara , in the book PopLit , PopCult and The X @-@ Files argues that episodes like " Nisei " and " 731 , " or the earlier episode " Paper Clip , " show the public 's trust in science " eroding . " Delasara proposes that " arrogated " scientists who are " rework [ ing ] the fabric of life , " are causing the public 's faith in science to fade drastically , " a concern " , she notes , " that is directly addressed by X @-@ Files episodes " . Moreover , she notes that almost all of the scientists portrayed in The X @-@ Files are depicted with a " connection to ancient evil " , with the lone exception being Agent Scully . In " Nisei , " and later in " 731 " , the scientists are former Japanese scientists who worked during WWII for the infamous 731 unit . In their attempts to create a successful human @-@ alien hybrid , they become the archetypical scientists who " [ go ] too far , " a serious factor that Delasara argues " ' alienates ' [ the public ] further from science and its practitioners .

 " Nisei " premiered on the Fox network on November 24 , 1995 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on October 23 , 1996 .

" 
 " Nisei " received largely positive reviews . In a retrospective of the third season in Entertainment Weekly , " Nisei " was rated an A. The review noted that the episode contained " lots of excitement for Scully " , though it also described Mulder 's plot thread as " equally gripping " . Writing for The A.V. Club , Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A- , calling it " a hell of a lot of fun " . VanDerWerff described the cliffhanger ending as " just phenomenal " , and felt that the episode had " the drive of a big @-@ budget action film " . However , he noted that it was becoming evident by this stage that the series ' mythology was becoming " too big to ever resolve wholly satisfactorily " . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Vitaris noted that , despite the teaser and first act being " promising enough " , the episode " slides downhill rapidly with a storyline that crosses the border into ludicrous . " Vitaris called the scene where soldiers kill prisoners " a scene more disturbing than anything else previously seen on The X @-@ Files . " Furthermore , she wrote that the final scene between Mulder and Scully was " beautifully written and acted . " 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , were slightly more critical and rated the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five .

 = Hurricane Diana ( 1984 ) = 
 Hurricane Diana was the fourth tropical storm , the first hurricane , the first major hurricane , and the strongest storm of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season . Diana was the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. East Coast in nearly 20 years . Watches and warnings were issued for the storm along the East coast between eastern Florida and Virginia . It caused moderate damage in North Carolina while it looped offshore and after it made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane . Forming on September 8 , Diana moved northward and wandered across North Carolina for a couple of days during mid @-@ September , dropping heavy rainfall . Once it left the state and accelerated east @-@ northeast , Diana quickly evolved into an extratropical cyclone . Damages to the United States totaled $ 65 @.@ 5 million ( 1984 USD ) . Three indirect fatalities were caused by the cyclone . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Diana can be traced back to a stalled out area of low pressure just north of the Bahamas along the tail end of a cold front on September 6 . Shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase the next day but was generally disorganized . Around 1200 UTC on September 8 , a ship in the vicinity of the low reported a sustained wind speed of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . A few hours later , based on satellite observations , the low was designated Tropical Storm Diana . With weak steering currents , Diana gradually intensified as it slowly moved towards the west over the next day , coming within 50 miles ( 85 km ) of Cape Canaveral , Florida , before taking a sharp turn towards the north @-@ northwest . As Diana neared Saint Augustine , Florida , it turned towards the northeast and intensified into a hurricane . 
 Under weak steering currents while detached to the front , Diana drifted westward , and came within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of the Florida coast . Rather than continuing westward , where it would have hit near Cape Canaveral , Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline . The storm , continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream , turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10 . On September 11 and September 12 , Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130 miles per hour ( 210 km / h ) winds while remaining offshore . 
 An approaching frontal system caused Diana to execute a cyclonic loop , where cool , dry air caused it to weaken . The hurricane hit Wilmington , North Carolina as a weakening hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) on September 13 , and quickly weakened to a tropical storm over land . The high pressure system that built in after Diana looped weakened , allowing the storm to move to the north and east . After crossing the Outer Banks , Diana accelerated to the northeast , and after restrengthening to a 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) storm , became extratropical near Nova Scotia on September 16 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Soon after advisories were initiated , gale warnings were issued between Cape Canaveral , Florida and Virginia Beach , Virginia during the afternoon of September 8 . During the morning of September 9 , gale warnings were lowered south of St. Augustine , Florida . As Diana strengthened into a hurricane , hurricane watches and gale warnings were raised between St. Augustine and Oregon Inlet , North Carolina . By the morning of September 10 , gale warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings between Brunswick , Georgia and Oregon Inlet . All warnings and watches south of Brunswick were dropped at that time . By the morning of September 11 , hurricane warnings were lowered south of Savannah , Georgia . That afternoon , all warnings were lowered south of Cape Romain , South Carolina . 
 On the morning of September 12 , all warnings were lowered south of Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . Early in the morning of September 13 , gale warnings were raised between Cape Romain and Myrtle Beach . Later that morning , hurricane warnings were lowered between Wilmington , North Carolina and Oregon Inlet , and all warnings were dropped between Cape Lookout and Virginia Beach . Gale warnings were then in effect between Wilmington and Cape Lookout . Once inland , all warnings were lowered on the afternoon of September 13 . As the tropical storm moved offshore , gale warnings went into effect between the mornings of September 14 and September 15 between Cape Lookout and Chincoteague , Virginia . 
 Along the North Carolina coastline , state troopers were deployed to assist residents in evacuating and preparing for the hurricane . South Carolina governor Mike Daniel declared a state of emergency and placed the national guard on standby . Schools throughout the Carolinas and Georgia were closed . Most beaches were closed due to strong rip currents and beach erosion . Residents on barrier islands were urged to evacuate as waves in excess of 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) were expected to inundate them . Approximately 94 families were relocated from their mobile homes near Beaufort , North Carolina by state officials . A 24 @-@ hour emergency operations center was also established . The Coast Guard moved all available boats in the area to a position where they could be deployed immediately if needed . 
 Along the Georgia coastline , The Golden Isles of Georgia were evacuated due to large swells produced by Diana . Two nursing homes in Tybee Island were evacuated and a voluntary evacuation was issued for all residents in the town . Several shelters were also opened at schools in a few counties ; however , relatively few families sought refuge in them . Local schools and beaches were also closed for the duration of the storm 's passage . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 With Category 4 winds of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) , Diana threatened to become the most intense hurricane to strike North Carolina since Hurricane Hazel in 1954 . However , it looped and weakened just offshore and made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane . Because of this , Diana only caused $ 65 @.@ 5 million in damage ( 1984 USD ) due to heavy flooding from up to 19 inches ( 480 mm ) of rain , tree damage , and downed power lines . Most of the damage was experienced between Wilmington , North Carolina and Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . The Carolina Power and Light Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant recorded winds of over 75 mph , making Hurricane Diana the first hurricane to bring hurricane force winds to a nuclear power plant . Some yard damage was seen , but the plant was mostly unaffected . 
 Three indirect deaths were reported from Diana . One person died from a heart attack while making hurricane preparations , and the other two were from automobile accidents . Following the storm , President Ronald Reagan declared five North Carolina counties as a federal disaster area , allowing the affected regions to receive government funds and assistance . Funds were also allocated for the repairing of roads and sewers .

 = U.S. Route 8 = 
 U.S. Highway 8 ( US 8 ) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs primarily east – west for 280 miles ( 451 km ) , mostly within the state of Wisconsin . It connects Interstate 35 ( I @-@ 35 ) in Forest Lake , Minnesota , to US 2 at Norway in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan near the border with Wisconsin . Except for the short freeway segment near Forest Lake , and sections near the St. Croix River bridge and Rhinelander , Wisconsin , it is mostly undivided surface road . As a state highway in the three states , US 8 is maintained by the Minnesota , Wisconsin and Michigan departments of transportation ( Mn / DOT , WisDOT , MDOT , respectively ) . 
 The highway was originally commissioned on November 11 , 1926 , with the rest of the original U.S. Highway System . At the time , it ran between Forest Lake , Minnesota , and Pembine , Wisconsin , with a planned continuation to Powers , Michigan . Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then . The western end was extended south to Minneapolis before it was truncated back to Forest Lake . Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway . Internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original 1926 terminus . US 8 's course through the three states has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years . 
 WisDOT built a bypass around the city of Rhinelander in the 1990s and created a business loop along the old highway through the town . This loop was a locally maintained route through the central business district in Rhinelander . The signage for the loop was removed in 2005 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Forest Lake to St. Croix Falls = = = 
 US 8 begins at an interchange with I @-@ 35 in Forest Lake . This interchange is incomplete : traffic can only access US 8 directly from northbound I @-@ 35 , and westbound traffic on US 8 merges onto southbound I @-@ 35 . The first one @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) segment of roadway to Forest Lake is a freeway , with an interchange at US 61 . East of this junction , the highway follows Lake Boulevard North around Forest Lake and continues northeasterly through the community to cross the Washington – Chisago county line . The highway continues to the northeast along farmland and the shore of Green Lake to Chisago City , where it meets up with County Road 22 ( CR 22 ) . US 8 follows Lake Boulevard through Chisago City along the isthmus between the larger Chisago Lake and the smaller <unk> Lake on the eastern side of town . The highway turns along a more easterly path in Lindström between North and South Lindström lakes . East of those lakes , US 8 crosses into the town of Center City . 
 In Center City , US 8 runs between North and South Center lakes , curving around the north shore of South Center Lake . On the eastern edge of town , it turns due east for several miles and runs through Shafer . US 8 merges with State Highway 95 ( MN 95 ) about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southwest of Taylors Falls . The two highways concurrently turn northeast along the St. Croix River , entering town . At this point , MN 95 continues north along the river while US 8 turns east to cross the St. Croix River , exiting the state of Minnesota into Wisconsin . 
 Legally , the Minnesota section of US 8 is defined as Constitutional Route 46 and Legislative Route 98 in the Minnesota Statutes § § 161 @.@ 114 ( 2 ) and 161 @.@ 115 ( 29 ) ; the roadway is not marked with those numbers . The section of US 8 in Chisago County is officially designated the Moberg Trail . 
 = = = St. Croix Falls to Rhinelander = = = 
 US 8 enters Polk County at St. Croix Falls as a multilane roadway . It joins State Highway 35 ( WIS 35 ) at a diamond interchange located approximately one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the state line . The two highways run concurrently for four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) before WIS 35 turns off to the north at a location in the Town of St. Croix Falls west of Deer Lake . US 8 continues eastward through forest lands , and WIS 46 joins from the north for a four @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) concurrency before splitting off to the south . Continuing eastward , US 8 passes through Range and crosses into Barron County at Turtle Lake . US 63 merges from the south near Turtle Lake and departs to the north in the downtown area . The roadway passes through <unk> and intersects WIS 25 in Barron . East of Barron , US 8 meets US 53 at a mixed diamond / cloverleaf interchange and turns north into Cameron , then turns east in downtown to leave the latter community . After a nine @-@ mile ( 14 km ) straightaway , the highway crosses into Rusk County , and then it continues due east for an additional five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) before turning northeast and passing through Weyerhaeuser . Continuing northeasterly , the roadway crosses WIS 40 in Bruce . East of town , the highway continues through rural Rusk County , and US 8 meets WIS 27 in downtown Ladysmith . 
 Upon leaving Ladysmith , US 8 passes through the communities of Tony , Glen Flora , Ingram ( where it meets the northern terminus of WIS 73 ) and Hawkins on its way out of Rusk County . In Price County , US 8 passes through Kennan and Catawba . WIS 111 terminates at its south end on US 8 just east of Catawba . US 8 meets WIS 13 at a diamond interchange northwest of Prentice and passes north of the city . The highway passes through Brantwood and enters Lincoln County at Clifford . Further east , US 8 crosses Tripoli and McCord and runs north of Tomahawk as it passes through the Lake Nokomis area . US 51 crosses US 8 northeast of Tomahawk . US 8 turns northeast into Oneida County and onto a twisting northeasterly alignment . The highway passes through <unk> and expands to a divided highway into Rhinelander . It merges with WIS 47 on the southwest side of Rhinelander . WIS 17 north joins the highways one @-@ half mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) to the southeast , creating a wrong @-@ way concurrency with WIS 47 ; along this section of highway , eastbound US 8 is also southbound WIS 47 and northbound WIS 17 and vice versa . WIS 17 turns to the north two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southeast of there , and US 8 and WIS 47 head eastbound out of the Rhinelander area . 
 = = = Rhinelander to Norway = = = 
 US 8 intersects US 45 south in Monico , and WIS 47 splits from US 8 to follow US 45 south . Immediately east of the same intersection , US 45 north follows US 8 for one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before splitting to the north . US 8 enters Forest County five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) east of Monico . Seven miles ( 11 km ) into the county , the highway merges with WIS 32 from the north in Crandon and the two highways head east to Laona where US 8 turns north and WIS 32 turns south . US 8 turns east again at Cavour and passes through the community of Armstrong Creek one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the Marinette County line . The highway passes through Goodman and Dunbar as it meanders through the county and joins US 141 at Pembine . The two routes split 10 miles ( 16 km ) further north near Niagara ; after the split , US 8 heads east . The highway takes a northward turn and heads across the Menominee River into Michigan near Pier 's Gorge Park . 
 Entering Michigan south of Norway at the Menominee River crossing in Norway Township , US 8 proceeds north into the city where it ends at US 2 . US 8 in Michigan is 2 @.@ 322 miles ( 3 @.@ 737 km ) long ; in this segment , the road passes by the Dickinson County fairgrounds and Norway Speedway . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Starting in 1918 , the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state @-@ maintained roadways . The highway across the state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was numbered WIS 14 at that time . The remainder of what is now US 8 was unnumbered secondary highways , and WIS 14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence . When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year , the future US 8 was not included in the system . In Minnesota , US 8 would follow what was Constitutional Route 46 , which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2 , 1920 ; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming . 
 The first changes to the routings of the predecessor highways were made by Wisconsin by 1920 . A series of curves were added between Turtle Lake and Barron adding " stair steps " to the routing while similar jogs were removed near Cameron , <unk> , Hawkins and Prentice . WIS 14 was rerouted between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake to run via Monico , and WIS 38 ( the future US 141 ) was extended northward from Wausaukee to terminate at the state line near Niagara . The realignment between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake was shown as reversed by 1922 . By 1925 , the highway in that area was again rerouted to run directly from Rhinelander to Monico , but instead of turning south to Pelican Lake , it was run directly to Crandon . That same year , WIS 14 was extended eastward from Armstrong Creek to Pembine and northward to Niagara . The north – south section , previously numbered WIS 38 , was also redesignated as part of WIS 57 . 
 US 8 was created with the beginnings of the United States Numbered Highway System on November 26 , 1926 . The highway was originally shown on maps running between Forest Lake , Minnesota and Powers , Michigan . At the time , its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the State Trunkline Highway System in Michigan . The trunkline connection from Quinnesec south into Wisconsin was part of M @-@ 57 , which met WIS 57 at the state line . US 8 ended at WIS 57 in Pembine at the time , with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps . A map by the American Automobile Association does show the highway continuing east through <unk> and Hermansville in Michigan to end at US 2 . The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously indicated an unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville . A later extension in 1927 moved US 8 to run along US 141 , which had replaced WIS 57 and M @-@ 57 , ending in Quinnesec at US 2 . By the next year , the highway was shifted to end in Norway , utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan . 
 In 1931 , US 8 was extended south from Forest Lake into downtown Minneapolis . West of the Rhinelander area , US 8 and US 51 overlapped for about eight miles ( 13 km ) as US 8 jogged northward along US 51 . This concurrency was altered in 1934 , and two years later the short east – west section of US 8 / US 51 was removed when changes to US 51 's routing were finished in the area . A jog in the routing near Almena was removed in 1937 when Wisconsin rerouted the highway to a more direct alignment in the area . 
 The last segment of US 8 in Wisconsin was paved in 1937 between Cavour and Armstrong Creek ; the highway in Minnesota was paved in its entirety by 1940 . Near Hawkins , a pair of sharp curves near the Rusk – Price county line were removed as the State Highway Commission realigned the highway to follow a straighter course . The US 8 / US 51 concurrency was altered the next year to a shorter overlap running southward near <unk> Junction . The former routing of US 8 was redesignated County Trunk Highway K ( CTH @-@ K ) after it was transferred back to county control . 
 Starting around the year 1955 , US 8 was moved to a more direct routing between Forest Lake and Chisago City ; US 8 replaced MN 98 along Legislative Route 98 . The former routing between Wyoming and Chisago City along Constitutional Route 46 was then redesignated MN 98 until it was decommissioned in the late 1990s . 
 As late as 1959 , the Michigan Department of Transportation still had plans to build the section of US 8 west of Hermansville to the Menominee River . The control section atlas published on January 1 , 1959 , showed this segment of highway on the Menominee County map , complete with a control section number . The section of highway is shown as " proposed " or " under construction " . However , a new bridge was built over the Menominee River to carry the highway across the Michigan – Wisconsin state line near Norway in 1966 . WisDOT still shows the section of highway needed in their state to extend US 8 to the original eastern terminus in Michigan on internal maps . The December 31 , 2004 , edition of their Official State Trunk Highway System Maps shows this section as a " mapped corridor " . 
 In the late 1970s , with ongoing construction and completion of the I @-@ 35W freeway in Minnesota , US 8 was routed along I @-@ 35W ; US 8 was truncated again by 1981 to its current terminus in Forest Lake . The section in New Brighton is currently known as Old Highway 8 . 
 WisDOT built a bypass of the city of Rhinelander during the early 1990s ; the new highway was constructed south of town as a new two @-@ lane highway that opened to traffic by 1993 . The former route through downtown Rhinelander and near Clear and George lakes was redesignated as Business US 8 ( Bus . US 8 ) . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 In 2002 , US 8 was widened from two lanes to four lanes with a grass median between North Rifle Road and WIS 47 near Rhinelander , Wisconsin . At the time , officials with WisDOT had plans to extend the four @-@ lane divided highway as far west as US 51 near Tomahawk . Problems related to wetlands in the construction area and bad weather pushed completion of the project back almost a year . Contractors had to install metal sheeting to stabilize the marshy ground . Originally scheduled to end in late 2002 , the project did not finish until August 2003 . The delays and additional work increased the price tag of the project from the original $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 6 @.@ 3 million in 2015 ) to $ 6 @.@ 0 million ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) . A section of the project was only designed for 45 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 72 km / h ) speeds for safety reasons . The design also allowed planners to limit the amount of land needed for the expansion . 
 Bill and Jerri Osberg sued the state and seven other parties in April 2003 over runoff from the construction , claiming that it killed hundreds of trees and polluted ponds on their property . Later investigation uncovered damage to wildlife habitat in the Wisconsin River . Included in the original lawsuit were six individual WisDOT employees , the primary contractor and a local pet supply company . The court of appeals partially upheld a ruling by the district court dismissing the employees and the contractor from the lawsuit in March 2006 . The pet supply company was reinstated in the case by the appeals court . The couple settled their claims , and the state pursued the matter against Pagel Construction in a related lawsuit . WisDOT alleged that the contractor did not follow proper erosion controls and failed to <unk> the erosion damage to the <unk> ' property . The state wanted the construction company to forfeit their $ 70 @,@ 000 retainer ( equivalent to $ 99 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) and pay damages of $ 150 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 174 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . Pagel Construction faulted WisDOT 's erosion control plan and said that the state 's engineers controlled the project and was seeking the return of its retainer . In September 2007 , a jury ruled in favor of Pagel Construction and awarded them $ 70 @,@ 898 @.@ 13 in damages ( equivalent to $ 82 @,@ 402 @.@ 99 in 2015 ) .

 WisDOT has completed the environmental studies on bypasses of Barron and Cameron in Barron County . These bypasses would form a continuous expressway through the area . No funding has been identified to complete the projects . The entire length of US 8 in the state has been classified as a North Country Corridor in the Connections 2030 Plan by the department . This designation marks the highway as a priority in " continued safety , enhanced mobility and efficiency " as well as " modernization to correct outdated infrastructure design " .

 = = Business route = = 
 Business U.S. Highway 8 ( Bus . US 8 ) in Rhinelander , Wisconsin , was a locally maintained business loop highway routing through the central business district of the city . The route was designated when US 8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in the 1990s . The former routing of US 8 through the area was turned over to the city and county for maintenance . The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of the main highway south of town . The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1 , 2005 , when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH @-@ P. 
 Before the signage was removed , Bus . US 8 started at the western junction of US 8 and WIS 47 . The business loop ran east from this intersection along Kemp Street , crossing the Wisconsin River north of the convergence with the Pelican River . The loop jogged north along Oneida Street for 3 blocks and turned east again on Lincoln Street . East of town , Bus . US 8 intersected WIS 17 and turned to the southeast . Outside of town , the business loop ran through wooded terrain and turned south near Clear Lake . Near the larger George Lake , the roadway curved back east along the lake 's southern shore , running parallel to the main highway before turning south to connect to the main highway . At this intersection with US 8 / WIS 47 , the business loop ended after a total run of 7 @.@ 1 miles ( 11 @.@ 4 km ) .

 Salil Ashok Ankola ( born 1 March 1968 , Solapur , Maharashtra ) is a former Indian international cricketer who played one Test match and 20 One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) from 1989 to 1997 for India . A right @-@ arm fast @-@ medium bowler , he played first @-@ class cricket for Maharashtra , regularly opening the bowling . Ankola 's consistent performances for Maharashtra earned him a call for representing India during their tour of Pakistan in 1989 – 90 . After the first Test match at Karachi , he was dropped for the subsequent matches in the series owing to injuries . After a brief phase of playing first @-@ class cricket , Ankola was called for the Indian ODI team during 1993 , eventually led to being a part of the 1996 Cricket World Cup . At age 28 , Ankola retired due to a sudden development of bone tumor in his left shin bone ( <unk> <unk> ) because of which he could not run for 2 years . Since then he went on to appear in a number of Indian soap operas and a few Hindi films .

 Ankola was born into a <unk> @-@ speaking Maharashtrian Brahmin family in 1968 . He made his first @-@ class debut at the age of 20 for Maharashtra in 1988 – 89 . Playing against Gujarat he scored 43 runs and took a six @-@ wicket haul ( six wickets in an innings ) that included a hat @-@ trick . He followed with another six @-@ wicket haul ; six wickets for 51 runs in an innings against Baroda . Overall , he collected 27 wickets at an average of 20 @.@ 18 including three five wicket hauls during the season . Owing to the consistent performances during the season , Ankola caught the attention of the selectors , as he was selected for the India 's tour of Pakistan in 1989 – 90 . In a warm up match against <unk> Patron 's XI he took six wickets for 77 runs in the first innings and collecting two more wickets in the second innings , thus taking his tally to eight wickets . 
 = = Pakistan tour and aftermath = = 
 Ankola made his Test debut during the first test of the tour at Karachi , alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Waqar Younis , both would go on to become successful cricketers later in their careers . In a match that was drawn , Ankola took two wickets for 128 runs . Injuries sustained thereafter and prevented him from appearing in the remaining Tests of the series . 
 Soon after the Test series , that was drawn , Ankola was called for the ODI series . He made his ODI debut in the second of the three @-@ match series ; the first ODI was abandoned due to bad lights . Ankola picked up two wickets conceding 26 runs . He arrived at number 10 in the second innings at a stage where India needed 15 runs of one over . Ankola hit a six of the first ball that he faced off Imran Khan but eventually ended on the losing side . In the next match , he bowled just 2 @.@ 3 overs ( 15 balls ) before the match was called off due to crowd disruption . Despite being selected in the Test squads on domestic series and overseas tours , he never got an opportunity to play for the team . Being dropped from the team without getting a game was known in cricket circles as being " <unk> " . However , Ankola continued to play ODI cricket . In the early 1990s , he along with other bowlers such as <unk> <unk> , Paras <unk> , Nilesh Kulkarni and <unk> <unk> was trained under Frank Tyson . Ankola mainly worked on altering his style rather than pace . During this period , Ankola married Parineeta ; the couple has two children — a daughter and a son . After a period of three years , Ankola was selected for the Charms Cup against England and Zimbabwe at home . In a match against South Africa during the Hero Cup ( 1993 ) , he captured three wickets for 33 runs , which remained his career @-@ best bowling figures in ODIs . 
 In 1996 , Ankola was selected in the Indian team for the World Cup . In the tournament he played just one match against Sri Lanka . In a match that India lost , he conceded 28 runs off five overs without claiming any wicket . Shortly after the World Cup , the selectors with immediate effect dropped Ankola along with Vinod Kambli and all @-@ rounder Manoj Prabhakar — all were a part of the squad earlier — for the Singer cup and Pepsi Sharjah Cup . Ankola was replaced by medium @-@ fast bowler Prashant Vaidya . However , Ankola was subsequently selected for the Indian team that toured South Africa in 1996 — 97 . Despite being a part of the squad , he was never given a chance to represent the playing XI in any of the Test matches . Following the Test series , he was picked up for the Standard Bank International ODI tournament ; he played five games in the tournament against South Africa and Zimbabwe . In the finals against South Africa that India lost , Ankola conceded 50 runs in seven overs in what became his last match ; the spell included a catch being taken off a no ball and a dropped chance . The tour remained his last in international cricket as he was never selected for the team again . Following that , Ankola declared his retirement from international cricket the same year .

 After retiring from cricket , Ankola shifted his focus towards entering films . He made his cinematic debut through the 2000 Hindi film Kurukshetra , where he played the role of a cop accompanying his senior officer played by Sanjay Dutt . He followed that with <unk> ( 2002 ) , and his last major release Chura <unk> Hai <unk> ( 2003 ) featured him alongside Esha Deol and Zayed Khan . The following year he acted in Silence Please ... The Dressing Room , where he played the character of a cricket captain . The film did not fare well at the box @-@ office , nonetheless Ankola 's performance was highly appreciated . He also participated in the first season of Bigg Boss , Indian version of the reality show Big Brother in 2006 . Prior to that , he acted in the Indian soap opera titled Karam Apna Apna , where he signed a contract with Balaji Telefilms that " [ Ankola ] would not act in any television show on any channel apart from those produced by Balaji Films " . Since he appeared in Bigg Boss before the contract would expire — one year from June 2006 — the Bombay High Court ordered him not to act in any TV shows on other channels that are considered rivals for Sony Television . <unk> ... Koi Hai and Kora <unk> are some of the other soap operas that he has acted . In 2008 , it was reported that Ankola has been suffering from depression and was enrolled in a rehabilitation centre in Pune . The reason behind the illness was believed to be his severe addiction to alcohol . As a result of this his wife decided to settle with her parent in Pune with their children , leaving Ankola isolated . 
 After his recovery in January 2010 , Ankola sent a legal notice to his wife demanding mutual consent for separation . His wife responded that , " there was [ no ] problem or a marital breakdown ... wanted to work on a reconciliation , not divorce . " Ankola , when asked about reconciliation , said he was not willing to do so . The couple finally got divorced in 2011 . On 22 December 2013 , Parineeta 's body was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room at her residence in Geeta Society , Salisbury Park , in Pune . 
 In March 2010 , his former team @-@ mates in order to support Ankola , organised a Twenty20 benefit match between Sachin Tendulkar XI and Sourav Ganguly XI at the Andheri Sports Complex , Mumbai . The squad included Ankola himself along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni , captain of the Indian national cricket team then . A writer noted that , " Salil Ankola is indeed fortunate . Not many players get to witness an unexpected visitor in the form of the current India captain turning up for his benefit match " . 
 In February 2013 , Salil was seen as Savitri 's father in the daily show Savitri but was replaced by Shahbaz Khan in August , 2013 after a revamp of the show . Rumors are that he will be seen in an episode of the popular Zee TV show , Fear Files .

The episode explores themes of marriage , community and alcohol use . Homer 's voyage features surreal animation to depict the elaborate hallucination .

 = = Plot = = 
 After a series of distractions from Marge , Homer suddenly smells out the annual chili cook @-@ off . Marge admits that she was trying to keep Homer from attending because of his drunken antics at the previous year 's event , when he jumped into a cotton candy machine , claiming he was a " puffy pink cloud " , so she allows Homer to go , on the condition that he does not drink any beer . At the cook @-@ off , Homer demonstrates an extraordinary ability to withstand hot foods , until he fails against Chief Wiggum 's chili which burns his tongue . Sobbing about his humiliation , he drinks several cups of water . 
 After nearly accidentally drinking melted candle wax , Homer decides to coat his mouth with wax , enabling him to eat several of the peppers . The peppers bring on a hallucination in which Homer is trapped in a bizarre fantasy world . He encounters a snake , a butterfly and a tortoise , and he accidentally destroys the sun . He finally arrives at a large Mayan pyramid and meets his spirit guide in the form of a coyote . The coyote advises Homer to find his soulmate , and questions Homer 's assumption that he has already found her in Marge . Meanwhile , Marge hears of Homer 's strange behavior and , believing he has broken his promise , drives home . 
 The next day , Homer regains his senses while lying in a golf course sand trap . He rationalizes his dream , comparing the desert he wandered in to the sand trap , the Mayan pyramid with a pro shop , and the talking coyote with a passing talking dog . After returning home , he finds Marge angry with him for his embarrassing behavior at the cook @-@ off . This leads to Homer making note of their fundamental personality differences , causing him to question if Marge is truly his soulmate , and he leaves . Filled with doubt , he searches elsewhere for a soulmate , yet fails in each instance . 
 Eventually he becomes convinced that a lighthouse keeper might be his soulmate , since they would both be theoretically lonely individuals ; instead he finds the lighthouse is operated by a machine , <unk> ( Electronic Automatic Robotic Lighthouse ) . Seeing an approaching ship , Homer destroys the lighthouse 's light in hopes that it will cause the boat to come closer and the people inside will befriend him . An apologetic Marge arrives , having known exactly where Homer would go , and the pair realize that they really are soulmates . Marge quickly fixes the lighthouse so that the ship will not run into them , but it runs aground nearby , spilling its precious cargo of hot pants . The citizens of Springfield happily retrieve the pants while Marge and Homer embrace . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was pitched as early as the third season by George Meyer , who was interested in an episode based on the books of Carlos Castaneda . Meyer had wanted to have an episode featuring a mystical voyage that was not induced by drugs , and so he decided to use " really hot " chili peppers instead . The staff , except for Matt Groening , felt it was too odd for the show at that point . Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein resurrected the story , and decided to use it for season eight . 
 Most of the hallucination sequence was animated completely by David Silverman . Silverman did not want the risk of sending it to South Korea , as he wanted it to look exactly as he had imagined it , including rendered backgrounds to give a soft mystical feel to the scene . The coyote was intentionally drawn in a <unk> way so that it looked " other @-@ worldly " and unlike the other characters . During Homer 's voyage , the clouds in one shot are live @-@ action footage , and 3D computer animation was used for the giant butterfly . During the same hallucination , Ned Flanders ' line was treated on a Mac computer so that it increased and decreased pitch . The Fox censors sent a note to the writers , questioning Homer coating his mouth with hot wax . The note read : " To discourage imitation by young and foolish viewers , when Homer begins to pour hot wax into his mouth , please have him scream in pain so kids will understand that doing this would actually burn their mouths . " The scream was not added ; however , they did add dialog from Ralph Wiggum , questioning Homer on his action . The director also created a " wax @-@ chart " for Homer for the animators to follow during the sequence when Homer 's mouth is coated with candle @-@ wax . 
 Homer waking up on a golf course was a reference to something that happened to a friend of the producers , who blacked out , waking up on a golf course in a different town and state . He had to buy a map from 7 @-@ Eleven in order to find out where he was . He then had to walk several miles in order to get back to his friend 's house , which was the last place he remembered being the night before . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan were the writers ' top two choices to play the coyote ; the writers had wanted to use one of The Highwaymen as the voice of the spirit guide . Bob Dylan had turned the show down many times , having previously been offered a role in season seven 's " Homerpalooza " . Johnny Cash was offered the role , which he accepted . Matt Groening described Cash 's appearance as " one of the greatest coups the show has ever had . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The main plot of the episode is based on the works of Carlos Castaneda , with some of the Native American imagery being similar to that used in the film Dances with Wolves . The lighthouse keeper actually being a computer is a reference to the episode of The Twilight Zone " The Old Man in the Cave " , in which a man in a cave turns out to be a computer . The main theme from The Good , the Bad and the Ugly is used during the scenes when Homer walks into the chili festival , and the song " At Seventeen " by Janis Ian plays in the background as Homer walks through the town of Springfield looking for his soul @-@ mate after he wakes up from his vision . The scene at the end of Homer 's hallucination , when the train is heading towards him , is a reference to the opening titles of Soul Train . Homer 's record collection features albums by Jim Nabors , Glen Campbell and The Doodletown Pipers .

 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , said : " Homer 's chili @-@ induced trip is brilliant , complete with the surreal tortoise and Indian spirit guide . " The episode was placed eighth on AskMen.com 's " Top 10 : Simpsons Episodes " list , and in his book Planet Simpson , Chris Turner named the episode as being one of his five favorites , although he found the ending too sentimental . In 2011 , Keith Plocek of LA Weekly 's Squid Ink blog listed " El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer " as the best episode of the show with a food theme . IGN ranked Johnny Cash 's performance as the 14th @-@ best guest appearance in the show 's history , while Cash also appeared on AOL 's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars , and on The Times ' Simon Crerar 's list of the 33 funniest cameos in the history of the show .

 = Italian cruiser Folgore = 
 Folgore was a torpedo cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) , the lead ship of the Folgore class . Armed with three 14 in ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes and six light guns , she was capable of a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . She was built in the mid @-@ 1880s , was launched in September 1886 , and was completed in February 1887 . The ship spent her first two years in service either conducting training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet or in reserve status . She was badly damaged in a collision with the cruiser Giovanni Bausan in 1889 , which reduced her effectiveness and cut her career short . Folgore spent the next eleven years primarily in the reserve , until she was sold for scrap in April 1901 and broken up . 
 = = Design = = 
 Folgore was 56 @.@ 7 meters ( 186 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 6 @.@ 31 m ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) and an average draft of 2 @.@ 15 m ( 7 ft 1 in ) . She displaced 364 metric tons ( 358 long tons ; 401 short tons ) normally . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal double @-@ expansion steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by four coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers . Folgore could steam at a speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) from 2 @,@ 150 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 600 kW ) . She had a crew of between 57 – 70 . 
 The primary armament for Folgore was three 14 in ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes . She was also equipped with two 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) / 43 guns and four 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) / 25 guns , all mounted singly . The ship carried no armor protection .

 Folgore was built at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia ( Royal Dockyard in Castellammare di Stabia ) . She was launched on 29 September 1886 and was completed on 16 February 1887 . On 10 June , the annual fleet maneuvers began ; Folgore was assigned to the " defending squadron " , along with the ironclads Enrico Dandolo , Palestro , Castelfidardo , and Affondatore , the protected cruiser Dogali , and several smaller vessels . The first half of the maneuvers tested the ability to attack and defend the Strait of Messina , and concluded in time for a fleet review by King Umberto I on the 21st . The second phase consisted of joint maneuvers with the Italian Army ; Folgore and the torpedo cruiser Tripoli were tasked with blockading Livorno . The exercises lasted until 30 July . 
 The following year , she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers , along with five ironclads , a protected cruiser , the torpedo cruisers Tripoli , Goito , and Saetta , and numerous smaller vessels . The maneuvers consisted of close @-@ order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia . Later that year , the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser Wilhelm II during a visit to Italy . The ship 's career was cut short on 5 July 1889 , when she collided with the protected cruiser Giovanni Bausan while the two ships were steaming off Capri . Folgore was badly damaged , and she could not be restored to her original capabilities . She was accordingly laid up . 
 Folgore was briefly recommissioned to take part in the annual fleet maneuvers in 1894 , along with her sister ship Saetta . After two months in service , both vessels returned to the reserve . As of 1895 , she was located in La Spezia , along with Saetta . That year , unrest in the Ottoman Empire that killed hundreds of foreign nationals prompted several of the European great powers to send an international fleet to pressure the Ottomans into compensating the victims . In November , a small Italian squadron was sent to Smyrna to join the fleet in there ; Folgore was mobilized as part of a larger force in Naples that consisted of the ironclads Francesco Morosini , Lepanto , and Ruggiero di Lauria , the protected cruiser Elba , the torpedo cruiser Calatafimi , and five torpedo boats . This second squadron was stocked with coal and ammunition in the event that it would need to reinforce the squadron at Smryna . She remained in reserve until 12 April 1900 , when the Regia Marina sold the ship for scrap . Folgore was thereafter broken up .

 In the 1960s , Selena 's father Abraham Quintanilla , Jr. became the third vocalist of Los Dinos , a group composed of Mexican Americans . The band began their careers playing English @-@ language doo @-@ wop music . White Americans were offended that a Mexican American band was singing " their type of music " . After a crowd of Mexican @-@ Americans ran Los Dinos out of a nightclub for singing English @-@ language songs , the band decided to perform music of their heritage . Los Dinos found success recording and performing Spanish @-@ language songs and their popularity grew . Quintanilla , Jr. left the band in the 1970s after fathering his third child , Selena . After discovering Selena could sing , he quickly organized his children into a band called Selena y Los Dinos . Despite wanting to record English @-@ language songs , the band recorded Tejano music compositions ; a male @-@ dominated , Spanish @-@ language genre with German influences of polka , jazz , and country music that was popular with Mexicans living in the United States . The band was often turned down by Texas music venues because of the members ' ages and because Selena was the lead singer . 
 Rick Trevino , founder of the Tejano Music Awards , originally approached La Sombra as the opening act for the 1989 awards ceremony , following Selena y Los Dinos . The band 's lead vocalist Frank <unk> declined the offer , telling Trevino he " doesn 't open up for anybody " . Trevino then called Quintanilla , Jr. to ask him to open the ceremony . Quintanilla , Jr. immediately accepted the offer , saying it was " the best time , because everyone is sober . They 're sober they 're listening to the artist and the music . " Unbeknown to Quintanilla , Jr and Selena , the new head of Sony Music Latin and José Behar , who had recently launched EMI Latin Records , were attending the awards ceremony and were scouting for new Latin acts . Behar wanted to sign Selena to EMI 's label Capitol Records , while Sony Music Latin was offering Quintanilla , Jr. twice Capitol 's sum . Behar thought he had discovered the next Gloria Estefan , but his superior called Behar illogical since he had only been in Texas for a week . Quintanilla , Jr. chose EMI Latin 's offer because of the potential for a crossover , and he wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign with the company . 
 Before Selena signed her contract with EMI Latin in 1989 , Behar and Stephen Finfer requested Selena for an English @-@ language debut album . She was asked to make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman , chairman of EMI Records . After reviewing them , Koppelman declined a crossover attempt , believing Selena should first strengthen her fan base . In a 2007 interview , Behar spoke about the difficulty of recording Selena 's English @-@ language debut . He said EMI " had let all of us to believe that she would record in English , and it just wasn 't materializing for whatever reason " . Behar said the record company " didn 't believe , they didn 't think it could happen " , and continuously told Selena and her father " it wasn 't the right time " for an English @-@ language debut . 
 Selena signed a record deal with EMI subsidiary SBK Records in November 1993 , following her Grammy Award nomination for Live ( 1993 ) . The news of the singer 's record deal was front @-@ page news in Billboard magazine . In a 1994 meeting , Selena expressed her guilt to Behar ; Selena had told interviewers of her upcoming crossover album and told them the recording was expected to be release soon . At the time , Selena had not recorded a single song for her planned English @-@ language debut . Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English @-@ language album for Selena . Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin ; EMI relented and the recording sessions began . Selena said she felt intimidated by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and only a few people had believed she would achieve success in the pop market .

 According to Betty Cortina of People magazine , Dreaming of You marked a shift that abrogated the singer being marketed as part of her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in " the most fundamental way for her " . From 1989 , Selena 's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena 's principal music producer and songwriter , and remained so throughout her career . Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer 's follow @-@ up recording to Amor Prohibido ( 1994 ) , he could not produce the crossover album . He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best " fit with Selena 's style " . Dreaming of You was the first album Selena 's family did not produce . They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her . Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville , Tennessee , and met with Keith Thomas , who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called " I Could Fall in Love " but had not yet completed the vocal parts , so he sang it for them . Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it ; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album . Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin , Tennessee ; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals . Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24 , 1995 to finish recording the song . In a 2002 interview , Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of " I Could Fall in Love " and said she had the song " on loop " and she " must have heard it a hundred times " . He believed it had an " effect on her " because " she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [ Thomas ] was letting her do her thing and I mean it was an incredible thing to watch " . 
 EMI Records , which had more experience in the pop market , headed the project and allowed Selena to choose one song that she liked . Her sister and drummer of the band , Suzette Quintanilla , said in a 1997 interview that the singer carefully chose a song that represented what " Selena was all about " . She chose " Dreaming of You " , which was written by American songwriters Franne <unk> and Tom Snow in 1989 for American R & B group The Jets , who rejected it . According to Snow , <unk> " never gave up on the tune and eventually got it to Selena " . When Quintanilla III heard the demonstration recording , he told Selena he did not like the track . Selena told him she was going to record it because she favored its lyrical content and message . In a 2002 interview , Quintanilla III said he was " more judgmental " on his first impression of the demonstration recording than the song itself and cited its medley , content , and song structure for changing his mind . 
 Selena began recording " Dreaming of You " on March 5 , 1995 at Quintanilla , Jr . ' s recording label Q @-@ Productions in Corpus Christi , Texas . During the recording session , Selena was suffering from bronchitis . Her father asked her to " just try " and sing the song because several producers had arrived from Los Angeles to watch her record the track . After the recording session , the producers liked Selena 's vocal range in the song and decided to use her first take . American producer Guy Roche produced and arranged the piece along with " Captive Heart " . After the arrangement for " Dreaming of You " , Selena wanted Pérez to hear the finish product . He was unable to attend after Quintanilla , Jr. wanted him to work with a band he was interested in managing . In 2012 , Pérez wrote in his book about his and Selena 's relationship that he regretted not going to the recording session . 
 Selena recorded " God 's Child ( Baila Conmigo ) " , a duet with David Byrne that was included on the soundtrack of the comedy film Blue in the Face ( 1995 ) . Byrne said the song was the last recording Selena made before she was shot to death by Yolanda Saldívar , her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques , on March 31 , 1995 . Behar said promotion " will be on the superstar scale " and " [ we ] didn 't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy . We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed that this was going to be a huge album because of the music . This is a record that we 're going to work over the next 10 months . " EMI Records and EMI Latin put aside US $ 500 @,@ 000 ( $ 784 @,@ 000 2015 USD ) to complete Dreaming of You . " Oh No ( I 'll Never Fall in Love Again ) " , a song intended to be recorded for Dreaming of You , was released on the <unk> ( a free radio operated by Quintanilla , Jr . ) in September 2015 . Quintanilla , Jr. decided to release the demo version of the song after fans began requesting for it to be heard . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Dreaming of You is a <unk> work of American pop and Latin music . It incorporates the diverse stylistic influences of techno , hip @-@ hop , pop rock , dance @-@ pop , regional Mexican music , Tejano , R & B , disco , and flamenco music . The first half of the album comprises R & B and pop ballads , while the remainder contains Latin @-@ themed influences that profile Selena 's music career . Music journalists said producers who worked with Selena tried to caricature her with Paula Abdul , Amy Grant , Celine Dion , Whitney Houston , Mariah Carey , and Madonna . Newsweek magazine called Selena 's English @-@ language recordings " a blend of urban pop and Latin warmth " . According to Allmusic 's Stephen Erlewine , the album 's mood is spicy , celebratory , and exuberant . " I Could Fall in Love " and " Dreaming of You " are lyrically identical ; called " confessional ballads " , both recordings speak of despair , heartbreak , and fear of rejection from a man the songs ' narrators are falling in love with . The lyrics of " Dreaming of You " also explore feelings of longing and hope . Larry Flick of Billboard magazine wrote that " Dreaming of You " ' s idealistic lyrics have an " affecting poignancy that will not be lost on AC [ radio ] . " 
 " God 's Child ( Baila Conmigo ) " employs an off @-@ beat rhythm that is energetic , dark , mysterious , and its lyrics suggest subterfuge and counter @-@ hegemony . The song has elements of rumba , flamenco , rock , R & B , and Middle Eastern music . " Captive Heart " has 1980s funk ; Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune said it was intended for contemporary hit radio . The disco house track " I 'm Getting Used to You " , which makes use of cha @-@ cha , explores a volatile relationship . Mario Tarradell of The New London Day said " Captive Heart " and " I 'm Getting Used to You " border on new jack swing — a popular R & B subgenre pioneered by Jade and Mary J. Blige . The producers of the soundtrack of the 1995 romantic comedy @-@ drama film Don Juan DeMarco — in which Selena played a mariachi singer — decided not to include her recordings of " Tú Sólo Tú " and " El Toro Relajo " . Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said the producers who excluded the songs regretted this move following the impact of Selena 's death . According to Denise Segura and Patricia <unk> in their book Women and Migration in the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands : A Reader ( 2007 ) , " Tú Sólo Tú " — a Pedro Infante cover — and " El Toro Relajo " are about unrequited love and were recorded in a ranchera @-@ style . Selena recorded " Tú Sólo Tú " con ganas — a Spanish @-@ language aphorism that translates to a performer singing with " unapologetic emotionality " ; common among ranchera singers . 
 EMI Records , which wanted the 1992 track " Missing My Baby " and the 1994 single " Techno Cumbia " to be added to Dreaming of You , asked Quintanilla III to meet with R & B group Full Force in Manhattan . The group remixed both songs , added vocals to " Missing My Baby " , and remixed the latter in a reggae style . Quintanilla , Jr. decided to add " Como la Flor " ( 1992 ) , " Amor Prohibido " ( 1994 ) , and " Bidi Bidi Bom Bom " ( 1994 ) to Dreaming of You . He pitched the idea of remixing the songs as though the band was singing them in concert , changing their beats a little .

 Davitt Sigerson , the president and CEO of EMI records , feared " I Could Fall in Love " might sell more copies than Dreaming of You , so he did not issue the single as a commercial release . " I Could Fall in Love " was released promotionally to U.S. radio stations on June 26 , 1995 , at the same time as " Tú Sólo Tú " to demonstrate Selena 's change from recording in Spanish to English . Fred Bronson of Billboard magazine said if EMI Latin had released " I Could Fall in Love " as a single and it had debuted in the top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart , it would have been the first posthumous debut single to do so since " Pledging My Love " by Johnny Ace in 1955 . " I Could Fall in Love " peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart , and at number one on the U.S. Latin Pop Songs chart . " Tú Sólo Tú " and " I Could Fall in Love " occupied the first and second positions respectively on U.S. Hot Latin Tracks for five consecutive weeks . Selena thus became the first artist to have both a Spanish @-@ language and an English @-@ language song in the top ten of that chart . " I Could Fall in Love " became the fifth @-@ highest @-@ charting song on that chart in 1995 and remained the highest @-@ charting English @-@ language song for two years , until Celine Dion 's 1998 single " My Heart Will Go On " exceeded it when it peaked at number one . " Tú Sólo Tú " spent ten consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot Latin Tracks , becoming the most <unk> number @-@ one single of Selena 's musical career . With " Tú Sólo Tú " and her other chart @-@ topping singles from 1992 to her death in 1995 , Selena 's recordings spent 44 weeks at number one ; the most for any Hispanic artist as of 2011 . 
 On August 14 , 1995 , " Dreaming of You " was released as the album 's lead single , with the remix version and a radio edit of " Techno Cumbia " as the b @-@ side tracks . The single peaked at number twenty @-@ two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and sold 25 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of availability ; by 2010 it had sold 284 @,@ 000 digital units . " Dreaming of You " was the best @-@ selling single of Selena 's career ; in 2003 it was the eighty @-@ eighth best @-@ selling Hot 100 single of all @-@ time , according to Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan . The Los Angeles Times placed " Dreaming of You " at number five out of its top @-@ ten singles of 1995 . " Techno Cumbia " peaked at number four on the U.S. Hot Latin Tracks and the U.S. Regional Mexican Songs charts . On December 2 , 1995 , " El Toro Relajo " debuted and peaked at number twenty @-@ four on the U.S. Hot Latin Tracks . " I 'm Getting Used to You " , the second commercially released single and the sixth single overall , was released on March 2 , 1996 . It debuted and peaked at number seven on the U.S. Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and at number one on the U.S. Billboard Dance / Electronic Singles Sales chart . " I 'm Getting Used to You " later peaked at number twenty @-@ three on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Tracks chart on the week ending June 8 , 1996 . The Billboard critics poll ranked the remix version of " I 'm Getting Used to You " among their top ten singles of 1996 . 
 " I Could Fall in Love " , " Dreaming of You " , and " I 'm Getting Used to You " were less commercially successful outside the United States and Canada . " I Could Fall in Love " peaked at number one on the RPM Adult Contemporary Songs chart on the week ending November 6 , 1996 . " I Could Fall in Love " peaked at number five on the RPM Top 100 Singles chart . It was the only single by Selena to chart on the New Zealand Singles Chart , peaking at number ten . In 1996 , " Dreaming of You " performed better in Canada on the RPM Adult Contemporary and the Top 100 Singles chart , peaking at numbers seven and thirty , respectively . " I 'm Getting Used to You " debuted at number ninety @-@ six on the RPM Top 100 Singles chart on the week ending June 10 , 1996 , and became the third single by Selena to chart in Canada .

 The majority of contemporary reviews were positive . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said Dreaming of You was the first recording by Selena to have been heard by the general population of the United States because her death attracted American listeners to her album . This was echoed by Alisa Valdes of the Boston Globe . Erlewine said Amor Prohibido is " a more consistent release " and that Dreaming of You was not the singer 's best work , and he called it an introductory effort . According to Erlewine , the English @-@ language tracks on the album " are no different than her Spanish songs " ; he also said the album " would have been stronger " if the singer had lived . He finished his review by calling the album a " powerful — and touching — testament to her talents " . John Lannert of Billboard magazine called the album 's commercial success " hardly a fluke " . Vibe magazine contributor Ed Morales , described the album as a summation of her cumbia @-@ influenced songs , her Tex @-@ Mex ( Texas @-@ Mexico ) " excellence " , and a " poignant glimpse " of the path the singer 's musical career may have taken had she lived . Writing for Time magazine , David Browne said Dreaming of You 's release was " one of the quickest posthumous albums ever cobbled together " . He said the producers who worked with Selena on the album had decisively paired her with recordings that reminded him of lighter versions of Paula Abdul and called them " greeting @-@ card sentiments " . He recognized the later half of Dreaming of You as " the true , unbridled Selena " , calling them " traditional ballads or tropical fantasies , Selena evokes lust and passion " ; illustrating that those qualities found on her English @-@ language songs are absent from the Spanish @-@ language ones . 
 Writing for the Chicago Tribune , Achy Obejas called the recording a fragmentary work and said it is " Selena 's past and about what might have been " . Obejas called the record " full of promise and flaws " , and said its intentional bilingual nature was done by " necessity rather than design " . She also said the album is a Latino crossover nix , citing Gloria Estefan 's earlier mainstream work as the primitive Latino crossover ; although Selena " didn 't get to take the next step " as did Estefan . <unk> also wrote that the album is the opposite of a " masterpiece , or definitive , or even a testament to Selena 's talents " , but is more of a " smorgasbord " . <unk> praised Selena 's " complete ease on the R & B tunes " and thought she was " getting funky and pretty soulful " . Enrique Lopetegui of The Los Angeles Times said Dreaming of You is Selena 's " most electric and satisfying album " , and said it was an applicable " epitaph " for her . Lopetegui called the songs on the album " radio @-@ friendly pop tunes " but said the album " lacks cohesion " and that he finds the bilingual album " even more interesting than the original idea " . According to Lopetegui , Selena " blossoms into a full @-@ fledged soul singer , with an aggressiveness seldom show before " on her English @-@ language tracks but finds the rancheras " Tú Sólo Tú " and " El Toro Relajo " the " most impressive " and saying Selena was inexperienced with that style . Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said Dreaming of You elevated Selena 's music " to a far wider audience than she ever had when she was alive " . He said the album incorporates her " finest , most enjoyable work " and called it " a commendable but sorrowful accomplishment " . Contrasting her Tejano and English @-@ language songs , Farley wrote that Selena 's Tejano recordings was sometimes clumsy , whereas her English pop songs were " sweet , pure and clear , and on the mariachi numbers , Selena shows off a voice that is sexy , strong and gracefully maturing " . 
 Writing for the New York Daily News , Mary Talbot said listening to Dreaming of You was " akin to sifting through a dead woman 's scrapbook " and called it " disparate jottings and snapshots some artful , some light , all weighted with nostalgia " . Talbot said the album showcases " Selena 's past and outlines what could have been her future " , and because of the singer 's death , the story is incomplete . She called the English offerings " sturdy , generic pop numbers " that would be favored among her Tejano following " but there aren 't enough of them to prove her strength or breadth as an English @-@ language artist " . Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing " traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility , and that skill doesn 't figure with these songs " . Towards the end of her review , Talbot said Dreaming of You is " the effervescent pop of her generation " . Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album " doesn 't deliver " , writing that Selena was " revamped to sound like one of pop radio 's many generic female vocalist " and that her English recordings lack " the bubbly , effervescent personality , the <unk> @-@ del @-@ barrio charm " found on her Tejano songs . Tarradell said the English songs were " tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul " . Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You " a collection of leftovers " and said the Spanish @-@ language songs " sound better " than Selena 's English ones . Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena 's English @-@ language tracks and gave their all . He further wrote that " the music is faceless commerce " but that Selena recorded them " so well on the album " that it suggested " she had a good chance of success , working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered " . Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming of You as " a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star " . Catlin said her English @-@ language works were lacking " technical heroics that have defined [ Selena ] in the ' 90s . " but states the singer " is understandably assured " on her Spanish offerings . He said Selena was " low key " and that the material seemed that way because she had only recorded four English @-@ language tracks before her death .

It became the first and only Spanish @-@ language and Tejano recording to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart , and the first EMI Latin release to do so .
