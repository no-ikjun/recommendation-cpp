 The video begins with Stefani awaking by a car crash wearing a black and white , striped gown . After walking past a line of hanging clocks , and changing into a red kimono , she enters a pink salon where her friend and hair stylist , Danilo Dixon , greets her . Stefani proceeds to read a fake tabloid magazine with the headline announcing " Gwen Pregnant with Alien Baby ! " , referencing then recent rumors of a pregnancy with boyfriend Blake Shelton . The next scene shows Stefani wearing a sequined blazer as she walks behind two male breakdancers . As the song 's bridge plays , Stefani stumbles upon a dark room with five dancers wearing masks with her head on them . As she pushes two of them over , she changes into a multi @-@ colored poncho and rides a motorcycle with other women wearing apparel from her clothing line , L.A.M.B .. 
 When the chorus is played for the third time , Stefani changes into a long , white skirt and walks into a lounge named " Blake 's " , where she is served by a bartender played by social media star Todrick Hall . Stefani is then shown singing the song behind a piano as the video crew helps her put on a pair of roller skates . After inline skating in a black leotard , a stunt double appears and performs a " fake " tumble . The final scene shows Stefani , wearing a rose @-@ inspired red dress , on an elevating platform mouthing the words : " Thank God . Thank God that I 've found you " , before the camera zooms out to display the Target logo .

 Writing for TIME , Nolan Feeney stated : " Stefani wasn 't scheduled to perform during the Grammys , but she may have just delivered one of the evening 's most colorful performances anyway " . Sierra <unk> of Us Weekly also gave a positive review of the video , claiming that : " the No Doubt frontwoman teamed up with Target to pull off the near impossible " . After the initial broadcast of the video , several critics mistakenly thought the fake ' tumble ' during the rollerblading scene was real .

 Original Stories from Real Life ; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections , and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness is the only complete work of children 's literature by the 18th @-@ century English feminist Mary Wollstonecraft . Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason , followed by a series of didactic tales . The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788 ; a second , illustrated edition , with engravings by William Blake , was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century . 
 In Original Stories , Wollstonecraft employed the then @-@ burgeoning genre of children 's literature to promote the education of women and an emerging middle @-@ class ideology . She argued that women would be able to become rational adults if they were educated properly as children , which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century , and contended that the nascent middle @-@ class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor . Wollstonecraft , in developing her own pedagogy , also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century : John Locke and Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau . 
 = = Historical and biographical context = = 
 Wollstonecraft 's oeuvre shows " a keen and vital concern with education , especially the education of girls and women " . One year before she published Original Stories , she wrote a conduct book ( a popular 18th @-@ century genre , akin to the modern self @-@ help book ) entitled Thoughts on the Education of Daughters ( 1787 ) , which describes how to raise the ideal middle @-@ class woman . In 1789 , she assembled The Female Speaker , a text meant to edify the minds of young women by exposing them to literature ; she modelled it after William Enfield 's anthology The Speaker , which was designed specifically for men . Just one year later , she translated Christian Gotthilf Salzmann 's Elements of Morality , a popular German pedagogical text . Wollstonecraft continued writing on educational issues in her most famous work , A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) , which is largely a defence of female education . She also devotes an entire chapter to outlining a national education plan — she envisioned a half @-@ public , half @-@ private , co @-@ educational system . She also directly challenged Rousseau 's Emile ( 1762 ) , which claimed that women should not be taught to reason since they were formed for men 's pleasure and that their abilities lay in observation rather than reason . When Wollstonecraft died in 1797 , she was working on two more educational works : " Management of Infants " , a parenting manual ; and " Lessons " , a reading primer inspired by Anna Laetitia Barbauld 's Lessons for Children ( 1778 – 79 ) . 
 Wollstonecraft was not alone in focusing her revolutionary writings on education ; as Alan Richardson , a scholar of the period , points out , " most liberal and radical intellectuals of the time viewed education as the cornerstone of any movement for social reform " . One reason these thinkers emphasized the training of the young mind was the pervasive acceptance during the 18th century of Locke 's theory of mind . He posited that the mind is a " blank slate " or tabula rasa , free from innate ideas , and that because children enter the world without preconceived notions ; whatever ideas they absorb early in life will fundamentally affect their later development . Locke explained this process through a theory he labelled the association of ideas ; the ideas that children connect , such as fear and darkness , are stronger than those ideas adults associate , therefore instructors , according to Locke , must carefully consider what they expose children to early in life . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Modelled on Madame de Genlis 's Adèle et Théodore ( 1782 ) and Tales of the Castle ( 1785 ) , both of which have frame stories and a series of inset moral tales , Original Stories narrates the re @-@ education of two young girls , fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Mary and twelve @-@ year @-@ old Caroline , by a wise and benevolent maternal figure , Mrs. Mason . ( Wollstonecraft probably named these characters after people in her own life . She became acquainted with a Miss Mason while teaching in Newington Green , whom she greatly respected , and she taught two girls named Mary and Caroline while she was a governess for the Kingsborough family in Ireland . Margaret King , who was greatly affected by her governess , saying she " had freed her mind from all superstitions , later adopted " Mrs Mason " as a pseudonym . ) After the death of their mother , the girls are sent to live with Mrs. Mason in the country . They are full of faults , such as greediness and vanity , and Mrs. Mason , through stories , real @-@ world demonstrations , and her own example , cures the girls of most of their moral failings and imbues them with a desire to be virtuous . 
 Mrs. Mason 's amalgam of tales and teaching excursions dominates the text ; although the text emphasizes the girls ' moral progress , the reader learns very little about the girls themselves . The work consists largely of personal histories of people known to Mrs. Mason and of moral tales for the edification of Mary and Caroline and the reader . For example , " The History of Charles Townley " illustrates the fatal consequences of procrastination . Mrs. Mason takes the girls to Charles Townley 's ruined mansion to tell them the cautionary tale of a " boy of uncommon abilities , and strong feelings " ; unfortunately , " he ever permitted those feelings to direct his conduct , without submitting to the direction of reason ; I mean , the present emotion governed him ... He always indeed intended to act right in every particular to @-@ morrow ; but to @-@ day he followed the prevailing whim " ( emphasis Wollstonecraft 's ) . Charles wants to help those in need , but he is easily distracted by novels and plays . He eventually loses all of his money but his one remaining friend helps him regain his fortune in India . Yet even when this friend needs assistance , Charles cannot act quickly enough and , tragically , his friend is imprisoned and dies and his friend 's daughter is forced to marry a rake . When Charles returns to England , he is overcome with guilt . He rescues the daughter from her unhappy marriage , but both she and he have gone slightly insane by the end of the story , she from her marriage and he from guilt . 
 Original Stories is primarily about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind and becoming a rational and charitable adult ; it does not romanticise childhood as an innocent and ideal state of being . The inset stories themselves emphasise the balance of reason and emotion required for the girls to become mature , a theme that permeates Wollstonecraft 's works , particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . 
 = = Literary analysis = = 
 Original Stories gained a reputation in the 20th century as an oppressively didactic book and was derided by early scholars of children ’ s literature such as Geoffrey Summerfield . Recent scholars , particularly Mitzi Myers , have re @-@ evaluated Wollstonecraft ’ s book and 18th @-@ century children ’ s literature in general , assessing it within its historical context rather than judging it according to modern tastes . Myers suggests , in her series of seminal articles , that women writers of children ’ s literature such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Maria Edgeworth were not only using the genre of children ’ s literature to teach but also to promote visions of society distinct from those of the Romantics . These authors believed that they could effect great change by exposing young children to their ideas of a better society , even though they were " only " writing stories about seemingly insignificant topics such as small animals or little girls . Myers argues that because scholars have traditionally paid more attention to Romantic poetry and prose ( the works of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley , for example ) than to children ’ s literature , they have missed the social critique that these women writers of children ’ s literature were offering . 
 = = = Pedagogical theory = = = 
 The two most influential pedagogical works in 18th @-@ century Europe were John Locke 's Some Thoughts Concerning Education ( 1693 ) and Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau 's Emile . In Original Stories and her other works on education , Wollstonecraft responds to these two works and counters with her own pedagogical theory . 
 Wollstonecraft follows Locke in emphasising the role of the senses in learning ; for her , as Myers writes , " ideally , children should learn not from direct teaching but from living examples apprehended through the senses . " Wollstonecraft ’ s Mrs. Mason takes Mary and Caroline out into the world in order to instruct them — their very first lesson is a nature walk that teaches them not to torture but rather to respect animals as part of God 's creation . Mrs. Mason uses the experiences of everyday life as a teaching tool because they are grounded in concrete realities and easily absorbed through the senses ; she will seize on " a bad habit , a passerby , a visit , a natural scene , a holiday festivity " and then apply them to a moral lesson that she wants to inculcate into her pupils . Mrs. Mason also tells Mary and Caroline the unfortunate or tragic histories of people she has known , such as that of Jane <unk> , who died because of her bad behaviour ; Jane was an angry and selfish little girl and eventually her anger affected her health and killed her . Her misbehaviour " broke her mother 's heart " and " hastened her death " ; Jane 's guilt over this event and : 
 her peevish temper , preyed on her impaired constitution . She had not , by doing good , prepared her soul for another state , or cherished any hopes that could disarm death of its terrors , or render that last sleep sweet — its approach was dreadful ! — and she hastened her end , scolding the physician for not curing her . Her lifeless countenance displayed the marks of convulsive anger ; and she left an ample fortune behind her to those who did not regret her loss . They followed her to the grave on which no one shed a tear . She was soon forgotten ; and I [ says Mrs. Mason ] only remember her , to warn you to shun her errors . 
 Mrs. Mason also takes her charges to visit models of virtue , such as Mrs. Trueman , who , though poor , still manages to be charitable and a comfort to her family . At the end of one visit , Mrs. Mason reminds the girls that Mrs. Trueman " loves truth , and she is ever exercising benevolence and love — from the insect , that she avoids treading on , her affection may be traced to that Being who lives for ever . — And it is from her goodness her agreeable qualities spring . " Wollstonecraft also adheres to the Lockean conception of the mind as a " blank slate " : in Original Stories , Mrs. Mason describes her own mind using these same terms . 
 Wollstonecraft was not as receptive to Rousseau ’ s ideas as she was to Locke ’ s ; she appropriated the aesthetic of the sublime to challenge Rousseau 's ideas regarding the education of women ( discussed in more detail below ) . During the 18th century , " the sublime " was associated with awe , fear , strength and masculinity . As Myers writes , " to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within , Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength , force , and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness , delicacy , and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood " . Unlike writers such as Rousseau and Burke , who portray women as innately weak and silly , Wollstonecraft argues that women can indeed achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime . 
 Although Wollstonecraft disagreed with much of Rousseau ’ s fundamental philosophy , she did agree with many of his educational methods , including his emphasis on teaching through example and experience rather than through precept . In this , she was following children ’ s writers such as Thomas Day who , in his popular The History of Sandford and Merton ( 1783 – 89 ) , also emphasised learning by experience rather than by rote and rules . Gary Kelly , in his book on Wollstonecraft 's thought , explains how this idea and others important to Wollstonecraft are reflected in the title to her work — Original Stories from Real Life ; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections , and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness : 
 The first part of the title indicates that the ‘ stories ’ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic , quotidian life , though readers would understand ‘ from real life ’ to mean ‘ based on ’ or ‘ adapted from real ‘ life ’ , and not necessarily ‘ representation of actual events ’ . The ‘ stories ’ are ‘ original ’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘ fairy tales ’ . The phrase ‘ real life ’ strengthens ‘ original ’ , excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary . ‘ Conversations ’ suggests familiar , familial discourse rather than formal moralising . ‘ Calculated ’ suggests a programme rationally determined . These ‘ conversations ’ and ‘ stories ’ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way , by regulating ‘ the affections ’ or emotional self and forming ‘ the mind ’ or rational and moral self ‘ to truth and goodness ’ – understood in terms of professional middle @-@ class culture . 
 As Richardson explains , in Original Stories adulthood is defined by the ability to discipline oneself by " constructing moral tales " out of one ’ s life . Wollstonecraft 's extensive use of inset tales encourages her readers to construct a moral narrative out of their own lives , with a predetermined ending . At the end of the book , Mary and Caroline no longer require a teacher because they have learnt the storylines which Mrs. Mason has taught them — they know the stories that they are supposed to enact . 
 = = = Gender = = = 
 As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman , Wollstonecraft does not highlight the differences between men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories . Moreover , she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes . Traditionally , as Kelly explains , virtue was tied to femininity and chastity , but Wollstonecraft ’ s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self @-@ control . Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason ’ s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau , who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender . 
 But it was against Rousseau 's depiction of femininity and female education that Wollstonecraft was most vigorously reacting in Original Stories . Rousseau argued in Emile that women were naturally cunning and manipulative , but he viewed these traits positively : 
 [ G ] <unk> is a natural talent with the fair sex , and since I am persuaded that all the natural inclinations are good and right in themselves , I am of the opinion that this one should be cultivated like the others ... This peculiar cleverness given to the fair sex is a very equitable compensation for their lesser share of strength , a compensation without which women would be not man ’ s companion but his slave . It is by means of this superiority in talent that she keeps herself his equal and that she governs him while obeying him ... She has in her favor only her art and her beauty . 
 For Rousseau , women possessed " guile " and " beauty " that allowed them to control men while men possessed " strength " and " reason " that allowed them to control women . In contrast to Rousseau 's presentation of Sophie , the fictional figure he employs in Book V of Emile to represent the ideal woman , who is enamoured of her own image in a mirror and who falls in love with a character in a novel , Wollstonecraft depicts Mrs. Mason as a rational and sincere teacher who attempts to pass those traits on to Mary and Caroline . 
 = = = Class = = = 
 Original Stories encourages its readers to develop what were at the time coming to be labelled middle @-@ class values : industry , self @-@ discipline , economy , and charity . As Andrew O ’ Malley points out in his analysis of 18th @-@ century children ’ s books , " middle @-@ class writers wanted children to associate happiness with morality and social utility instead " of " the trappings of wealth and status " . The end of the 18th century saw the development of what is now referred to as the " middle @-@ class ethos " , and " children ’ s literature became one of the crucial mechanisms for disseminating and consolidating middle @-@ class ideology " throughout British and American society . Works by children ’ s writers such as Anna Laetitia Barbauld , Ellenor Fenn , Sarah Trimmer , and Dorothy Kilner all embrace this ethos , although they differ radically in their opinions on other political issues , such as the French Revolution . 
 One way that writers such as Wollstonecraft helped to shape the new genre of children 's literature at the end of the 18th century was by attempting to remove its chapbook and fairy tale associations and replace them with a middle @-@ class ideology . Many of these writers considered chapbooks and fairy tales to be associated with the poor and the rich , respectively . As Kelly explains , " traditional chapbook literature embodies a lottery mentality of carpe diem , belief in fortune , wish for lucky gifts ( such as great strength , cleverness or beauty ) , a view of time as cyclical or repetitive and an avid interest in predicting the future . " In contrast , 18th @-@ century children 's literature " embodies an investment mentality . This meant saving for the future , ‘ proper ’ distribution of personal resources , avoiding extravagance , conceiving of time and one ’ s own life as cumulative and progressive , and valuing self @-@ discipline and personal development for a better future under one ’ s own control . " Sarah Trimmer , for example , contends in her Guardian of Education , the first successful periodical dedicated to reviewing children ’ s books , that children should not read fairy tales precisely because they will lead to slothfulness and superstition . 
 = = = Illustrations = = = 
 William Blake , who often did illustrative work for Wollstonecraft 's publisher Joseph Johnson , was engaged to design and engrave six plates for the second edition of Original Stories . Blake scholars tend to read these plates as challenges to Wollstonecraft ’ s text . For example , Orm Mitchell , basing his interpretation on Blake 's personal mythology ( which is elaborated in his other works ) argues that in the frontispiece to the work : 
 The two girls gaze out wistfully from beneath the outstretched arms of Mrs. Mason . The hats that the children wear are drawn in such a way that they form halos around their heads , a touch Blake also uses in Songs of Innocence and of Experience to indicate the innate and divine visionary capacity of the child ( see for example " The <unk> Green " and " The Little [ B ] <unk> Found " ) . The children ’ s eyes are open – they are looking at what a fine morning it is and longing to take part in it . They cannot participate , however , for they are under the suffocating influence of Mrs. Mason . In contrast to the children ’ s halo @-@ like hats Mrs. Mason wears a large <unk> bonnet . Her eyes are downcast to such an extent that they appear to be shut . Blake often draws Urizen 's eyes in this way to signify the blindness of his rational and materialist ‘ Single vision . ’ See for example plates 1 , 9 and 22 of The Book of Urizen and plate 11 of For Children : The Gates of Paradise where <unk> ' Aged Ignorance , ’ wearing large spectacles , blindly clips the wings of a child thus preventing its imaginative flight in the morning sunrise . Ironically then , Mrs. Mason is the only individual in the illustration who is not seeing what a fine morning it is . She looks down at the hard factual earth , ignoring the infinite and holy life around her . ( emphasis Mitchell 's ) 
 Myers , in contrast , relying on a more traditional art historical interpretation of the image , reads it more positively . She agrees that the children 's hats resemble halos but she identifies Mrs. Mason 's position as one of a " protective cruciform " , evoking a " heroic , even <unk> ... female <unk> tradition " . Myers views Mrs. Mason as a sacrificial hero rather than as an oppressive adult who cannot see the glories of nature . 
 = = Publication and reception history = = 
 Original Stories was first published anonymously in 1788 , the same year as Wollstonecraft 's first novel Mary : A Fiction , and cost two shillings . When the second edition came out in 1791 , Wollstonecraft ’ s name was printed on the title page ; after the publication in 1790 of her Vindication of the Rights of Men , she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales . Joseph Johnson , the publisher of Original Stories and all of Wollstonecraft 's other works , commissioned William Blake to design six illustrations for the second edition , which cost two shillings and six pence . It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print . According to Gary Kelly , a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar , the last edition of Original Stories was published in 1820 , but without Wollstonecraft ’ s name on the title page ; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband , William Godwin , had revealed her unorthodox lifestyle in his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1798 ) . According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the Masterworks of Children 's Literature series , Original Stories was published until 1835 . It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795 . 
 By the time C. M. <unk> , a librarian for the Hartford Library Association who wrote children 's books herself , wrote a " History of Children 's Books " in The Atlantic Monthly in 1888 , Original Stories was more famous for its plates by Blake than it was for its text by Wollstonecraft . The bulk of the article 's discussion is dedicated to Blake , although , strangely enough , not to his work on Original Stories . <unk> does mention that the book was " new and in demand in the autumn of that year [ 1791 ] , [ but is ] now unknown to the bookstalls " . Original Stories is now primarily reprinted for scholars , students , and those interested in the history of children 's literature .

 " Sometimes a Great Notion " is the thirteenth episode in the fourth season of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica . It aired on television on SCI FI and Space in the United States and Canada respectively on January 16 , 2009 and on Sky One in the United Kingdom on January 20 , 2009 . This episode is the first after the mid @-@ season finale of the fourth season ( " Revelations " ) , which aired on June 2008 . The episode title is a reference to the novel of the same name , written by Ken Kesey . The episode was also the last to be written before the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . It received a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 6 and was received positively throughout . 
 The episode continues from " Revelations " , where both the colonial fleet and the rebel Cylons finally found Earth , only to find it devastated by a nuclear holocaust at least 2 @,@ 000 years before , and the discovery leads to despair all across the fleet . The episode was not given an opening title sequence , but the survivor count for the episode was 39 @,@ 651 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Both the Human fleet and the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust , which occurred at least 2 @,@ 000 years prior to the events of the episode . After research on the bodies found in the soil , the Cylons and Dr. Baltar ( James Callis ) conclude the remains are not Human , but Cylon in origin . The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs , but are of a kind unknown to them . Following this , they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2 @,@ 000 years ago and moved out from <unk> to populate Earth . When addressing the fleet , Admiral Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) never states this fact , leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human . Meanwhile , Samuel Anders ( Michael Trucco ) , Galen Tyrol ( Aaron Douglas ) and Tory Foster ( Rekha Sharma ) receive memories of their lives on Earth 2 @,@ 000 years ago . Kara Thrace ( Katee Sackhoff ) has Leoben ( Callum Keith Rennie ) help track the origins of the beacon . However , what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper , containing a corpse with Starbuck 's dog tags . After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her , Leoben becomes scared and retreats , with Thrace wondering what she is . In shock , Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre , and decides to not tell anyone about what she found , making people believe she lost the signal . 
 In the fleet , President Roslin ( Mary McDonnell ) burns her book of Pythia , and is unable to address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere , and believing the prophecy is a lost cause . Lee Adama ( Jamie Bamber ) and Anastasia Dualla ( Kandyse McClure ) revisit their relationship , and after their evening together , Dualla returns to her quarters , and commits suicide . Devastated by this , Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and attempts to coerce Tigh ( Michael Hogan ) into killing him , which fails . Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories , and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet . Adama eventually steps back into the CIC , and makes an announcement that he will find a home for the fleet , gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems , and invites their new Cylon allies to join them . As the fleet prepares to leave Earth , D 'Anna ( Lucy Lawless ) , devastated by the knowledge that history repeats itself endlessly , decides to remain on Earth to die , rather than being hunted by Cavil . Tigh walks into the sea and receives a flashback of his life on Earth ; He realizes that his wife , Ellen ( Kate Vernon ) , is the last of the Final Five Cylons . In the vision , a dying Ellen tells Tigh that " everything is in place " and that they will be " reborn , again , together " . They are then destroyed in this vision by a nuclear blast .

 This episode was written back @-@ to @-@ back with the Season 4 @.@ 0 episode , " Revelations . " According to co @-@ writer David Weddle , the title of episode was chosen as co @-@ writers David Weddle and Bradley Thompson outlined their story for the producers . The title is taken from the Ken Kesey novel , Sometimes a Great Notion . The book is one of Weddle 's favorites . While writing the novel , Kesey made notes in which he urged himself to make the novel 's protagonist quit living , and this became the theme of this episode as well . Weddle stated that he and the other writers were inspired by the idea of taking a strong , heroic character and piling misfortunes on him or her until finally the character breaks : 
 What happens in that moment ? Does he despair ? Does he get up and go on ? For me , there is no more defining moment for a character . We tried to do this with almost all the characters in this episode : [ Adama ] , Laura , Kara , Lee . We ripped everything out from under them then sat back to see what they would do . What were their individual breaking points ? And if they did break , would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery ? 
 The " fox in the river " story told by Admiral Adama comes from the novel , and also from real @-@ life incidents with wildlife swimming out to sea near Weddle 's home in Malibu , California . 
 The decision to have Lt. Dualla commit suicide in this episode was made after the writing staff felt there had to be fallout from discovering that Earth was a nuclear ruin . Moore explained : 
 There had to be a cost . There had to be a price somebody paid for that discovery . Not everybody could take that . Not everyone could just say , " OK , that didn 't work out , let 's go on to next week 's episode . " It felt like somebody would just say , " No , I 'm done . I just want to find a little moment of time where I can feel good about myself one last time , then I 'm finished with this long nightmare . " And that seemed like that would be Dualla . 
 Dualla fit this best because she had lost two men whom she loved , and all she had left was the hope of finding Earth . Moore also came up with the idea that Dualla 's suicide was actually an act of hope and control , not despair . 
 Although the network had concerns that the script was too depressing , Moore successfully defended the writing by saying that it might be the last episode of the series and that viewers who had stuck with the show for three and a half seasons would not be put off by yet another " dark " episode . Writers Weddle and Thompson considered giving the characters some leeway in interpreting what they had found . Among the options debated were giving the fleet some hope that Earth might be some other planet , allowing a character to discover a new part of the Prophecy of Pythia , giving one of the characters a vision of an Earth @-@ like planet , and placing a clue in the ruins that would direct the fleet to yet another planet . All were rejected . 
 Weddle and Thompson also worked extensively on the scene in which Admiral Adama tries to provoke Col. Tigh into killing him . Moore encouraged Weddle and Thompson to give the Adama character progressively crueler lines . The writers were the ones who inserted the line in the script in which Adama mentions Ellen Tigh 's sexual infidelity . On the set , however , actor Edward James Olmos changed the line from Adama saying Ellen wanted a man with " real blood in his veins " to " main vein , " then ad @-@ libbed the line in which the character said , " I could smell her . " The scenes where Dualla finds the set of jacks and where Laura Roslin holds the plant cutting were added by director Michael Nankin . Weddle notes that although Nankin usually peppers his writers with script notes , he did not do so for this script . 
 Cost estimates indicated that the script , as originally written , would be $ 300 @,@ 000 over budget ( about two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times what the studio would have permitted ) and a number of scenes were cut . An extensive opening segment which would have depicted the destruction of Earth was changed to the filmed segment in which Tyrol sees a flash of light and his shadow is left on a wall . However , Nankin restored the scene in which Helo , Dualla , Adama and Roslin ride back to Galactica in the Raptor .

 According to showrunner Ronald D. Moore , the concept of Ellen and Saul Tigh 's relationship being more than an average husband @-@ and @-@ wife relationship went back to the pilot mini @-@ series for Battlestar Galactica but was not made part of the story arc for the two characters until the middle of Season 3 . As writing progressed on the episode " Torn , " the writing staff needed to explain why Baltar would not see all 12 Cylon models aboard the base star . Moore came up with the concept of five Cylon models that had yet to be revealed . Later , during writing sessions for the episode " Rapture , " D 'Anna <unk> has a vision in which she confronts the Final Five Cylons in the opera house , and apologizes to one of them . Although Moore and the writing team had yet to formally settle on Ellen Tigh as one of the Final Five , Moore says it was his intention for the Cylon to be Ellen . When one of the final four Cylons was revealed to be Saul Tigh in the episode " Crossroads , " Moore finally decided to make Ellen the fifth Cylon because " Tigh being revealed as a Cylon was such a profound shift in that character , such a big leap for the show , that it felt really natural that she was also a Cylon . " 
 A clue to the final Cylon 's identity was inserted into several episodes , when Col. Tigh sees Ellen 's face on the Number Six model . Moore 's decision was revealed to the writing team at series writers ' conference which occurred between Season 3 and Season 4 . Other characters were considered as the final Cylon model , but the writing staff agreed none had the same resonance as Ellen Tigh . The decision to reveal Ellen Tigh 's true identity in " Sometimes A Great Notion " was made because Moore did not want Season 4 @.@ 5 to devolve into a guessing game about who the final Cylon might be , and because he wanted the final episode of the series to be about issues other than who the final Cylon was .

 The script for " Sometimes A Great Notion " was the only script finished by the time the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike began . Revised script pages were turned in the day before the strike . Moore decided that the crew should proceed as if shooting would be green @-@ lit , and flew to Vancouver , British Columbia , to speak to the cast and crew before the strike began . The strike proved so vexing that the studio did not give approval for shooting to occur until the night before it was to begin . 
 The cast and crew were very emotional during filming , as they were concerned that this might be the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one . Olmos helped to work up the cast 's emotions for the shoot by telling everyone that the show was ending . According to co @-@ writer Weddle , Olmos repeatedly told the cast , " This is the end , I think we all feel that . They 're not going to bring the show back . They 'll pull the sets down . We 'll never shoot another episode . " Actress Kandyse McClure improvised the lullaby her character hums before committing suicide , and series composer Bear McCreary used the melody for part of the episode 's musical soundtrack .

 The producers intended for this episode to be the last to star Lucy Lawless , who portrayed Number Three . They only had Lawless for one day during the filming of the episode . Most of the Earth scenes were shot on and around Centennial Beach , in <unk> , British Columbia . Two days before the shoot much of the location set was destroyed by a rain storm with 90 kilometres per hour ( 56 mph ) winds , but the art department crew repaired it in time for the shoot to occur on schedule . 
 The final shots for the episode " Revelations " were filmed in the three hours immediately preceding the shooting of the beach scenes for " Sometimes A Great Notion . " Director Michael Rymer , who helmed " Revelations , " and Nankin agreed that all Earth sequences should be reminiscent of the work of film director Ingmar Bergman , so wide camera lenses were used , the color was desaturated , and long rather than short takes were used . 
 The scene in which Adama goads Tigh was scheduled to last a day . Originally the segment was to be shot in small bits and flashbacks edited between each line , but the scene was instead shot as one long take . Actors Olmos and Michael Hogan struggled for several hours to find the right emotional tone . Moore said that the audience should accept the irradiated planet as Earth . " They have found Earth . This is the Earth that the 13th Colony discovered , they christened it Earth . They found Earth . "

 Eric Goldman of IGN gave " Sometimes a Great Notion " an " incredible " rating of 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 . The reviewer quoted the episode as " stronger and sadder than ever , " and was executed " extremely well . " Goldman felt that the episode did not back down from the deeply powerful storylines from the past , and praised the emotions of the fleet after finding Earth in ruins . The Guardian received the episode positively , stating how many events happened during the course of the episode , and felt that the episode played fair with its audience , despite the number of new questions being addressed . It was anticipated that Dualla would play a big part in the episode after her appearance from the cold open . Her suicide was compared with Boomer shooting Adama in the closing scene of season 1 in a dramatical sense . The Guardian also praised the performance between Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell 's characters , as well as the standoff between Adama and Tigh . 
 Matt Norris of Cinema Blend stated that most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected , including Dualla 's suicide , Starbuck finding her own supposed body , discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons , and that Ellen Tigh is the final model , but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run . Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode , but criticised the writers ' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon . While Dualla 's suicide was surprising for Bernardin , he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide , stating it as " some of Olmos ' worst acting in the series " , and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions , but felt the episode was good overall . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger commented : " What really grabs me about the show ( as I discussed in today 's column ) is its humanity , the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real , contemporary people might " and felt that " as the stakes for the characters has risen , so has the intensity of [ the actors ' ] performances , " with even the extras in character . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin 's directing , particularly " the moment in which we see Kara Thrace , silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky , preparing to burn “ her ” body — that ’ s sent a shiver down my spine . That was just such a beautifully operatic image , spot @-@ on in tone and perfectly executed . "

 = Calvatia craniiformis = 
 Calvatia craniiformis , commonly known as the brain puffball or the skull @-@ shaped puffball , is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae . It is found in Asia , Australia , and North America , where it grows on the ground in open woods . Its name , derived from the same Latin root as cranium , alludes to its resemblance to an animal 's brain . The skull @-@ shaped fruit body is 8 – 20 cm ( 3 – 8 in ) broad by 6 – 20 cm ( 2 – 8 in ) tall and white to tan . Initially smooth , the skin ( peridium ) develops wrinkles and folds as it matures , cracking and flaking with age . The peridium eventually sloughs away , exposing a powdery yellow @-@ brown to greenish @-@ yellow spore mass ( the gleba ) . The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm , before it matures to become yellow @-@ brown and powdery . Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China , Japan , and the Ojibwe as a hemostatic or wound dressing agent . Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described as Bovista craniiformis by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1832 . Elias Fries transferred it to the then newly circumscribed genus Calvatia in 1849 , setting Calvatia craniiformis as the type and only species . Scott Bates and colleagues suggest that the name is synonymous with Lycoperdon <unk> published by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873 ( not the L. <unk> published by Berkeley in 1854 ) , as is Lycoperdon <unk> published by William Trelease in 1891 . The form C. craniiformis f. gardneri , published by <unk> Kobayasi in 1932 ( originally Lycoperdon gardneri Berk . 1875 ) , since been elevated to the distinct species Calvatia gardneri . 
 In their 1962 monograph on North American Calvatia , mycologists Sanford Myron Zeller and Alexander H. Smith set C. craniiformis as the type species of the stirps ( a grouping of related species ) <unk> , containing species with a large sterile base and a persistent cottony gleba . Other species they included in this stirps were C. <unk> , C. <unk> , C. lycoperdoides , C. <unk> , C. <unk> , C. <unk> ( since transferred by some authorities to Handkea ) , and C. elata . 
 Calvatia craniiformis is commonly known as the " brain @-@ shaped puffball " or the " skull @-@ shaped puffball " . The specific epithet craniiformis derives from the Ancient Greek words <unk> , meaning " brain " , and forma , " a form " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Calvatia craniiformis grow to dimensions of 6 – 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) tall by 8 – 20 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) wide , and have a form ranging from pear @-@ shaped , to flattened @-@ spherical , to obovate ( roughly egg @-@ shaped ) , to tunicate ( like an inverted cone ) . At the bottom is a thick , often crumpled base attached to a cord @-@ like rhizomorph , which is often encrusted with surrounding soil . The rhizomorphs are well developed , and when cut into longitudinal section , reveal three distinct tissues : an outer cortex , a subcortical layer , and a central core . The thin and fragile exoperidium ( the outer layer of " skin " ) is whitish @-@ gray to gray , and initially smooth before becoming areolate ( divided by cracks into discrete areas ) . The base extends up one @-@ third to one @-@ half way into the puffball ( where it becomes the <unk> ) tapering to a point . The gleba is initially whitish , and then yellow @-@ green , and finally brownish @-@ green in older specimens with mature spores . 
 Spores are spherical , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 4 μm in diameter . They are thick @-@ walled with a short pedicel ( a <unk> extension ) , and are ornamented with tiny spines ( verrucae ) that are roughly equidistant from each other . <unk> threads are long , hyaline , and branched , measuring 2 @.@ 4 – 4 μm thick . They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls . The exoperidium comprises thick @-@ walled , inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts ( spherical cells ) , while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven , thick @-@ walled hyphae . In the rhizomorphs , the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick as those in the surrounding <unk> . 
 Using light microscopy , the spores of Calvatia craniiformis are generally indistinguishable from those of C. <unk> and C. gigantea ; electron microscopy reveals that each has distinctive spore ornamentation . C. craniiformis features small , well @-@ separated verrucae ( <unk> projections ) up to 0 @.@ 2 μm tall with rounded tips . In comparison , C. gigantea has larger verrucae ( up to 0 @.@ 4 μm tall ) that are more irregularly arranged . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Fruit bodies arise from the tips or the lateral branches or rhizomorphs . New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae similar to those found in the rhizomorph core ; in contrast , the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball 's core . Unlike some other puffball species , the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium ; rather , the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma ( a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma ) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved . In time , the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The brain @-@ like surface folds and mature olive @-@ brown gleba are characteristic of Calvatia craniiformis , but younger puffballs that have not yet developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species . Another edible puffball , C. cyathiformis ( lilac puffball ) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple @-@ brown when mature . Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba . C. bicolor is a smaller , rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C. craniiformis , but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores , and lacks a distinct <unk> . Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C. craniiformis , but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive @-@ brown gleba , and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Calvatia craniiformis is an edible species . Young puffballs with a firm , white gleba have a mild odor and pleasant taste . Early 20th @-@ century mycologist Charles McIlvaine noted over a century ago that " the slightest change to yellow makes it bitter . " <unk> in cooking , the puffball absorbs flavors well . 
 In the United States , the Ojibwe used the powdery gleba as a hemostatic agent to staunch the flow of nosebleeds : the spore powder was inhaled through the nostrils . It is now known that this practice can lead to the pulmonary disease <unk> , which causes symptoms similar to pneumonia . It is also used as a hemostatic agent in Chinese and Japanese folk medicines . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Although Calvatia craniiformis is generally considered a saprobic species , in controlled laboratory conditions , an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum ( <unk> <unk> ) was reported in a 1966 publication . A Chinese study showed that C. <unk> would readily form mycorrhiza with poplar seedlings on unsterilized , but not on sterilized soil . Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C. craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa . Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods , hardwood forests , and wet areas . In Asia , it has been recorded from China , India , Indonesia , Japan , Malaysia , and South Korea . The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia . In North America , its range includes the eastern and southern United States , and Mexico . In Michigan , it is one of the few macrofungi found regularly in black locust plantations . Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species of flies .

 The storyline surrounding the WWF World Heavyweight Championship began at the 1994 Royal Rumble when the final two wrestlers , Lex Luger and Bret Hart , simultaneously eliminated each other . After a disagreement between two referees , Jack Tunney , the WWF President , declared Luger and Hart co @-@ winners . Tunney announced that both wrestlers would get a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania , the prize given to the winner of the Royal Rumble match , and both wrestlers would have to wrestle two matches for the pay @-@ per @-@ view . 
 Tunney announced that a coin toss would be used to decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first . If Luger won , he would face Yokozuna first . Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger @-@ Yokozuna match . If Hart won the coin toss , he would get the first title shot , and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card . On the January 31 , 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw , Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first . 
 Bret Hart was booked to face his brother Owen , with whom he was in the middle of a feud . The storyline between the Hart brothers began at Survivor Series 1993 , where they were competing on the same side of an elimination match . As Owen was fighting in the ring , Bret , who had sustained a kayfabe injury , was staggering along the ring apron . Owen ran into Bret , causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match . After the match , Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret . In the following weeks , Owen demanded a match with Bret , but Bret refused to accept the challenge . Eventually , the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994 . During the match , Bret sustained another kayfabe injury , causing the referee to end the match . In a planned turn , Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud . 
 Luger 's feud with Yokozuna began on July 4 , 1993 , at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge . In June , Mr. Fuji , Yokozuna 's manager , challenged all American athletes to attempt to bodyslam Yokozuna on the deck of the USS Intrepid . After several athletes failed , the storyline saw Luger arrive by helicopter and successfully bodyslam Yokozuna . This began a strong push for Luger , who was then scheduled to challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993 . Luger won the match by countout but did not win the title . The WWF claimed that the match stipulations did not allow Luger a rematch . The storyline saw Luger campaigning for entry into the 1994 Royal Rumble , as he wanted the title shot that would be given to the winner . Luger was eventually entered into the match , although The Great Kabuki and Genichiro Tenryu were also entered , on Mr. Fuji 's behalf , to attempt to prevent Luger from winning . Kabuki and Tenryu were unsuccessful , however , as Luger won the match and gained a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . 
 The storyline leading to the match between " Macho Man " Randy Savage and Crush focused on the supposedly strained friendship between the two wrestlers . On the July 12 , 1993 , episode of Monday Night Raw , Crush challenged Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . At the end of the match , Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop to win the match . After the match , he performed three more Banzai Drops while various wrestlers ran to the ring to stop the attack . Savage eventually came to the ring to help Crush . Following the match , Crush was not seen on televised matches for several months , although he continued to appear at house shows . On October 18 , Crush appeared on Monday Night Raw accompanied by Yokozuna and Yokozuna 's manager , Mr. Fuji . Crush criticized Savage for not intervening sooner during the July 12 match . In a worked promo , Crush announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States in order to align himself with Yokozuna and Fuji . He then attacked Savage by dropping him on the ringside guard rail . Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop on Savage before a group of referees came to the ring to break up the fight . During the November 8 , 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw , Savage left his position as commentator to attack Crush . The following week , Jack Tunney announced that Savage was suspended from commentating as a result of the previous week 's attack . The feud intensified at Survivor Series 1993 when Savage and Crush caused each other to be eliminated from their respective matches . 
 Bam Bam Bigelow and Doink the Clown were engaged in a feud that began in the fall of 1993 . Doink annoyed Bigelow with a series of pranks , such as throwing water and confetti on him and tripping him with a broom . Bigelow retaliated against Doink and Doink 's midget sidekick Dink . A match was booked for Survivor Series 1993 , but Bigelow was unable to get revenge because Doink did not compete . Instead , the WWF prolonged the feud by having Bigelow 's team face was The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission dressed as Doinks . The feud eventually culminated in a match scheduled for WrestleMania X. In the match , Bigelow and his storyline girlfriend Luna Vachon competed against Doink and Dink in a Mixed tag team match . 
 The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to the fall of 1993 . Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough . There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt . Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel , the other finalist in the match . In the angle , Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change , however , as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion . To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt , Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon 's gold chains .

 In a dark match before the pay @-@ per @-@ view aired , The Heavenly Bodies faced The Bushwhackers . Near the end of the match , The Bushwhackers gained control when they performed the Battering Ram on Jimmy Del Ray . Tom Prichard , Del Ray 's partner , attacked <unk> Butch before he was able to pin Del Ray . This allowed Del Ray to recover and pin Butch to win the match . As the broadcast began , Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler were introduced as commentators for the event and Little Richard sang " America the Beautiful " . 
 The first televised match was between Bret and Owen Hart . The beginning of the match went back and forth with neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage . The tension between the two was demonstrated by Owen 's bragging and Bret 's refusal to let Owen leave the ring . Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver . When Owen stood outside the ring to recuperate , Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him . Bret landed awkwardly , however , and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee . Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret 's sore leg . Bret was able to recover , and he kicked Owen in the back of the head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen . Owen regained the advantage , however , and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret . Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen . Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll , but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match . 
 Sy Sperling , the president of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men , appeared in the ring before the next match . He announced that he was at WrestleMania to introduce one of his latest clients , ring announcer Howard Finkel . Finkel came to the ring wearing a toupée , showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded . The match then began , as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink . Bigelow attacked Doink at the beginning of the match with a dropkick and a powerslam . When Dink entered the match , the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match . Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon , but she eventually caught him . She kicked him and powerslammed him , but she then missed a moonsault attempt . Doink and Bigelow re @-@ entered the match , and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow . Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink . Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match , and he and Vachon then attacked Dink . 
 The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush . The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned , he then had to make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match . Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang , but Crush reversed the attack . He used a tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall . While Savage was returning to the ring , Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him . Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining , so the match continued . Inside the ring , Crush tried to throw salt in Savage 's eyes , but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush 's eyes . Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall . Fuji helped revive Crush , which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired . Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage . Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush 's legs to a pulley . Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring , so Savage was declared the winner . 
 Alundra Blayze defended her WWF Women 's Championship against Leilani Kai in the next match . Blayze began the match by using a leg sweep and two sunset flips . Kai came back with a powerslam and a suplex . Blayze got the win , however , by pinning Kai after performing a German suplex . 
 In the next match , Men on a Mission challenged The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship . Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell , Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers . The Quebecers used several double @-@ team moves against their opponents , but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb . Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche , allowing The Quebecers to suplex him . The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but did not get a pinfall . Men on a Mission regained the advantage , prompting The Quebecers ' manager , Johnny Polo , to pull his wrestlers out of the ring . Men on a Mission won the match by countout , but they did not win the belts . 
 The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next , as Lex Luger challenged Yokozuna . Mr. Perfect was revealed to be the special guest referee for the match , while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper . After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna , Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring . After getting back into the ring , Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from a corner of the ring . Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger . As he tried to throw Luger 's head into the exposed turnbuckle , however , Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna 's head into the turnbuckle . Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash . Yokozuna 's managers , Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger , and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them . Luger covered Yokozuna , but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count . When Luger pushed him , Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring , thereby turning heel . 
 Adam Bomb and his manager Harvey Wippleman entered the ring for the next match , and Wippleman criticized Finkel 's new hair and tore the pocket off Finkel 's suit . Earthquake came to the ring and attacked Bomb from behind . He powerslammed Bomb and performed the Earthquake splash to get the pinfall victory in thirty @-@ five seconds . 
 For the Ladder match , the Intercontinental belts belonging to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring , and the first wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner . Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels . Michaels recovered , however , and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon . Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside , where Michaels ' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon . Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel to return to the dressing rooms . Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor , but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon 's attempt to perform the Razor 's Edge . While Ramon was lying on the floor , Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach , chest and back . Michaels tried to retrieve the belts , but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder . Michaels then set the ladder up in the corner of the ring and performed a splash onto Ramon . Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder . He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts . Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts . Michaels dropkicked the ladder , which caused Ramon to fall off . Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring . Michaels climbed the turnbuckles , jumped onto the ladder , and used his weight to push it down across Ramon 's chest . Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again , but Ramon pushed him off . Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up , allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship . 
 A ten @-@ man tag team match was supposed to take place next , but it was canceled due to time constraints . The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team ( Irwin R. Schyster , The Headshrinkers , Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett ) could not agree on who would be the team 's captain for the match . Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid , Sparky Plugg , Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns . Bob Holly ( " Sparky Plugg " ) , stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match , but Michaels and Ramon ignored him , and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match . 
 The final match of the night and main event was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart . The guest referee for the match was " Rowdy " Roddy Piper , while the guest ring announcer was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth . Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell , and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain . Eventually , Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat . Cornette tried to distract Piper , but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron . Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt . Bret maintained the advantage for a little while , but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex . When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop , however , he lost his balance and fell to the mat . Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title . He celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger , " Rowdy " Roddy Piper , Razor Ramon , Tatanka , The 1 – 2 – 3 Kid , Sparky Plugg and " Macho Man " Randy Savage . Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds , Rhonda Shear , Donnie Wahlberg , and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon . Owen Hart stood in the aisle , glaring at Bret , then quickly left .

 At the time of Acquainted with the Night 's writing , author and poet Christopher Dewdney was 52 years old and living in Toronto with his wife , Barbara Gowdy . He had previously written 14 books , the last being the 2002 book of poetry , The Natural History . His previous non @-@ fiction books were Last Flesh : Life in the <unk> Era ( 1998 ) on the impacts of technological advances on humanism , The Secular Grail : Paradigms of Perception ( 1993 ) regarding the human psyche , and The Immaculate Perception ( 1986 ) on his views of consciousness , language and dreams . Dewdney 's past books were described as being " more admired than read " . On the topic of ' the night ' , he had a lifelong fascination with nightlife and eventually decided to write a book about it . He quickly became overwhelmed by the amount of information relating to the subject . For research , he consulted a variety of genres and formats , including books , journals , magazines , music , and movies , and collected information within the broad topics of art , science , social sciences and history . The perspective Dewdney took was that of " explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all " . 
 = = Content = = 
 The content is divided into 14 chapters . The first chapter serves as an introduction and considers the mythological and geological origin of night . The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2 's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13 's 5 am . Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night , including sunsets , the green flash , the stages of twilight , as well as Olbers ' paradox , and a definition of the size and speed of night . The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night , how animals see and hear differently at night with a focus on bats , nighthawks , and nocturnal insects . The 8 pm chapter analyzes children 's literature and bedtime stories . The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night , including the evolution of nightclubs , street lights , and the impacts of light pollution . The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history . The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams . 
 The 12 am chapter traces the history behind dream interpretation from Gilgamesh to Sigmund Freud , Carl Jung , and Calvin Hall . Here , Dewdney considers nightmares and takes sudden unexplained death syndrome , whose sufferers are almost always Asian males , between 20 and 49 years old , as an extreme example of nightmares that cause the dreamer to die from a " ventricular fibrillation ... brought about by extreme terror " . The 1 am chapter compares literary and mythological personifications of , or beings associated with , the night . The 2 am chapter tells the stories of the legends behind the moon and the constellations . The 3 am chapter is all about insomnia .

 The title shares its name with the Robert Frost poem Acquainted with the Night , which is quoted on the first page . The book 's structure uses twelve chapters , equating to twelve hours of night , from 6 pm to 5 am . Two additional chapters , " First Night " and " Night 's Last Stand " , bookend the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion . This hour @-@ by @-@ hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics . The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture , superstitions , natural history , physiology , and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book " a compendium " , " a browser 's book " and full of " encyclopedic mini @-@ essays " . Autobiographical passages are also included . One reviewer noted the format uses personal observations that lead to discussions of broad subjects with " side trips into relevant supporting materials " . 
 The reviewer for the Quill & Quire cited the book as an example of a subgenre which an article in The Atlantic Monthly dubbed " mundane studies " referring to the ubiquity of the subject , like Mark Kurlansky 's Salt : A World History and Witold Rybczynski 's One Good Turn : A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw . Dewdney 's writing in Acquainted with the Night combines a poet 's point of view with an interest for the sciences . The tone was described as " boyish enthusiasm " and " highly condensed yet personable voice " . Gisèle Baxter , in the journal Canadian Literature , wrote that the its tone was set at the beginning of the book by " an anecdote of a small boy creeping into the moonlit , partly wooded backyard of his family home " .

In the United States , Bloomsbury published the hardback version in July 2004 as Acquainted with the Night : A Celebration of the Dark Hours . The trade paperback version was published by HarperCollins in March 2005 . An excerpt was published in the Canadian literary magazine Geist .

The Library Journal noted the book would be " most useful for larger public libraries " . 
 Regarding Dewdney 's writing , the reviewer for Publishers Weekly wrote that Dewdney writes carefully and " confidently " . Another reviewer called the book " engaging and recreational " . Gisèle Baxter , in Canadian Literature , found his use of language " provok [ es ] consideration through its elegant turns of phrase and image " and Laura Wright , in Discover called the imagery " arresting " . In The Globe and Mail , poet and novelist Margaret Atwood wrote , " The prose moves from the strictly informative to the lyrical to the charming to the amusing to the odd to the strangely moving without batting an eye . " Another reviewer noted Dewdney " combined a deft lyric touch with a deep interest in science " . The reviewer for Canadian Geographic wrote that " the strength of the book is in its artful mix of science and poetry " . Literary critic Sven Birkerts found Dewdney to be " an engaging enough narrator and solid , enthusiastic stylist " . The book 's structure received mixed reviews , some reviewers found Dewdney was able to effectively transition between various topics while other reviewers did not . Birkerts wrote the book has " a fun @-@ facts @-@ fished @-@ from @-@ the @-@ data @-@ ocean ... [ and ] end @-@ of @-@ term crammer " sense to it . The Quill & Quire and The Economist reviewers found the topics were too cursory , like " an encyclopedia entry " . Birkerts concluded " that any one of Dewdney 's excursions could earn its keep as a column in a popular science magazine " but assembled into one book the topics seemed random .

 Houston ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ stən ) is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth @-@ most populous city in the United States , located in Southeast Texas near the Gulf of Mexico . With a census @-@ estimated 2014 population of 2 @.@ 239 million within a land area of 599 @.@ 6 square miles ( 1 @,@ 553 km2 ) , it also is the largest city in the Southern United States , as well as the seat of Harris County . It is the principal city of Houston – The Woodlands – Sugar Land , which is the fifth @-@ most populated metropolitan area in the United States . 
 Houston was founded in 1836 near the banks of Buffalo Bayou ( now known as Allen 's Landing ) and incorporated as a city on June 5 , 1837 . The city was named after former General Sam Houston , who was president of the Republic of Texas and had commanded and won at the Battle of San Jacinto 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of where the city was established . The burgeoning port and railroad industry , combined with oil discovery in 1901 , has induced continual surges in the city 's population . In the mid @-@ 20th century , Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center — the world 's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions — and NASA 's Johnson Space Center , where the Mission Control Center is located . 
 Houston 's economy has a broad industrial base in energy , manufacturing , aeronautics , and transportation . It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment ; only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters within its city limits . The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled . Nicknamed the " Space City " , Houston is a global city , with strengths in business , international trade , entertainment , culture , media , fashion , science , sports , technology , education , medicine , and research . The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community . Houston is the most diverse city in Texas and has been described as the most diverse in the United States . It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits , which attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District . Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District and offers year @-@ round resident companies in all major performing arts .

 In August 1836 , two real estate entrepreneurs from New York — Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen — purchased 6 @,@ 642 acres ( 26 @.@ 88 km2 ) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city . The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston , the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto , who was elected President of Texas in September 1836 . The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states . Sizable numbers , however , came through the domestic slave trade . New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South , but slave dealers were in Houston . Thousands of enslaved African Americans lived near the city before the Civil War . Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations , while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs . In 1860 , 49 % of the city 's population was enslaved . A few slaves , perhaps as many as 2 @,@ 000 between 1835 and 1865 , came through the illegal African trade . Post @-@ war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands ; they also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans , whose numbers nearly tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860 , from 58 @,@ 000 to 182 @,@ 566 . 
 Houston was granted incorporation on June 5 , 1837 , with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor . In the same year , Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County ( now Harris County ) and the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas . In 1840 , the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and waterborne business at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou . 
 By 1860 , Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont . During the American Civil War , Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston . After the Civil War , Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston . By 1890 , Houston was the railroad center of Texas . 
 In 1900 , after Galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane , efforts to make Houston into a viable deep @-@ water port were accelerated . The following year , oil discovered at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry . In 1902 , President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $ 1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel . By 1910 , the city 's population had reached 78 @,@ 800 , almost doubling from a decade before . African Americans formed a large part of the city 's population , numbering 23 @,@ 929 people , or nearly one @-@ third of the residents . 
 President Woodrow Wilson opened the deep @-@ water Port of Houston in 1914 , seven years after digging began . By 1930 , Houston had become Texas ' most populous city and Harris County the most populous county . In 1940 , the Census Bureau reported Houston 's population as 77 @.@ 5 % white and 22 @.@ 4 % black . 
 When World War II started , tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended ; however , the war did provide economic benefits for the city . Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war . Ellington Field , initially built during World War I , was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators . The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II . Due to the boom in defense jobs , thousands of new workers migrated to the city , both blacks and whites competing for the higher @-@ paying jobs . President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors , and blacks gained some opportunities , especially in shipbuilding , although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence . Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years . 
 In 1945 , the M.D. Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center . After the war , Houston 's economy reverted to being primarily port @-@ driven . In 1948 , the city annexed several unincorporated areas , more than doubling its size . Houston proper began to spread across the region . 
 In 1950 , the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston , where wages were lower than the North ; this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city 's economy toward the energy sector . 
 The increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during World War II spurred Houston 's growth , as did the establishment in 1961 of NASA 's " Manned Spacecraft Center " ( renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973 ) . This was the stimulus for the development of the city 's aerospace industry . The Astrodome , nicknamed the " Eighth Wonder of the World " , opened in 1965 as the world 's first indoor domed sports stadium . 
 During the late 1970s , Houston had a population boom as people from the Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers . The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry , created as a result of the Arab oil embargo . With the increase in professional jobs , Houston has become a destination for many college @-@ educated persons , including African Americans in a reverse Great Migration from northern areas . 
 One wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid @-@ 1980s , as oil prices fell precipitously . The space industry also suffered in 1986 after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated shortly after launch . A cutback in some activities existed for a period . In the late 1980s , the city 's economy suffered from the nationwide recession . After the early 1990s recession , Houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care / biotechnology , and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry . Since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s , the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy . 
 In 1997 , Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city 's first African American mayor . 
 In June 2001 , Tropical Storm Allison dumped up to 40 inches ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) of rain on parts of Houston , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history . The storm cost billions of dollars in damage and killed 20 people in Texas . By December of that same year , Houston @-@ based energy company Enron collapsed into the third @-@ largest ever U.S. bankruptcy during an investigation surrounding fabricated partnerships that were allegedly used to hide debt and inflate profits . 
 In August 2005 , Houston became a shelter to more than 150 @,@ 000 people from New Orleans , who evacuated from Hurricane Katrina . One month later , about 2 @.@ 5 million Houston @-@ area residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast , leaving little damage to the Houston area . This was the largest urban evacuation in the history of the United States . In September 2008 , Houston was hit by Hurricane Ike . As many as 40 % refused to leave Galveston Island because they feared the traffic problems that happened after Hurricane Rita . 
 During the floods in 2015 and 2016 , parts of the city were covered in several inches of water . On 31 May 2016 , several cities experienced record setting flooding . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Houston is located 165 miles ( 266 km ) east of Austin , 112 miles ( 180 km ) west of the Louisiana border , and 250 miles ( 400 km ) south of Dallas . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 656 @.@ 3 square miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km2 ) ; this comprises 634 @.@ 0 square miles ( 1 @,@ 642 km2 ) of land and 22 @.@ 3 square miles ( 58 km2 ) covered by water . The Piney Woods are north of Houston . Most of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain , and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest . Much of the city was built on forested land , marshes , swamp , or prairie which resembles the Deep South , and are all still visible in surrounding areas . The flatness of the local terrain , when combined with urban sprawl , has made flooding a recurring problem for the city . Downtown stands about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea level , and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet ( 38 m ) in elevation . The city once relied on groundwater for its needs , but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground @-@ level water sources such as Lake Houston , Lake <unk> , and Lake Livingston . The city owns surface water rights for 1 @.@ 20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater . 
 Houston has four major bayous passing through the city . Buffalo Bayou runs through downtown and the Houston Ship Channel , and has three tributaries : White Oak Bayou , which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown ; Brays Bayou , which runs along the Texas Medical Center ; and Sims Bayou , which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston . The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Underpinning Houston 's land surface are unconsolidated clays , clay shales , and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep . The region 's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains . These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter , that over time , transformed into oil and natural gas . Beneath the layers of sediment is a water @-@ deposited layer of halite , a rock salt . The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward . As it pushed upward , the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations , often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands . The thick , rich , sometimes black , surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow . 
 The Houston area has over 150 active faults ( estimated to be 300 active faults ) with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles ( 500 km ) , including the Long Point – Eureka Heights fault system which runs through the center of the city . No significant historically recorded earthquakes have occurred in Houston , but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past , nor occurring in the future . Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years . It may be associated with slip along the faults ; however , the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake , where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves . These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed " fault creep " , which further reduces the risk of an earthquake . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Houston 's climate is classified as humid subtropical ( Cfa in the Köppen climate classification system ) , typical of the lower South . While not located in " Tornado Alley " , like much of the rest of Texas , spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area . Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year , which bring heat and moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico . 
 During the summer , temperatures commonly reach over 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) , with an average of 106 @.@ 5 days per year , including a majority from June to September , with a high of 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) or above and 4 @.@ 6 days at or over 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) . However , humidity usually yields a higher heat index . Summer mornings average over 90 % relative humidity . Winds are often light in the summer and offer little relief , except in the far southeastern outskirts near the Gulf Coast and Galveston . To cope with the strong humidity and heat , people use air conditioning in nearly every vehicle and building . In 1980 , Houston was described as the " most air @-@ conditioned place on earth " . Officially , the hottest temperature ever recorded in Houston is 109 ° F ( 43 ° C ) , which was reached both on September 4 , 2000 , and August 28 , 2011 . 
 Houston has mild winters in contrast to most areas of the United States . In January , the normal mean temperature at Intercontinental Airport is 53 @.@ 1 ° F ( 11 @.@ 7 ° C ) , while that station has an average of 13 days with a low at or below freezing . Snowfall is rare . Recent snow events in Houston include a storm on December 24 , 2004 when 1 @.@ 0 in ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) of snow accumulated in parts of the metro area . Falls of at least 1 @.@ 0 in ( 25 mm ) on both December 10 , 2008 , and December 4 , 2009 , marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred in two consecutive years in the city 's recorded history . The coldest temperature officially recorded in Houston was 5 ° F ( − 15 ° C ) on January 18 , 1930 . Houston has historically received an ample amount of rainfall , averaging about 49 @.@ 8 in ( 1 @,@ 260 mm ) annually per 1981 – 2010 normals . Localized flooding often occurs , owing to the extremely flat topography and widespread typical clay @-@ silt prairie soils , which do not drain quickly . 
 Houston has excessive ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone @-@ polluted cities in the United States . Ground @-@ level ozone , or smog , is Houston 's predominant air pollution problem , with the American Lung Association rating the metropolitan area 's ozone level sixth on the " Top 10 Most Ozone @-@ <unk> Cities " in 2014 . The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of the city 's air pollution . In 2006 , Houston 's air quality was comparable to that of Los Angeles .

 Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation . The ward designation is the progenitor of the 11 current @-@ day geographically oriented Houston City Council districts . Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the Interstate 610 Loop . The inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that <unk> World War II . More recently , high @-@ density residential areas have been developed within the loop . The city 's outlying areas , suburbs , and enclaves are located outside of the loop . Beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) farther out . 
 Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without formal zoning regulations , it has developed similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city 's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role . Regulations include mandatory lot size for single @-@ family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers . Such restrictions have had mixed results . Though some have blamed the city 's low density , urban sprawl , and lack of pedestrian @-@ friendliness on these policies , the city 's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing , sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis . The city issued 42 @,@ 697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009 . 
 Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land @-@ use districts in 1948 , 1962 , and 1993 . Consequently , rather than a single central business district as the center of the city 's employment , multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include Uptown , Texas Medical Center , Midtown , Greenway Plaza , Memorial City , Energy Corridor , <unk> , and <unk> .

 Houston has the fourth @-@ tallest skyline in North America ( after New York City , Chicago , and Toronto ) and 12th @-@ tallest in the world , as of 2014 . A seven @-@ mile ( 11 km ) system of tunnels and <unk> links downtown buildings containing shops and restaurants , enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain while walking between buildings . 
 In the 1960s , Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of midrise office structures . Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry – led boom in 1970 . A succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s — many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines — culminating with Houston 's tallest skyscraper , the 75 @-@ floor , 1 @,@ 002 @-@ foot ( 305 m ) -tall JPMorgan Chase Tower ( formerly the Texas Commerce Tower ) , completed in 1982 . It is the tallest structure in Texas , 15th tallest building in the United States , and the 85th @-@ tallest skyscraper in the world , based on highest architectural feature . In 1983 , the 71 @-@ floor , 992 @-@ foot ( 302 m ) -tall Wells Fargo Plaza ( formerly Allied Bank Plaza ) was completed , becoming the second @-@ tallest building in Houston and Texas . Based on highest architectural feature , it is the 17th @-@ tallest in the United States and the 95th @-@ tallest in the world . In 2007 , downtown Houston had over 43 million square feet ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m ² ) of office space . 
 Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road , the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings , hotels , and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 West . Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city . The tallest building in Uptown is the 64 @-@ floor , 901 @-@ foot ( 275 m ) -tall , Philip Johnson and John <unk> designed landmark Williams Tower ( known as the Transco Tower until 1999 ) . At the time of construction , it was believed to be the world 's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district . The new 20 @-@ story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years . The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei , César Pelli , and Philip Johnson . In the late 1990s and early 2000s , a mini @-@ boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred , with several over 30 stories tall . Since 2000 more than 30 high @-@ rise buildings have gone up in Houston ; all told , 72 high @-@ rises tower over the city , which adds up to about 8 @,@ 300 units . In 2002 , Uptown had more than 23 million square feet ( 2 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 m ² ) of office space with 16 million square feet ( 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 m ² ) of class A office space . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Houston is multicultural , in part because of its many academic institutions and strong industries , as well as being a major port city . Over 90 languages are spoken in the city .

 Houston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry — particularly for oil and natural gas — as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics . Renewable energy sources — wind and solar — are also growing economic bases in the city . The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston 's economic base . Because of these strengths , Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney . The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports , surpassing New York City in 2013 , according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce 's International Trade Administration . In 2012 , the Houston – The Woodlands – Sugar Land area recorded $ 110 @.@ 3 billion in merchandise exports . Petroleum products , chemicals , and oil and gas extraction equipment accounted for roughly two @-@ thirds of the metropolitan area 's exports last year . The top three destinations for exports were Mexico , Canada , and Brazil . 
 The Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment . Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship channel , the Port of Houston . In the United States , the port ranks first in international commerce and 10th among the largest ports in the world . Unlike most places , high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial for Houston 's economy , as many of its residents are employed in the energy industry . Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil , gas , and products pipelines : 
 The Houston – The Woodlands – Sugar Land MSA 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2012 was $ 489 billion , making it the fourth @-@ largest of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Austria 's , Venezuela 's , or South Africa 's GDP . Only 26 countries other than the United States have a gross domestic product exceeding Houston 's regional gross area product ( GAP ) . In 2010 , mining ( which consists almost entirely of exploration and production of oil and gas in Houston ) accounted for 26 @.@ 3 % of Houston 's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity , followed by engineering services , health services , and manufacturing . 
 The University of Houston System 's annual impact on the Houston area 's economy equates to that of a major corporation : $ 1 @.@ 1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the Houston area , $ 3 @.@ 13 billion in total economic benefit , and 24 @,@ 000 local jobs generated . This is in addition to the 12 @,@ 500 new graduates the <unk> System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston and throughout the state of Texas . These degree @-@ holders tend to stay in Houston . After five years , 80 @.@ 5 % of graduates are still living and working in the region . 
 In 2006 , the Houston metropolitan area ranked first in Texas and third in the U.S. within the category of " Best Places for Business and Careers " by Forbes magazine . Foreign governments have established 92 consular offices in Houston 's metropolitan area , the third @-@ highest in the nation .

In the same year , the city ranked second on the annual Fortune 500 list of company headquarters , first for Forbes magazine 's Best Cities for College Graduates , and first on their list of Best Cities to Buy a Home . In 2010 , the city was rated the best city for shopping , according to Forbes . 
 In 2012 , the city was ranked number one for paycheck worth by Forbes and in late May 2013 , Houston was identified as America 's top city for employment creation . 
 In 2013 , Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn , but also after the crash , more than two jobs were added for every one lost . Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston 's success to the ability of the region 's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes . Furthermore , Jankowski stated that " more than 100 foreign @-@ owned companies relocated , expanded or started new businesses in Houston " between 2008 and 2010 , and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low . Also in 2013 , Houston again appeared on Forbes ' list of Best Places for Business and Careers .

 = = Government and politics = = 
 The city of Houston has a strong mayoral form of municipal government . Houston is a home rule city and all municipal elections in the state of Texas are nonpartisan . The City 's elected officials are the mayor , city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council . The current mayor of Houston is Sylvester Turner , a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot . Houston 's mayor serves as the city 's chief administrator , executive officer , and official representative , and is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced . 
 The original city council line @-@ up of 14 members ( nine district @-@ based and five at @-@ large positions ) was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979 . At @-@ large council members represent the entire city . Under the city charter , once the population in the city limits exceeded 2 @.@ 1 million residents , two additional districts were to be added . The city of Houston 's official 2010 census count was 600 shy of the required number ; however , as the city was expected to grow beyond 2 @.@ 1 million shortly thereafter , the two additional districts were added for , and the positions filled during , the August 2011 elections . 
 The city controller is elected independently of the mayor and council . The controller 's duties are to certify available funds prior to committing such funds and processing disbursements . The city 's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 . Ronald Green is the city controller , serving his first term as of January 2010 . 
 As the result of a 2015 referendum in Houston , a mayor is elected for a four @-@ year term , and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms . The term limits were spearheaded by conservative political activist Clymer Wright . The city controller and city council members are also subject to the same two @-@ year , three @-@ term limitations . 
 Houston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats . Much of the city 's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city 's working class and minority areas vote Democratic . According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey , 68 percent of non @-@ Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non @-@ Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats . About 62 percent Hispanics ( of any race ) in the area are declared or favor Democrats . The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas , a state known for being generally conservative . As a result , the city is often a contested area in statewide elections . In 2009 , Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor , by electing Annise Parker .

 The primary city airport is George Bush Intercontinental Airport ( IAH ) , the tenth @-@ busiest in the United States for total passengers , and twenty eighth @-@ busiest worldwide . Bush Intercontinental currently ranks fourth in the United States for non @-@ stop domestic and international service with 182 destinations . In 2006 , the United States Department of Transportation named IAH the fastest @-@ growing of the top ten airports in the United States . The Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center stands on the George Bush Intercontinental Airport grounds . 
 Houston was the headquarters of Continental Airlines until its 2010 merger with United Airlines with headquarters in Chicago ; regulatory approval for the merger was granted in October of that year . Bush Intercontinental became United Airlines ' largest airline hub . The airline retained a significant operational presence in Houston while offering more than 700 daily departures from the city . In early 2007 , Bush Intercontinental Airport was named a model " port of entry " for international travelers by U.S. Customs and Border Protection . 
 The second @-@ largest commercial airport is William P. Hobby Airport ( named Houston International Airport until 1967 ) which operates primarily short- to medium @-@ haul domestic flights .

 = Vädersolstavlan = 
 Vädersolstavlan ( Swedish for " The Sun Dog Painting " ) is an oil @-@ on @-@ panel painting depicting a halo display , an atmospheric optical phenomenon , observed over Stockholm on April 20 , 1535 . It is named after the sun dogs ( Swedish : <unk> , " Weather sun " ) appearing on the upper right part of the painting . While chiefly noted for being the oldest depiction of Stockholm in colour , it is arguably also the oldest Swedish landscape painting and the oldest depiction of sun dogs . 
 The original painting , which was produced shortly after the event and traditionally attributed to Urban <unk> ( " Urban [ the ] Painter " ) , is lost , and virtually nothing is known about it . However , a copy from 1636 by Jacob Heinrich <unk> held in Storkyrkan in Stockholm , is believed to be an accurate copy and was until recently erroneously thought to be the restored original . It was previously covered by layers of brownish varnish , and the image was hardly discernible until carefully restored and thoroughly documented in 1998 – 1999 . 
 The painting was produced during an important time in Swedish history . The establishment of modern Sweden coincided with the introduction of Protestantism and the break @-@ up with Denmark and the Kalmar Union . The painting was commissioned by the Swedish reformer Olaus Petri , and the resulting controversies between him and King Gustav Vasa and the historical context remained a well @-@ kept secret for centuries . During the 20th century the painting became an icon for the history of Stockholm , and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated . 
 = = Painting = = 
 The painting is divided into an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city as it must have appeared viewed from Södermalm in the late Middle Ages . The medieval urban conglomeration , today part of the old town Gamla stan , is rendered using a bird 's @-@ eye view . The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle , which are rendered in a descriptive perspective ( i.e. , their size relates to their social status , rather than their actual dimensions ) . Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges , today part of central Stockholm . Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning , the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east . 
 The wooden panel measures 163 by 110 centimetres ( 64 by 43 inches ) and is composed of five vertical deals ( softwood planks ) reinforced by two horizontal dovetail battens . The battens , together with the rough scrub planed back , have effectively reduced warping to a minimum and the artwork is well preserved , with only insignificant fissures and attacks by insects . A dendrochronological examination of the panel by doctor Peter Klein at the Institute für <unk> in Hamburg determined that it is made of pine deals ( Pinus silvestris ) , the annual rings of which date from various periods ranging from the 1480s to around 1618 . The painting can therefore date no further back than around 1620 . This is consistent with the year 1636 given on the frame and mentioned in the parish accounts . 
 The dye , covering a semi @-@ transparent red @-@ brownish bottom layer , is emulsion paint containing linseed oil . The painting was apparently painted detail by detail as no under @-@ painting or preparatory sketches have been discovered , except for marks at the centres of the biggest circles indicating that compasses were used . As a result of this , the horizon tilts to the right ; an x @-@ ray analysis has shown that the painter tried to compensate for this tilt by altering various elements in the painting , including mountains added along the horizon and the gently leaning spires of the church and the castle . A narrow unpainted border has been left around the image . 
 = = = Possible prototypes = = = 
 No prototypes for the painting are known in Sweden , and while the painting is occasionally associated with the Danube school , much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated . A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer ( brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer ) . Begun in 1530 , it was inspired by the works of Cranach and Dürer , but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster . In particular , Altdorfer 's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message similar to that of the Vädersolstavlan . Historical documents show that Olaus Petri , who commissioned the painting , combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church . Copies of Erhard Altdorfer 's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant <unk> <unk> who lived by <unk> square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther . 
 In Albrecht Altdorfer 's The Battle of Alexander at Issus , one of the most famous paintings produced by the Danube School , a composition similar to Vädersolstavlan renders the battle scene in a detailed landscape under a sky crowded with celestial symbols and messages . Just as in Vädersolstavlan , the view is not depicted as it would really appear , but is rather a composite of factual elements as known by the artist . In The Battle of Alexander at Issus the eastern Mediterranean Sea , Africa , and the Nile River are represented as known from contemporary maps , while the knights and soldiers are dressed in 16th century armours and the battle is depicted as retold in sources from Antiquity . The frame suspended over the scene , a device which appears in many other German Renaissance battle scenes , is mirrored by the 17th century inscription in Vädersolstavlan . In both paintings , Apocalyptic symbols in the sky are given a contemporary political significance . The realistically rendered sky , light , and clouds , in both paintings , are emblematic of the Danube School . 
 = = = 17th @-@ century copy and modern restorations = = = 
 The lost original painting is attributed to Urban <unk> by tradition . However , historical sources and other works of art from the early Vasa Era are rare , and this attribution is apparently doubtful . Furthermore , as the extant painting has proven to be a 17th @-@ century copy , and not as previously believed a restored original , a credible corroboration is unlikely to ever be produced . 
 In the parish accounts , the painting is first mentioned in 1636 , at which time a " M. Jacob <unk> " was recorded as having " renewed the painting hanging on the northern wall " . Modern scholarship has convincingly identified Jacob Heinrich <unk> ( 1600 – 1664 ) , guild master from 1628 and court painter of Queen Maria Eleonora from 1634 , as the artist responsible . Based on the brief note referencing the painting 's " renewal " in 1636 , it was long assumed that the extant painting was in fact the original from 1535 , and that the work performed on it in the 17th century was little more than restoration of some kind . However , when the painting was taken down in mid @-@ October 1998 to allow a group of experts from various fields to restore and document it , this notion had to be completely reassessed . A dendrochronological investigation showed that the wood used for the panel came from trees cut down in the early 17th century : the painting in question must therefore be a copy and not the restored original . 
 Notwithstanding the excellent state of the wooden panel prior to its 1998 restoration , the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish . This was particularly pronounced in the area of the sky , obscuring many fine details and altering this area 's colouring . Once these layers were removed , it was discovered that the original grey @-@ blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a fixing agent . An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour , still discernible as a bright line above the horizon , was composed of azurite , while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli . The ultramarine layer has been identified as <unk> blue , a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards . Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts ; the painting was " varnished and somewhat restored " by the painter Aline Bernard ( 1841 – 1910 ) in 1885 , and a second time in 1907 by a Nils <unk> . The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish . 
 When the painting was thus copied in the 17th century from the 16th @-@ century original , the painting was furnished with a Baroque frame carrying a heart @-@ shaped cartouche . This cartouche displayed the message : 
 in Latin , repeated in Swedish and German . In 1885 , the frame was repainted in brown by Leonard <unk> , who also modernized the Swedish and German texts and added his signature at the lower right . During the 1907 restoration the frame was repainted yet again , only to be repainted in its original colour twenty years later , at which time the original text was also uncovered .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 1523 , as the newly elected King of Sweden , Gustav Vasa had to unify a kingdom which , unlike a modern nation @-@ state , was composed of separate provinces not necessarily happy with his reign . He also had to prepare for a potential Danish attack , and resist the influence of German states and merchants with an interest in reintroducing the hegemony of the Hanseatic League over the Baltic lands . Facing these challenges , the king saw conspiracies everywhere — sometimes correctly — and started to thoroughly fortify his capital while purging it of potential enemies . 
 Shortly after his coronation , Gustav Vasa heard of the reformatory sermons delivered by Olaus Petri in <unk> and called him to Stockholm to have him appointed councillor in 1524 . When Petri announced his marriage the following year , the solemnity of the celebration infuriated Catholic prelates to the extent Petri was excommunicated , while the king , in contrast , gave his unreserved support . Although the king and the reformer collaborated initially , they started to pull in different directions within a few years . As the king carried out the Reformation from 1527 , Catholic churches and monasteries were demolished or used for other purposes . Petri strongly opposed the king 's methods of depriving the church of its assets and in his sermons he began to criticize the king 's actions . While both the king and Petri were thus devoted to both establishing what was to become the Swedish state and the new religious doctrine , they were also involved in domestic struggle for power , a situation fuelled by various enemies and Counter Reformation propaganda . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 The primary historical source describing the events following the celestial phenomenon is the minutes of the proceedings from the king 's legal process against the reformers Olaus Petri and Laurentius Andreae in 1539 – 1540 . The process was originally described in the chronicle of Gustav Vasa written by the clerk and historian Erik <unk> Tegel in the early 17th century . 
 Sun dogs were apparently well known during the Middle Ages , as they are mentioned in the Old Farmer 's Almanac ( <unk> ) which states that the phenomenon forecasts strong winds , and also rain if the sun dogs are more pale than red . According to the passage in the Vasa Chronicle , however , both Petri and the master of the mint Anders Hansson were sincerely troubled by the appearance of these sun dogs . Petri interpreted the signs over Stockholm as a warning from God and had the Vädersolstavlan painting produced and hung in front of his congregation . Notwithstanding this devotion , he was far from certain on how to interpret these signs and in a sermon delivered in late summer 1535 , he explained there are two kinds of omens : one produced by the Devil to allure mankind away from God , and another produced by God to attract mankind away from the Devil — one being hopelessly difficult to tell from the other . He therefore saw it as his duty to warn both his congregation , mostly composed of German burghers united by their conspiracy against the king , and the king himself . 
 However , on his return to Stockholm in 1535 , the king had prominent Germans imprisoned and accused Petri of replacing the law with his own " act of faith " . In response , Petri warned his followers that the lords and princes interpreted his sermons as rebellious and complained about the ease with which punishment and subversion were carried through , while restoring " what rightly and true is " was much harder . In a sermon published in 1539 , Petri criticized the misuse of the name of God " now commonly established " , a message clearly addressed to the king . Petri also explained to his congregation that the Devil ruled the world more obviously than ever , that God would punish the authorities and those who obeyed them , and that the world had become so wicked that it was irrevocably doomed . 
 The king 's interpretation of the phenomenon , however , was that no significant change was presaged , as the " six or eight sun dogs on a circle around the true sun , have apparently disappeared , and the true natural sun has remained itself " . He then concluded that nothing was " much different , since the unchristian treason that Anders Hansson and several of that party had brought against His Highness , was not long thereafter unveiled " . The king referred to the so @-@ called " Gun Powder Conspiracy " uncovered in 1536 , which aimed at murdering him by a blasting charge hidden under his chair in the church . This resulted in various death sentences and <unk> , including Mint Master Anders Hansson who was accused of being a counterfeiter . 
 Petri further excited royal disapproval by writing a chronicle describing contemporary events from a neutral point of view . Both Olaus Petri and Anders Hansson were eventually sentenced to death as a result of the trial in 1539 / 1540 , but were later reprieved . In the end , the king achieved his aim and the appointment of bishops and other representatives of the church was placed under his jurisdiction . 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 When Tegel 's Vasa Chronicle was published in 1622 , the section describing the king 's legal process and death sentences against the reformers was regarded as unfavourable to the Vasa dynasty and was subsequently left out . The original manuscript , finally published in 1909 , was however not the only account of the events . The oldest report , dating from the 1590s , is a handwritten manuscript simply confirming the event , and a publication on meteorological phenomena published in 1608 described the halo in 1535 as " five suns surrounding the right one with its rings as still depicted in the painting hanging in the Great Church " . 
 Knowledge of the events faded : in 1622 when the Danish diplomat Peder Galt asked for the meaning of the signs in the painting , he could get no replies anywhere in the city . He translated the Swedish text then accompanying the painting to Latin — " Anno 1535 1 <unk> hoc <unk> sex <unk> soles in <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> usque ad <unk> <unk> <unk> " — and concluded that the real sun represented Gustav Vasa and the other suns his successors , an assumption he thought confirmed by contemporary Swedish history . Even this confused report was soon forgotten and in 1632 the halo display in the painting was described in a German leaflet as three beautiful rainbows , a ball , and an eel hanging in the sky over the Swedish capital day and night for four weeks in 1520 , furthermore interpreted as a prophecy announcing the forthcoming liberation of Protestant Germany by " the Lion from the North " ( i.e. King Gustavus Adolphus ) . 
 With the publishing of the first Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642 , the interpretation of the painting and the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow . Relying on a publication from 1620 , the sun dogs are said to have appeared first to King John III ( 1537 – 1592 ) on his deathbed - the painting subsequently being produced by the papist @-@ friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632 . 
 The 1592 date remained the established one until the 19th century . In the 1870s , however , several publications corrected the dating and within a few decades 1535 became the generally accepted date . The painting 's correct historical context was finally laid bare with the publication of the censored manuscript from the Vasa Chronicle in 1909 . 
 = = = Historic icon = = = 
 Over time , the painting has become emblematic of the history of Stockholm , and as such appears frequently in various contexts . The 1000 kronor banknote published in 1989 shows a portrait of King Gustav Vasa , based on a painting from the 1620s , in front of details from Vädersolstavlan . In the arcs of the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> IN <unk> <unk> <unk> , which roughly translates to " Let them have the Holy Scripture in their own language " . This is a quote from a letter written by the king in which he ordered a translation of the Bible into the Swedish language . 
 Two stamps engraved by Lars <unk> were published in March 2002 for the 750th anniversary of Stockholm . They were both printed in two colours , an inland postage depicts the entire old town , while the 10 kronor stamp focuses on the castle and the church . 
 For the restoration of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts , including the <unk> tapestries and the 14th @-@ century <unk> humilis ( <unk> ) from the Orkney Islands . Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles . 
 The painting is used on a variety of merchandise — such as puzzles , posters , notebooks — in museum shops and other cultural institutions in Stockholm , like the Museum of Medieval Stockholm and the Stockholm City Museum . 
 = = Medieval Stockholm = = 
 Just as the 1630s replica has proven to be an accurate copy of the lost original , the panorama has proven to be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm . The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail , that historical censorship , misinterpretations , and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting 's accuracy . 
 In the painting , the medieval city is viewed looking east with the dark waters of <unk> in the foreground and the interior of the Stockholm archipelago in the background . Although the event depicted is said to have occurred in the morning , the city is painted in evening light . 
 = = = The church and the castle = = = 
 The painting is centred on the Storkyrkan church , first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged over the following centuries . In 1468 – 1496 , during the reign of Sten Sture the Elder , its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles , while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building . The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting , which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original . The church still exists , although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design . 
 Immediately behind the church is Tre <unk> castle . Destroyed by fire in 1697 and subsequently replaced by the Stockholm Palace , it was named after the central citadel , a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol , known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown . While it is not known when the symbol was first added to the citadel ( it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century ) , it was gilded during the 16th century . Again , the painting is strictly accurate , as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image . The castle 's eastern wing , the king 's personal residence , was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king , burdened by debts of war to Lübeck , expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed . In the painting to the right of the church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction , the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch . 
 However , the two western towers left of the church display an unusual detail in the painting . The uniformly proportioned , large , square windows depicted there are associated with the Italian Renaissance , which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle . While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented , the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely . It seems more credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632 , forcing the copyist to rely on another source . As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560 – 1570 , the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way , before its completion in the 1580s . 
 = = = Riddarholmen = = = 
 The islet in the left foreground , today known as Riddarholmen ( " Knights ' Islet " ) , was during the medieval era known as <unk> ( " Greyfriars Islet " ) after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the painting represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret at the far side of the islet . Together with other similar institutions , the monastery was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building was used as a hospital until the mid 16th century . The turret of the monastery was replaced by the cast iron spire of <unk> Church in the 19th century , but the remains of the monastery still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings . 
 The two defensive towers appearing along the near shoreline of the islet are still present , their structures remain intact although their exteriors are considerably altered . The leftmost is Birger Jarls torn located in the north @-@ western corner of the islet and erroneously named after Birger Jarl , by tradition attributed to be the founder of Stockholm . The other is the so @-@ called <unk> ( " Tower of Vasa " ) , today forming the southern tower of the Wrangel Palace . For the construction of the towers and other defensive structures , the king used bricks from the monastery Klara <unk> located just north of the city but absent in the painting . Since the monastery is known to have been demolished immediately following the introduction of Protestantism in 1527 , the painting is , again , a credible source rendering the city as it appeared in 1535 . 
 = = = Helgeandsholmen = = = 
 Just behind the Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen , where the northern city gate and defensive wall were located . Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament , this islet was named after the charitable institution , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Islet of the Holy Spirit " ) , located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating the location of the demolished <unk> monastery . King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen , so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced . 
 The painting shows a bridge stretching north ( left ) from the northern city gate to an open space . This is the site of perhaps the oldest river crossing in Stockholm , today replaced by the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> bridges . The latter of these ( not present in the painting ) is a 19th @-@ century bridge still located on the site of the medieval structure . It connects <unk> passing through the Parliament Building on Helgeandsholmen to the square <unk> on <unk> , from where <unk> extends it further south . 
 To the left of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep southern slopes of the <unk> <unk> , a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city . Missing in the painting is the small island of <unk> , which was little more than an insignificant cliff at the time . 
 = = = Southern city gate = = = 
 The two defensive towers of the southern city gate appearing in the left foreground , are known to be much older than the painting but their history remains poorly documented . The outer tower ( <unk> <unk> ) was built on an artificial island in the strait and was rebuilt in front of an expected attack by King Christian II of Denmark in the late 1520s . In <unk> ( " The Bloodbath Painting " ) , an image ten years older than Vädersolstavlan , it appears with a cone @-@ shaped roof seriously damaged during the Danish assault . In Vädersolstavlan , the inner tower ( <unk> <unk> ) is similar to the exterior tower , and both structures , together with the narrow bridge between them , match other historical sources . Additions younger than the 1530s , such as the reinforcements ordered by Gustav Vasa during the 1540s , are missing in the painting but present in engravings from 1560 to 1580 , which confirms Vädersolstavlan is a credible contemporary document . 
 Where the southern city gates were , is today the <unk> area . The sluice and the locks of Karl <unk> had to be rebuilt regularly , and the appearance of the city 's southern approach changed constantly . In the early 1930s , when a multi @-@ story concrete roundabout replaced everything else in the area , the foundations of the outer defensive tower were discovered ( known as Gustav Vasas <unk> ) and remains of the southern defensive structures can still be found below the present squares in the area . 
 = = = Defensive structures = = = 
 Along the western shoreline are several defensive structures of various ages . The wooden defence structure built along the shore around 1650 is absent in the painting , but the double row of piles protecting the western harbour is present . It served both as a defensive structure and , because a duty was imposed on all incoming ships , as an important source of income for the city . The western defence structures were neglected around 1500 , which resulted in settlements being constructed between the western city wall and a shoreline constantly pushed westward by landfill , just as the painting renders it . 
 While the old city wall is not discernible in the painting , several of the towers sitting on the city gates are ( left to right ) : 
 The tower with a cone @-@ shaped roof just to the right of the Greyfriars monastery was called <unk> ( " Dragon 's Tower " ) , and in 1535 served as a prison . 
 Just to the right of it was <unk> ( " Greyfriars Tower " ) with stepped gables and a large gate leading to Riddarholmen island . Excavations in the 1950 showed that the gate was 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 5 feet ) wide . 
 The second tower with stepped gables but without a gate was the <unk> ( " Lion 's Tower " ) , the foundations of which were rediscovered during an archaeological excavation in 1984 and are now part of the interior of a restaurant on <unk> . 
 Between <unk> and the southern city gate flanked by two boats is a wooden structure , roughly triangular in plan ; this is a defensive tower called <unk> , built in 1520 – 1523 on piles in the water . 
 Lastly , next to the southern city gate is an open space , believed to be the precursor of present @-@ day <unk> , the square where ships from the Lake Mälaren region used to deliver corn and iron . 
 = = = Other buildings and surrounding ridges = = = 
 The turret on the right side of the church and the palace was the Blackfriars monastery , inaugurated in 1343 and demolished in 1547 . It was built on the location of the first southern defensive tower , of which no traces have been found . The basement of the monastery , however , can still be seen by <unk> and the school next to <unk> <unk> . 
 During the Middle Ages , there were two harbours west and east of the city 's southern square ; in the painting they are only suggested by the presence of a mast behind the city . On the western shore at <unk> ( " Grain Harbour " ) – today <unk> – grain , iron , and other goods from the Lake Mälaren area were delivered . These goods were then weighed in the Våghuset ( " The Scales Building " , i.e. a weigh house ) , another important source of income for both the crown and the city , before being transported to the eastern harbour , <unk> ( " The Cog Harbour " ) – today the southern part of <unk> – from which large ships delivered goods across the Baltic Sea . 
 In the painting , the Våghuset is the building with stepped gables and iron bars to the right of the Blackfriars monastery facing <unk> ( " Iron Square " ) . Våghuset was located where the Södra <unk> ( " Southern [ National ] Bank Building " ) is today . Just behind Våghuset there is another stepped gable symbolizing the <unk> ( " <unk> Building " ) where goods were stored . The building with stepped gables between the church and the Blackfriars monastery was <unk> ( " Soul 's Homestead " ) . It was built in the 15th century at <unk> to accommodate the poor and aged but also priests and others serving at the church . During the reign of Gustav Vasa it was transformed into the first royal printing house . 
 Between the city and the horizon are several rural islands , which today form part of central Stockholm . Behind the church and the castle is <unk> , which for centuries served as a base for the Swedish Navy together with Kastellholmen islet , which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery . To the left of <unk> are two small islets , which are today merged into the peninsula of <unk> . Behind these islands are Djurgården ( right ) , <unk> , and Norra Djurgården ( left ) . On the horizon , the Lilla <unk> strait passes in front of <unk> and , arguably , the interior islands of the Stockholm archipelago . 
 Like the islands , the ridges surrounding the city , including the cliffs in the foreground , look very much as they still do . South ( right ) of the city is the island of Södermalm , where a cluster of buildings ( see image of the southern city gate above ) lined up along the shore called <unk> were used to burn train oil ( e.g. seal lard ) . The round building on the eastern end of Södermalm was the gallows hill . As depicted in the painting , it was used exclusively for men ( women were beheaded ) . The gallows remained there until the late 17th century when they were moved to present @-@ day <unk> south of the historical city centre . 
 = = Halo display = = 
 While the painting is arguably the oldest realistic depiction of a halo phenomenon — almost a century older than Christoph Scheiner 's famous observation of a halo display over Rome in 1630 — the phenomenon was apparently not entirely understood . The image contains several obvious misinterpretations and a few peculiarities . Most notably , like many other early depictions of haloes , the painting depicts a series of events occurring over several hours and is consistent in its preference for perfect circles rather than ellipses . 
 A work of art produced in the spirit of the Danube School ( see Possible prototypes above ) , Vädersolstavlan features realistic depictions of cirrus clouds and the sky is properly rendered , going from bright blue near the horizon to dark blue near zenith . The shadows in the lower half of the painting , however , seem to suggest the sun is located in the west — even leaving the southern façades in shadow — which is incorrect as historical sources claim the event lasted from 7 to 9 a.m. In contrast to the city below it , the halo phenomenon is depicted vertically in a fisheye perspective with the major circle centred on zenith ( like in the ray tracing solution above ) . 
 In the painting , the actual sun is the yellow ball in the upper @-@ right corner surrounded by the second circle . The large circle taking up most of the sky is a parhelic circle , parallel to the horizon and located at the same altitude as the sun , as the painting renders it . This is actually a common halo , although a full circle as depicted is rare . Such parhelic circles are caused by horizontally oriented plate ice crystals reflecting sun rays . In order for a full circle to appear sun rays must be reflected both internally and externally . The circle surrounding the sun is a 22 ° halo , as the name implies located 22 ° from the sun . While the painting depict it pretty much as it normally appears , it should be centred on the sun and is misplaced in the painting . The pair of arcs flanking the 22 ° halo and crossing each other are most likely a misinterpretation of a circumscribed halo . While the sun is still low , it starts as a V @-@ shaped upper tangent arc which gradually develops into something looking like the unfolding wings of a seagull . As the sun ascends , in rare cases it finally joins with the lower tangent arc to form an ellipse which closes in on the circumscribed 22 ° halo . 
 The sun dogs or <unk> , in the painting erroneously pinned to the misinterpreted arcs of the circumscribed halo , are rather frequent optical phenomena which appear when sunlight is refracted by hexagonal ice crystals forming cirrus or cirrostratus clouds . When the sun is still low , they are located on the 22 ° halo , the way they are most commonly observed , and as the sun ascends they move laterally away from the 22 ° halo . At rare occasions , they can actually reach the circumscribed halo . As depicted in the painting , the sun dogs are located midway between the 22 ° halo and the circumscribed halo , and , assuming they are correctly rendered , the sun should have been located at about 35 @-@ 40 ° above the horizon ( as in the simulation above ) . 
 The unintelligible arc on the lower right might be a misinterpreted and misplaced <unk> arc missing its mirrored twin . These phenomena are , however , rare and only form when the sun is below 32 ° . Their shape change quickly as the sun rises , and as the painting most likely isn 't depicting any specific moment , it is impossible to draw any conclusions from the mysterious shape in the painting . 
 The crescent moon shape in the middle of the sky looks very much like a circumzenithal arc , which is parallel to the horizon but centred at and located near zenith . However , they only form when the sun is located lower than 32 @.@ 2 ° and are at their brightest when the sun is located at 22 ° , which is not consistent with other haloes depicted in the painting . Furthermore , one of the most striking features of circumzenithal arcs is their rainbow colours , and the shape in the painting is perfectly devoid of any colours . It is however not a complete circle ( see Kern arc ) , and it is facing the sun , which are both correct properties for this phenomenon . 
 The white spot on the lower left part of the parhelic circle , opposite to the sun , should be an <unk> , a bright halo always located at the <unk> point . Most scientists are convinced <unk> are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs ( of which are no traces in the painting ) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo . Other researchers believe column @-@ shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting . 
 Finally , the minor , slightly bluish dots , flanking the <unk> , may be perfectly depicted 120 ° <unk> . These halos are produced by the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the parhelic circle . They result from multiple interior reflections of sun rays entering the hexagonal top face and leaving through the bottom face . 
 = 1940 New England hurricane = 
 The 1940 New England hurricane moved off of the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada in August and September 1940 , producing strong winds and torrential rainfall . The fourth tropical cyclone and third hurricane of the season , the storm originated from a well @-@ defined low @-@ pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean on August 26 . Moving slowly in a general west @-@ northwest motion , the disturbance intensified , reaching tropical storm strength on August 28 and subsequently hurricane intensity on August 30 . The hurricane passed within 85 mi ( 135 km ) of Cape Hatteras before recurving towards the northeast . The hurricane continued to intensify , and reached peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 38 inHg ) , though these statistical peaks were achieved at different times on September 2 . Afterwards , the hurricane began a weakening trend as it proceeded northeastward , and had degenerated into a tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on Nova Scotia later that day . The storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the next day while making another landfall on New Brunswick . The extratropical remnants persisted into Quebec before merging with a larger extratropical system late on September 3 . 
 Despite not making landfall on the United States , the hurricane caused widespread damage . Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast , particularly in New England . The heightened precautions were due in part to fears that effects from the storm would be similar to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior . Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey , where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall , peaking at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in the town of Ewan . This would make the storm the wettest in state history . The resultant floods damaged infrastructure , mostly to road networks . Damage in the state amounted to $ 4 million . Farther north in New England , strong winds were reported , though damage remained minimal . Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada , damage too was minimal , and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves . Overall , the hurricane caused seven fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the hurricane can be traced to a compact and slow @-@ moving low @-@ pressure area in the open Atlantic Ocean in late August 1940 . As the system progressed in a west @-@ northwest direction , its center of circulation became more organized . As a result , the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda at 1200 UTC on August 26 . Operationally , the storm was analyzed to have undergone tropical cyclogenesis on August 30 . However , a reanalysis of the storm conducted in 2012 found that the system was already organized prior . In its initial stages , the depression remained weak , with few ships reporting abnormally strong winds in association with the storm . Continuing in a slow west @-@ northwest movement , the disturbance gradually intensified , and was analyzed to have attained tropical storm intensity by 1800 UTC on August 28 . At 0600 UTC on August 30 , the tropical storm strengthened further into the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 1 hurricane , roughly 225 mi ( 360 km ) east of the Florida peninsula . At the same time , the hurricane began to intensify and move quicker than it had previously . Later that day , a ship within the periphery of the storm reported winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 979 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 90 inHg ) . 
 At 1200 UTC on September 1 , the hurricane attained modern @-@ day Category 2 intensity . Ships continued to report strong winds and low pressures associated with the storm . Early on September 1 , the hurricane passed 85 mi ( 135 km ) of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , before recurving towards the northeast and away from the coast . That same day , two ships reported hurricane @-@ force winds . At 0200 UTC on September 2 , the American steamboat Franklin K. Lane reported a barometric pressure of 965 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 50 inHg ) while located within the hurricane 's radius of maximum wind ; this would be the lowest pressure measured in association with the tropical cyclone and the lowest measured in the entire North Atlantic Ocean in September 1940 . Based on the ship observation , the storm was analyzed to have reached peak intensity on September 2 with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 961 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 38 inHg ) . However , stronger winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) were analyzed to have been present in the hurricane earlier . As it traversed though more northerly latitudes , the storm began to gradually weaken . The storm made landfall slightly northwest of Yarmouth , Nova Scotia at 2100 UTC later on September 2 as a tropical storm with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . After quickly passing over Nova Scotia , the weakening tropical storm transitioned into an extratropical storm over the Bay of Fundy at 0000 UTC on September 3 . At the same time , the cyclone made a second landfall on New Brunswick as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . The extratropical system progressed over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm at 1800 UTC later that day in Quebec just north of Anticosti Island . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and aftermath = = 
 As the hurricane approached the United States East Coast on August 31 , the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England . Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington , North Carolina and the Virginia Capes . These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater . Strong winds exceeding gale @-@ force were expected for much of the East Coast , particularly for Cape Hatteras . On September 1 , hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras , North Carolina to Pamlico Sound , while previously issued storm warnings remained in place . On September 2 , gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket , Massachusetts . In Norfolk , Virginia , city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties . United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast . United States Navy personnel were detained in New London , Connecticut until the storm passed . In Westhampton , New York , a mass evacuation occurred , involving 10 @,@ 000 residences . Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled , and 100 airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground . Police and firemen evacuated a 50 mi ( 80 km ) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline . This included Roy Carpenter 's Beach , where 1 @,@ 000 families were forced to evacuate . In Narragansett Bay , boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore . The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior . 
 On September 1 , the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while near the hurricane 200 mi ( 320 km ) southeast of the Frying Pan Shoals . United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk , Virginia and Morehead City , North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship . Off of the East Coast , an offshoot of the hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people . In the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , the passing hurricane 's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi @-@ stationary over the area . The cyclone 's flow pattern enhanced the moisture environment over the region , resulting in locally heavy rainfall , particularly in New Jersey , where precipitation peaked at 24 in ( 610 mm ) in Ewan in a nine @-@ hour period on September 1 . This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history . Most of the rain was in western portions of the state , however , with minimal rainfall at the coast . The floods caused small rivers to overflow , breaching dams . An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township , rendering 2 @,@ 000 people homeless . Rail service between Philadelphia , Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks . Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone . Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $ 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . In Camden County , damage was estimated at $ 1 million . Four fatalities were reported as a result of the floods . In Delaware , rainfall was comparatively less . However , rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $ 50 @,@ 000 in damages and one death . Further north , strong gusts were reported across New England . Winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket . Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . In Eastport , Maine , winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) were reported . 
 After the storm , New Jersey state health department investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility for an increase in typhoid fever in flooded areas . In Woodbury , where the city pumping station was flooded , water was rationed . Gas service was also limited in Woodbury , <unk> , Penns Grove . As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro , electricity was rationalized in Hammonton , forcing residents to eat uncooked food . Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters . 
 Despite making two separate landfalls in Atlantic Canada on September 2 and September 3 , the hurricane caused minimal damage . Effects in Nova Scotia were limited to boating incidents . In Lake Milo , near Yarmouth , six yachts capsized due to the strong winds . In New Brunswick , damage was also minimal . A car accident associated with the storm injured a man near Barnesville .

 The 2007 French Grand Prix ( formally the <unk> Grand Prix de France ) was a Formula One motor race held on 1 July 2007 at the Circuit de Nevers Magny @-@ Cours , Magny @-@ Cours , France . It was the eighth race of the 2007 Formula One season . The 70 @-@ lap race was won by Kimi Räikkönen for the Ferrari team after starting from third position . Felipe Massa , who started the race from pole position , finished second in the latter Ferrari , with Lewis Hamilton third in a McLaren car . 
 Massa controlled most of the race from the front , but Räikkönen overtook him during the second round of pit stops to take the lead .

 Following the United States Grand Prix , the Formula One teams headed to Silverstone for a three @-@ day test . Nine teams participated , with the exception of Honda and Super Aguri , who opted to test at the Jerez circuit . Neither Ferrari nor McLaren were fastest on the first two days at Silverstone , rather it was Toyota that was fastest on both of the days . However , on the third and final day of testing Felipe Massa put Ferrari on top with a time of 1 : 20 @.@ 805 . The nearest challenger , Nico Rosberg was 0 @.@ 469 behind , with Fernando Alonso a further 0 @.@ 010 behind . With Ferrari fastest on the third day , both of their drivers , Massa and Kimi Räikkönen were very confident heading into the French round of the season . 
 Off track Ferrari launched a criminal investigation in Modena against their own employee Nigel Stepney . Stepney 's lawyer ruled out sabotage claims , and Stepney said it was part of a " dirty tricks " campaign . 
 There was also controversy at the rear @-@ end of the grid , as Spyker asked the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) to look at the new updates that were put on the Super Aguri at Indianapolis to see whether the Aguri team are receiving current Honda parts . On Saturday , Super Aguri 's managing director Daniel <unk> said " We have rules – they [ Spyker ] can just protest . Tell them to protest – if I have something to complain about , I will make a protest . " 
 Robert Kubica was back in his BMW after his crash at the Canadian Grand Prix . Early on Saturday , Nick Heidfeld was cleared to continue in his BMW after experiencing back pains during Friday practice . 
 = = = Practice = = = 
 Ferrari dominated both practice sessions on the Friday , with Räikkönen fastest in the first Practice Session and Felipe Massa was fastest in the second Practice Session . Behind the Ferraris , Alonso was third in his McLaren , but seven tenths behind , with his team @-@ mate and World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton sixth , but lost nearly an hour of the session due to car trouble . The two McLarens were split by David Coulthard and Nico Rosberg . 
 Hamilton managed to recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session on Friday afternoon . The Ferraris were still leading , but Massa was fastest , just 0 @.@ 035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen . However , one of the major surprises came from Scuderia Toro Rosso , as Scott Speed posted the third quickest time , with Vitantonio Liuzzi posting the fifth quickest time . During the session , Liuzzi was involved in a bizarre incident with Anthony Davidson ; Davidson exited his garage , and smashed his Super Aguri into the side of Liuzzi 's Toro Rosso ; knocking his front wing off in the accident . Alonso finished the second practice session eighth . 
 In the final practice session on Saturday morning , Hamilton managed to beat Ferrari , with the Englishman ahead of second @-@ placed Massa by 0 @.@ 063 seconds . Hamilton and the two Ferraris completed the top three , but Alonso was again down in eighth , having missed nearly the whole of the session with a faulty brake sensor . The Renaults sparked a return to form with Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella fourth and fifth , both ahead of rivals BMW , who were sixth and fifteenth respectively .

 Both Spykers and both Super <unk> were knocked out of the first phase of qualifying , along with Alexander Wurz 's Williams and Vitantonio Liuzzi 's Toro Rosso . For Super Aguri 's Takuma Sato , it did not matter where he qualified , as he was docked ten places , due to overtaking Jenson Button under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix . Spykers Adrian Sutil was hoping for a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying . At the front end of the grid , the McLarens were first and fourth , with Hamilton on top , and the Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth . Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the top five . 
 David Coulthard failed to complete a single timed lap in the second part of qualifying due to a gearbox problem , and started sixteenth . Both Hondas were knocked out also , along with Mark Webber , Scott Speed and Ralf Schumacher . Both Button and Barrichello were happier with the upgraded Honda , with Button saying " the car is certainly better than the last race in Indianapolis , although the positions don 't reflect that " . Hamilton was again fastest in Part two , with team @-@ mate Alonso down in fifth . Massa , Räikkönen and Kubica rounded out the top four . 
 After topping the first two parts of qualifying , Hamilton dropped to second in the third and final part , with Massa taking pole position , just 0 @.@ 070 ahead of the Englishman . Massa stated in the post @-@ Qualifying press conference that " it looks like we [ Ferrari ] are back and fighting " , with Hamilton believing pole was possible had he not made a mistake at Turn 15 . Räikkönen qualified third as he lost time on one corner , which he called " all my fault " . Alonso was unable to complete a single lap in the session due to a gearbox problem . He was classified tenth and stated that he 'd " prefer a wet race " . Behind Räikkönen was Kubica in fourth , but despite qualifying fifth , Giancarlo Fisichella believed there was " potential for more " from the Renault . Fisichella 's team @-@ mate Kovalainen was sixth , with Nick Heidfeld seventh . Jarno Trulli , Nico Rosberg and Alonso rounded out the top ten . Rosberg also had a slight gearbox problem in the final part of qualifying , which he believed cost him a few tenths coming into the final few corners .

 Backlash ( 2006 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , which took place on April 30 , 2006 , at the Rupp Arena in Lexington , Kentucky . It was presented by Topps . It was the eighth event under the Backlash name and featured wrestlers and other talent that performed on the Raw brand .

 The event received 273 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , which was more than the previous year 's event received . This contributed to WWE 's pay @-@ per @-@ view revenue increasing by $ 4 @.@ 3 million from the previous year . When the event was released on DVD , it peaked at second on Billboard 's DVD sales chart for recreational sports .

 Backlash featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots , and storylines that were played out on Raw . Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension , and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches . All wrestlers were from World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) ' s Raw brand — a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name . 
 The main event at Backlash was a triple threat match , a match involving three wrestlers , for the WWE Championship between John Cena , Triple H , and Edge . The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match , a multi @-@ competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but participated in the 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament , where the winner would become the number @-@ one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania . Triple H won the tournament . Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him to submit to the STFU , a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent . The next night on Raw , one of WWE 's primary television programs , Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship , but Edge and Lita ( Edge 's girlfriend ) interrupted Triple H 's segment . Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year 's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot , that he won at WrestleMania 21 , and defeating Cena at the event , after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber , a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders . Cena , however , reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble , when he defeated Edge . Edge claimed that it was time for a new opponent for the WWE Championship , after stating that at WrestleMania , Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena . All three men had a series of Handicap matches , a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two , or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena 's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat , a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree , Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU , and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him . It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash . 
 Another rivalry heading into the event was Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon versus Shawn Michaels and God . This feud started on December 26 , 2005 , when Vince McMahon made note of Bret Hart 's DVD , claiming that he " tricked " Hart in the hours of his match at Survivor Series 1997 , where Hart lost the WWE Championship to Shawn Michaels . At the event , Michaels applied Hart 's own finisher , the Sharpshooter , and McMahon called for the bell , in an event known as the " Montreal Screwjob " . Michaels interrupted McMahon and told him to " let it go " and " move on " from the events of Survivor Series . In reply McMahon told Michaels that he indeed screwed Bret Hart and added , " Shawn , do not make me screw you . " At the Royal Rumble , Shane McMahon made a surprising appearance when he eliminated Michaels from the Rumble match , though Shane was not a participant . McMahon informed Michaels that he would face his son Shane on the March 18 , 2006 , edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event in a No Holds Barred match . At the event , Vince interfered throughout the match on his son 's behalf , by stopping the referee 's count , after Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music , a move which sees the wrestler use the sole of the foot to strike an opponent 's head or chin on Shane , an enraged Michaels grabbed McMahon but before he could do anything , Shane hit Michaels with a low blow . McMahon ordered Shane to apply the Sharpshooter on Michaels , and , after he executed the submission move , McMahon called for the bell , similar to the 1997 Survivor Series match . Mr. McMahon booked himself and Michaels in a No Holds Barred match at WrestleMania 22 . At WrestleMania , the Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon interfered on McMahon 's behalf , but Michaels defeated Vince McMahon after he performed Sweet Chin Music and captured the pinfall victory . The next night on Raw , The McMahons confronted Michaels and informed him that his win at WrestleMania was " an act of God , " therefore setting up the tag team match at Backlash that would have The McMahons facing Michaels and God . 
 The Divas rivalry between Mickie James and Trish Stratus over the WWE Women 's Championship continued entering the event . Stratus and James first fought over the title at New Year 's Revolution , with Stratus retaining . In the months that followed , James ' obsession with Stratus grew to the point that she confessed to Stratus that she was in love with her ; making Stratus uncomfortable . James made one final attempt to kiss Stratus at Saturday Night 's Main Event on March 18 , after the duo defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria . After she was rebuffed , James attacked Stratus and later vowed to destroy her , turning James into a villainess . At WrestleMania 22 , the evil James defeated Stratus to capture the Women 's Championship for the first time in her career . In the following weeks , James continued her mind games by dressing like Stratus and claiming to be her . Stratus eventually confronted James by dressing like her and mocking her personality . It was later announced that a Women 's Championship rematch between James and Stratus would take place at Backlash .

 Before the event aired live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , Goldust defeated Rob Conway in a match that aired on Heat . Goldust won the match after a powerslam , a move where the wrestler performing the slam falls face @-@ down on top of his opponent .

Umaga defeated Flair after hitting Flair in the throat with his thumb . The third match was between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women 's Championship . The match had escalated outside the ring . When Stratus delivered punches to Mickie , who was on the second turnbuckle , Mickie threw her over the top rope , causing Stratus to land on her right arm . Afterwards , Mickie choked Stratus with a wristband she was wearing that fell off during the match , therefore giving the win to Stratus by disqualification , but per WWE regulations , a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship . 
 The next match was for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam and Shelton Benjamin . Both Van Dam and Benjamin started the match with high spots as Benjamin performed a Sunset Flip Powerbomb , a move in which a wrestler will roll / flip over an elevated opponent facing them in a reverse body scissors and use the momentum to pull the opponent down to the floor . The match went back and forth with action , but in the end Van Dam performed a body splash , known in wrestling as a frog splash , from the top turnbuckle on Benjamin and pinned him to win the match and retain his Money in the Bank briefcase and win the Intercontinental Championship .

Vince then pinned Michaels for the win . 
 The main event was the Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship between champion John Cena , Edge , and Triple H. As the match began , Edge chose to stand outside the ring , hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves . Cena and Triple H , however , teamed up and turned against Edge . One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost , which made Triple H bleed as a result . Afterwards , Edge drove Triple H 's head through a table and then focused on Cena . Cena , however , locked Edge in the STFU , but was broken when Triple H hit Cena in the head with a microphone . Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair , sending him over the security wall and into the audience .

 Werner Erhard : The Transformation of a Man , The Founding of est is a biography of Werner Erhard by philosophy professor William Warren Bartley , III . The book was published in 1978 by Clarkson Potter . Bartley was professor of philosophy at California State University and had studied with philosopher Karl Popper . He was the author of several books on philosophy , including a biography about Ludwig Wittgenstein . Prior to writing the book , Bartley was a friend of Erhard 's and was involved in his company Erhard Seminars Training ( est ) . While writing the book , Bartley was paid US $ 30 @,@ 000 in the role of philosophical consultant for est . Erhard wrote a foreword to the book . The book 's structure describes Erhard 's education , transformation , reconnection with his family , and the theories of the est training . 
 The book became a bestseller and was well received by graduates of the est training . Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard , and a number of critics felt that it was unduly so , or lacked objectivity , citing Bartley 's close relationship to Erhard . Responses to the writing were mixed ; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining , others felt the tone was too slick , promotional , or hagiographic .

 Werner Erhard ( born John Paul Rosenberg ) , a California @-@ based former salesman , training manager and executive in the encyclopedia business , created the Erhard Seminars Training ( est ) course in 1971 @.@ est was a form of Large Group Awareness Training , and was part of the Human Potential Movement. est was a four @-@ day , 60 @-@ hour self @-@ help program given to groups of 250 people at a time . The program was very intensive : each day would contain 15 – 20 hours of instruction . During the training , est personnel utilized jargon to convey key concepts , and participants had to agree to certain rules which remained in effect for the duration of the course . Participants were taught that they were responsible for their life outcomes , and were promised a dramatic change in their self @-@ perception . 
 By 1977 over 100 @,@ 000 people completed the est training , including public figures and mental health <unk> est was widely ridiculed in the popular press and aroused a great deal of controversy . William S. McGurk , a lecturer in Clinical Psychology at Brown University , summarized : 
 Est promises dramatic awakening to its participants by enhancing the capacity to experience oneself . Trainees are given the opportunity to re @-@ examine those belief systems and reflex patterns of living that keep their lives from working . Notions of self @-@ responsibility are central in which we become cause rather than effect through choosing the inevitable . We can be the directors of our own determined fate . 
 Needless to say , accounts of est are fraught with controversy and criticisms abound . Its major critics suggest that est is simply brainwashing . They also suggest that it is fascistic , <unk> , and too superficial . Nevertheless , what follow @-@ up studies have been done report strong evidence in favor of positive health changes among the respondents after the training ( even though est claims not to be a form of therapy ) Space does not allow for a thorough review of est ’ s principles here . Let it suffice to say that est appears to have a powerful effect on people ’ s lives in a short two weekends . 
 In 1985 , Werner Erhard and Associates repackaged the course as " The Forum " , a seminar focused on " goal @-@ oriented breakthroughs " . 
 By 1988 , approximately one million people had taken some form of the trainings . In the early 1990s Erhard faced family problems , as well as tax problems that were eventually resolved in his favor . In 1991 a group of his associates formed the company Landmark Education , purchasing The Forum 's course " technology " from Erhard .

 William Warren Bartley , III , professor of philosophy at California State University , prior to writing his biography on Erhard , had authored The Retreat to Commitment , on the epistemology of Sir Karl Popper ; Wittgenstein , a biography of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein ; edited Lewis Carroll 's Symbolic Logic ; and authored a book titled , Morality and Religion . Bartley was first introduced to est in March 1972 by a doctor whom he had consulted about his nine @-@ year struggle with insomnia . Finding his insomnia cured , he became very involved in the est organization , and served for several years as the company 's philosophical consultant . He received payments of over US $ 30 @,@ 000 in this capacity during the two years he spent writing the book . He also served on the " Advisory Board " of est . Bartley interviewed a number of individuals who were involved in his subject 's life and made use of quotations from a wide array of sources . Bartley commented on his subject in an article on the book in The Evening Independent , stating : " He 's not a huckster , although he 's a great salesman . I think he 's a very good man , a very important man . ... He 's a fascinating man . People are interested in him . "

 Life story 
 The book recounts how Erhard 's childhood events , job positions and self @-@ education lead to the development of the est training . Born Jack Rosenberg , Erhard was an inquisitive child who was close to his mother . In his student years , he read profusely and earned superior grades . As a teenager , <unk> experienced both conflicts with his mother and a growing dissatisfaction with his life . Shortly after graduating from high school he married his girlfriend Pat Campbell , who had become pregnant . Instead of pursuing his plans for higher education , he took on a variety of jobs including meat @-@ packing , heating and plumbing , estimating and selling cars . By the age of 21 , Erhard had become the top car salesman at the dealership he worked for . By the time he was 25 , Erhard and his wife had four children and he was feeling increasingly restless and constrained . He formed a friendship with a woman named June Bryde , which gradually deepened into an affair . He secretly arranged a flight from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania with June in 1960 , leaving behind his wife and their four children , who would not hear from him for twelve years . The couple settled for a time in St Louis , and it was at this time that he changed his name to Werner Erhard with June changing hers to Ellen Erhard . After more work in car sales , Erhard joined the sales staff of Parents Magazine and was rapidly promoted to training manager and eventually appointed Vice @-@ President in 1967 . During this period Erhard moved frequently to different parts of the US as dictated by the demands of the job , finally settling in San Francisco . When Parents Magazine was sold to the Time @-@ Life group , he was recruited by the Grolier Society as Divisional Manager . According to Grolier vice @-@ president John Wirtz the intention of appointing Erhard was that he would bring “ integrity , honesty and straightforwardness ” to their sales practices . 
 Personal search and self @-@ education 
 Shortly after moving to St. Louis Erhard began to embark on a program of inquiry and self @-@ education . Initially he focused on self @-@ improvement books such as Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and Psycho @-@ Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz . From there , he widened his search to Human Potential Movement psychologists such as Abraham <unk> and Carl Rogers , a range of traditional Western philosophers , and Eastern disciplines such as Zen Buddhism , Taoism , Confucianism , Subud and the Martial arts as well as contemporary movements including Mind Dynamics , and Scientology . 
 Creating the est training 
 Bartley recounts a revelation that Erhard said he had experienced in March 1971 while driving into San Francisco , California to work at Grolier Society . Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like : " What happened had no form . It was timeless , unbounded , ineffable , beyond language . " He told Bartley that he realized : " I had to ' clean up ' my life . I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life . I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family , or Ellen ( his second wife ) , or anyone else , to be different from the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was . " His desire to share this experience led to the plans formed later that year to create the est training . The first promotional seminar was held in September with over one thousand attendees , and the first est training took place in October 1971 in a San Francisco hotel . In October 1972 , while leading an est session in New York , Erhard realized that the time had come to reconnect with his family after an absence of 12 years . Although his long absence from his family caused them feelings of confusion and pain , he re @-@ established cordial and loving relationships with all of them . His brother and sister became est Trainers and took on prominent roles in the business . He also set up a separate business venture for Ellen that gave her the financial freedom to choose how to structure her life and her relationship with him . 
 Key concepts of the est training as defined by Erhard and described in the book include : 
 Completion : the acknowledgement of actions or decisions taken in the past , and the taking of steps to bring a resolution . 
 Rackets : behavior patterns ostensibly involving complaints about people in one ’ s life , but actually resulting in the perpetuation of the complaint and the securing of a payoff such as dominating the other person . 
 Integrity : being whole and complete , and honoring one ’ s word . In the est context the word is used to depict a matter of workability , rather than with the moral overtones it has in everyday usage . 
 Stories : the interpretations of experiences which are regarded as reality , leading to conflict with other people who have created differing interpretations of the same events . 
 Responsibility : the willingness to accept oneself as the source of outcomes in life – whether welcome or unwelcome – rather than blaming others for them . 
 Intersections 
 The biographical chapters on Erhard are interspersed with chapters that Bartley refers to as “ Intersections ” . These chapters contain Bartley ’ s scholarly overview and analysis of the various disciplines that Werner Erhard explored before founding the est training . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The book was a bestseller in 1978 , taking 8th place on the TIME non @-@ fiction bestseller list of November 20 , 1978 . Bartley told The Evening Independent in February 1979 that the book had sold a total of 110 @,@ 000 copies and gone through five editions . The growing numbers of est graduates contributed to strong sales . 
 Jonathan Lieberson , writing for The New York Review of Books , described the book as " attractively written , never shrill or unduly proselytizing , careful to avoid the hysteria and tribalism that usually characterize the early years of movements like est " , but considered Bartley to have " fallen " for Erhard . Given Bartley 's previous work , Lieberson stated , he might have made an ideal interpreter of Erhard , but he found this expectation " disappointed [ although ] the book is nevertheless instructive " . A review of Werner Erhard in Kirkus Reviews similarly concluded , " Too entranced to be truly objective , Bartley is nonetheless an insightfully partial observer . " Booklist stated that Bartley , as an est student , had made the " mistake of being too close to his subject to be objective or critical . " 
 In Psychology Today , Morris B. <unk> stated that Bartley had written his biography of Erhard " carefully , lovingly , and well " . Kris Jeter , writing in Cults and the Family , commented that " wise researchers know and teach that one should be in love with their research topic " , and counted Bartley 's book among several in which " this love was highly evident " . Steve <unk> , in the Pacific Sun , said that the book was " clearly written and , while basically sympathetic " was not " an adulatory ' house job ' . " <unk> found the sections detailing Erhard 's " soap opera " , making up three @-@ quarters of the book , the easiest to read , while the " intersections " , passages in which Bartley provided concise summaries of the philosophical traditions underpinning Erhard 's est training , were tougher but ultimately rewarding . 
 Kenneth Wayne Thomas , in Intrinsic Motivation at Work , described the book as " somewhat sympathetic " to Erhard and the est philosophy ; Steve Jackson , writing in Westword , similarly included it among " books sympathetic to Erhard , est and Landmark " , written by an " old friend of Erhard 's " . Stephen Goldstein , in a Washington Post review , said Bartley had made it " obvious from the start that he cares about his subject and his own est experience " and had told " a rather simple , straightforward story that pretty much lets you draw your own conclusions [ about Erhard ] or keep the ones you have already reached . " A reviewer in Choice : Current Reviews for Academic Libraries stated he was " enthusiastic about this book " , praising the " personal quality [ of ] the narrative , which , though , sometimes becomes overly detailed . " He highly recommended the book for general and college libraries focused on the social sciences . 
 Other commentators felt that the book was unduly favourable to Erhard . A review of the book in The Christian Century stated that Bartley had got " sucked into " writing a " promo on Erhard , founder of one of the pseudo @-@ therapies of the ' 70s . " The Los Angeles Times commented that " [ Bartley 's ] philosophical justification of est as a mishmash of totalitarianism , <unk> and existentialism makes this book more a public relations product than an objective study . " A Chicago Tribune review described the book as a " painstaking [ ... ] act of devotion " that nevertheless failed in its mission : " No one reading it is likely to agree with Bartley that the founder of est is a philosopher and spiritual leader of Gandhian magnitude except the already convinced . " James R. Fisher , in Six Silent Killers : Management 's Greatest Challenge , and Suzanne Snider , writing for The Believer magazine , referred to Bartley 's book as a " hagiography " , and Rachel Jones of <unk> considered the book " sycophantic " . A review in The Evening Independent described Bartley as Erhard 's " friend and admitted booster " , telling his " often @-@ sordid story in detail . " E. C. Dennis , writing for Library Journal , found that Bartley 's work " has a slick tone and more than a trace of hero worship " . Dennis acknowledged that the book gave " the full details of Erhard 's ' soap opera , ' often in his own words , " but was critical of Bartley 's writing , saying he cast " a Freud 's @-@ eye @-@ view on his subject 's youthful failings , but after the famous ' transformation ' his tone becomes almost reverential . " Dennis stated that the book failed to ask important questions , but that large public libraries should carry a copy , given its status as an " authorized " biography .

 Major @-@ General Humphrey Atherton , ( <unk> – September 16 , 1661 ) an early settler of Dorchester , Massachusetts , held the highest military rank in colonial New England . He first appeared in the records of Dorchester on March 18 , 1637 and made freeman May 2 , 1638 . He became a representative in the General Court in 1638 and 1639 – 41 . In 1653 , he was Speaker of the House , representing Springfield , Massachusetts . He was chosen assistant governor , a member of the lower house of the General Court who also served as magistrate in the judiciary of colonial government , in 1654 , and remained as such until his death . " He was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts and held the ranks of lieutenant and captain for several years before rising to the rank of major @-@ general . He also organized the first militia in Massachusetts . 
 It is unclear where and when Atherton was born . It is presumed he came from Lancashire , England . He was active in the governance of the colony , taking part in the acquisition of Native American lands , the persecution of Quakers , and the apprehension and convictions of heretics . His accidental death was seen by the Quakers as a punishment from God for his persecution of them , an idea repeated in a play by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . He was one of the most successful land speculators in the New England colonies . He and his wife , Mary , had a number of children and several New England families have traced their ancestry to them . He is interred at Dorchester North Burying Ground , one of the oldest cemeteries in New England .

 Humphrey Atherton 's date and place of birth are uncertain . It has been presumed by some that he was born in Lancashire , England , because the name Atherton is prominent there . However , genealogist Robert Charles Anderson , in The Great Migration , states that this " does not come close to constituting proof of origin . " The date of 1608 is sometimes given as his date of birth because Edmund Atherton of Wigan Lancashire , England died in 1612 leaving , as his heir , a four @-@ year @-@ old son named Humphrey . However , Duane Hamilton Hurd , in History of Norfolk County , Massachusetts stated that Atherton was 36 years old when he died in 1661 . On the other hand , Charles Samuel Hall in Hall Ancestry , pointed out that when Atherton was made freeman and was granted property in 1638 , " he must at that time reached his majority . " 
 A descendant of his , Charles H. Atherton , said that Humphrey Atherton , his wife and three young children arrived at the colony in the ship James , August 7 , 1635 , but there is no record of this . His descendant further said that Atherton and his wife were each about 15 years old when they were married . 
 There is a record of Nathaniel Wales having voyaged on the James . Wales referred to Humphrey Atherton as his " brother @-@ in @-@ law " in his will , so it has been assumed that Atherton 's wife , Mary , was Wales ' sister . However , the term may have been used because Atherton 's daughter , Isabel , was married to Nathaniel Wales , Jr . The identity of his wife is unknown . 
 = = Political and military life = = 
 Atherton had a very active public life having power and taking part in the law making , enforcing and interpreting affairs of the colony . Subsequent to his acceptance as a freeman , in 1638 , he was frequently selectman or treasurer , and for several years a member of the Court of Assistants which gave him a say in the appointment of governors as well as judicial power in criminal and civil matters . In 1638 and 1639 – 41 he was a governor 's assistant in the General Court , and in 1653 , he was Speaker of the House , leader of the Court of Deputies , which was the lower house of the General Court , representing Springfield , Massachusetts . He was also " long a justice of the peace , and solemnized many marriages " . One of the marriages over which he officiated was that of Myles Standish , Jr. and Sarah Winslow . 
 Atherton was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery and he organized the first trained band ( militia ) in Dorchester . As Major @-@ General in the Suffolk Regiment , he was the senior military officer in New <unk> which included the responsibilities of subduing and controlling Native Americans and apprehending criminals , such as those accused of heresy . 
 In 1644 he [ Atherton ] was sent , with Captains Johnson and Cook , to Narragansett to arrest and try Samuel Gorton for heresy . It is hoped that Gorton 's complaint of his treatment was exaggerated , for he said , in passing through Dorchester . ' A large concourse of persons assembled with several ministers to witness the passage of the troops , and the prisoners were stationed apart and volleys of musketry fired over their heads in token of victory . ' " 
 = = = Other persecutions = = = 
 Harlow Elliot <unk> , in Epitaphs from the Old Burying Ground in Dorchester , said that Atherton had believed in witches and " felt it to be a duty which he owed to God and to his Country to mete out to the poor creatures , against whom accusations were brought , the punishment , which , in his opinion , they so richly merited . " Woodward said that , in his capacity as assistant , Atherton had been instrumental in bringing about the execution of Mrs. Ann Hibbins , a wealthy widow , who was executed for witchcraft on June 19 , 1656 . Hibbins was later fictionalized in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter . In that book she was depicted as the sister of Governor Bellingham . 
 Atherton was involved in the persecution of Quakers and there are two incidents in particular that the Quakers wrote about in relationship to Atherton . First , the case of Mary Dyer , a Quaker who was executed in 1660 after returning to Boston despite banishment . Atherton was assistant governor at the time , and at her hanging he was said to have remarked , " She hangs there like a flag . " The Quakers understood this comment to be an insulting boast . 
 Secondly , there was the case of Wenlock Christison , a Quaker who had repeatedly returned to Massachusetts despite banishment , whose trial in May , 1661 put an end to the execution of Quakers . He was sentenced to death , but the law was changed soon after , and he was not executed . He was the last Quaker to be sentenced to death in Massachusetts . The Quakers believed that during an altercation between the accused and Atherton at the trial , Christison prophesied the outcome of his trial as well as the circumstances of Atherton 's untimely death . Quaker writer George Bishop wrote , " Yea , Wenlock Christison , though they did not put him to death , yet they sentenced him to die , so that their cruel purposes were nevertheless . I cannot forbear to mention what he spoke , being so prophetical , not only as to the judgment of God coming on Major @-@ general <unk> , but as to their putting any more Quakers to death after they had passed sentence on him . " Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recreated the Christison trial in his play John Endicott which included the damnation of Atherton by the accused . 
 = = Relationship with Native Americans = = 
 Ebenezer Clapp , in The History of Dorchester said of Atherton , " He had great experience and skill in the treatment of the Indians , with whom his public duties brought him in frequent contact . He manifested much humanity and sympathy for their ignorant and degraded condition , but exercised great energy and decision of character when necessary . " In 1637 the colonists had sided with the Mohegans in the Pequot War , which wiped out most of the Pequot people . By the early 1640s tensions were building between the Mohegans and the Narragansetts . " In 1645 , the New England Colonies met by representatives to consult upon the Indian problem , and appointed a Council of War ; Capt. Miles Standish , of Plymouth , was chairman . Mason of Connecticut , Leverett and Atherton of Massachusetts , were the other councilors " . 
 The New England colonies , with the exception of Rhode Island , formed a confederation called " The Four United Colonies of New England " . Rhode Island , according to The Proceedings of the Rhode Island Historical Society , 1881 – 1882 , was excluded , not for reasons of religious differences , but because its founder , Roger Williams , had been banished from Massachusetts " for denying the right of the magistrates to take the lands of the Indians with out compensating the owners " . The United Colonies obtained Narragansett lands within the boundaries of Rhode Island by putting in motion a series of events that began with their promise of aid to the Mohegan Sachem , Uncas , whom they had supported during the Pequot War , if he declared war against the Narragansett Sachem , Miantinomo . During the ensuing war , Miantinomo was captured and brought to the commissioners of the Four United Colonies at Hartford . " After obtaining him as a captive , they could find no excuse for putting him to death ; and , to avoid the responsibility , they referred his case for decision to a convention of ministers in Boston ; [ sic ] Winthrop states , ' Miantinomo was killed near Hartford by a blow on the back of his head with a hatchet . ' " 
 The Connecticut settlers demanded land from Uncas in return for their assistance to him . " Trumbull states , ' Mr. Leffingwell obtained nearly the whole township of Norwich for his services . ' " Miantinomo 's successor , Pessicus , declared war against Uncas and the colonies fined him 2000 fathoms of wampum for causing the hostilities , which he was unable to pay . " 
 " Humphrey Atherton was sent by the commissioners of the Four Colonies , with twenty armed men , to enforce the payment . As stated in Arnold 's history of Rhode Island ( <unk> i . , p . 199 ) , ' Atherton forced his way , pistol in hand , into the wigwam , and , seizing the Sachem by the hair , dragged him out , threatening instant death if any resistance was offered . ' The debt was settled by Pessicus giving a mortgage of all his lands to the commissioners of the Four Colonies . " 
 In 1658 , Atherton came into contact with Native Americans again when he was appointed by the General Court to the post of Superintendent of Indian Affairs , overseeing the praying Indians ; <unk> Indians who had been converted to Christianity by John Eliot . He held that position until his death . " Though a terror to warlike Indians , yet he was the trusted friend of all who were well disposed , helping on their education and Christianizing , and guarding their rights , so that he had immense personal influence with them , and was a successful treaty @-@ maker " . 
 = = Land speculation = = 
 Humphrey Atherton was a successful land speculator . The land he owned in Dorchester included a large portion of South Boston . He also owned a share in what became Milton , Massachusetts . The General Court awarded 500 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) to him for his public service , but because some of it impeded the town on Hadley , Massachusetts , he was given a new grant that had an additional 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) . Since he had represented Springfield in the General Court , he probably owned land in Springfield as well . When he died , his estate was worth 900 pounds , not including much of his land . 
 Atherton " played a key role in fighting and removing Indians from land he later owned . " In 1659 , he and some friends , including Connecticut Governor , John Winthrop , Jr . , made some purchases of land from Native Americans on the western side of Narragansett Bay for which Rhode Island had claimed . The group , referred to as the Atherton Company , circumvented Rhode Island 's law by acquiring the land when the Natives defaulted on a loan . 
 In 1660 , commissioners of the Four Colonies , of whom John Winthrop , Jr. was one , transferred ownership of the mortgage of Pessicus 's land to the Atherton Company for 735 fathoms of wampum . The Company then foreclosed on the mortgage . The land included the Narragansett property within the bounds of Rhode Island . Rhode Island found this transference of land to be illegal and prevented the sale of the land for several years . The company , which changed its name to " Proprietors of the Narragansett Country , " eventually did sell 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 km2 ) of the land to Huguenot immigrants who began a colony there called Frenchtown . The Huguenots lost the land when , in 1688 , a Royal Commission determined the Atherton claim to be illegal . 
 = = Death = = 
 Humphrey Atherton died , September 16 , 1661 , from head injuries sustained in a fall from his horse . He was traveling through Boston Common , on his way home after drilling his troops when his mount collided with a cow . 
 Woodward , aforementioned author of Epitaphs from the Old Burying Ground in Dorchester , said that because of Atherton 's persecution of the Quakers , " they believed his horrible death to be God 's visitation of wrath . " <unk> credits Joseph Besse , a Quaker author , with the following account of Atherton 's death : 
 " ' <unk> <unk> , who at the trial of Wenlock Christison , did , as it were , bid defiance to Heaven , by saying to Wenlock , ' You pronounce <unk> and Judgements , and those that are gone before you pronounced <unk> and Judgements ; but the Judgements of the Lord God are not upon us yet , ' was suddenly surprised : having been , on a certain day , exercising his men with much pomp and ostentation , he was returning home in the evening , near the place where they usually loosed the Quakers from the cart , after they had whipped them , his horse , suddenly affrighted , threw him with such violence , that he instantly died ; his eyes being dashed out of his head , and his brains coming out of his nose , his tongue hanging out at his mouth , and the blood running out at his ears : Being taken up and brought into the Courthouse , the place where he had been active in sentencing the innocent to death , his blood ran through the floor , exhibiting to the spectators a shocking instance of the Divine vengeance against a daring and hardened persecutor ; that made a fearful example of that divine judgment , which , when forewarned of , he had openly despised , and treated with disdain . ' " 
 Longfellow repeated this sentiment in his account of Atherton 's death in the final scene of John Endicott . In the scene Governor Endicott , while speaking to Richard Bellingham , asks if it is true that Humphrey Atherton is dead . Bellingham confirms that he is and adds , " His horse took fright , and threw him to the ground , so that his brains were dashed about the street . " Endicott responds , " I am not superstitions , Bellingham , and yet I tremble lest it may have been a judgment on him . "

 = Para @-@ alpine skiing classification = 
 Para @-@ alpine skiing classification is the classification system for para @-@ alpine skiing designed to ensure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities . The classifications are grouped into three general disability types : standing , blind and sitting . Classification governance is handled by International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing . Prior to that , several sport governing bodies dealt with classification including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ) , International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation ( ISMWSF ) , International Blind Sports Federation ( IBSA ) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) . Some classification systems are governed by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing , such as the Special Olympics . The sport is open to all competitors with a visual or physical disability . It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities . 
 The first classification systems for para @-@ alpine skiing were developed in Scandinavia in the 1960s , with early systems designed for skiers with amputations . At the time , equipment had yet to be developed to allow participation for skiers with spinal cord injuries . The goal of the early classification systems was to be functional but ended up being medical classification systems . At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976 , there were two classifications for the sport . By the 1980s , classification existed for skiers with cerebral palsy . At that time , with inspiration from wheelchair basketball classification , efforts were made to make classification more of a functional system . Ten classes existed by the 1980s , and since then , efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of classification by reducing the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded . 
 Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation . For skiers with visual impairments , guides are used to assist the skier down the course . For standing skiers , different class rules determine what sort of equipment is allowed in competition , such as one pole , two poles or no poles , or one or two skis . Sit skiers use a specially designed ski called a mono @-@ ski . Skiers are classified based on medical assessment , and their body position when they ski . Blind skiers are evaluated purely on a medical assessment . 
 = = Definition = = 
 The para @-@ alpine skiing classification system ensures fair competition in the sport by categorising skiers according to their functional mobility or vision impairment . Classification for amputees is based on their mobility with the use of an assistive device . 
 People with cerebral palsy in classifications from <unk> to CP8 are covered by skiing classifications . Skiers from CP5 to CP8 compete standing up with the use of equipment . The blind classifications are based on medical classification , not functional classification . In 1995 , the classifications for skiing were LW1 , LW2 , LW3 , LW4 , LW5 / 7 , LW6 / 8 , and LW9 , where LW stands for Locomotor Winter . There were three sit @-@ ski classifications : LW10 , LW11 and LW12 . Classification for competitors with cerebral palsy is difficult because the levels of spasticity can change as the race progresses . 
 There are 9 standing classifications , on a gradient of most severe being LW1 and LW9 being the least severe . Sit skiing has three classifications , LW10 , LW11 and LW12 . These are grouped from the most severe at LW10 to least severe at LW12 . LW10 have T5 @-@ T10 paraplegia . 
 In 2010 , there were three vision impaired classifications , B1 , B2 and B3 . These classifications based on a gradient with B1 being the most severe and B3 being the least severe , with B3 skiers having vision around 2 / 60 to 6 / 60 . Beyond the level of vision impairment , research done at the Central Institute on Employment Abilities of the Handicapped in Moscow has found differences in functional capabilities based on differences in visual acuity , which plays a significant role in skiing . 
 In 1997 , one of the international alpine skiing classifiers was <unk> <unk> . She said " Sometimes athletes try to cheat , to hide what they can really do . They are athletes who want to be in a class that is more advantageous to for them . In testing and classification they don 't show what they can really do . They try to show that they are not able to do some movement , and that is why we have started functional testing . " She goes on to say " The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport , you don 't want to punish that person for their good performance . He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance , and you might be tempted to say ' OK , he is doing so well he must be in another class . ' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don 't get , for example , 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports . We try to review the classes , but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult . In winter the aim is to have three classes , like sitting , standing and blind : that is certainly the future that we are all looking to . " 
 = = Governance = = 
 Para @-@ alpine skiing is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing . In the sport 's early history , the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ) , founded in 1964 , governed the sport . In 1980 , there were two governing bodies handling classification , ISOD and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation ( ISMWSF ) . ISMWSF was in charge of classification for athletes with spinal cord related disabilities . In 1981 , the International Blind Sports Federation ( IBSA ) was created , and took over governance for skiers with visual impairments . In 2003 , ISMWSF merged with ISOD , and changed its name to the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation ( IWAS ) in 2004 . 
 While the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy , it is not governed by them . In 1983 , the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the CP @-@ ISRA , but in 2002 , the rules governing the sport , including classification , were set by the 1994 IPC Handbook . In the United States , the sport is governed by Disabled Sports USA for skiers with functional mobility , and governed by the United States Association of Blind Athletes ( USABA ) for skiers with vision impairment , while Special Olympics governs the sport and classification for people with intellectual disabilities . 
 = = Eligibility = = 
 The sport is open to all competitors with a visual or physical disability . It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities . In 1983 , Cerebral Palsy @-@ International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport . They defined cerebral palsy as a non @-@ progressive brain lesion that results in impairment . People with cerebral palsy or non @-@ progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them . The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments . For their classification system , people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco @-@ motor dysfunction . People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete . People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance . Competitors with multiple sclerosis , muscular dystrophy and <unk> were not eligible for classification by CP @-@ ISRA , but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres . The sport was not open to competitors with intellectual disabilities in 2002 . 
 = = History = = 
 The earliest classification systems for the sport were developed in Scandinavia . Classification for winter sport started out as a medical one before moving to a functional system . The original classification system was for amputees , with classification based on the type of amputation as determined by a medical expert . Other classes of disability were not eligible to compete . During the 1970s , equipment was developed for skiers with spinal injuries and a classification system had yet to become fully developed for the sport . 
 Going into the first winter Paralympic Games , the 1976 Winter Paralympics , the organisers had a difference of opinion with Paralympic Games founder Ludwig Guttmann , because they wanted a functional classification , not medical classification system , from the onset . They largely succeeded , although the system that ended up being used was developed in Örnsköldsvik , Sweden , based on equipment utilised by the skier instead of a true functional classification system . The 1976 Winter Paralympics were the first time that classifications other than spinal cord injury classifications competed at the Paralympic Games . There were only two classifications for alpine skiing . One athlete from Austria with a spinal disability as a result of polio competed in an alpine event . He was able to ski from a standing position and competed against amputee skiers . 
 In 1983 , classification for cerebral palsy competitors in alpine skiing was done by the Cerebral Palsy @-@ International Sports and Recreation Association . The classification used the classification system designed for track events . There were five cerebral palsy classifications . During the 1980s , there were 3 sit @-@ ski classes and 7 other classes . During the 1980s , while not formally part of the para @-@ skiing classification system , intellectual disability alpine skiing classes did exist as part of the Special Olympics movement . 
 By 1984 , there were four organisations governing classification for the sport . They included ISOD , ISMGF , IBSA and CP @-@ ISRA . In 1985 , Swedish Brigitta <unk> , Swiss Andre Deville and Austrian Richard <unk> began to develop a classification system for mono @-@ skiing . Their classification system was put into use in competition in 1988 . Prior to 1988 , the classification assessment process generally involved a medical exam to determine the classification . The change in winter disability sport classification towards a more formal functional classification system happened more quickly as a result of changes being made in wheelchair basketball classification that started in 1983 . Sit skiing was not included on the Paralympic programme . Norway worked to change this by added sit skiing classifications to the World Championships in 1986 . The move from a medical classification to a functional classification system was still taking place during the 1990s . Vision impaired , cerebral palsy and amputee classifications representing standing classifications were the only ones eligible for the Paralympics prior to the 1998 Winter Paralympics , when sit @-@ ski classifications were added . By 2002 , there were three vision impaired classifications . 
 For the 2002 Winter Paralympics , for the Winter Paralympics , the Games Classifiers were <unk> <unk> , Bob Harney , Richard <unk> and Dr. Ann @-@ Sophie von <unk> . The Games Classifiers for vision impairment classifications were Roman <unk> , Johan <unk> and Axel <unk> . There were fourteen classifications for the sport , with four of them for sit @-@ skiing , seven for standing and three for vision impairment . A factoring system was used when there were not enough competitors in a class and the classes had to be combined . This was modified for the 2006 Winter Paralympics , with skiers being grouped into one of three categories based on a skiers functional ability : vision impaired , standing and sitting . The 14 classes still exist , but against these three groups with different classes having their results factored based on average historical performances inside that classification . 
 The debate about inclusion of competitors into able @-@ bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst <unk> as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able @-@ bodied sport . At the time , sport administrators were trying to get disability skiing into able bodied competitions like the Olympics . These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme . The sport was one sports people with disabilities were more likely to participate in during the 1990s . 
 During the 1990s , there were conversations about whether or not less @-@ disabled <unk> athletes should be competing in disability winter sport and if they should instead be competing against able bodied competitors . At the same time , there were people including IPC first vice president Jens <unk> who entertained discussions about whether or not blind classifications should be combined into a single class like is done in some other disabilities sports . 
 In 2006 , skiers with amputation still had a medical component to their classification assessment . The three @-@ group classification system , which utilized the Realistic Handicap Competition and <unk> Renn <unk> <unk> ( RHC @-@ <unk> ) , was used for the first time at the Paralympics . The decision to use the RHC @-@ <unk> and limit it to medals for the three groups was made at the IPC Aline Skiing Sports Assembly in October 2004 in order to limit the number of potential medals being offered . It was implemented immediately for all IPC Paralympic Games and IPC World Championships . The system has been criticized because it relies on historical data from individual skiing competitors inside their own class , with out taking into account conditions that could slow a skier such as temperature , visibility and precipitation . 
 Going forward , disability sport 's major classification body , the International Paralympic Committee , is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence @-@ based system as opposed to a performance @-@ based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less . 
 = = Sports = = 
 Three classifications exist for skiers with visual disabilities . Vision impaired skiers generally follow the same rules as sighted skiers laid out by the International Ski Federation . The major difference is skiers in this group follow sighted guides who give the skiers vocal directions on where to ski . The guide for B1 skiers generally skis behind the skier in order to maximize the ability of the skier to hear the guide . The guide tells the skier things like when weight should be shifted , elements coming up on the course , and how to position themselves to maximize the diagonal run of the course . Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently as the skiers have some vision , which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight . 
 Standing skiers generally follow the same rules as sighted skiers laid out by the International Ski Federation . They may wear a prosthesis , use modified length ski poles , and / or use a ski pole called an outrigger that had a small ski on the end . LW1 skiers use two poles but may ski on one or two skis . LW2 skiers use one ski and two poles . LW3 , LW4 skiers use two skis and two poles . LW5 and <unk> skiers do not use poles . LW6 and LW8 skiers use two ski and one pole . 
 Sit skiers generally follow the same rules as sighted skiers laid out by the International Ski Federation . They use a mono @-@ ski , which has a specially fitted chair attached to the single ski . The skiers also use <unk> poles to aid in balance . The monoskis are sometimes called tubs or buckets . Wheelchair users are classified as sit @-@ skiers . 
 Classifications were combined for one event in 2002 when there were fewer than six competitors in a single class . When classes are combined , a percentage system is used to determine the winner of a race . The Canadian Paralympic Committee explains how this works with the following example : " Athlete A is classified as LW6 with a factor of 91 % finishes the race in 1 minute , their final race time is 54 @.@ 6 seconds . Athlete B is classified as LW5 with a factor of 79 % finishes the race in 1 minute and 2 seconds , their final race time is 48 @.@ 98 seconds . Athlete B wins . Therefore , the athlete who completed the race fastest may not be the winner and gold medalist . " 
 = = Process = = 
 In general , classification for all para @-@ alpine skiers looks at which equipment is utilized by a skier and their body position when they ski . Sit @-@ skiers who are in the wheelchair group are assessed based on the residual muscle strength and level of spinal cord injury . For skiers with a visual impairment , their classification is handled by the International Blind Sports Association . They are tested based on medical classification by an Ophthalmologist . 
 For Australian competitors in this sport , the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee . There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors : Provisional , national and international . The first is for club level competitions , the second for state and national competitions , and the third for international competitions . 
 = = At the Paralympic Games = = 
 The sport was introduced at the 1976 Winter Paralympics . At the 1988 Games , the Giant Slalom was an exhibition event for amputee classified skiers . At the 1992 Winter Paralympics , all disability types were eligible to participate , with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee , with classification being done based on blind , amputee and sitting disability types . Downhill was open to the LW classification , the Super G had a blind event and an LW event , the Giant was open to blind and LW classes , and the slalom was open to the LW classification . 
 At the 2002 Winter Paralympics , the blind skiers skied first , followed by the sit skiing classified skiers , with the standing classes skiing last . Going into the Games , skiers had to have their classification recorded by a chief classifier by 14 February 2001 , with the chief classifiers requiring to submit any amendments by 31 March 2001 . This list was then sent to National Paralympic Committees ( NPC ) by 27 April 2001 , with an ability to send in amendments again by 7 August 2001 . Any discrepancies between the IPC list and NPC lists were reviewed in August 2001 . A final master list for classifications was sent by the IPC to the NPCs on 7 September 2001 . On 27 January 2002 , the IPC sent a classification evaluation schedule to NPCs . 
 At the 2010 Winter Paralympics the LW5 and <unk> events were combined , as were LW6 and LW8 events . There were 25 men and 18 women in the downhill standing classes , 25 men and 10 women in the downhill sitting classes , and 12 men and 10 women in the downhill vision impaired classes . In the Super Combined , there were 18 men and 14 women in the standing event , 18 men and 10 women in the sitting classes , and 10 men and 10 women in the vision impaired classes .

 Upon re @-@ joining the party in 1922 , Berchtold became a member of the Sturmabteilung ( " Storm Detachment " ; SA ) , a paramilitary wing formed to protect its speakers at rallies , and to police Nazi meetings . Adolf Hitler , leader of the party since 1921 , ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his protection only instead of a suspected mass of the party in 1923 . Originally the unit was composed of only eight men , commanded by Julius Schreck and Berchtold . It was designated the Stabswache ( " Staff Guard " ) . Later that year , the unit was renamed Stoßtrupp @-@ Hitler ( " Shock Troop @-@ Hitler " ) . 
 On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp , along with the SA and several other paramilitary units , took part in what would become known as the Beer Hall Putsch . The plan was to take control of Munich and then seize total power in Berlin . The coup d 'état failed and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers . In the aftermath of the putsch both Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison . The Nazi Party and all associated formations , including the Stoßtrupp , were officially disbanded . Berchtold then left Germany and fled to Tirol , Austria . Berchtold was tried in absentia before the special People 's Court in Munich in 1924 for his role in the Beer Hall Putsch and sentenced to a prison term . During his time in Austria , Berchtold continued to be involved with Nazi Party activities , even though it was illegal . 
 When Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924 , Berchtold was District Director of the Nazi Party in Carinthia , Austria and was leader of the SA there . After the re @-@ formation of the Nazi Party on 20 February 1925 , he again joined the party , documented as member # 964 . In March 1926 , Berchtold returned to Munich from Austria . He became chief of the SA in Munich .

 On 15 April 1926 , Berchtold became the successor to Schreck as chief of the Schutzstaffel ( " Protection Squadron " ; SS ) , a special elite branch of the party under the control of the SA . Berchtold changed the title of the office position which became known as the Reichsführer @-@ SS . He issued new rules to establish the position of the SS . The rules stated the unit was " ... neither a military organisation nor a group of hangers @-@ on , but a small squad of men that our movement and our Führer can rely on . " He further stressed that the men must follow " only party discipline " . He was considered to be more dynamic than his predecessor , but was still unable to keep the party organizers at bay . He was frustrated in his efforts to have a more independent unit and became disillusioned by the SA 's authority over the SS . On 1 March 1927 , he handed over leadership of the SS to his deputy Erhard Heiden .

 In 1927 , he became a lead writer for Völkischer Beobachter , the Nazi Party newspaper . From 1928 to 1945 , Berchtold was a SA leader on the staff of the Supreme SA leadership ( <unk> ) .

 = = Plot = = 
 The Springfield Elementary School Model United Nations club is going on a field trip . On the bus , Bart , Nelson , Ralph , and Milhouse are playing a game by racing fruit down the aisle . Milhouse rolls a grapefruit that gets stuck under the brakes . When bus driver Otto attempts to press down on the pedal , it squirts juice into his eyes , causing him to lose control and drive the bus off a bridge . 
 Otto attempts to swim for help but ends up being swept away by the current and picked up by Chinese fishermen . The students swim to a nearby tropical island , where Bart tries to tell the children that being stranded on an island is fun . Reality soon sets in when the island is found to be largely barren and the children lack survival skills . With no food found on the island and no adult supervision , the children rely on snack food retrieved from the sunken bus by Bart. They awaken the next morning to find the snacks all gone . Suspecting Milhouse because of his pot @-@ belly and <unk> cheese breath , the students put him on trial and he blames the loss on a mysterious island " monster " . 
 Back at home , Homer discovers that Ned Flanders has his own home @-@ based Internet business , and decides he wants to start his own company . His business is later dismantled by Bill Gates and his goons . 
 As there is insufficient evidence to prove Milhouse ate all the food , he is acquitted . The other students are not happy with this verdict and attempt to kill Milhouse , along with Bart and Lisa , who tried to intervene . The other students end up chasing them into a cave , where it is revealed that Milhouse 's " monster " is actually a wild boar . On one of the boar 's tusks is an empty bag of chips , revealing that it was the actual culprit for eating the snacks . The kids kill the boar and eat it ( except for Lisa , who adheres to her vegetarianism ) . The episode concludes with a comically obvious deus ex machina ending , narrated by James Earl Jones :

 The couch gag was suggested by Dan Castellaneta 's niece . The film True Lies was the inspiration for the bus crashing against the bridge . To get the fisherman 's Chinese correct , Cohen called his friend . When the Chinese actors came , the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin , so it was changed . Moe was picked to rescue the children , because the writers thought it was funny . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Most of the episode 's plot , namely a group of children trapped on an island and the breakdown of law , order and civility , is a reference to William Golding 's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies , but unlike the book , the children on the island are a <unk> . The title comes from the 1981 film Das Boot , although it would be " Der Bus " in German . When the children are squabbling in the classroom , Principal Skinner restores order by banging his shoe on the desk . Skinner 's actions are a reference to the shoe @-@ banging incident by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at the UN in 1960 . When escaping from the other children , Bart , Lisa and Milhouse have to swing across a gap on a vine ; Milhouse goes across first , but refuses to throw the vine back in a reference to the opening scene of the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark , where the same thing happens to Indiana Jones .

 In its original broadcast , " Das Bus " finished 17th in ratings for the week of February 9 – 15 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 9 , equivalent to approximately 9 @.@ 6 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files and King of the Hill . 
 In a 2006 article in USA Today , " Das Bus " was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9 , along with " Trash of the Titans " , " The Last Temptation of Krust " , " The Cartridge Family " , " Dumbbell Indemnity " , and " The Joy of Sect " . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it a " fantastic episode " , adding : " Ignore the Internet business side , and wallow in the cleverness of the children trapped on the island . Bart has never been cleverer , Nelson more menacing , and Milhouse more <unk> . Great stuff with a delightful ending that is so witty and obvious , that it 's annoying you never imagined they 'd get away with it . " 
 The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California , Berkeley , where it is used to " examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects , in this case , a satirical cartoon show " , and to figure out what it is " trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society , and , to a lesser extent , about other societies " . Some questions asked in the courses include : " What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode ? What aspects of them are used to make the points ? How is the satire conveyed : through language ? Drawing ? Music ? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his / her character as developed over the years ? Can we identify elements of the historical / political context that the writers are satirizing ? What is the difference between satire and parody ? "

 It was the first Once Upon a Time episode to be written by consulting producer Jane Espenson , while being directed by Paul Edwards . Espenson was " thrilled " to be assigned the episode ; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people 's stories , so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative . Espenson especially wanted to depict how some , like Jiminy in this episode , " have their adolescence well after adolescence . It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living , and I think a lot of people feel like that . " In addition , the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians .

 In the present day , Dr. Archie Hopper ( Sbarge ) continues to evaluate Henry ( Jared S. Gilmore ) , who is still trying to convince him that he is Jiminy . Meanwhile , Sheriff Graham ( Jamie Dornan ) officially makes Emma Swan ( Jennifer Morrison ) his new deputy . An explosion soon after causes the town to shake , followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft . As Emma , Henry , Archie , and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area , Regina ( Lana Parrilla ) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further , then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket . She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma , and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories . 
 The next day , Archie follows through on Regina 's warning by convincing Henry that the fairy tale stories are not real , upsetting Henry . This prompts Emma to pay a visit to Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him . Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie , but Regina says that Henry is missing again . Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft . There , Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack . Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy , but as they try to escape , an aftershock blocks off the main entrance , leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped . They find an elevator shaft , not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco ( Tony Amendola ) , which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place . 
 Inside the elevator , Henry asks Archie why he refuses to believe that he is Jiminy Cricket . Archie acknowledges that he might share Jiminy 's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past , yearn to be free from being told what to do . Meanwhile , above ground , Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft , where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie . Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother . Regina backs down after Archie 's threat , she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft , where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White 's ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) glass coffin .

At the same time , Kathryn ( Anastasia Griffith ) also continues to visit David , showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits , although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn , to Mary Margaret that he doesn 't remember anything that he saw in the pictures . As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her , she still feels threatened by Kathryn 's presence . This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital .

 " That Still Small Voice " was the first Once Upon a Time episode written by consulting producer Jane Espenson . She was drawn to join the series because she believed a curse involving fairy tale characters was a " fantastic concept " . She explained , " What 's the modern take on Jiminy Cricket and Rumpelstiltskin ? What would their issues be in the real world ? The beauty of the production , the care and the effort and , honestly , the expense that was put into it just made clear that was a project done with a lot of attention and love . " The episode was directed by Lost veteran Paul Edwards . " That Still Small Voice " , featuring Jiminy Cricket , was assigned to Espenson , and she was " thrilled to get it , " as she wanted to explore the character in his own story . She elaborated that Jiminy is 
 Someone who you might think of as being part of someone else ’ s story – even in Pinocchio , he ’ s all about someone else ’ s arc . I like taking that character and reminding us all that everyone is the hero of their own story . I related to him because of that , and also because it was such an identifiable story — the way so many people have their adolescence well after adolescence . It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living , and I think a lot of people feel like that . 
 Actor Raphael Sbarge became attracted to join the series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories , one in a fantasy world and the other in a modern setting . In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost " in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them , effectively on a deep dive . " When Sbarge read the script for " That Still Small Voice " , he was worried about " treading into people 's imaginations , " but ultimately decided that " they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell . " 
 Believing that his character was " sort of a surrogate father figure " to Henry , Sbarge admitted that the script " made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful . " Referring to his character 's storyline as a hero 's journey , Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – " what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing . " The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn <unk> as Jiminy 's parents Martin and Myrna . Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer . It is their only appearances in the series . 
 The episode contains several cultural references and allusions . The scenes in which Henry was carrying a couple of Apollo Chocolate Candy Bars in his back pack was also the same brand of candy bars made by the DHARMA Initiative on Lost , while Archie 's pet Pongo is also the name of one of the dogs in the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians . 
 The episode 's title , " That Still Small Voice " , is an apparent allusion , or reference to a Biblical passage in the Books of Kings : " but the Lord was not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice . "

 The episode was met with generally positive reviews . 
 Writing for AOL TV , Laura Prudom noted that the episode " proved to be an undeniably satisfying hour of television , deepening our understanding of Archie / Jiminy 's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David 's tragic romance . I don 't know about you , but I really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show . " Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she " ragged on Robert Carlyle initially , his campy <unk> is quickly becoming one of my favorite parts of this show . " Tor.com 's Teresa Jusino called Espenson 's script " so engaging " because it deviated from the series ' typical two @-@ story format and " incorporated a third , separate modern storyline " that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket , in which " each storyline got just enough attention . " She added that the episode 's best parts were its " intimate character moments , particularly the scenes between Archie / Jiminy and the boys in his life , " and attributed this to Espenson 's strength as a writer . Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge 's performance , as he " navigated both Archie and Jiminy ’ s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth . "
