 Quatermass 2 ( US title : Enemy From Space ) is a 1957 black @-@ and @-@ white British science fiction horror film from Hammer Film Productions , produced by Anthony Hinds , directed by Val Guest , and starring Brian Donlevy , John Longden , Sid James , Bryan Forbes , William Franklyn and Vera Day . Quatermass 2 is a sequel to Hammer 's earlier film The Quatermass Xperiment ( 1955 ) . Like its predecessor , it is based on the BBC Television serial Quatermass II written by Nigel Kneale . Brian Donlevy reprises his role as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass , making him the only actor to twice play the character on the silver screen . 
 The story concerns Quatermass 's investigation of reports of hundreds of meteorites landing only in the Winnerden Flats area of the UK . His inquiries lead him to a huge industrial complex , strikingly similar to his own plans for a Moon colony . This top @-@ secret facility is in fact the centre of a conspiracy involving the alien infiltration of the highest echelons of the British Government . Quatermass and his allies must now do whatever is necessary to defeat the alien threat before it is too late . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As Professor Bernard Quatermass ( Brian Donlevy ) struggles to gain government support for his Moon colonisation project , his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats . Travelling there with Marsh , his colleague ( Bryan Forbes ) , Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction , based on his lunar colony plans . Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket . It then cracks open , releasing a gas , leaving him with an odd V @-@ shaped mark on his face . Black @-@ clad guards from the complex arrive , armed with machine guns and sporting similar V @-@ shaped marks , and take Marsh away , knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave . 
 Trying to discover what happened to Marsh , Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax ( John Longden ) , who had previously assisted him ( see The Quatermass Xperiment ) . Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead ( Tom Chatto ) , a Member of Parliament , who has been trying to uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats . Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex , which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food . Slipping away from the visiting party , Broadhead attempts to get inside one of the large domes that dominate the skyline . Quatermass later finds him dying , covered in a poisonous black slime . 
 Shot at by guards as he exits , Quatermass rushes to Inspector Lomax , explaining that he believes that the complex is indeed making food but not for human consumption . Its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside the huge domes . Lomax attempts to alert his superiors , but when he meets the Commissioner of Police , he notices that he , too , is sporting the V @-@ shaped mark ; the aliens have taken control of the government . 
 Quatermass and Lomax then turn to journalist Jimmy Hall ( Sid James ) , who is skeptical of their story but asks to visit Winnerden Flats . At the local community centre , they receive a hostile reception from locals employed to do heavy construction and other work at the complex . The mood changes , however , when one of the meteorite @-@ missiles crashes through the building roof , injuring barmaid Sheila ( Vera Day ) . Armed guards arrive and gun down Hall after he telephones the press . The villagers form a mob that marches on the complex . Rushing the gates , Quatermass , Lomax , and the villagers barricade themselves in the pressure control room . 
 Realising that earth 's atmosphere must be poisonous to the aliens , Quatermass sabotages their life support system , pumping oxygen into the large domes . Simultaneously , Quatermass ' assistant , Brand ( William Franklyn ) , sacrifices his life by launching a Quatermass rocket at an asteroid believed to be the invasion 's staging point . The individual creatures combine their small bodies to create huge 150 @-@ foot tall creatures that soon burst from the domes . The rocket destroys the asteroid with a nuclear explosion . Their base gone and now fully exposed to earth 's atmosphere , the giant masses of combined creatures collapse and die . The V @-@ shaped marks disappear from those affected , leaving them with no memory of having been under alien control . As they head back to the village , Lomax wonders aloud how he 'll make a believable report on all that 's happened . More pointedly , Quatermass questions just how final will that report be ... 
 = = Production = = 
 The first Quatermass film had been a major success for Hammer and , eager for a sequel , they purchased the rights to Nigel Kneale 's follow @-@ up before the BBC had even begun transmission of the new serial . For this adaptation , Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write the first draft of the screenplay , although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest . The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial . The main difference between the two versions is at the climax : in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the aliens in outer space , whereas in the film the rocket is fired , unmanned , to destroy the aliens ' asteroid base . Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism . Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film , mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role . Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy 's interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor 's performance was marred by his alcoholism , a claim denied by Val Guest . 
 Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful , its box office performance was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film , The Curse of Frankenstein , which was to be the first of their many Gothic horror films . As a result it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967 . Quatermass 2 was , however , the first film for which Hammer pre @-@ sold the distribution rights in the United States , a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Nigel Kneale had been unhappy with Hammer 's adaptation of The Quatermass Experiment , partly because he received no extra remuneration from the sale of the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script . In the wake of his dissatisfaction , Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work . Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract , Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II . The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds . Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest , as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment . Guest recalled of Kneale 's script that there was “ lots of <unk> and very down @-@ to @-@ earth thinking but it was too long , it would not have held <unk> . So , again , I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it ” . The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors ( BBFC ) in April 1956 . BBFC reader Audrey Field commented , “ There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit , either in sights or sounds ” . The BBFC 's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic . This scene was omitted from the final film , although it is present in the original television presentation . 
 As with The Quatermass Xperiment , the screenplay for Quatermass 2 condenses many of the events of the original . The most significant change is at the climax : in the television version Quatermass and his assistant , Pugh , use Quatermass 's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired , unmanned , at the asteroid to destroy it . Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film , most notably Quatermass 's daughter , Paula , and his assistant , Leo Pugh . Conversely , the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version , having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment , but does not appear in the television version . The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass : Donlevy reprised his role as the eponymous professor , much to the despair of Nigel Kneale , who had heavily criticised his interpretation of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment . As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment , Donlevy 's alcoholism presented challenges for the production . Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day : “ He [ Donlevy ] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up . He staggered over to the set and looked <unk> around . They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said , “ What 's this movie called ? ” and they said , “ Well , it 's called Quatermass 2 ” . He said , “ I 've got to say all that ? There 's too much talk . Cut down some of the talk ” . He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go , so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was ” . Val Guest has denied Kneale 's claims , saying “ So many stories have been concocted since , about how he was a paralytic [ drunk ] . It 's absolute balls , because he was not paralytic . He wasn 't stone cold sober either , but he was a pro and he knew his lines ” . Guest also recalled , “ By after lunch he would come to me and say “ Give me a breakdown of the story so far . Where have I just been before this scene ? ” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it . But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with ” . 
 John Longden as Inspector Lomax : The role of Lomax had originally been played by Jack Warner in The Quatermass Xperiment . When Warner proved unavailable for the sequel , the role was recast and the part given to John Longden . Longden had been a major star of British silent films and had also appeared in several early Alfred Hitchcock films including Blackmail ( 1929 ) , Elstree Calling ( 1930 ) and The Skin Game ( 1931 ) . Nigel Kneale greatly preferred Longden 's authoritative take on the character to Jack Warner 's more comedic " breezy sergeant " in the first film . 
 Sid James ( credited as " Sydney James " ) as Jimmy Hall : At the time , James was known as a character actor , specialising mainly in " tough guy " roles , with credits in films such as No Orchids for Miss Blandish ( 1948 ) , The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) and Hell Drivers ( 1957 ) . James plays the character of Jimmy Hall in a much more comedic manner than Roger Delgado 's interpretation of the equivalent journalist character Hugh Conrad in the television version ; Guest cast James in order to " lighten the story a bit " . He later went on to enjoy widespread fame in many comedy roles including Hancock 's Half Hour ( 1956 – 60 ) , the Carry On series of films , and sitcoms such as George and the Dragon ( 1966 ) , Two in Clover ( 1969 – 70 ) and Bless This House ( 1971 – 76 ) . 
 Bryan Forbes as Marsh : Forbes had appeared in a number of supporting roles in films , including The Small Back Room ( 1949 ) , An Inspector Calls ( 1954 ) and The Colditz Story ( 1955 ) . However he later became better known as a director , with films such as Whistle Down the Wind ( 1961 ) , The L @-@ Shaped Room ( 1962 ) and The Stepford Wives ( 1975 ) among his best @-@ known credits . Forbes later recalled of the film : “ I was one of the people attacked by the alien pods . This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face . Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub . Of course , I couldn 't take this stuff off , the makeup was too complex ; the landlord refused to serve me . ” 
 William Franklyn as Brand : Franklyn later became well known for his voiceovers for a series of advertisements for Schweppes tonic water . In 2004 he took over from the late Peter Jones as the Voice of the Book in the radio version of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . He died in 2006 . 
 Vera Day as Sheila : Vera Day was first spotted by Val Guest in the musical Wish You Were Here at the London Hippodrome . He subsequently cast her in Dance , Little Lady ( 1955 ) and then Quatermass 2 . She later appeared in Guest 's Up the Creek ( 1958 ) . 
 Other actors appearing in the film include Charles Lloyd @-@ Pack , Tom Chatto , John Van Eyssen , Percy Herbert and Michael Ripper . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Val Guest , who had directed The Quatermass Xperiment , returned for Quatermass 2 . Guest once again sought to create a film that felt as real as possible , using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand @-@ held cameras . He was assisted in this respect by the moody , overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs , who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film 's climactic scenes . Guest planned each day ’ s shooting carefully , creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots he wanted to make that day . 
 Filming took place between 28 May and 13 July 1956 . The film 's budget , at £ 92 @,@ 000 , was much larger than that of The Quatermass Xperiment . The bigger budget was achieved by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists . United Artists contributed some £ 64 @,@ 000 towards the production of the film , as well as Brian Donlevy 's $ 25 @,@ 000 fee and his airfare to London from the US . The larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor . The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford @-@ le @-@ Hope , Essex , on the Thames Estuary , which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex . This was exactly the same location as used in the BBC television production of the story . Despite its size , the plant was run by a relatively small number of personnel , which made Guest 's job of making the plant appear eerily deserted easier . Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant 's management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location . Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled , however , that a Newman @-@ Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment . The scenes of Vincent Broadhead emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise , necessitating many retakes . Tom Chatto , playing Broadhead , whose wife was a leading casting director , joked after the scene was finally completed , " Remind me to talk to my wife about casting me in this " . The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated . 
 Other locations used included the real @-@ life new town of Hemel Hempstead , Hertfordshire , which was under construction at the time and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats . Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square , where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats , and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead . The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton . A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy 's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it . As well as shooting on location , Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios , the first Hammer production to shoot there . This was production designer Bernard Robinson 's first film for Hammer ; he went on to become their regular set designer , working on many Hammer films . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Quatermass 2 received its first public screening at a trade show on 22 March 1957 ; its official première was held two days later at the London Pavilion on 24 May 1957 . It went on general release , with supporting feature And God Created Woman , on 17 June 1957 . The film received an ‘ X ’ Certificate from the BBFC . It was released in the US under the title Enemy From Space . 
 Quatermass 2 received mixed reviews . Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph found the film “ all good grisly fun , if this is the sort of thing you enjoy ” . The reviewer in The Times remarked that “ the writer of the original story , Mr Nigel Kneale , and the director , Mr Val Guest , between them keep things moving at the right speed , without digressions . The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on , and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally ” . On the other hand , <unk> Harman of the London Evening News wrote : “ Science @-@ fiction hokum can be convincing , exciting or just plain laughable . Quatermass II [ sic ] fails on all these scores , I am afraid ” . Similarly , the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “ The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue . [ ... ] At the end a detective says : “ How am I going to make a report on all this ? ” I felt the same way ” . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Although commercially successful , Quatermass 2 ’ s release was largely overshadowed by the box @-@ office record @-@ breaking performance of Hammer 's The Curse of Frankenstein , which was also released in May 1957 . Upon this success , Hammer made its priority the production of Gothic horror films . For this reason , although Nigel Kneale had written a new Quatermass serial for the BBC , Quatermass and the Pit ( broadcast December 1958 to January 1959 ) , Hammer did not acquire the rights until 1961 and the film version did not appear until 1967 . Quatermass 2 is notable , however , for being the first film Hammer pre @-@ sold to a major US distributor , in this case United Artists . This new finance and distribution deal would become the norm for subsequent Hammer films and led to them eventually winding down their own distribution arm , Exclusive Films , in the mid @-@ 1960s . 
 Critical opinion of Quatermass 2 in the years since its release remains divided . Writing in Science Fiction in the Cinema , John Baxter found the film “ a faithful but ponderous adaptation of Kneale 's TV sequel . There are effective sequences , director Guest and cameraman Gerald Gibbs shooting with light lancing up through the shadows in a manner reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur 's Night ( or Curse ) of the Demon . Otherwise the film is indifferent ” . Similarly , John Brosnan , in his book The Primal Screen , wrote that “ Quatermass 2 isn 't as good as the first one , despite a bigger budget . Again the theme is possession ( all four Quatermass stories are variations on the same theme ) with Kneale again cleverly mixing sf with the supernatural . The alien invasion may be sf but it is presented with the trappings of traditional horror , such as the V @-@ shaped " mark of the devil " that all possessed people display ” . On the other hand , Bill Warren , in Keep Watching The Skies ! , found Quatermass 2 to be “ one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s . It is not notably better than [ The Quatermass Xperiment ] , but the story idea is more involving , the production is livelier and there are more events in the unfolding of the story ” . Kim Newman in 1986 praised the film as " extraordinary " and , comparing it to Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1956 ) , Newman notes that while Don Siegel ’ s film is " a general allegory " about dehumanisation and conformity , Quatermass 2 is “ a specific attack on the Conservative Government of the time , down to the inclusion of several characters obviously based on real political figures ” . 
 The League of Gentlemen 's Mark Gatiss mentions on the DVD commentary for the First Series that a scene where two workmen , who have been abducted by Tubs and Edward , escape , covered in tar , was inspired by the scene in which Vincent Broadhead is covered in " Synthetic Food " from one of the labelled storage tanks .

The film was first released in the US on Region 1 DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment and is mastered from an archival print that shows every image with razor @-@ sharp clarity and richness ; it contains the same extra features as on the Region 2 UK release .

 The 2013 Chicago Bears season was the franchise 's 94th season in the National Football League . The season was the first year under head coach Marc Trestman , as Lovie Smith was fired on December 31 , 2012 . The team played at Soldier Field for the 11th season since its reconstruction in 2001 . The Bears failed to qualify for the playoffs with an 8 – 8 record , the sixth time in seven years since the Super Bowl XLI loss in 2006 . 
 The Bears started the regular season by winning their first three games before losing in weeks four and five to the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints , respectively . The following game after winning against the New York Giants , quarterback Jay Cutler suffered a groin injury against the Washington Redskins , as the Bears entered the bye week at 4 – 3 . With Cutler out , Josh McCown stepped in against the Green Bay Packers in week nine , leading the Bears to victory . Cutler returned in the next game against the Lions , but injured his ankle in the loss , and McCown filled in for the next four games ; during the four @-@ game span under McCown , the Bears went 2 – 2 , while McCown excelled , throwing thirteen touchdowns and one interception . As a result , when Cutler returned in week fourteen against the Cleveland Browns , controversy arose over who should be the starter . After winning against Cleveland , the Lions lost the following day , allowing the Bears to clinch the NFC North in week sixteen with Packers and Lions losses grouped with a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles . However , the Bears lost 54 – 11 , and in week seventeen against the Packers , the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention with a 33 – 28 loss .

 On December 31 , 2012 , nine @-@ year head coach Lovie Smith was fired . After Smith 's firing , the Bears requested interviews with thirteen coaches , twelve from the NFL and Montreal Alouettes ( of the Canadian Football League ) head coach Marc Trestman . The hunt later narrowed down to Trestman , Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell <unk> and Indianapolis Colts offensive coordinator Bruce Arians . Ultimately , Trestman was hired on January 15 . 
 After Trestman 's hiring , he hired New Orleans Saints ' offensive line coach Aaron Kromer as offensive coordinator , and the Dallas Cowboys later reported that Joe DeCamillis , who had been among the Bears ' 13 head coaching candidates , would join the Bears as the team 's assistant head coach / special teams coordinator . Trestman also hired Andy Bischoff and Michael Sinclair as tight ends and defensive line coaches , respectively ; both coaches had worked with Trestman in Montreal . Alouettes offensive coordinator Pat Meyer also joined the Bears as offensive line coach , along with Purdue defensive coordinator and colleague of Trestman , Tim <unk> , as linebackers coach . Former Alouettes coaches Brendan Nugent and Carson Walch were hired as offensive quality control assistants . 
 On January 15 , special teams coordinator Dave Toub announced that he is leaving the Bears for the Kansas City Chiefs . Two days later , it was announced that defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli would not return to the team . Eight assistants were also dismissed : quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates , running backs coach Tim Spencer , wide receivers coach Darryl Drake , tight ends coach Mike <unk> , offensive line coach Tim Holt , linebackers coach Bob Babich , defensive backs coach Gill Byrd , and offensive coordinator Mike Tice . To replace Bates and Spencer , Chicago hired Matt Cavanaugh and Skip Peete as quarterbacks and running backs coach , respectively . To take Marinelli 's place , the Bears hired Jacksonville Jaguars ' defensive coordinator Mel Tucker . On February 21 , Trestman 's staff was completed after the Bears hired Alabama coach Mike Groh as wide receivers coach . 
 On January 19 , Bears director of physical development Rusty Jones announced his retirement after 28 years in the NFL . He was eventually replaced by Mike Clark . On January 28 , Chicago hired former Bears safety Chris Harris as defensive quality control , with Sean Desai serving the same position , along with Dwayne <unk> as assistant special teams coordinator . 
 On May 3 , Bears pro scouting director Chris Ballard , who had been hired by general manager Phil Emery , left the team for the Chiefs , and was replaced by assistant director of college scouting Kevin Turks . Regional scout James Kirkland was also let go . On May 6 , executive director and Southeastern Conference overseer Ted <unk> joined the St. Louis Rams . On the same day , Kevin Turks and Dwayne Joseph were promoted to director of pro personnel and assistant director of pro personnel , respectively ; Chiefs area scout Ryan Kessenich was also hired as a scout . Chicago also hired Jay Muraco as scout of the East Coast and Andre Odom as a scouting assistant . The Bears also promoted Breck Ackley to South Central area scout and Sam Summerville to scout the Southeast area and David Williams to player personnel and scout . On May 16 , the Bears promoted Southeast area scout Mark Sadowski to senior national scout .

Two rounds later , the Bears used their 117th overall pick on Rutgers linebacker Khaseem Greene , who holds the NCAA record for career forced fumbles with 15 . In the fifth round , the Bears traded down ten spots with the Atlanta Falcons to draft Louisiana Tech offensive tackle Jordan Mills , marking the first time the team selected two offensive linemen in the same draft since 2002 . In the sixth round , Chicago selected Georgia Bulldogs defensive end Cornelius Washington , who led linebackers in the bench press at the NFL Combine with 36 repetitions at 225 pounds . Using a seventh @-@ rounder acquired in the trade with Atlanta , the Bears drafted wide receiver Marquess Wilson , who left the Washington State football team , citing abuse from head coach Mike Leach despite setting team records with 82 receptions for 1 @,@ 388 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2011 , followed by 52 receptions for 813 yards and five touchdowns in 2012 . 
 The Bears draft class received average grades , with questions from some graders questioning the selections of Long and Bostic , including Jason Cole of Yahoo ! Sports , who gave the class a grade of " C + " . Yahoo ! Sports writer Billy Grayson ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper , Jr. stated that he " wasn 't in love with the value " of Long 's talent , classifying the draft class as a " C + " , while Sports Illustrated writer Chris Burke asked why Chicago selected Bostic over Kansas State linebacker Arthur Brown . However , Burke praised Washington 's selection as a potential steal , giving a grade of " B- " . Thad Novak of the International Business Times gave Long the lowest grade of the players drafted by Chicago with a " C- " , considering him a " raw " player ; Mills was awarded a " C + " , due to not blocking against many top defenders in college . Washington and Wilson were given a " B- " and " B + " , respectively , the former despite being a linebacker , could adjust into the Bears ' 4 @-@ 3 defense . Linebackers Bostic and Greene were given an " A " and " A + " , the latter being considered a steal that could add depth to the linebacking corps . Vinny Iyer of Sporting News gave the class a " C " , stated Long should start as a guard before switching to tackle , which would be filled by Mills ; Iyer also considered Bostic a " textbook replacement " for Brian Urlacher , while Greene can replace Nick Roach as a strong @-@ side linebacker . After the 2013 season , Kiper improved the Bears ' class to a " B " . 
 All six players drafted agreed to four @-@ year contracts . Mills and Washington were the first players to sign on May 1 , followed by Greene and Wilson the following day . Bostic was the next player to sign , agreeing to a contract on May 9 , and Long was the final player to sign , signing his contract on May 17 .

However , the offense allowed seven sacks and had three turnovers , one of which was a fumble by Armando Allen . Panthers cornerback Josh Norman had two interceptions , one of which set up the first score of the game via Cam Newton 's three @-@ yard touchdown pass to Brandon <unk> early in the game . Bostic 's pick @-@ six tied up the game , followed by Robbie Gould 's 35 @-@ yard field goal in the second quarter . With 18 seconds left in the first half , Carolina scored again on <unk> Barner 's 5 @-@ yard touchdown run ; the Panthers scored the lone points of the third quarter after Norman intercepted Matt Blanchard , scoring on the 60 @-@ yard return . Though the Bears retaliated after Blanchard threw a 58 @-@ yard pass to Marquess Wilson to Carolina 's 4 @-@ yard line , followed by Michael Ford 's touchdown run , Graham Gano 's 50 @-@ yard field goal was the final score of the game , as the Panthers triumphed 24 – 17 . 
 Playing San Diego , Chicago opened with touchdowns by Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte , and led 20 – 0 late in the second quarter . The defense forced four turnovers in the first half off Chris Conte 's interception , Major Wright 's fumble recovery , Blake Costanzo recovering a muffed punt , and Corvey Irvin 's recovery of a blocked punt . The Chargers began to rally , scoring on Fozzy Whittaker 's rushing touchdown in the second quarter , followed by two more touchdowns in the third quarter , which Chicago countered with Michael Ford 's 100 @-@ yard kickoff return to San Diego 's 4 @-@ yard line .

As for Oakland , Terrelle Pryor replaced Flynn in the second half , and led the Raiders to two touchdowns and a field goal to narrow the gap to 27 – 20 . The Bears retaliated with Michael Ford scoring a 15 @-@ yard touchdown , and the Raiders responded with McGloin 's 5 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jaime <unk> , but failed the two @-@ point conversion , and the Bears sealed the game with Franklin 's interception to win 34 – 26 .

 The Bears ' schedule was released on April 18 , 2013 . Aside from the six games against their NFC North rivals , the Bears had the AFC North and NFC East on the schedule , along with two intraconference games against opponents with the same division placing as the Bears in the previous season . As a result , the Bears were assigned the St. Louis Rams and New Orleans Saints . NFL.com ranked the Bears ' schedule as the sixteenth @-@ strongest in the lead , with all opponents having a combined 2012 record of 128 – 127 – 1 , and a winning percentage total of .502 .

 = = = = Week 1 : vs. Cincinnati Bengals = = = = 
 The Bears kicked off the regular season at home against the Cincinnati Bengals . The game was the teams ' first meeting since 2009 , in which the Bengals won 45 – 10 . Since 2001 , the Bears dropped two of three games to the Bengals , winning 24 – 0 in 2001 , while losing 24 – 7 in 2005 and 45 – 10 in 2009 . The two teams entered with defenses that ranked in the top six in 2012 , but the Bears were ranked 16th in scoring at 23 @.@ 4 points per game and 28th overall on offense , while the Bengals had an average score of 24 @.@ 4 PPG and were 22nd in total offense . Among the Bears ' strategies that should be utilized include trying to protect Jay Cutler , as six of the Bengals ' linemen had combined for 129 career sacks . The Bears ' offensive line allowed 44 sacks in 2012 , and as a result , changed the line by adding veterans Jermon Bushrod and Matt Slauson to supplement Roberto Garza on the left , while rookies Kyle Long and Jordan Mills joined Garza on the right side , marking the first time the Bears offensive line featured two rookies since Jim Covert and Rob Fada in 1983 . The Bears ' defense had to apply pressure to Andy Dalton , whose quick release led to four play @-@ action touchdown passes to A. J. Green in 2013 , the third most in the NFL . Bears ' radio announcer Jeff Joniak wrote , " Marc Trestman owns the element of surprise , a true asset in Week 1 . There is not much tape on Trestman for the Bengals to game plan from . It 's old tape with very different personnel from a different time and place in the NFL . Trestman will try to use this asset to his advantage and a quick strike early in the game will jack up the crowd , and give the team a foundation to build on . " The Bears captains team captains for the season , starting with the Bengals game , were Cutler and Roberto Garza on offense , Lance Briggs and Julius Peppers on defense and Patrick <unk> on special teams . 2013 was <unk> 's sixth consecutive season as captain , the fifth season for Cutler , third for Garza , fourth for Peppers and first for Briggs . 
 Chicago struck first with Charles Tillman intercepting Dalton , which was followed with Cutler 's eight @-@ yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett , which the Bengals responded with a two @-@ yard touchdown pass to Green . On the Bengals ' first drive of the second quarter , Green was stripped by Tim Jennings , but the fumble went out of bounds . However , Dalton would be intercepted again by Tillman , his career @-@ high second pick of the game , but the Bears failed to capitalize , and the Bengals scored again on Dalton 's 45 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Greene . The Bears ' Robbie Gould connected on a team record 58 @-@ yard field goal to close out the first half . In the second half , the Bengals scored again , after Tillman was penalized for pass interference , via <unk> Green @-@ Ellis ' 5 @-@ yard touchdown run , which the Bears retaliated with Matt Forté 's one @-@ yard touchdown run . In the fourth quarter , Cutler was intercepted by <unk> <unk> , but the Bears got the ball back after Jennings forced Mohamed Sanu to fumble . On the next drive , the Bears converted a fourth down and Cutler threw the go ahead and eventual game @-@ winning 19 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall with 8 : 06 remaining . The Bengals failed to score on the next drive with 6 : 38 left , and the Bears clinched the game after Rey Maualuga was called for a personal foul after Michael Bush was stopped on third down . The Bears were able to run out the clock due to Cincinnati mis @-@ using its time @-@ outs . 
 With the win , Trestman became the fourth head coach in franchise history to win his head coaching debut , after George Halas , Neill Armstrong and Dick Jauron . The Bears comeback in the second half marked the first time since 1980 the Bears came back from an 11 @-@ point deficit to win with two touchdown drives of 80 yards or more . The offense allowed zero sacks , the first time the Bears didn 't allow a sack in a season opener since 1998 against the Jacksonville Jaguars . 
 = = = = Week 2 : vs. Minnesota Vikings = = = = 
 In week two , the Bears donned their 1940s alternate uniforms against rival Minnesota , in the second home game of the season , marking the first time since 1999 that the Bears hosted the first two games of the regular season . During the two games played between the rivals last season , the Bears won the first game 28 – 10 , while the Vikings won the second 21 – 14 . Since 2001 , the Bears led the series 16 – 10 . ESPN writes that the Bears could capitalize on the Vikings ' tendency to turn the ball over , as they gave away the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one . Chicago 's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson , who had been struggling when playing the Bears at Soldier Field . Since 2009 , Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game . 
 The Bears fell behind early after Cordarrelle Patterson 's 105 @-@ yard kickoff return for a touchdown . Devin Hester attempted to respond on the ensuing kickoff , but was pushed out of bounds at the Vikings ' 32 @-@ yard line . The Bears fought back with a one @-@ yard touchdown pass by Jay Cutler to Martellus Bennett , which Chicago added to with Cutler 's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall . In the second quarter , Jared Allen stripped the ball from Cutler , and Brian Robison returned the fumble 61 yards for a touchdown with 7 : 34 to go in the half . Afterwards , Hester returned the kickoff 80 yards to Minnesota 's 23 @-@ yard line . The Bears offense later reached Minnesota 's one @-@ yard line , but Cutler had his pass intercepted by Kevin Williams in the end zone for a touchback . The Vikings failed to capitalize on the turnover after Tim Jennings intercepted Christian Ponder and scored on a 44 @-@ yard interception return . Minnesota retaliated with Ponder 's 20 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 1 : 11 remaining , and the half ended with the Bears settling for a field goal . In the second half , the Vikings scored two field goals from Blair Walsh to take the 30 – 24 lead . However , the Bears scored on Cutler 's 16 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Bennett , and ultimately prevailed after recovering a fumbled squib kick . 
 The win marked the second time in franchise history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter , the first being in 1971 . During halftime , the team honored the 1963 Bears , two days following the death of running back Rick Casares , who was the team 's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him . When asked about Casares , defensive end Ed O <unk> stated , " Oh my God , I think when you talk to my fellow teammates over here , what was all right , true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares . Nobody loved the game more than him . " 
 = = = = Week 3 : at Pittsburgh Steelers = = = = 
 The Bears travelled to Heinz Field to face the winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season . Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0 – 2 for the first time in 11 years . In the last game between the two in 2009 , the Bears triumphed 17 – 14 . The Bears were the 1 @-@ point favorites ; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game , with a 5 – 3 result favoring Chicago , while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win . One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket , especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center <unk> Pouncey . Additionally , the Steelers also had the 31st @-@ ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown , who was expected to regain first @-@ rounder Le 'Veon Bell . Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush , which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games . Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance , stating , " It ’ s tough to rush the passer in wet weather ... For both sides . It ’ s tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field . It ’ s an advantage throwing the football . On a rainy day ( versus ) no rain , really the advantage goes to the offense . Because we can sit back there and protect . And it ’ s really hard to configure a pass rush to get close . " On offense , the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers ' 14th @-@ ranked rush defense . A key matchup was the WR @-@ CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor ; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green , who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one , to just six catches for 41 yards in week two . 
 Chicago started the game with Robbie Gould 's field goal , followed by Matt Forté and Michael Bush 's touchdown runs to take a 17 – 0 lead in the first quarter . Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun <unk> 's 27 @-@ yard field goal , but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger 's interception 38 yards for a touchdown for the 24 – 3 lead at halftime . In the second half , the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown , followed by <unk> kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27 – 23 . However , Jay Cutler threw a 17 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett ; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete , but was reversed . Eventually , Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger , and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown . Although the eventual extra point by Gould was blocked by Troy Polamalu , the Bears finished the game with Chris Conte intercepting Roethlisberger with 1 : 39 left in the game for the fifth takeaway by Chicago on the night and the 40 – 23 win , dropping the Steelers to 0 – 3 for the first time since 1986 . 
 = = = = Week 4 : at Detroit Lions = = = = 
 The second divisional game of the year for the 3 – 0 Bears , looking for their first 4 – 0 start in seven seasons , took place at Ford Field against the 2 – 1 Detroit Lions . Since 2001 , the Bears had won 17 of the meetings between the two , compared to Detroit 's 9 . The Bears defense , ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24 @.@ 7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383 @.@ 0 , had to keep up with the Lions ' 4th @-@ ranked offense , who recorded 410 @.@ 7 yards per game 27 @.@ 3 PPG , sixth in the league . The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury ; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games . However , the Lions ' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident , which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears . Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson , who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches , no touchdowns and an average of 62 @.@ 3 receiving yards in the last three games . Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game , he was later listed as active against the Lions . However , Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20 + yards in 2012 , and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays . To attempt to combat Johnson , the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2 . In the battle on the line of scrimmage , the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley , while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton . Offensively , the Bears also had to survive the crowd , who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011 . 
 Neither team scored a touchdown in the first quarter , instead both scoring field goals , which extended into the first score of the second quarter . Later in the quarter , Matt Forté scored on a 53 @-@ yard run , allowing the Bears to take the 10 – 6 lead . However , after a David Akers field goal , the Lions would score three unanswered touchdowns , all within 3 minutes , 26 seconds : Micheal Spurlock 's 57 @-@ yard punt return led to Matthew Stafford 's 1 @-@ yard run , while Jay Cutler was intercepted by Glover Quin , which set up Stafford 's 2 @-@ yard pass to Calvin Johnson ; finally , the Lions scored after Reggie Bush found a hole and hurdled over Bears ' safety Major Wright en route to a 37 @-@ yard touchdown . The 27 points scored in the quarter was the most by the Lions since September 30 , 2007 against the Bears . The Bears ended the half with a field goal , but continued to trail 30 – 13 . After the Bears kicked a field goal in the third quarter , Cutler was intercepted again , this time by Louis Delmas . However , Chicago regained possession after Stafford 's pass to Johnson was kicked and caught by Wright . Three plays later , Cutler was sacked by Ndamukong Suh , and fumbled ; the ball was picked up by Nick Fairley , who ran four yards for the touchdown . In the fourth quarter , Akers kicked another field goal to put the Lions up 40 – 16 . Afterwards , the Bears began to mount a charge , with Cutler throwing a 14 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with less than four minutes in the game , followed by a two @-@ point conversion on another pass to Jeffery . With 43 seconds remaining , a ten @-@ yard pass to Earl Bennett and a two @-@ point conversion off a throw to Brandon Marshall drew the Bears within eight points , but the eventual onside kick was recovered by Lions receiver Kris Durham , allowing the Lions to clinch the 40 – 32 victory . 
 Statistically , the Bears offense struggled . Cutler completed 27 of 47 passes for 317 yards , two touchdowns , three interceptions and a 65 @.@ 6 passer rating . Cutler 's three interceptions and fumble tied his turnover amount in the first three games . The offense also had trouble on third down ; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency , the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 seconds left in the game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs . 
 = = = = Week 5 : vs. New Orleans Saints = = = = 
 The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints , the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for . The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012 , with the Saints winning 30 – 13 . As a result , offensively , the two teams were similar conceptually . For the Bears ' offense , a challenge exists in the Saints ' 3 – 4 defense , which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304 @.@ 5 per game and fifth in points with 13 @.@ 8 . Additionally , Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks , respectively , while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks . Also , Saints tight end Jimmy Graham , the defending NFC Player of the Month , had six touchdowns on the season , and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end . Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field 's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears , as Drew Brees was 0 – 4 in Chicago , but those losses occurred in December and January , when the climate was much colder . In the last three meetings in Chicago , the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers ( 4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game , 3 in 2007 , and 2 in 2008 ) , which Joniak considered " may be the only thing slowing down the Saints . " 
 After the Bears punted , Garrett Hartley kicked a 47 @-@ yard field goal . On the ensuing possession , Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble , and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears ' 6 @-@ yard line . After failing to score a touchdown , Hartley kicked a 19 @-@ yard field goal . In the second quarter , the Saints scored off Drew Brees ' two @-@ yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points . On Chicago 's next drive , the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays , which ended in Jay Cutler 's three @-@ yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery . The final score of the half was by Thomas , who caught a 25 @-@ yard pass from Brees . In the third quarter , after Hartley kicked a 36 @-@ yard field goal , the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints ' 5 @-@ yard line . However , a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player , followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27 @-@ yard field goal . Early in the following quarter , Chicago reached New Orleans ' 25 @-@ yard line , but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler 's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped . On the Saints ' next drive , a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48 @-@ yard field goal to extend the Saints ' lead to 26 – 10 . However , the Bears attempted to rally , with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery , the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints ' 2 @-@ yard line , where Brandon Marshall scored . Matt Forté 's two @-@ point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points , but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints . Although the Saints were forced to punt , with 21 seconds remaining , Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears ' 41 @-@ yard line , as time ran out , giving the Saints the 26 – 18 win . The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002 , although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign , Illinois . 
 Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218 , which surpassed <unk> Hill 's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954 . Meanwhile , Marshall was targeted only five times during the game ( 15 percent of targets on the Bears ) , the lowest since Marshall 's arrival in Chicago ; the Bears fell to 0 – 4 in games when Marshall 's target percentage is less than 20 percent . 
 = = = = Week 6 : vs. New York Giants = = = = 
 In week six , the Bears and the winless New York Giants met on Thursday night . The Bears and Giants had split the last four meetings since 2004 , with Chicago winning the first two in 2004 and 2006 , but losing in 2007 and 2010 ; they had also won the last four games between the teams at Soldier Field . Among the keys to victory for Chicago was to force turnovers , as the Giants led the league in giveaways with 20 , while the Bears were ranked second in forced turnovers with 14 . Additionally , the Giants had the worst third @-@ down offense , and averaged only 3 @.@ 3 yards per carry . Chicago also had to attack Eli Manning , who had 12 interceptions entering the game , and was sacked 15 times , the fourth @-@ most in the league ; Manning also held a 658 passer rating , one of the lowest in the NFL . However , the Bears ' pass defense allowed 278 @.@ 8 yards per game , which is about 65 yards greater than the previous season 's average . The Giants ' offense was also returning from a strong game the previous week against the Philadelphia Eagles after scoring three touchdowns and 383 yards . 
 On the third play from scrimmage , Zack Bowman intercepted Manning 's pass intended for Rueben Randle at New York 's 36 @-@ yard line and reached the 12 @-@ yard line , but Jay Cutler threw an incomplete pass to Brandon Marshall on fourth @-@ and @-@ two , giving the ball back to the Giants . On the eventual drive for the Giants , Tim Jennings intercepted Manning and scored the first touchdown of the night on a 48 @-@ yard interception return . The Giants eventually scored on Brandon Jacobs ' 4 @-@ yard run after an 80 @-@ yard drive .

 In week seven , the Bears traveled to Landover , Maryland 's FedExField to play the 1 – 4 Washington Redskins . Since 2001 , the Redskins had won five of the previous seven meetings , including the last four games . However , the Redskins were 0 – 2 at home in 2013 , and were hoping to avoid going 0 – 3 at home since 1998 . The Bears ' third @-@ ranked scoring offense was a potential factor against the Redskins ' defense , which allowed 395 @.@ 0 yards and 28 @.@ 6 points per game , two of the worst percentages in the league . On offense , Jeff Joniak writes that Chicago had to protect Jay Cutler and the ball , as Washington 's 3 – 4 defense led to 75 quarterback blitzes , eight sacks , two interceptions , and four touchdowns . On the defensive side , the Bears looked to contain Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and the read option . Additionally , the Redskins recorded 399 @.@ 2 yards per game , the fourth best in the NFL . In the special teams phase , the Bears ' 23 kick returns were a league @-@ high , which led to an NFL @-@ leading 24 @.@ 6 yard starting spot . Meanwhile , the Redskins struggled the previous week against the Dallas Cowboys , allowing Dwayne Harris to score on an 86 @-@ yard punt return , and allowing him to return a kickoff 90 yards ; they ranked last in the league in punt coverage with 19 @.@ 1 yards allowed per return and 28th in kickoff coverage with 26 @.@ 4 . In the punting game , Adam Podlesh showed improvement in his punting hang time , with five of 26 punts returned , the second @-@ fewest in the NFL .

 The Redskins struck first with Kai <unk> 's 38 @-@ yard field goal , which was answered by Robbie Gould 's 47 @-@ yarder . On Washington 's ensuing drive , Griffin was intercepted by Charles Tillman , who returned the pick to the Redskins ' 10 @-@ yard line , which set up Matt Forté 's two @-@ yard touchdown run . In the following quarter , Roy Helu scored on a 14 @-@ yard run to tie the game , and Washington pulled ahead after Brian Orakpo intercepted Cutler , scoring on the 29 @-@ yard return . Cutler later tore a groin muscle after getting sacked by Chris Baker , and Josh McCown took his role . Afterwards , Devin Hester returned a punt 81 yards for the touchdown , tying Deion Sanders ' record for the most return touchdowns all @-@ time with 19 . However , the Redskins ended the first half as the leader after Griffin threw a three @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jordan Reed . On the Bears ' first drive of the second half , Gould missed a field goal wide right , but Chicago compensated for the miss with Forté 's 50 @-@ yard touchdown run . Washington ended the third quarter with Helu 's three @-@ yard touchdown run to lead 31 – 24 . On Chicago 's next drive , the Bears were forced to kick a field goal after blitzes rendered the Bears unable to score a touchdown . Afterwards , the Bears successfully converted an onside kick , but were offsides , and were forced to kick off . Forté scored again on a six @-@ yard run , which Griffin answered with a 45 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson . The Bears then pulled ahead with McCown 's seven @-@ yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett . With 3 : 57 left , the Redskins successfully reached the Bears ' three @-@ yard line , where Helu scored again with 45 seconds remaining . On the final play of the game , McCown was sacked by Barry Cofield and Ryan Kerrigan , ending the game with a 45 – 41 loss . 
 The game marked the first time in team history that the Bears have allowed 21 points or more in their first seven games , and the first time since 1969 that Chicago has allowed at least 40 points in two consecutive away games . Cutler was projected to be out for the next four weeks , with McCown serving as his replacement . 
 Statistics @-@ wise , Cutler struggled , completing 3 of 8 passes for 28 yards with one interception and an 8 @.@ 3 passer rating , while McCown completed 14 of 20 passes for 204 yards with one TD and a 119 @.@ 6 passer rating . On the ground , Forté became the first Bears running back since <unk> Salaam to score three rushing touchdowns in a game . On defense , James Anderson was the only Bear to record a sack .

The team was attempting to recover from the injuries suffered by seven players in the previous week against the Redskins . Jay Cutler and Lance Briggs were projected to be out for four weeks , while Brandon Marshall , Alshon Jeffery , Charles Tillman , Major Wright and Blake Costanzo , the other five players hurt , used the bye to heal . Marc Trestman preferred to use the week to rest his players , stating , " I think we did a good thing by letting these guys rest . They came back with a lot of energy [ at practice Monday ] . There was very little rust in terms of executing and getting through the practice . " During Trestman 's tenure with the Montreal Alouettes , the Alouettes were 5 – 4 ( .556 ) in games after bye weeks , and 3 – 1 ( .750 ) in the postseason after byes . At practice on October 28 , rookie Khaseem Greene filled in for Briggs , and was expected to start against the Packers . Greene and fellow rookie Jon Bostic eventually started for the Bears against the Packers . Lorin Cox of Pro Football Central predicted the Bears would finish the second half of the season with a 4 – 5 record , and a final record of 8 – 8 . 
 = = = = Week 9 : at Green Bay Packers = = = = 
 Coming off their bye week , the Bears traveled to Lambeau Field to play the Green Bay Packers in the 189th meeting between the two rivals . The Bears had struggled regarding scoring against Green Bay in the last nine games between the two prior to 2013 , and including the 2010 NFC title game , had scored 127 points , an average of 14 @.@ 11 points . The two teams entered with among the top three scoring offenses , with Chicago and Green Bay ranked second and third , respectively , with 30 @.@ 4 and 30 @.@ 3 points per game , both of which rank behind the Denver Broncos . Among the weapons of the Packers offense that the Bears must attempt to hinder was the running game , as Green Bay 's rookie running back Eddie Lacy has recorded over 100 yards per game in the previous six during the season , along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers . One of Rodgers ' skills is passing balls longer than 20 yards , and was 16 of 32 on these attempts , which was tied with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks for the highest percentage in the league ; the Bears allowed 57 percent of opponents to throw for the aforementioned distance , the second @-@ worst score in the NFL . However , both teams ranked in the bottom five in the NFL in pass rush , with the Bears being in last with only nine sacks . For Chicago , Matt Forté had gained 533 yards along with averaging 4 @.@ 6 yards per run , while Josh McCown filled in for Jay Cutler . Since 2009 , Bears quarterbacks besides Cutler had thrown a combined eight touchdowns and 21 interceptions against the Packers ; in McCown 's last start in 2011 against the Packers , he threw for 242 yards , a touchdown and two interceptions in a 35 – 21 losing effort . 
 On the Packers ' first drive , Rodgers failed to recognize the Bears ' zone defense , having expected a man @-@ to @-@ man defense , and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay 's block and , along with Isaiah Frey , pulled Rodgers down , who landed on his shoulder and injured his left collarbone , and was replaced by Seneca Wallace for the remainder of the game . Afterwards , Mason Crosby kicked the 30 @-@ yard field goal to give the Packers the lead . On Chicago 's first drive , McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7 – 3 lead . Once the Packers got the ball back , Wallace 's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers , and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay 's 45 @-@ yard line , but after the Bears failed to convert on third down , Adam Podlesh 's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore . Eventually , James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown . However , the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays , and Forté scored on the 1 @-@ yard run . The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould 's 24 @-@ yard field goal to expand the lead to 17 – 10 . In the third quarter , the Packers forced the Bears to punt , and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears ' 1 , and scored on the ensuing play . On the eventual kickoff , the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick , which was recovered by Lattimore . Crosby kicked a 23 @-@ yarder on the drive .

The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8 : 58 , leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game . Despite a 15 @-@ yard pass by Wallace to Nelson , sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27 – 20 victory for the Bears . 
 McCown ended the night completing 22 of 41 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns , while Wallace completed 11 of 19 for 114 yards and an interception .

 = = = = Week 10 : vs. Detroit Lions = = = = 
 Week ten featured the Bears attempting to avoid suffering the first sweep by the Lions since 2007 , while also trying to claim the division lead ; the last time the two teams faced each other in a late @-@ season game for the division lead was in 1991 , which ended in a Chicago 20 – 10 win . However , the Bears had won the last five games against the Lions at Soldier Field . On November 7 , Marc Trestman announced that Jay Cutler has been cleared by doctors to return against Detroit , despite having been projected to be out for approximately four weeks . Against the Lions , Cutler was 7 – 2 , and won all four home games . On the offensive side , Jeff Joniak states that the Lions defensive line " are ferocious up the middle , they are physical , and they make you pay for poor technique , " but that " there is growing confidence that the Bears offense is a resilient one ; " the Bears had the fewest pre @-@ snap penalties in the league , and only one false start . The Bears could also seize the Lions ' cornerback corps , which struggled during the season , allowing 11 plays of 40 yards or more , along with 4 @.@ 7 yards per carry . Defensively , Sports Illustrated writers Chris Burke and Doug Farrar wrote the Bears must attempt to hinder Reggie Bush , and improve their performance from the previous week , when the Packers ' running game ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns . The Bears also had to prevent Calvin Johnson from excelling ; against the Dallas Cowboys , Johnson recorded 329 receiving yards . 
 Chicago scored first after Cutler 's 32 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall capped a 65 @-@ yard drive that took just 2 : 23 . However , the Lions would travel 85 yards to tie on Matthew Stafford 's 5 @-@ yard pass to Kris Durham . In the following quarter , the Bears reached the Lions ' 4 @-@ yard line , but Cutler 's pass was tipped by Ndamukong Suh , and intercepted by DeAndre Levy in the endzone ; both teams would fail to score in the quarter .

However , Johnson would catch a 14 @-@ yard pass from Stafford to increase the lead to 21 – 13 , and with 2 : 22 remaining , Josh McCown entered the game in favor of Cutler , and guided the Bears ' offense 74 yards , culminating in McCown 's 11 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Marshall with 40 seconds to go . On the two @-@ point conversion , McCown 's pass to tight end Dante Rosario fell incomplete , but Willie Young was penalized for roughing the passer , allowing the Bears a second chance , which failed after Matt Forté was tackled by Nick Fairley in the backfield . The Bears ' onside kick would backfire , as <unk> Bell recovered , sealing a season sweep for the Lions . 
 Despite stating he was " 100 percent " healthy after the groin injury suffered two games prior , it appeared the injury was still lingering ; after throwing a pass during the third quarter , Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin , before standing back up . Regarding the injuries , Cutler stated , " It held up OK . It 's all on the same leg so I think that was a problem . But the groin , you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine , I think . " Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown , interception and a 69 @.@ 8 passer rating . Despite x @-@ rays on his ankle being negative , Cutler was ruled out of the next week 's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain . During the second quarter , Charles Tillman was also injured , suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle , and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return , allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after ; as a result , Tillman missed the entire regular season .

" Bleacher Report 's <unk> Ames stated that although Cutler is the better quarterback , his injury tendencies and inability to play a full season since 2009 had affected him , along with the statistics comparison between the two quarterbacks : Cutler has recorded 1 @,@ 908 yards , 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions , while McCown has thrown for 1 @,@ 809 yards , 13 touchdowns and one interception . However , Brandon Marshall defended Cutler 's status as the starter , stating : 
 McCown also acknowledged his backup position on the team , and told the Chicago Tribune , " The way that I serve my team is to play when the starter is not healthy . Jay is our starting quarterback , there is no doubt about that . " 
 Seven CBS Sports analysts predicted a Bears victory , with Pete Prisco being the only one to favor the Browns . Jeff Joniak stated that the Bears had to attack the Browns ' 3 – 4 defense , who ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed at 5 @.@ 32 , with their fifth @-@ ranked passing offense . Chicago 's wide receiver duo of Marshall and Alshon Jeffery should also be utilized , as Joe Haden and Buster <unk> are at a size mismatch ( Marshall is 5 inches and 40 pounds larger than Haden , while Jeffery is 6 inches and 30 pounds heavier than <unk> ) . Browns offensive coordinator Ray Horton commented , " This team , Chicago , is a lot like Detroit in that they have weapons at every position . Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have the most catches in the league . They have the most combined yards in the league . They are both , in our mind , No. 1 receivers . They present a challenge that you can ’ t double everybody . You can ’ t roll up to one guy because the other guy ’ s open . " On defense , the Bears had to contain Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron . Gordon ranks second in yards after catch , while leading all receivers with 71 for an average of 19 @.@ 7 yards . Cameron leads all tight ends with 23 third down catches . The Bears ' worst @-@ ranked run defense also has to defend against the Browns , which had the third @-@ fewest rushing attempts in the league with 290 with an average of 3 @.@ 78 yards , which is one of the bottom six in the league . 
 The Bears ' opening drive ended at Cleveland 's 14 @-@ yard line when Cutler had his pass tipped in the endzone by T. J. Ward and intercepted by <unk> Gipson . The Browns then scored on Billy <unk> 's 35 @-@ yard field goal , which was tied by Robbie Gould kicking a 23 @-@ yarder . Eventually , the Bears reached the Browns ' 24 @-@ yard line on another drive , and after a penalty on Alshon Jeffery forced the Bears to kick a 46 @-@ yard field goal , the score was nullified by Corey Wootton 's holding penalty , forcing Chicago to punt . With 8 : 01 in the first half , Cutler was again intercepted by Gipson , who returned the pick 44 yards for a touchdown and the 10 – 3 lead . With 24 seconds remaining in the half , Cutler connected on a 5 @-@ yard touchdown pass with Marshall to close the half at 10 – 10 . Cutler ended the first half with 13 of 19 passes completed for 168 yards , a touchdown and two interceptions . Early in the third quarter , Jason Campbell 's pass for Greg Little was intercepted by Zack Bowman and returned 43 yards for the score . Cleveland 's Edwin Baker eventually scored his first career NFL touchdown on a 2 @-@ yard run , and the Browns added to the score when Billy Winn punched the ball from Martellus Bennett , and Ward returned the fumble 52 yards for the 24 – 17 advantage . Eventually , Cutler guided the Bears from their own 5 @-@ yard line , culminating in a 45 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jeffery after Gipson made an ill @-@ timed leap and Julian Posey being unable to interrupt the play with 10 : 59 remaining . With 5 : 41 left in the game , Cutler threw a 5 @-@ yard pass to Earl Bennett to take the 31 – 24 lead , which was extended by Michael Bush on a 40 @-@ yard touchdown run . Cutler 's touchdown pass to Bennett was the twenty @-@ ninth passing touchdown of the season , which ties the team record set in 1947 and 1995 . With 1 : 03 to go , Campbell threw a 43 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Josh Gordon , but the Bears recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the victory , 38 – 31 . The win marked the third time since 1970 that the Bears won all four games against an AFC division , and the first since 1986 . 
 The following night , the Bears would jump to first place of the NFC North after the Lions were defeated by the Ravens . The Bears had the opportunity to clinch the division in week sixteen by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles , in addition to losses by the Packers and Lions . 
 = = = = Week 16 : at Philadelphia Eagles = = = = 
 Chicago entered week sixteen with a chance to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost . The Packers and Lions eventually lost to the Steelers and Giants , respectively , putting the Bears in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles . The last game between the Bears and Eagles was in 2011 , when the Bears won 30 – 24 ; the Bears also lead the all @-@ time series 30 – 12 – 1 , though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings . However , the Bears had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years , but all by less than six points . One of the Bears ' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating ; the Bears had the worst run defense in the league , while McCoy leads the league in rushing . Chicago 's defense also must contain the Eagles ' fast @-@ scoring offense : the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2 : 24 , while the league average is 3 : 27 . Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive . In the passing game , Chicago had the fourth @-@ best passing offense , while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense . However , the Eagles are ranked sixth in rushing defense . 
 The Bears fell behind early in the first quarter when Nick Foles threw a 5 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper with 9 : 54 to go , followed by Devin Hester getting the ball stripped on the ensuing kickoff and Cary Williams recovering the loose ball . LeSean McCoy eventually scored on a 1 @-@ yard run with 7 : 44 in the first , and Philadelphia added to the scoring with Foles throwing a 10 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Brent <unk> . After Alex Henery kicked a 49 @-@ yard field goal , the Bears scored their first points of the game with Robbie Gould 's 50 @-@ yard field goal on the last play of the first half . In the second half , the Eagles scored off a safety after Cedric Thornton tackled Matt Forté . Philadelphia scored again after McCoy recorded another rushing touchdown . The Bears scored their first touchdown after Jay Cutler threw a 6 @-@ yard pass to Brandon Marshall , followed by a two @-@ point conversion off Cutler 's pass to Earl Bennett . With 11 : 19 remaining , Chris Polk scored on a 10 @-@ yard run to increase the score to 40 – 11 , added by Brandon Boykin intercepting Cutler and scoring on a 54 @-@ yard return . Afterwards , Josh McCown filled in for Cutler . The Eagles scored again after Bryce Brown ran 65 yards for the touchdown to make the final score 54 – 11 , the biggest blowout since a 47 – 0 loss to the Houston Oilers in 1977 and the second @-@ most points allowed in team history , behind a 55 – 20 loss to Detroit in 1997 . 
 The Bears failed to score 18 points for the first time in 2013 , while allowing a season @-@ high five sacks . Chicago also allowed two 100 @-@ yard rushers in the same game for the first time since 1976 against the Denver Broncos , with Norris Weese ( 120 yards ) and Ottis Anderson ( 116 yards ) guiding the Broncos to 28 – 14 win . After the game , Marc Trestman stated , " We are a team that was ready to play this game and we played a terrible football game for lack of a better word . I 'm not going to use any word other than that . We were terrible in all three phases . We didn 't play well in any phase of football . "

 In the season @-@ ender against the Packers for the NFC North title , Aaron Rodgers made his return to action for the first time since week 9 against the Bears , who intend to sweep the Packers for the first time since 2007 . The Packers had fallen to 2 – 5 – 1 without Rodgers , and entered the game with a 7 – 7 – 1 record . However , Green Bay did not have Clay Matthews in the lineup , which ESPN wrote could provide an advantage for Jay Cutler , who had a 1 – 8 record against the Packers . The Packers had won seven of the last nine games between the rivals , while winning 21 – 13 in 2012 's game at Soldier Field ; Green Bay had won the last three games at Soldier Field . Rodgers ' absence had improved the Packers ' rushing offense , which ranked seventh with 131 @.@ 7 yards per game , which played against the Bears ' worst @-@ ranked rush defense , having allowed 161 @.@ 5 rushing yards per game , 25 @.@ 6 yards greater than the 31st @-@ ranked team . Also , the Bears had allowed 5 @.@ 4 rushing yards per carry , the worst in the league since the 1961 Vikings . For the Bears ' offense , the team had to utilize Matt Forté against a Packers defense that allowed 4 @.@ 61 yards per run . Quarterbacks against the Packers had a 95 @.@ 5 passer rating , recording 7 @.@ 70 yards per pass , and a 1 @.@ 9 interception percentage . However , the offensive line had to protect Cutler against the pass rush , with Green Bay ranked eighth in the NFL with 43 sacks , with 25 of them from blitzes . The game marked the first time since the NFL realigned with eight divisions in 2002 that the NFC North did not feature a division champion with at least ten wins . The Packers were the favorite by − 3 . 
 After the Bears punted on the opening drive , the Packers reached Chicago 's five @-@ yard line , but Rodgers was intercepted by Chris Conte . Chicago scored on the following possession with Forté 's four @-@ yard run . In the second quarter , Rodgers was intercepted by Tim Jennings . After the Packers scored on Mason Crosby 's 33 @-@ yard field goal , Devin Hester fumbled on the kickoff , but recovered ; the Bears would be forced to punt . After Green Bay reached Chicago 's 17 @-@ yard line , Rodgers was hit by Julius Peppers , with the ball leaving his hand as his arm went forward ; the players did not attempt to recover the ball , as if it was an incompletion , but the referees did not consider the play dead . Jarrett Boykin subsequently picked up the ball , and scored on the play . On the Bears ' next drive , Cutler 's pass to Alshon Jeffery was stripped by <unk> Williams , and was recovered by Morgan Burnett . Crosby scored the final score of the first half with a 27 @-@ yard field goal . In the third quarter , the Bears regained the lead with Forté 's five @-@ yard touchdown run . Both teams exchanged scores on the next two drives of the game , with the Packers scoring on Rodgers ' seven @-@ yard touchdown throw to Randall Cobb , followed by Forté 's one @-@ yard touchdown run , ending the quarter with the Bears leading 21 – 20 . On the first play of the final quarter , Cutler threw a five @-@ yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall , which the Packers retaliated with Eddie Lacy 's six @-@ yard touchdown run . After the Bears punted , the Packers reached the Bears ' 48 @-@ yard line with 48 seconds left . Defensive coordinator Mel Tucker called a blitz , but Conte failed to apply man @-@ to @-@ man coverage , allowing Cobb to score the game @-@ winning touchdown . However , the Packers failed the two @-@ point conversion , making the score 33 – 28 . The Bears received the ball with 38 seconds left , and reached the Packers ' 45 @-@ yard line , where Cutler 's Hail Mary pass for Marshall was intercepted by Sam Shields as time expired . 
 The season marked the sixth time in the previous seven years the Bears missed the playoffs . Despite forcing two turnovers , the Bears defense allowed the Packers to record 473 yards , convert 9 of 18 third down plays , a 35 : 09 time of possession and run 76 plays in comparison to Chicago 's 49 .

 Statistically , the Bears offense greatly improved from its 2012 counterpart . The 2013 offense ended the year with the second @-@ best scoring offense with 445 points , behind the Denver Broncos ; the previous year ranked 16th at 375 total points and 23 @.@ 4 PPG . The 2012 team also was ranked 29th in passing yards with 2999 , while the following year improved to fifth with <unk> yards . The offense also broke team records in total yards ( 6 @,@ 109 ) , passing yards ( 4 @,@ 450 ) , passing touchdowns ( 32 ) , first downs ( 344 ) and passer rating ( 96 @.@ 9 ) , while falling short of the 1985 team 's record of points scored in a season by 11 , ending with 445 . However , the defense struggled mightily throughout the season , ranking 30th in the NFL , with injuries ending the seasons of five players : defensive tackles Henry Melton and Nick Collins , cornerbacks Kelvin Hayden and Charles Tillman , and linebacker D. J. Williams . After having the fifth @-@ ranked defense in the league in 2012 , the team allowed franchise @-@ records in yards allowed with 6 @,@ 313 , rushing yards allowed ( 2 @,@ 583 ) and points with 478 in 2013 ( also ranking 29th in the NFL in points allowed per game with 29 @.@ 9 ) , while allowing a league @-@ worst 5 @.@ 35 rushing yards per carry ; the Bears were the only team in the NFL to allow five yards per carry during the year . In third @-@ down stops , the Bears ranked 25th . Additionally , the defense tied the Jacksonville Jaguars for the fewest sacks in the league with 31 . Regarding the defense , Chicago Tribune writer Steve Rosenbloom wrote , " Under Angelo and Smith , the Bears couldn 't win enough games where they needed only three offensive touchdowns . Under Emery and Trestman , the Bears couldn 't win enough games where they needed to hold opponents to only three offensive touchdowns . "

 On December 27 , Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte were named to the 2014 Pro Bowl , the fewest number of Bears sent since 2009 , when two were also sent , and the first time a Bears defensive player was not invited since 2004 . On January 14 , 2014 , Marshall and Forte were named to the Pro Football Writers Association 's All @-@ NFC Team . On January 3 , 2014 , the Associated Press released its annual All @-@ Pro team , with no Bears named . On January 9 , 2014 , Alshon Jeffery was named to the Pro Bowl after an injury to Calvin Johnson . Jeffery was later named the PFWA 's Most Improved Player on January 17 . On January 20 , Tim Jennings and Kyle Long were named to the Pro Bowl , replacing Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks , who advanced to Super Bowl XLVIII and Mike <unk> suffered an injury , respectively . Long 's invitation marked the first time a Bears rookie was invited since special teamer Johnny Knox in 2009 , and the first offensive rookie since Gale Sayers in 1965 . The four offensive Pro Bowlers are the most sent by the Bears since 1985 , when Jim McMahon , Walter Payton , Jay Hilgenberg and Jim Covert were invited to the game . Forte , Marshall and Jeffery 's invitations also marked the first time since 1985 the Bears sent multiple skill position players , and the most sent by the team since 1963 with Bill Wade , Joe Marconi and Mike Ditka . Forte , Marshall and Jeffery were eventually drafted in the fantasy draft by Team Rice , while Long and Jennings were assigned to Team Sanders . In the 22 – 21 victory for Team Rice , Forte ran for 31 yards on six attempts while catching three passes for 24 yards . Jeffery and Marshall recorded two and one catch for 22 and 21 yards , respectively . For Team Sanders , Jennings recorded three tackles , while Long assisted in shoving Cam Newton into the endzone .

 = Narrows Bridge ( Perth ) = 
 The Narrows Bridge is a freeway crossing of the Swan River in Perth , Western Australia . 
 Made up of two road bridges and a railway bridge located over a section of water known as The Narrows , located between Mill Point and Point Lewis , it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways , linking the city 's northern and southern suburbs . The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world . Construction of the northern interchange for this bridge necessitated the reclamation of a large amount of land from the river . 
 The bridge formed part of the Kwinana Freeway which originally ran for only 2 @.@ 4 miles ( 3 @.@ 9 km ) . Over the following decades , the freeway system was expanded to the north and south , greatly increasing the volume of traffic using the bridge . As a result , in 2001 , a duplicate traffic bridge was opened to the west of the original bridge , and in 2005 , the railway bridge was constructed in the gap between the two traffic bridges . Passenger trains first traversed the Narrows in 2007 with the opening of the Mandurah railway line . 
 = = First road bridge : 1959 = = 
 The close distance between Mill Point and Point Lewis at the foot of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849 . A bridge was proposed for the site in 1899 , but its expected cost of £ 13 @,@ 000 was deemed too high . Preliminary planning for a bridge at the site finally began in 1947 , but was suspended so that a replacement , The Causeway , could be built at Heirisson Island , at the city 's eastern end . The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952 , and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled , renewing calls for a bridge at The Narrows . 
 Site investigations for the bridge began in August 1954 . The bridge was proposed for The Narrows site by the Town Planning Commission under the chairmanship of Harold Boas . The chosen site drew public protest on the basis that the bridge would spoil the view to and from the city . Also , residents of the wealthy Mill Point area were angry that they would have a major highway running beside their houses . The site also necessitated the reclamation of 60 acres ( 24 ha ) of land from Mounts Bay for the bridge approach and interchange . This land reclamation , which started in October 1954 , saw the addition of 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m3 ) of sand , much of which was dredged from Melville Water . 
 The State started saving for the new bridge in September 1954 , and the construction of the bridge was approved by the Hawke state Labor government in November 1954 , before the Hepburn @-@ Stephenson metropolitan roads plan had been finalised , such was the urgency of a new traffic link . The construction of the bridge was subsequently endorsed in the 1955 Hepburn – Stephenson plan , which later developed into the Metropolitan Region Scheme . 
 The river bed at the site of the proposed bridge was not ideal for bridge building , with soft mud extending down up to 80 feet ( 24 m ) , with sand beds below that going a further 40 feet ( 12 m ) down . Ernie Godfrey , a bridge engineer with the Main Roads Department , travelled overseas to inspect bridges in similar geological locations and to source a designer for the proposed bridge . The design contract for the bridge was won by British engineering firm Maunsell & Co . 
 Construction on the road system began in 1956 , and the contract for construction of the bridge was signed by Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach on 16 March 1957 . The bridge was built by Danish firm Christiani and Nielsen in conjunction with Western Australian engineering firm J. O. Clough & Son . Leif Ott Nilsen oversaw construction on behalf of Christiani and Nielsen . The first timber pile for the temporary staging for the construction was driven at noon on 8 June 1957 . The first permanent pile for the bridge was driven home on 18 August 1957 . Work on the bridge 's precast concrete beams began in September 1957 , and the first of these was lifted into place by the 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) gantry crane in February 1958 . The last river pile was driven home in November 1958 , and the final concrete beam was lowered into position in June 1959 . 
 During construction on 10 February 1959 , John Tonkin , then the Deputy Premier and Minister for Works , announced that the new bridge was to be named the Golden West Bridge . However , Golden West was also the name for a popular soft drink ; the proposal encountered scorn from commentators and was quietly dropped . 
 The bridge cost £ 1 @.@ 5 million , as part of a wider road system costing £ 3 @.@ 5 million . Construction on the bridge took 2 years and 5 months . It was officially opened by Governor Charles Gairdner on 13 November 1959 . He unveiled a plaque on the bridge together with Premier Sir David Brand , Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach and Works Minister Wild . Gairdner was also the first person to drive across the new bridge . It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would be repaid by the Government within 12 months . 
 The bridge formed part of the new Kwinana Freeway , which originally ran 2 @.@ 4 miles ( 3 @.@ 9 km ) from the Narrows to Canning Highway . This was described as the " most modern highway " in Western Australia , with a speed limit of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) . The bridge was also the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world at the time of its opening . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The bridge was jointly designed by engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners and architects William Halford & Partners . The prestressed concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia , where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks . The bridge is arched along its length , with a vertical curve of up to 4 % grade . 
 The unusually soft soil conditions at the site forced the use 160 " Gambia piles " for the bridge 's foundations , named after the country in which they were first used . The 31 @-@ inch ( 79 cm ) diameter piles have steel shells and conical noses . The hollow piles were driven by a drop hammer falling within them , then when they had sufficient resistance to driving , they were filled with reinforced concrete . 
 The piles support two river piers , two shore piers and two abutments . The bridge 's support columns on the piers were designed in a triangular form , larger at the top than at the bottom , each carrying two of the bridge 's beams , so as to not completely obstruct the view through the bridge 's piers . These columns support the bridge 's five spans : a central span of 320 feet ( 98 m ) , two flanking spans of 230 feet ( 70 m ) each and two smaller spans of 160 feet ( 49 m ) at each end passing over roadways . The bridge has eight parallel lines of beams . Each line of beams consists of two cantilever spans 370 feet ( 110 m ) long suspended between the shore and river piers , a central suspended span 140 feet ( 43 m ) long between the two river piers , and two 110 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) spans suspended over roadways at either end . Suspended between the beams of the bridge were 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) water mains pipes and 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 800 m ) of 10 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 27 cm ) gas and drainage pipes . 
 Footpaths 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide on either side of the bridge were formed by concrete cast in situ and cantilevered out from the adjacent beams . These footpaths were separated from the roadway and the bridge 's edge by lightweight aluminium balustrades and safety fences installed by <unk> . The street lights were integrated into the safety fence . 
 The deck of the bridge was formed by pre @-@ casting individual concrete units on the southern river shore , then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river . The units were then structurally joined by strands of high @-@ tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack . These pre @-@ stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks at the ends of the spans . The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6 @,@ 000 cars per hour in each direction , over a total of six traffic lanes . 
 = = = Post @-@ completion history = = = 
 Strengthening works were carried out on the bridge by Structural Systems Ltd in 1996 . Also in 1996 , decorative night lighting was installed on each side of the bridge . The bridge was entered on the state 's heritage register on 8 January 1999 , and was named a national engineering landmark by the Institution of Engineers , Australia , in November 1999 . 
 The opening of the southern regions of Perth to easier central business district access changed the nature of the metropolitan area , prompting dramatic population growth south of the river . This led to increased traffic on the bridge , causing regular traffic jams in peak hour . Over the years , governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge , including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore , charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods . The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing . These efforts were largely unsuccessful , and by the 1990s , the bridge had become the city 's worst traffic bottleneck , despite the addition of an extra traffic lane , bringing the total number of lanes to seven . 
 = = Second road bridge : 2001 = = 
 Plans for a second Narrows Bridge were mooted during the 1970s , but did not eventuate . By 1998 , the original bridge was carrying 155 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , with an average of 2 @,@ 700 cars per lane between 7 : 30 am and 8 : 30 am , and was thought to be the busiest section of freeway in the country . This quantity of traffic far outstripped the expected capacity of the bridge when it opened in 1959 . The solution to the traffic problem most favoured by road planners in 1998 was to widen the existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west from it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway . This would increase the number of traffic lanes from seven to 10 . The widening was expected to cost $ 50 million . 
 A plan to widen the Narrows Bridge was announced on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government . The $ 70 million plan would involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes , and was part of a $ 230 million package upgrading and extending the southern end of the Kwinana Freeway . Alannah McTiernan , then the Opposition Transport spokesperson , attacked the plan , saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham . 
 Instead of widening the existing structure , Transport Minister Eric Charlton on 15 July 1998 approved the construction of a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge ; this solution would cost $ 15 million less , due to new building techniques , and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge . The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge . Under the plan , there would be six lanes on each bridge , including a bus lane on each . The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of 6 metres ( 20 ft ) , and was designed to look largely the same as the original . 
 Main Roads called for tenders for the bridge widening in July 1998 , and on 7 March 1999 it was announced that the building contract had been awarded to Leighton Contractors . The negotiated contract price was reduced to $ 49 million owing to the construction method proposed by Leighton . The designers were Connell Wagner . 
 The bridge was constructed by the incremental launching technique , with 28 @-@ metre ( 92 ft ) segments pre @-@ cast on both shores and pushed out into place as the construction progressed . The bridge was divided into two strips lengthways , with the eastern half launched separately from the western half , and the two decks were later joined at the bridge 's centre line . The first of twelve segments was launched in February 2000 . 
 As it was being launched , the bridge rested on temporary piles ; only after the structure was fully launched were these piles removed and the bridge allowed to rest on its permanent supports . The construction required the driving of around 250 steel piles ; the first was driven on 10 August 1999 . 
 Construction of the second bridge was interrupted several times by strikes , as well as by an algal bloom in the Swan River . The bridge was finally opened to traffic on 26 February 2001 , and officially opened by new Transport Minister Alannah McTiernan ( a strident critic of the project ) on 30 May 2001 . The bridge had originally been planned to be opened in August 2000 , and was expected to carry 80 @,@ 000 cars per day . The new traffic bridge carried six lanes of traffic , including one bus lane , and the original bridge was modified at this time to carry six traffic lanes , as designed . 
 = = Railway bridge : 2005 = = 
 During the construction of the second road bridge , the construction of a railway through Perth 's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became a political issue . The incumbent Liberal State Government proposed building a railway from Kenwick to connect to the Kwinana Freeway , running in the centre of the freeway for only part of its journey . The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway . 
 After the Labor party won the 2001 state election , they reversed the previous government 's position and started planning for the installation of railway tracks across the Narrows Bridge . The construction of a third bridge was needed due to the lack of previous planning provisions when the second bridge was constructed . Leighton Constructions won the contract to build the freeway stage of the railway line and set about constructing a narrow southbound railway bridge in the 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) gap between the existing road bridges . The designers of " Package E " of the Southern Suburbs Railway ( which included the Narrows Rail Bridge ) were GHD , Coffey Geosciences and Wyche Consulting . The eastern side of the existing northbound ( 2001 ) bridge was also strengthened to accommodate the northbound railway track . Construction was due to start in July 2005 and completion was expected by December 2005 . The first passengers traversed the Narrows on 23 December 2007 with the opening of the Mandurah Railway Line . 
 The railway bridge deck was made from nine steel girders each weighing up to 99 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 219 @,@ 000 lb ) and up to 54 metres ( 177 ft ) long . These girders were built in Kwinana , brought to the site by road and lowered into position with a crane . 
 = Mississippi Highway 792 = 
 Mississippi Highway 792 ( MS 792 ) is a road in eastern Mississippi . It starts at U.S. Route 45 ( US 45 ) , and travels east . Near halfway of the route , SR 792 turns south and continues to its eastern terminus at MS 388 . The highway was designated in 1998 , and no major changes have been made since .

 MS 792 is located in southern Lowndes and northern Noxubee counties . In 2012 , Mississippi Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) calculated as many as 1 @,@ 800 vehicles traveling west of Trinity Road and Weyerhaeuser Road , and as few as 540 vehicles traveling south of <unk> Road . It is not included as a part of the National Highway System ( NHS ) , a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy , mobility and defense of the nation . The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 , and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation . 
 MS 792 starts at a T @-@ intersection with US 45 , near the Black Prairie wildlife management area . It travels east along Carson Road , going through a small group of trees and farmland . At Gun Club Road , the landscape changes completely into farmland . Near 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) later , Carson Road intersects Weyerhaeuser Road , that leads to cellulose fiber mills . MS 792 later turns southeastward at Old Macon Road , and crosses over a river . South of Plum Grove Road , the route shifts slightly to the west . Old Macon Road enters Noxubee County , while crossing over a small creek . MS 792 continues south for a few more miles , before ending at MS 388 .

 = Bregowine = 
 Bregowine ( or <unk> or <unk> ; died August 764 ) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury . Little is known of his origins or his activities as archbishop , although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066 . There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop . He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch . The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land , but knowledge of his time in office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records . After his death , he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12th century . 
 = = Life = = 
 Various stories have been told about Bregowine 's origins , including that he was a nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus . Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent , but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 . There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop . It does not appear , however , that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors <unk> and Nothhelm . 
 Whatever his upbringing , Bregowine was consecrated as archbishop on 27 September 761 . His election took place in a brief period when Kent was free of Mercian dominance between 756 and 764 , so the story that he owed his election to Æthelbert does fit with the time frame . He wrote letters to Archbishop <unk> of Mainz which still exist , and which discuss an earlier meeting between the two men . Other activities as archbishop are recorded in surviving charters . One records that he protested at the loss of a church at Cookham that was confiscated by King Cynewulf of Wessex sometime after 760 . Another surviving charter from <unk> , a thegn of King Æthelbert , concerning land in Canterbury , records that Bregowine consented to the gift of land . Unfortunately , many of the early charters of the diocese of Canterbury are lost , which restricts knowledge of Bregowine 's activities as archbishop . 
 Bregowine died in 764 and was originally buried in the baptistry in Canterbury , but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123 . This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery , which came to nothing . The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept , after having been briefly placed in the north transept . Bregowine was later considered a saint , with a feast day of 26 August , although Florence of Worcester , a 12th @-@ century writer , recorded his death date as 24 August . Other sources record the death date as 25 August . His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12th century . 
 = Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment = 
 " Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment " is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons ' eighth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 16 , 1997 . Prohibition is enacted in Springfield and Homer helps fight it by illegally supplying alcohol to the town . It was written by John Swartzwelder , and directed by Bob Anderson . Dave Thomas guest stars as Rex Banner and Joe Mantegna returns as Fat Tony . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A prohibitionist movement emerges in Springfield after Bart is accidentally intoxicated during a St. Patrick 's Day celebration . The municipal government discovers alcohol has actually been banned for two centuries , and moves to enforce the law , prompting Moe to disguise his bar as a pet shop . With the town becoming impatient with the police 's incompetence , Chief Wiggum is replaced by Rex Banner , an officer of the U.S. Treasury Department . 
 In the meantime , Homer figures out a way to keep Moe 's bar operating , by becoming a bootlegger . One night , he and Bart sneak out to the city dump to reclaim the beer that was disposed of when the Prohibition law was enacted . He then sets up shop in his basement pouring the beer into the finger holes of bowling balls . Using an intricate set of pipes under the Bowl @-@ A @-@ Rama , he bowls the balls into Moe 's . Upon discovering it , Marge actually finds it a very good idea ( since Homer is actually using his intellectual faculties and that he 's making enough money to support the family ) , though Lisa doesn 't , prompting Homer , Marge , and Bart to send her to her room . The media realizes someone 's allowing Springfield 's underground alcohol trade to flourish , and they give the still @-@ unknown Homer the nickname " Beer Baron " . Rex Banner fails to catch the Baron and resorts to stopping people in the street to demand if they are the Beer Baron ; he even arrests Ned Flanders who pleads guilty to drinking only root beer . 
 When his supply of liquor runs out , Homer begins to distill his own homemade liquor . However , his stills start to explode . He is then confronted by a desperate ex @-@ Chief Wiggum . In an attempt to rekindle Wiggum 's career , Homer allows the former Police Chief to turn him in . The punishment that awaits him is expulsion from the town ( and presumably death ) by an archaic catapult , showing how anachronistic the law really was . Marge tells everyone that this law and punishment make no sense and it 's meaningless to punish Homer , especially for their freedom to drink . Rex Banner steps up to lecture the town on the reasons why the law must be upheld . While he lectures the assembled Springfield citizens , Wiggum has him catapulted and gets his job back . The town clerk then finds out that the Prohibition law was actually repealed a year after it was put in place , and so Homer is released . Within five minutes Fat Tony is only too happy to oblige when Mayor Quimby asks him to flood the town with alcohol once more , and Springfield salutes its qualities as Homer announces , " To alcohol ! The cause of ... and solution to ... all of life 's problems . " 
 = = Production = = 
 The main plot of the episode is based on the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , in which alcohol was banned in the United States . As The Simpsons has many episodes that have stories and jokes related to alcohol , the writers thought it was strange that they had never done an episode related to Prohibition , and that the idea seemed " perfect . " The episode features a vast amount of Irish stereotyping at the St. Patrick 's Day celebration . This was a reference to when Conan O 'Brien was a writer for the show and was of Irish descent , and his use of Irish stereotypes . Various writers were very concerned about Bart getting drunk . This was why he drank the beer through a horn , to show that it was only accidental . This was a toned down version of what was in John Swartzwelder 's original script . Originally Chief Wiggum 's first line was " They 're either drunk or on the cocaine " , but it was deemed too old @-@ fashioned . The discovery of " more lines on the parchment " was a simple deus ex machina to get Homer freed and to end the episode . 
 When Homer first enters Moe 's " Pet Shop " the man that tips his hat to him outside was a background character used in the early seasons . The riot at the beginning of the episode was taken from footage from the end of the season 6 episode " Lisa on Ice " and updated . The line " To alcohol ! The cause of ... and solution to ... all of life 's problems , " was originally the act break line at the end of act two , but was moved to the very end of the episode . 
 = = Censorship = = 
 During the riot , a scene where an Irish mob blow @-@ up a British chip shop named " John Bull 's Fish & Chips " was censored on British television . The episode first aired while the conflict in Northern Ireland known as The Troubles was ongoing and four years after the Shankill Road bombing in which ten people were killed by a Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) bomb which exploded prematurely in a chip shop . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode parodies the series The Untouchables , with the character of Rex Banner based on Robert Stack 's portrayal of Eliot Ness , and the voice of the narrator being based on that of Walter Winchell . Barney leaving flowers outside the Duff brewery is , according to show runner Josh Weinstein , a reference to people leaving flowers at the grave sites of various Hollywood figures , with him specifically citing Rudolph Valentino and Marilyn Monroe as examples of this trend . It may also be a direct reference to the Poe Toaster . The shot of the diner is a reference to Edward Hopper 's Nighthawks painting . A sign in Moe 's Bar says " No Irish Need Apply " a reference to Anti @-@ Irish sentiment . One of the persons on the float " The Drunken Irish Novelists of Springfield " bears a resemblance to Irish writer James Joyce . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment " finished 39th in ratings for the week of March 10 – 26 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 9 , equivalent to approximately 8 @.@ 6 million viewing households . It was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files . 
 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it " A nice episode in which Homer actually devises a clever plan to keep the beer flowing . " The Toronto Star described the episode as one of Bob Anderson 's " classics . " The Daily Telegraph also characterized the episode as one of " The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes . " Robert Canning gave the episode 9 @.@ 8 / 10 calling it his favorite episode of the series . 
 Homer 's line " To alcohol ! The cause of ... and solution to ... all of life 's problems " was described by Josh Weinstein as " one of the best , most truthful Simpsons statements ever . " In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly included it in their list of " 24 <unk> Quotable TV <unk> " . 
 = The Last of the Masters = 
 The Last of the Masters ( also known as Protection Agency ) is a science fiction novelette by Philip K. Dick . The original manuscript of the story was received by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on July 15 , 1953 , and the story was published by the <unk> Corporation in the final issue of Orbit Science Fiction in 1954 . It has since been reprinted in several Philip K. Dick story collections , beginning with The Golden Man in 1980 . 
 " The Last of the Masters " depicts a society 200 years after a global anarchist revolution has toppled the national governments of the world ( the exact year is unstated ) . Civilization has stagnated due to the loss of scientific knowledge and industry during the now @-@ legendary revolt . Elsewhere , the last state , governing a highly centralized and efficient society , conceals itself from the Anarchist League , a global militia preventing the recreation of any government . When three agents of the League are sent to investigate rumors of the microstate 's existence , the government arranges for them to be killed , leading to the death of one and the capture of another . Tensions rapidly escalate after the agents of the state realize that the third has escaped . Assuming he will report the state 's existence , the government mobilizes for total war . In actuality , the surviving anarchist elects to attempt his comrades ' rescue and assassinate the head of state : the last surviving " government robot " . 
 The primary theme of the story is the conflict between anarchism and statism , the political and ethical dimensions of which are explored through the characters ' dialogue . Though the attention the story received was limited prior to the author 's death in 1982 , it has since seen greater circulation in Philip K. Dick story collections , and has been reviewed and analyzed for its postmodern critique of technology and its political implications . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = The last government = = = 
 The title character , Bors , a 200 @-@ year @-@ old " government integration robot " — and the last in existence — awakens after a routine maintenance check to learn that his motor system is in a state of decline . An artificially intelligent machine who displays a degree of emotion and even psychological complexity , he is informed by Fowler , a personal mechanic , that his body has begun to break down due to age . His legs no longer work , his motor system will be irreparable in a matter of months , and full paralysis will take place in under a year . 
 Of his entire body , only five " synapse coils " have not yet begun to degrade . These memory units are irreplaceable due to the lack of skilled technicians and rare components needed to recreate them . Within them , he stores the last records of advanced science and technology , which he uses to guide his society at high efficiency as a benevolent dictator , operating according to utilitarian principles . Though he wields hegemonic control over his society , he views his dictatorship as the last bastion of humanity 's scientific progress , and views himself as a guardian who oversees and protects that progress . This causes him to privately despair that he — and the knowledge only he possesses — will soon die . He also becomes increasingly paranoid , fearing to trust a loyal assistant , Peter Green , and confiding only in Fowler , his personal mechanic . 
 Hidden in a remote mountain valley , Bors commands the world 's last government . The microstate is tightly centralized around him , and he manages it bureaucratically for optimum efficiency in all sectors of the economy and military . The effect is " an accurate and detailed reproduction of a society two centuries gone . " Bors is immediately established as an utterly necessary figure in his society and is quickly escorted back into service as the leader of the government by Fowler . A personal assistant as well as mechanic to Bors , Fowler maintains a pretension of loyalty to the robot , but privately recognizes that his society is stagnant and that its leader is becoming mentally unbalanced . Pessimistic , he expresses cynicism regarding the subservient role humans in his society play to Bors . He is contrasted with Peter Green , a genuinely loyal assistant to the robot , who is among the few humans trusted to oversee his body while it is unconscious for repair . Though loyal to his leader , Green nonetheless draws Bors ' distrust as the robot 's paranoia steadily grows . 
 = = = The Anarchist League = = = 
 Elsewhere , three members of the " Anarchist League " are on a mission to investigate rumors of a government in existence near a remote mountain valley . The League is a global organization dedicated to seeking out and eradicating governments . Established at some unknown point during or after the global revolt , the League is organized around " League camps " which dot the landscape . Members of the League are easily recognized by their " <unk> staffs " : metallic walking sticks which they are trained in using as weapons . These tools are a symbol of the League — " the walking Anarchists who patrolled the world on foot , the world 's protection agency . " 
 The three member team is composed of Edward Tolby , his daughter , Silvia Tolby ( of unspecified age , but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult ) , and their mutual friend , Robert Penn . While en route to the valley , the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax . Fairfax is littered with ancient , decaying gadgets ; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society , which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce . Excited by the strangers , the locals ask about the League . Tolby answers their questions in turn , ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt . The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments . After France exists for a month free of government , millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers . At each toppled government center , millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed . These events result in the setting of the story ; a world full of anachronistic high @-@ technology , interspersed in a pre @-@ industrialized , agrarian culture . 
 = = = Conflict and resolution = = = 
 While retelling the story of the anarchist revolution , Tolby attracts the attention of a local who invites the trio of anarchists to her home , but who is in secret a government spy ordered to kill them . The ensuing assassination plot is bungled , as the spy dies in the process , but succeeds in killing Penn . Silvia is also badly injured and left unconscious . Her father survives the tragedy largely unscathed , however , and awakens as a patrol of military scouts arrives . The scouts panic after a brief counterattack by Tolby and retreat with Silvia captive . After re @-@ arming himself , Tolby sets out to mount her rescue . 
 Bors is alerted to the situation and overreacts upon learning that one of the three anarchists has escaped . Fearing that the agent will alert the world to their existence , he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room . Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the microstate . He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior , allowing him to survive in hiding . Enraged by his calm indifference to the prospect of war , Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape , but is restrained by guards . 
 Tolby infiltrates the mountain valley , sneaking past the rapidly mobilizing army of the state . After killing and outmaneuvering inexperienced soldiers , he arrives at the government center and encounters Fowler . Fowler alludes to his desire to end the government and spurs Tolby onward . Ultimately , Tolby confronts and kills Bors , sending the building into confusion as the citizens react with hysteria and grief . The condition is implied to spread outward from the city to troops in the hills , resulting in mass desertion . No longer resisted by guards , Tolby reunites with Silvia . The story concludes as Fowler secretly salvages three remaining synapse coils from Bors ' remains , " just in case the times change " .

 The exact date Philip K. Dick wrote " The Last of the Masters " is unknown , but the original manuscript of the novelette was received by the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on July 15 , 1953 . 25 years old at the time , Dick was in the habit of submitting a new story to the agency weekly . Just prior to receiving " Last of the Masters " , the agency received " The Turning Wheel " on July 8 , and following the former , the agency received " The Father @-@ thing " on July 21 . " The Last of the Masters " was published over a year later , in the 1954 November / December issue of Orbit Science Fiction <unk> The issue was the last in a science fiction anthology series edited by Donald A. Wollheim . Orbit Science Fiction advertised " The Last of the Masters " on its cover and included Dick among an advertised list of prominent contributing authors , among them August Derleth , Gordon R. Dickson , and Chad Oliver . The novelette was republished in 1958 for the Australian market by Jubilee Publications Pty . , in Space Station 42 and Other Stories , a part of the Satellite Series . 
 The novelette was not published again until the 1980 release of The Golden Man , the sixth collection of classic stories by Dick . This collection also included the only commentary Dick ever wrote regarding the story . Thereafter , " The Last of the Masters " was included in six more print collections — most of which have seen multiple print runs — and two audiobooks .

 The Last Of The Masters is in the public domain in the United States because it was published in the United States between January 1 , 1950 and December 31 , 1963 , but copyright was not renewed with the U.S. Copyright Office within a year period beginning on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright and running through December 31 of the following year . When renewal registration was not made within the statutory time limit , copyright effectively expired at the end of its first term and protection was lost permanently . Copyright protection for Orbit Science Fiction No.5 and its contents was created under registration number <unk> . 
 After the author 's death , a nonexistent story with the same title was included under the new renewal registration number <unk> . This created the appearance that " The Last Of The Masters " was still under copyright protection . This incorrect first publication date has been cited in several Dick anthologies ( e.g. , The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick & The Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick ) ; these publications falsely list the original publication of the story to have been in Imaginative Tales in November 1955 .

 While " The Last of the Masters " was little noticed in the years immediately following its publication , it was reviewed after its 1980 publication in The Golden Man collection . Fellow science fiction writer Thomas M. Disch reviewed Dick 's The Golden Man collection among other works in " Fluff and <unk> " , an essay dated to 1979 , but published in a 1980 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction . While celebrating several stories in the collection , and proclaiming to readers the " categorical imperative " of buying a copy , he nonetheless derided most of its contents as " turkeys " , citing specifically " The Last of the Masters " as an example . Referring to the story as " a hyperkinetic foray into hairy @-@ chested @-@ style hugger @-@ mugger " , Disch also mocked its " action @-@ packed denouement " involving Edward Tolby as an example of " bogus machismo " . 
 In her 1982 review of the Golden Man collection , Hazel Pierce lauded the sophistication of the story , summarizing the theme of " The Last of the Masters " as an examination of " the paradoxical cast of human existence . " 
 = = Thematic analysis = = 
 = = = Technological critique = = = 
 In his 1980 commentary on the story , Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic was a result of a form of trust he advanced towards robots , as opposed to androids . " Perhaps " , he suggested , " it 's because a robot does not try to deceive you as to what it is " . One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick 's fiction is the " power of empathy " and he uses it as the " key element defining the authentic human being " . For example , when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government , she exclaims " My God , you have no understanding of us . You run all this , and you 're incapable of empathy . You 're nothing but a mechanical computer . " 
 Christopher Palmer , of La Trobe University , has written on the postmodern literary themes of Dick 's early short stories , analyzing stories in which " breakdown and ignorance " are the result of social upheaval . Palmer proposed that Dick often created post @-@ apocalyptic scenarios of ruined worlds which held high tech gadgets in an attempt to present a view of postmodern materialism . Common to many of Dick 's short stories were settings in which the outgrowth of modernity is a world where that which is natural is in ruin , and what is artificial is reshaped through science into a fantastically high tech form . Palmer presented " The Last of the Masters " as an example of this , as well as " The Variable Man " and The Penultimate Truth , two other post @-@ apocalyptic works by Dick . Palmer contended that these shared themes were " ... not simply the expression of dystopian malaise , or of Luddism treacherously taking up residence in popular SF ... It points to a coherent interpretation of industrialism and post @-@ industrialism . " 
 Suggesting that many of the philosophical and political underpinnings of the author 's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life , Palmer 's focus turned to Dick 's common use of sterility as a metaphor . In " The Gun " , " Second Variety " , The Penultimate Truth , and " The Last of the Masters " , people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility . As Palmer noted of " The Last of the Masters " , Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility : " It is not clear why he does not replicate himself , or educate his human servants : it is simply a given that he is sterile . The old , technologically advanced , highly organized civilization is a civilization of production , but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself . " Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility , Palmer asserts that Dick 's work presented a social and existential protest . Palmer interpreted Dick 's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence , and genuinely expresses a form of individuality , then the process of reproduction is alienating , oppressive , and retards an individual 's liberty . As Palmer explains , " ... this process <unk> consumers , and even technocrats , by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant . " <unk> , Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author 's concept of what made an object unique and valuable : " A thing can 't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing . " 
 In writing a biography on the author , Brian Stableford placed several of Dick 's short stories in a context that established their relationship to the author 's personal hardships . " ... it always seemed to him [ Philip K. Dick ] that his career was a catalogue of undeserved disappointments and the record of his published work a travesty of his true ambitions . " The personal problems which Dick struggled throughout his life provided fuel for several of the anxiety driven themes for his short stories . In Dick 's early work , Stableford highlighted recurring themes in those most popular . These included paranoid suspicions ; the dangerous hostility of " seemingly innocent entities " ; and " the mechanization of the environment and the computerization of political decision @-@ making " . Stories in which androids and robots are a danger to the protagonist include " <unk> " , " Colony " , and Vulcan 's Hammer . However , " The Last of the Masters " , Stableford contends , was an exception to Dick 's common dystopic portrayals of technology , given Stableford 's interpretation of Bors as an <unk> , who was " benign " in its role .

 In his 1980 commentary , Philip K. Dick pointed out the moral ambiguity of the story , laying out its political implications : " Should we have a leader or should we think for ourselves ? Obviously the latter , in principle . But – sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical . " This quote became part of a larger political analysis of Dick 's work in How Much Does Chaos Scare You ? by Aaron Barlow , Associate Professor of English at New York City College of Technology . In analyzing Dick 's short fiction , Barlow presented their themes against the backdrop of post @-@ September 11 , 2001 America . In particular , Barlow compared many of the philosophical underpinnings of <unk> , and its rise to prominence during the George W. Bush administration , to the philosophy of Philip K. Dick . " To [ Dick ] , " writes Barlow , " the elites were both alien and dangerous . To him , the focus of vision and of political debate should never be on the rulers , but on the little person , the shopkeeper , the mechanic . " In his dissection of Dick 's work , Barlow compared several stories in which normal humans lose some form of liberty in their society to an elite group . Examples presented include " <unk> " , " Null @-@ O " , and " Some Kinds of Life " . From these stories , Barlow drew three themes important to Dick 's anti @-@ government writings : first , that humanity is often doomed by institutions of power created by the humans themselves ; second , that paranoia is a natural aspect of governance , as " [ n ] o elite can ever completely trust the people it governs , " and this distrust leaves a governed people in perpetual danger ; and third , that the belief that individuality must be sacrificed — either for the sake of social stability or survival — is a constant threat . " To Dick , " Barlow adds , " there are few attitudes more dangerous than this . " Each of these themes would be revisited in " The Last of the Masters " . 
 Continuing his analysis , Barlow addressed " The Last of the Masters " , contrasting it with an earlier work by Dick , " The Defenders " . In " The Defenders " , humanity has been duped by a noble lie — provided by their robot soldiers — into believing in a war which is not actually taking place . In the latter story , Barlow asserts that Dick surprisingly agreed with such neoconservative theorists as Leo Strauss in the efficacy of the deception . " Here , the [ robots ] have saved mankind ... The ' noble lie ' has served its purpose . " However , Barlow concedes , " [ b ] ut this is an extremely early story and Dick had not yet clarified his own world view ... " Comparing this story to " The Last of the Masters " , Barlow took note of Dick 's commentary from The Golden Man collection ( " ... sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical . " ) and concluded that the story represented Dick 's understanding of " the problems at the other extreme ... " in politics . Where most of Dick 's stories presented government in skeptical terms to warn the reader of potential abuse , " The Last of the Master " presented an argument for the utility of government . 
 Barlow dissected the Anarchist League and " the contradictory nature of their organization " which patrolled a " poor and dirty " world , and juxtaposed this with the " opulent organization of the ( state ) " . In particular , he highlighted dialogue by the robot master , Bors , as illustrating the importance of his leadership to the success of the micro @-@ state . In the story , a conversation with a mechanic leads the robot to state , " You know I 'm the only one who can keep all this together . I 'm the only one who knows how to maintain a planned society , not a disorderly chaos ! If it weren 't for me , all this would collapse , and you 'd have dust and ruins and weeds . The whole outside would come rushing in to take over ! " Barlow concluded that while the story ended in triumph for the anarchists , the story did not go so far as to validate their society . " Dick does not vindicate them , " writes Barlow , " keeping it clear that the robot had certainly accomplished something in that valley , though it had eventually gone too far . "

 In a commentary made for the 1980 anthology , The Golden Man , Philip K. Dick briefly touched on several themes of the story , including the Christian allegory of the " suffering servant " , manifested in the character of Bors . This was touched upon in the Dick biography Divine Invasions , by memoirist and biographer Lawrence Sutin . Drawing on Dick 's commentary , Sutin sees Bors as part of a religious pattern in Dick 's stories as a " Christ @-@ like robot " , and likens the robot to characters in other stories by Dick who suffer from illness . 
 = Me , Myself and I ( Beyoncé song ) = 
 " Me , Myself and I " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé . It was written by Beyoncé , Scott Storch and Robert Waller for her debut solo album Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) . The recording was produced by Storch with guitars performed by musician Aaron Fishbein . Beyoncé decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the third single ; the song was sent by Columbia Records to US radio on October 19 , 2003 . " Me , Myself and I " is an R & B song about dealing with a philandering boyfriend and learning from the consequences . 
 " Me , Myself and I " was generally well received by music critics , who complimented the smooth and assertive vocals of Beyoncé and called it a 1980s throwback from Dangerously in Love . The Grammy Award @-@ nominated song earned Beyoncé , Storch and Waller an American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers Pop Music Award . " Me , Myself and I " peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , and became Beyoncé 's fourth consecutive US top five single . It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . The single reached the top 20 in Australia , the UK and in some European countries . 
 Directed by Johan Renck , the accompanying music video follows the plot of the song 's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse . " Me , Myself and I " was part of Beyoncé 's set list on the Verizon Ladies First Tour , the Dangerously in Love Tour , The Beyoncé Experience , the I Am ... Tour and the Formation World Tour .

 After the release of her former group Destiny 's Child 's 2001 album Survivor , Beyoncé worked on her debut solo album , Dangerously in Love . She stated that it was more personal than her previous records because she only had to write for herself . She contacted various musical collaborators , including Storch and Waller . The musical style of " Me , Myself and I " is different from the style of her previous singles ; Beyoncé decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the next single . Following the release of the song , Beyoncé told Corey Moss of MTV News , " [ ' Me , Myself and I ' ] is really powerful . It talks about women basically listening to their inner voice and knowing that they will never disappoint themselves . " 
 " Me , Myself and I " was the third single released from Dangerously in Love , which followed " Crazy in Love " and " Baby Boy " . It was sent to United States Rhythmic contemporary and Urban contemporary radio on October 19 , 2003 . A CD single was released on October 21 , 2003 in the US , which contained Junior 's dance radio mix of " Krazy in Luv " as its B @-@ side . It officially impacted U.S. Top 40 / Mainstream radio on November 12 , 2003 . On December 16 , 2003 , a 12 @-@ inch single was released in the US . The single was released in selected European countries in January 2004 , including Austria , Belgium , Ireland , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Switzerland . 
 " Me , Myself and I " was first released in the United Kingdom as a maxi single on January 6 , 2004 . A week later , it was released as a double CD single ; the first disc included a radio edit of the song and " Dangerously in Love 2 " ( 2003 ) , and the second one contained two remixes of " Me , Myself and I " . In 2004 , the single was also released in the UK on a CD that included videos of live performances of " Naughty Girl " and " Work it Out " . In Canada , a CD single was released on December 30 , 2003 , featuring the album version and two remixes of the track . A CD single was released in Australia on January 16 , 2004 , which included the radio edit and three remixes of the track . The song was also released as a maxi single on January 19 , 2003 and later as a three @-@ track single in Germany . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing , " Me , Myself and I " is an R & B song performed in a moderately slow manner . It is written in the key of D ♭ major ; the tempo is set to eighty @-@ four beats per minute , in common time . The chord follows the E ♭ <unk> @-@ Fm7 @-@ G ♭ <unk> keys , appearing every other bar , and the song has a string arrangement . According to Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media , the song 's instrumentation consists of a blending of funk keyboards , a slippery bass and minimal , programmed R & B percussion instruments . 
 " Me , Myself and I " is " ... replete with strong woman lyrics about holding one 's head up high after a traumatic break @-@ up . " The lyrics are constructed in the common verse @-@ chorus form , each written in two stanzas . The song includes an intro and a bridge that appears between the second and final choruses . In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV News , Beyoncé explained the lyrical content of the song : 
 ... [ Me , Myself and I ] basically talks about a girl who the guy 's not right for her and he 's cheating and whatever . And usually women feel stupid and silly and they blame themselves ' cause you have all the signs most of the time , but you love the guy so you don 't want to see them go . And in this song , it 's kind of like a celebration of the breakup ... 
 According to Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly , " Me , Myself and I " is similar to " Say My Name " ( 2000 ) , in terms of " ... its specificity and earnestness ... " and the way Beyoncé defends " ... her chastity [ a ] <unk> some greedy boy ... . " This was echoed by James Poletti of Yahoo ! Music who wrote that the song hints at what is to come as the warbling begins to move into overdrive on " ... a faintly sickly , if admirably slick , ode to that old Destiny 's Child staple ... " , independence and self @-@ belief in the face of a cheating man .

 The song received generally positive response from music critics . Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters said : " Beyoncé sounds assured " in her singing of the song and " ... lacking any of the ' shrill overboard ' that describes some of the ' melisma fits ' ... that marked earlier vocal efforts . " Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media noted the song as the " most notable 80s throwback " of the album , as its " augmented chords " call to mind Patti Austin and James Ingram 's 1983 single " Baby Come to Me " and Michael Jackson 's 1983 single " Human Nature " , or a decelerated version of " Baby Be Mine " , from Jackson 's 1982 album , Thriller . Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly said : Me , Myself , and I rides Storch 's signature gangsta guitar , mellowed for Beyoncé 's lovesick lament ... While reviewing Beyoncé second studio album , B 'Day in 2006 , Andy Kellman of Allmusic remarked that there are no songs with the " ... smooth elegance of ' Me , Myself and I ' " . Spence D. , writing for IGN Music considered " Me , Myself and I " as a typical sounding R & B ballad with a familiar theme , and in which Beyoncé sings with passion .

 The footage follows the plot of the song 's theme , in which Beyoncé deals with a cheating boyfriend . From the aftermath of the affair , Beyoncé discards her old possessions that reminds her of her boyfriend . The events in the video are played in reverse . Beyoncé said that this music video was the hardest video she had ever made . Philadelphia 's Patrick DeMarco described the video as " sexy " . In 2004 , the video was nominated for Best R & B Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards . In May 2010 , an alternative version of the video was released ; this does not show the events in reverse and includes some of the scenes that were not included in the first version .

She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse , saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend 's mistress . During the performance , Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience 's response , which was " is all I got in the end " . She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back , and continued singing , then told the audience that she wrote the song for " each and every one of y 'all ! " . 
 " Me , Myself and I " was also included on the set list of Beyoncé 's Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003 . During the tour , Beyoncé appeared suspended from the ceiling of the arena , and was lowered onto a red lounger .

 = Norwegian Public Safety Radio = 
 The Norwegian Public Safety Radio ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a public safety network system based on Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) which is being implemented by the Directorate for Emergency Communication ( Norwegian : <unk> for <unk> ) throughout Norway . The system will primarily be used for internal communication for the police , fire departments and paramedics , and will later be taken into use for search and rescue , border control , the civil defense , the military and other public agencies . Planning of the system started in 1995 and in 2006 the contract was awarded to Nokia Siemens Networks . As Nokia Siemens Networks was unable to complete the contract , it was passed on to Motorola Solutions . 
 The system is replacing nearly 300 local and regional systems which are independent for the fire , police and healthcare agencies . The Norwegian Public Safety Radio allows functionality such as authentication , encryption , higher reliability and additional functionality . The network is budgeted to cost 3 @.@ 6 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . Investments are being paid for by the government , but users have to pay for operating costs . In 2009 the first part of the system was taken into use , with all three agencies in Oslo , Akershus , Østfold and Southern Buskerud having taken it into use as of August 2010 , two years after schedule . There have been shortcomings of indoor coverage which has caused some agencies to retain use of the old systems 
 = = Background and choice of technology = = 
 Formerly , Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police , fire departments and paramedics , all based on analog radio . The old system had two main downsides : it was not encrypted , and it prohibited communication between agencies . This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents , and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions . The Norwegian Data Inspectorate has also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy . This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems , or through the construction of a new , digital network . 
 Another issue is using standardized technology for communication with other country 's agencies . Norway is a member of the Schengen Agreement , which requires trans @-@ border communication between law enforcement agencies . There were 27 different networks for the police , one for each police district . In Oslo , Akershus and Østfold , the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994 . There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems , and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector . The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service , including paramedics , ambulance services , midwives and medical doctors . The various systems had different levels of coverage . In addition , Global System for Mobile Communication ( GSM ) and Nordic Mobile Telephone ( <unk> ) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary . 
 Keeping the old systems and converting them to encrypted systems was also considered . This would cost NOK 500 million to install , but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily . In particular , encryption would delay communications , which would be a problem for paramedic communications . It was also uncertain if the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted . 
 The government considered using a similar procurement solution to that in Denmark , where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise , and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies , based on conventional GSM technology . However , in Denmark this had not given the desired results , with only Metropolitan Copenhagen being covered . Instead , the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network . Use of the GSM and <unk> network was insufficient because of lack of capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication , lack of ability of group conversations , lack of priority systems and long dial @-@ up times . 
 Using conventional GSM systems was rejected also because GSM lacks many of the functionalities of TETRA , such as group conversations , dispatcher centers , and direct communication . In addition , Global System for Mobile Communication – Railway ( GSM @-@ R ) was considered , but rejected because of the lack of trans @-@ border functionality and the need for more base stations , and thus higher investment costs , and longer start @-@ up time for calls . The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM @-@ R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network . Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM @-@ R. TETRA also allows a fall @-@ back system , where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station , even if the central parts of the network should break down . 
 In a parliamentary hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge <unk> and Minister of Justice , Odd Einar <unk> , stated that the choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity . In a parliamentary decision in 2004 it was decided to opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( <unk> ) as a data transmission standard , which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe , but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service ( TEDS ) owned by Motorola . The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs . 
 In 2000 , the annual cost of agency communication was NOK 175 million , while this had increased to NOK 260 million in 2004 . The increase was largely caused by the increase in use of mobile telephones . The costs of the fire department networks was paid for by the municipalities , the health network paid for by the municipalities and the regional health authorities , and the police networks by the respective police districts . 
 = = Implementation = = 
 Work with the system started in 1995 , when the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision took initiative for a new mobile telecommunications platform . The issue was coordinated by the Ministry of Justice , and the issue was first discussed politically in 1997 , and in 1998 a project group was created . In 2000 , a pilot project was established in Greater Trondheim , which included all three agencies . The trial was successful and terminated in June 2003 . Later that year , the Parliament of Norway made the principal decision to establish the network . Quality control of the project was concluded in June 2004 , and construction was estimated at NOK 3 @.@ 6 billion . The investment costs would be covered by the Ministry of Justice , while the user agencies would have to pay for the operating and maintenance costs of the network . 
 The procurement process was initially led by the Ministry of Justice and the Police , in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Care Services , the National Police Directorate , the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs and the Directorate for Civil Defence and Emergency Planning . The public tender was launched in May 2005 , and on 22 December 2006 the contract was signed with Nokia Siemens Networks . The project is the largest single information technology contract ever awarded in Norway . The Directorate for Emergency Communication was established on 1 April 2007 . 
 Original plans called for the system to be built between 2007 and 2011 . Implementation was planned in six phases , numbered zero through five . Between phases zero and one , an evaluation of the process was planned . The first phase covers the smallest geographic area , but the largest population . 
 By June 2007 , the project was delayed by half a year . One of the major delays in the project has been the development of the software for the health sector 's communication centers — which consist of emergency wards , casualty wards , emergency dispatch centers and aircraft coordination centers . The system is being developed by <unk> in Austria , who have stated that they did not receive sufficient specifications . In December 2009 , the state granted NOK 110 million extra for development of the system . Health workers will therefore be taking the network into use in May 2010 , after the police and fire departments in Follo and Østfold . Representatives for the Police Directorate have criticized the implementation model and stated that in most other countries , the system was implemented first just for the police and afterwards taken into use by the fire and paramedic agencies . For instance , Østfold Police District had installed a new center in February 2008 , but had to wait 21 months to take it into use while waiting for Public Safety Radio . 
 The Police Directorate sees the use of the encrypted communication as the system 's greatest benefit , and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated , and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally . The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009 , and by Oslo in March 2010 . In Oslo , the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles , and instead give all officers hand @-@ held devices , to speed up the closing of the old network , which is regarded as a security hazard . Traditionally , journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios . The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents . The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo took the system into use in June 2010 . 
 In August 2010 , the emergency health communication centers in Østfold and the casualty ward at Fredrikstad Hospital took the Norwegian Public Safety Radio into use . This was followed by the emergency rooms in Halden and <unk> , in Rakkestad and Sarpsborg , and in Oslo . For the health sector , phase zero involves 40 communication centers , of which 20 are emergency rooms , 16 are casualty wards at hospitals , one is an air ambulance coordination center and three are emergency health communication centers , in addition to radios in the 150 ambulances that serve in the region . The official opening of the network took place on 17 August 2010 . In October 2010 , Arne Johannesen , the leader of the Norwegian Police Federation , stated that he wanted to place the building of the radio network on hold and instead use the funding for a new information technology system for the police force , named D # 2 . 
 DNK carried out tests with the system in 2010 for firefighters using self @-@ contained breathing apparatus in structure fires , and found the system to be sufficient . Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year , and they found that the radio system was insufficient for their needs . Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway / repeater @-@ radio equipment . Because of this firefighters in Oslo continue to use the old ultra @-@ high frequency radios during indoor fires . Both the Norwegian Police Security Service 's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system , citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground , even in downtown Oslo . The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies , which is a drawback in case of major incidents . Also the joint rescue coordination centers , the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage . During the 2011 Norway attacks at <unk> , located in northern Buskerud , police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The network is owned by the Directorate for Emergency Communication , which is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice . The ministry signed an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to install the system . Nokia Siemens Networks also have the responsibility for operating and maintaining the system for 20 years . Nokia Siemens Networks has subcontracted control room systems to <unk> , <unk> for transmission , <unk> for operation and maintenance , and <unk> for training . The directorate is led by Tor Helge <unk> and has its offices in Nydalen in Oslo . 
 The cost of constructing the network will be covered by the ministry . The costs of operating and maintaining the network will be covered by the users , who will also have to purchase their own terminals . Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal , based on the terminal 's use . For a terminal only used for stand @-@ by , the annual subscription cost will be NOK 1 @,@ 500 per year , while that for a terminal in a control room will be NOK 40 @,@ 000 . As the cost of running the network is fixed independently of the amount of traffic , there is no cost for using the network . As additional users start implementing the system , the costs per subscriber will be reduced . 
 = = Network = = 
 The Terrestrial Trunked Radio network has three components : the core net , which is a centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure ; the transmission net , which connects the core net , the radio net and other connection points with high @-@ capacity lines ; and the radio net , which consists of base stations with antennas in masts , on buildings and in some tunnels . The network is controlled from a center in Oslo , which is operated by Nokia Siemens Network . In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net , the base station can still relay communication within its range . Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage , the terminals can communicate directly with each other . 
 All communication from mobile terminals to the base stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and the terminal . For group conversations , two keys are used , one from the terminal to the base station , and one from the base station to all users . In addition , there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal @-@ to @-@ terminal communication should the base station fall out . In addition , the police can use a user @-@ to @-@ user encryption where the communication is encrypted all the way through the network from the one user to the other . 
 The system will ensure 100 % coverage of populated and surrounding areas , which exceeds any of the existing GSM networks . This includes good coverage indoors , to aid fire fighters , as well as full coverage of the coastline and coverage up to 2 @,@ 500 meters ( 8 @,@ 000 ft ) height for aircraft . It will give full coverage along all national and county roads . The system also allows interoperability towards the maritime radio . The system also allows for transmission of digital information at a speed of 28 @.@ 8 kb / s . As the system is rolled out , central parts will receive <unk> , which includes the TETRA Enhanced Data Services , which allows for transmission speeds of 163 kbit / s . 
 There has been raised criticism against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system . The most fundamental is the lack of indoor coverage . This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics , Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . Another major shortcoming is that the system does not support any transmission of data . For instance police scanning of fingerprints , sending of blueprints to firefighters and paramedics sending video from an accident for analysis by physicians have been mentioned as technology which could be used if only the radio system allowed for transmission of data . Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know , allowing for easy sabotage , and increased investment costs because of the choice of the proprietary TEDS instead of the open <unk> system . 
 = = Terminals = = 
 The system has two types of receivers : radio terminals , which can either be hand @-@ held or mounted in vehicles , and desktop equipment for control centers . The system will include 40 @,@ 000 radios throughout the country . Compared to the analog network , the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free , and allow special radios for motorcycles , snowmobiles , boats , undercover activities and smoke diving . Communication can either be performed as one @-@ to @-@ one conversations , group calls for predefined or ad @-@ hoc groups , with radios able to be part of several groups , or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage . The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use . All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network . 
 Control room terminals will have new functionality including identification of all users and radio terminal positioning , radio and telephone inquiries made on the same equipment , use of either loudspeakers or head sets , and allowing operators to listen to each other 's conversations .

 The Platte Canyon High School hostage crisis was an incident of a hostage taking and shooting that occurred at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey , Colorado , on September 27 , 2006 . The gunman , 53 @-@ year @-@ old Duane Roger Morrison , took six female students hostage and sexually assaulted them , later releasing four . When police broke open the classroom 's door with explosives , Morrison opened fire with a semiautomatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head . The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed , and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom . Keyes was pronounced dead at 4 : 32 p.m. MDT ( 23 : 32 UTC ) at Saint Anthony 's Hospital in Denver , Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery .

 At about 11 : 40 a.m. , Morrison entered the school carrying a .40 S & W caliber Glock 22 pistol , a Smith & Wesson .357 @-@ caliber revolver ( which wasn 't used during the incident ) , and a backpack , which he claimed contained " three pounds of C @-@ 4 " . A search of the backpack later recovered duct tape , handcuffs , knives , a stun gun , rope , scissors , massage oil , sex toys , and numerous rounds of ammunition , but no explosives . 
 A sixteen @-@ year @-@ old student named Katrina Keller reportedly saw Morrison entering the school before the time specified by police . She stated that she had been walking past a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt , apparently angry . Keller did not report the incident to the school office . Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow Jeep in the school parking lot at around 10 : 45 a.m. , almost an hour before he entered the school . Morrison was believed to have been living in the car , camping out near Bailey . Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes , mingling with students as classes changed , 35 minutes before the siege began . Earlier , Morrison had spoken to a male high school student that day and " asked about the identity of a list of female students . " 
 Morrison entered a classroom on the second floor , room 206 , where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English . When Smith asked him what he was doing in the classroom , he pulled out his handgun and ordered her , all of the male students , and several female students to leave . He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again . After Smith and the male students left the classroom , Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard . He later released one student at approximately 12 : 15 p.m. , before law enforcement arrived at the scene . 
 Park County sheriff Fred Wegener ( whose son was in the school building at the time of the incident ) informed the media that all seven girls were molested , though he did not know " how much or to what degree . " <unk> Long , a 15 @-@ year @-@ old sophomore and one of the seven hostages , stated that Morrison lined the girls up facing a chalkboard and then sexually assaulted all of them ; Long stated that she knew that the other hostages were being molested because of " the rustling of clothes and elastic being snapped and zippers being opened and closed . " During the sexual assaults , Morrison reportedly held his gun to the hostages ' heads and threatened to kill them if they did not cooperate . According to the first hostage released , Morrison would systematically take individual hostages from the blackboard and further into the interior of the classroom before sexually assaulting them . 
 = = = Negotiations and evacuations = = = 
 A " code white " alert was sounded over the intercom and students were instructed to remain in their classrooms . Negotiations with Morrison began with the goal of allowing the six remaining hostages in the room to be released . Initially , he directly spoke to deputies in the hallway while holding one of the hostages at gunpoint , but later spoke via telephone and used the student hostages as <unk> between the negotiators and himself , as he did not want to speak directly with officials . After four of the six girls were released between the hours of 12 : 35 p.m. and 1 : 45 p.m. , negotiators heightened the intensity of their indirect discussions with Morrison . During this time , 16 @-@ year @-@ old junior Emily Keyes , one of the two remaining hostages , managed to send her family a brief text message stating , " I love u guys " in response to a text message ( " R U OK ? " ) her father , John @-@ Michael Keyes , had sent using his cell phone after receiving word that an incident was occurring at the high school . When Keyes ' father sent the message " Where are you ? " , he received no response . 
 A total of 800 students from both Platte Canyon High School and the nearby Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated . Morrison 's demands were unknown , although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request for the police to back away . All students , except the hostages , were safely evacuated by 12 : 10 p.m. and by 3 : 00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School . Parents were able to gain little information from authorities , who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued . 
 = = = Shooting = = = 
 By the time the four student hostages were released , a bomb squad , SWAT team from Jefferson County , and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives were sent to the scene . Ambulances parked in the end zone of the high school 's football field . A 4 @-@ mile ( 6 km ) stretch of U.S. Route 285 was closed . At approximately 3 : 32 p.m. , negotiations began to stall . Morrison later explicitly stated that he would stop negotiating at 4 : 00 p.m. 
 Wegener said that police had chosen to storm the second @-@ floor classroom after the man ended negotiations , stating that " something would happen at 4 p.m. " SWAT team members witnessed Morrison assaulting the girls , and Wegener made the decision to save the hostages by force , stating later , " My decision was either wait — [ and have the ] possibility of having two dead hostages or act and try to save what I feared he would do to them . ... Because I 'd want whoever was in my position to do the same thing , and that is to save lives . " 
 The police burst through the door at approximately 3 : 45 p.m. and encountered Morrison and the hostages behind a barricade of desks at a far wall . After using the hostages as human shields against the Jefferson County SWAT team , Morrison shot at the policemen , and then at Emily Keyes , who was trying to run . Morrison shot and critically wounded himself soon thereafter , simultaneously being shot by police , and died at the scene at 3 : 57 p.m. Keyes was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Denver , where she was pronounced dead at 4 : 32 p.m. The other hostage survived with no physical injuries . Investigators found no sign of explosives in the man 's backpack , but three additional firearms were recovered outside the school campus : a Colt AR @-@ 15 assault rifle found in a clearing adjacent to a river about a mile north of the school , a Browning bolt @-@ action rifle found north of the campus near U.S. Route 285 , and a Smith & Wesson .44 @-@ caliber revolver found south of the school near a hiking trail . 
 The coroner of Park County , Sharon Morris , confirmed that the body of Morrison ( which had four bullet wounds , three non @-@ fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun ) was still in the second @-@ floor classroom as of 6 : 00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head ( including the fatal one fired from his gun ) , two additional in the right shoulder , and a graze wound to his right hand , while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head . District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29 ; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7 : 00 a.m. for students . 
 = = The perpetrator = = 
 Duane Roger Morrison ( July 23 , 1953 – September 27 , 2006 ) was eventually identified as the perpetrator of the incident . He was unemployed at the time of the hostage crisis , and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages . Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35 @-@ year @-@ old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt . Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana , and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton , Colorado . Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI . Morrison 's family gave the letter to police , who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico , Virginia . In the 14 @-@ page letter , Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child , and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old . 
 On August 15 , 2006 , about one month prior to the shooting , he pleaded guilty to harassment after leaving a voice message to a local Harley @-@ Davidson dealership on November 22 , 2004 , after receiving a promotional catalog in his mail ; the message contained profanities and a threat to visit their headquarters with an assault rifle . Prior to that , he phoned a similar threatening call . An investigation found that Morrison had purchased a motorcycle from the dealership , but became " extremely dissatisfied " after not receiving certain aftermarket accessories and services promised in his contract , and the dealership reportedly never made any attempt to resolve the dispute . His suicide letter later mentioned the purchase , in which he vaguely claimed that " the matter wasn 't over " . On May 31 , 2005 , Morrison filed a report claiming that fifteen of his firearms were stolen from his residence , and later gained $ 10 @,@ 000 from a fictitious insurance claim initiated after the stolen firearms report . Four of the firearms mentioned in his report were among those recovered on or around the school campus ; the whereabouts of the remaining 11 firearms currently remain unknown . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Platte Canyon High School reopened a week after the shooting on October 5 . Memorials had been erected along the highway leading to the school that carried messages such as " Be Strong " and " Random Acts of Kindness " . A number of students prayed in front of the school before the day began and students were given donated teddy bears as they left . Fifty counselors were present during the day for students . Superintendent Dr. James Walpole noted that of 460 high school students , only 10 were absent . 
 The service for Emily Keyes was held on September 30 , the day that Governor Bill Owens later declared " Emily Keyes Day " . About 5 @,@ 000 motorcyclists took part in the " Columbine to Canyon Ride " , which occurred in memory of the victims of both the Columbine and Platte Canyon shootings . The procession of motorcycles was so long that the first to get to Platte Canyon High School arrived as the final motorcyclists departed from Columbine High School , two riding alongside each other . 
 The efforts initiated toward increased school security had come to a standstill several years after the Columbine High School massacre as federal and state funding toward safety was cut in favor of higher test scores . Although an increase in communication with law enforcement was evident in the Platte Canyon High School shooting , Del Elliot of the University of Colorado noted that " [ the vast majority of school districts ] are so totally absorbed with <unk> and academic requirements that they aren 't spending a lot of time and resources on this issue " . 
 By October 11 , investigators had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 pieces of evidence related to the case . They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania , which had occurred five days after the shooting in Bailey . As a result of the September 27 incident , Platte Canyon High School increased its security , leaving only one school entrance unlocked . It plans to install more security cameras . Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day , but he stated that that particular suggestion was outside the current budget .

 Zachary Elias " Zach " Auguste ( born July 8 , 1993 ) is an American basketball player who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association . Born in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Auguste started playing high school basketball for Marlborough . In 2011 he moved to university preparatory New Hampton School , where he was nominated for the 2012 McDonald 's Game . After graduating from New Hampton , Auguste enrolled in the University of Notre Dame to play for the Fighting Irish . Spending his freshman and sophomore seasons mainly as a reserve player , Auguste rose to prominence during his junior season in 2014 – 15 , when the team won the ACC Tournament title and went to the NCAA Elite Eight . 
 = = High school career = = 
 Auguste played at Marlborough High School for three seasons , growing 3 inches in each of these seasons . As a junior in 2009 – 10 , Auguste averaged 22 points and received All @-@ Star accolades from the Mid @-@ Wachusett ( Central Massachusetts ) league and local newspapers the Telegram & Gazette and The MetroWest Daily News . He scored a total 631 points throughout his career at Marlborough . 
 He moved to university preparatory New Hampton School after that season , reclassifying to the class of 2012 . He cited his desire to get academically and physically ready for college as the main factors behind that decision . After adapting to the higher competition level , he improved dramatically in time , putting on 28 pounds and developing his post game to transition from a perimeter player to a forward . He finished with an average of 15 points and 8 rebounds for his senior season . Nominated for the 2012 McDonald 's All @-@ American Boys Game , he didn 't make the final selection . 
 Soon after joining New Hampton , he was noticed by Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) conference Notre Dame 's assistant coach Anthony Solomon , however he later cut the school from his selection list , which included Division I schools West Virginia , Georgia Tech , Florida and Marquette . Despite this , Solomon 's steadfast attempts to recruit the player , widely ranked a 4 @-@ star recruit , convinced Auguste to visit the campus ; he committed to Notre Dame on the spot in September 2011 . 
 = = College career = = 
 He made his debut for Notre Dame in a November 12 , 2012 victory against Monmouth , contributing 4 points and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes . After two ankle sprains during pre @-@ season practice , Auguste had difficulty breaking into the already established team . Finding himself behind Jack Cooley and Garrick Sherman in the rotation , he averaged 10 @.@ 7 minutes per game in 25 games . Notable were games against Kennesaw State ( 12 points and 7 rebounds in 12 minutes ) and Marquette ( a season @-@ high 15 points with 5 rebounds and 3 steals in 21 minutes ) , for a freshman season average of 3 @.@ 7 points and 2 @.@ 7 rebounds . 
 For the 2013 – 14 season , Auguste was expected to play a larger role after Cooley graduated and coach Mike Brey cited him as a major player . Though he did start 13 games out of 30 , he stayed third choice with Sherman and Tom Knight preferred . He recorded his first college double @-@ double against Clemson having 14 points and 12 rebounds , followed by no @-@ shows . He finished his sophomore season with 6 @.@ 7 points and 4 @.@ 3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average . 
 <unk> as a starter during the preseason , Auguste , as one of the team 's few post options , established himself as a starter during his junior season with good performances early in the season , albeit against weaker opposition . A memorable December 13 , 2014 game against Florida State , in which he scored a career @-@ high 26 points , started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward , with Auguste quickly recouping from his bad performances . In January 2015 , Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues , with the length of the suspension undisclosed . It would ultimately only last three days , with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player . Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish 's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 rebounds in the final against North Carolina ( for an average of more than 11 points and 9 rebounds in the whole tournament ) . 
 In the Round of 64 of the following 2015 NCAA Tournament , Auguste scored 25 points against Northeastern , including two under @-@ pressure free @-@ throws in the final minute of a 69 @-@ 65 close @-@ fought win . In the next round tie against Butler , he committed a double dribble that conceded possession with two seconds left on the clock in a tied 55 @-@ 55 game . Butler did not score , and in overtime Auguste blocked a shot before grabbing a rebound - a team @-@ leading 13th - as Notre Dame won to reach the Sweet 16 . A comfortable win over Wichita State followed ( 15 points , 6 rebounds and 1 block for Auguste in 26 minutes ) and Notre Dame qualified to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1979 . Auguste , described as " Notre Dame 's only true post player " , was predicted to play an important role in the game against undefeated Kentucky , who - in Karl @-@ Anthony Towns and Willie Cauley @-@ Stein - had some of the biggest forwards of the tournament . He had 20 points and nine rebounds in the game , while mostly defended by Towns . In defense against the same player , he could not stop him from scoring 25 points in a to @-@ the @-@ wire 66 @-@ 68 loss to the favorites . Auguste finished the tournament with 16 @.@ 8 points and 8 @.@ 3 rebounds per game , with 12 @.@ 9 points and 6 @.@ 5 rebounds in around 24 minutes for the whole 2014 @-@ 15 season .

 = Sejm of Congress Poland = 
 The Sejm of Congress Poland ( Polish : Sejm <unk> Polskiego ) was the parliament in the 19th century Kingdom of Poland , colloquially known as Congress Poland . It existed from 1815 to 1831 . In the history of the Polish parliament , it succeeded the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw . 
 = = History = = 
 After the Congress of Vienna , a small Kingdom of Poland , known as Congress Poland , was recreated , with its king being the Tsar of Russia , Alexander I. Alexander I , an enlightened autocrat , decided to use Congress Poland as an experiment to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system , and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy . At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia ; in the end it proved to be a failure . 
 Tsar Alexander left the administration to his younger brother , Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia , to serve as viceroy . Constantine , with the help of Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev , " Russified " Congress Poland and oversaw secret police investigations of student groups in contravention of the Constitution . Alexander visited the Sejm in 1820 and received such condemnation from the deputies ( members of the Sejm 's lower house ) that he reversed his stance of the Sejm as a liberalization experiment although he was still bound by the Congress of Vienna not to liquidate Russia 's partition of Poland entirely . By 1825 , Alexander I was sufficiently dissatisfied with the Sejm that he decided to bar some of the most vocal opposition deputies from it . 
 Although the Sejm was supposed to meet every 2 years , only four sessions were called by the Tsar as it became the scene of increased clashes between liberal deputies and conservative government officials . With regards to the years the Sejm met , Bardach gives the dates of 1818 , 1820 , 1823 and 1830 ; Jędruch offers a similar list , however lists 1825 instead of 1823 . 
 Nicholas , an opponent of Alexander 's liberalization efforts , acceded the throne as Tsar Nicholas I upon Alexander 's death in December of 1825 . <unk> Russian military officers resisted Nicholas 's takeover in the Decembrist revolt . Some Polish liberals were accused of being connected to the Decembrist plot and were brought before the Sejm for trial in 1828 . Despite heavy political pressure from Moscow , the Sejm Tribunal only found them guilty of belonging to the National Patriotic Society formed by Walerian <unk> ( a misdemeanor ) rather than treason . The decision was met with cheers in Poland but infuriated Tsar Nicholas . 
 In the 1830 session , the Sejm refused to allocate funding for a statue in Warsaw to honor Tsar Alexander , further incensing Moscow . The Tsar 's tightening grip on Poland ran counter to the growing romantic nationalism sweeping Poland 's youth , especially in the universities . These factors led to increasing discontent within Poland culminating in the failed November Uprising in 1830 . An extraordinary Sejm was convened on 18 December 1830 . Despite the danger this failed attempt to assassinate the Grand Duke represented , the Sejm was swept by nationalist fervor and supported the insurgents , thereby appointing a new revolutionary government led by General Józef <unk> . On 25 January 1831 , it passed an act introduced by Roman Sołtyk dethroning Tsar Nicholas I and declaring full independence from Russia . Senator Wincenty Krasiński , one of the few votes against the National Patriotic Society members , refused to join the revolt . The overthrow of Russian rule was planned badly and as the fortunes of war turned against the insurgents , the last session of the Sejm @-@ in @-@ exile was held in Płock in September that year . After the uprising was crushed , in an act of vengeance the Tsar not only eliminated the parliamentary institution of the Sejm from the new government of Congress Poland , but ordered the demolition of the Chamber of Deputies in the Castle of Warsaw . Member of the Sejm and noted historian Joachim Lelewel , as well as fellow deputy Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and countless others , fled the Russian crackdown in what would be termed the " Great Emigration . " 
 = = Composition and duration = = 
 The Sejm was composed of the king , the upper house ( Senate ) and the lower house ( Chamber of Deputies or Sejm proper ) . There were 128 members ( called deputies ) , including 77 deputies elected by the nobility ( szlachta ) at local sejmiks , and 51 elected by the non @-@ noble classes . They were chosen for 6 years , with one third of them chosen every 2 years . Sejms were called every 2 years for a period of 30 days , with provisions for extraordinary sessions in time of special need . The king could also dissolve the Sejm before the 30 days elapsed . During the Uprising , on 19 February , 1831 , a new law declared the Sejm in constant session . The Marshal of the Sejm was appointed by the king . Candidates for all offices had to meet specific wealth requirements . 
 Suffrage was offered to property owners , lease holders , and teachers . Jews were forbidden from voting . Military personnel had no right to vote . Overall , about 100 @,@ 000 people in the Congress Poland population of 2 @.@ 7 million had the right to vote , which made them one of the most enfranchised populations in early 19th @-@ century Europe . 
 Candidates for Deputy had to be literate males over the age of 30 . The deputies had legal immunity , although that did not prevent two liberal deputies , brothers Bonawentura and Wincenty <unk> , from being placed under temporary house arrest to prevent them from joining the Sejm in 1825 . 
 The Senate had 64 members , including 9 bishops , 18 voivodes and 37 castellans . Candidates for the Senate members ( senators ) were appointed by the king for a lifetime from a list prepared by a Senate , and had to be at least 35 years old . 
 = = Competences = = 
 While the Constitution of Congress Poland was relatively liberal in theory , and gave the Sejm significant powers ( wider than those of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw ) , in practice those competences were limited , as they were often not respected by the tsar . Jews and peasants lost rights they had previously enjoyed under the Duchy of Warsaw . 
 The Sejm had the right to vote on civil , administrative and legal issues ; a simple majority was required to pass laws . With permission from the king , it could vote on matters related to the fiscal system and the military . It had the right to control government officials , and could prepare reviews and reports on them to present to the king . It had legislative competences in court and administrative law . It could issue laws on currency , taxation and budget , deal with issues related to military conscription ( such as its size ) , and amend the constitution . It had no legislative initiative , as that belong only to the king ; however , the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with proposed legislation . 
 The Senate , rather than the judiciary , acted as the tribunal , and could sit in judgement over government officials impeached by the Sejm . The Sejm Tribunal also had competences in cases of crimes against the state . After the Sejm Tribunal 's 1828 acquittal of the National Patriotic Society members , Tsar Nicholas reversed the tribunal 's verdict and permanently removed the Sejm 's competency to hear other such cases . 
 = 10th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam = 
 The 10th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam ( Vietnamese : Đại hội <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> X ) was held in Ba Đình Hall , Hanoi from 18 to 25 April 2006 . The congress occurs every five years . 1 @,@ 176 delegates represented the party 's 3 million members . At the 13th plenum of the Central Committee , held before the congress , it was decided that eight members of the Communist Party 's 9th Politburo had to retire . While certain segments within and outside the Politburo were skeptical , the decision was implemented . Because of party rules , the congress was not empowered to elect the general secretary , and it held a survey on whom the delegates wanted to be appointed General Secretary . The first plenum of the Central Committee , held in the immediate aftermath of the congress , re @-@ elected Nông Đức Mạnh as general secretary . 
 The congress is noteworthy because of the extent of democratization which took place within the party . The role of the Central Committee in decision @-@ making was strengthened , and the role of the Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened . Inner @-@ party accountability was strengthened . The Eighth Five @-@ Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress , renewed its Marxist – Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist @-@ oriented market economy . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Preparations for the 10th Congress were led by the Personnel Appointments subcommittee of the 9th Central Committee , probably chaired by General Secretary Nông Đức Mạnh . Mạnh worked closely with the Head of the Commission for Organization and Personnel to prepare a list of nominees for the election of the Central Committee at the upcoming congress . The 12th plenum of the 9th Central Committee , held in July 2005 , laid down the principles for the Personnel Appointments subcommittee to work within : 
 ( i ) quality of candidates in terms of qualifications and a " clean " CV 
 ( ii ) reasonable distribution of candidates among different sectors and representations from among the population to ensure total Party leadership in all areas . 
 After the 12th plenum , the Personnel Appointments subcommittee began discussions with important organizations and individuals within the Party , most notably with the Central Commission for Inspection ( which investigates complaints against Party members ) , party elders Đỗ Mười , Lê Đức Anh , Võ Văn Kiệt , Võ Nguyên Giáp and Nguyễn Đức Tâm , and with the 9th Politburo . The nomination list created in these discussions had to be voted on by the 9th Central Committee . At its 13th plenum , the 9th Central Committee , several changes to the nomination list recommended by Personnel Appointments subcommittee were made ; the Central Committee decided to retire 8 out of 14 Politburo members , the largest number of en masse retirements in the history of the Politburo . However , in official pronouncements , this decision was referred to as a " survey " , and not an election . Even so , the majority believed the eight people mentioned would retire rather than stay for another term . The retirements of Chairman of the National Assembly Nguyễn Văn An , who was considered a strong contender for the general secretaryship at the 11th Congress , and two leading proteges of Mạnh ; the unofficial deputy general secretary Phan Diễn , and the Head of the Commission for Organization and Personnel Trần Đình Hoan , were unexpected . 
 Some party elders were seeking the removal of Mạnh as general secretary . While Đỗ Mười and Lê Đức Anh supported Mạnh 's re @-@ election , Võ Văn Kiệt and Võ Nguyên Giáp opposed him . However , all four of them agreed on retaining Nguyễn Văn An in the 10th Politburo . One point in Mạnh 's favour was his lack of grave mistakes during his first tenure , and the lack of a credible opponent . Võ Văn Kiệt supported Nguyễn Minh Triết 's candidacy for the general secretaryship , while the retiring prime minister Phan Văn Khải supported a possible candidacy by Nguyễn Văn An , even if the Central Committee had voted for his Politburo retirement in the " survey " . Those who supported Mạnh 's removal based their campaign on the fact that his son @-@ in @-@ law had worked at PMU 18 Department of the Ministry of Transport during the PMU 18 scandal . A more damaging rumour was that Mạnh had included Nguyễn Việt Tiến , the Deputy Minister of Transport who was implicated in the scandal , on the Central Committee nominee <unk> , Dao <unk> Đình Bình , the Minister of Transport , was a close associate of Mạnh . Mạnh was accused of nepotism and of establishing a patronage system for himself within the party and state ; his son Nông Quốc <unk> was elected as Head of Youth Organizations in March 2005 , and was thus entitled to attend the 10th Congress . At a meeting with some veteran politicians , Mạnh was asked by Lê Khả Phiêu and Võ Nguyên Giáp to resign from his post and not to run for a seat in the 10th Central Committee – Mạnh , however , refused to resign . 
 In a proposal to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee , Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary , the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection , and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress . He called for the reduction of the Central Committee from one @-@ fourth to one @-@ third , holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly in the immediate aftermath of a congress ( and not a year later ) , secret ballots for elections , empowering delegates to self @-@ nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one . These suggestions , with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier , were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005 . 
 At the 14th plenum of the 9th Central Committee , the Politburo proposed that Mạnh would be appointed president and resign from his post as general secretary to be succeeded by Nguyễn Văn An , while Phan Diễn would be retained for the sake of stability . The proposal was rejected in a formal vote by the 9th plenum , and the Central Committee upheld the results of the " survey " . At the unplanned 15th plenum held 14 – 16 April , which was held due to pressure by Nguyễn Minh Triết , Nguyễn Văn An and Phan Văn Khải , it was decided that delegates at the upcoming congress had the right of self @-@ nomination and that there would competing elections for the posts of general secretary , prime minister and chairman of the National Assembly . The loser of the contest for general secretary would be appointed president . Mạnh and Nguyễn Minh Triết were candidates for the general secretaryship , Nguyễn Tấn Dũng and Nguyễn Sinh Hùng for the prime ministership and Nguyễn Phú Trọng and Trương Tấn Sang for the National Assembly chairmanship . For the first time in the party 's history , competing elections were held for offices of power .

 The elected 10th Central Committee comprised 81 ( 52 @.@ 5 percent ) members from the 9th Central Committee , and 79 ( 47 @.@ 5 percent ) new members were elected . The candidate with the highest vote received 97 @.@ 88 percent , while the candidate with the lowest vote received 63 @.@ 41 percent . All the provinces , with the exception of Đắk Nông Province , elected officials to the 10th Central Committee . A number of surprises occurred during the election process ; six ministers were not re @-@ elected . Another surprise was that no officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were elected as full members . However , Phạm Bình Minh , the Director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , was elected as an alternate member . None of the 34 self @-@ nominated candidates at the congress were elected to the 10th Central Committee . It is unknown whether any of the self @-@ nominees for alternate membership in the 10th Central Committee were elected . There was an increase in Central Committee officials working in the central government , the provinces , military and defence officials , public security officials and officials from mass organizations , but there was a decrease in officials from the sectors of information , social and cultural affairs , economics , business and financial affairs , and others . 
 As the meeting progressed , some delegates publicly demanded that the congress should be given the authority to elect the general secretary and the head of the Central Commission for Inspection . This was approved and a survey form which listed four possible candidates ; Mạnh , Nguyễn Minh Triết , Nguyễn Văn An and Nguyễn Phú Trọng was created . Nguyễn Văn An withdrew his candidacy , knowing he would not be elected to the 10th Politburo because he was not elected to the 10th Central Committee . However , because of party rules which stated that the Central Committee after the congress elected the general secretary , the vote at the congress was considered a survey . Another version of the proceedings , that given by Mạnh at the press conference after the congress , was that the 1 @,@ 176 congress delegates were given a list of the elected members of the 10th Central Committee , and were given a free choice of electing any of them to the general secretaryship . After the congress , on 25 April , the 1st plenum of the Central Committee convened to elect the general secretary . The two leading candidates at the congress survey , Mạnh and Nguyễn Minh Triết , stood for election at the plenum . Mạnh was elected and Nguyễn Minh Triết was appointed state president . However , rumours that Mạnh won narrowly over his rival , and that Nguyễn Minh Triết withdrew his candidature following the party tradition of appointing the general secretary , circulated after the congress . 
 The 10th Politburo comprised 14 members . As was decided at the first plenum , the ranking given to Politburo members was to be decided by the number of approval votes the official earned during the election . Lê Hồng Anh , the Minister of Public Security , was ranked second in the Politburo because he received the second @-@ most approval votes for his candidacy . Of the 14 members of the Politburo , five were concurrently members of the 10th Secretariat . The Secretariat comprised eight members , amongst whom the highest rank was general secretary . 
 = = Policy enactments = = 
 The official Congress communique set 2020 as a date on which Vietnam would reach the status of a modern , industrial society . To reach this goal , the targeted growth for gross domestic product ( GDP ) was set at 7 @.@ 5 – 8 percent for 2006 – 2011 . The congress promised to renew the socialist @-@ oriented market economy , and step up its fight against political corruption . The communique emphasized the party 's goal of a future society without exploitation , based on the ideology of Marxism – Leninism . The Political Report , the Eighth Five @-@ Year Plan ( 2006 – 2010 ) – officially titled the Five Year Socio @-@ economic Development Plan , the report on Party building and the amendment and revision to the Party 's charter , were approved . Mạnh said that the approval of these documents were " the results of the intellect and the will of our entire Party and people , the in @-@ depth practical and theoretical summation of 20 years of Renovation [ Đổi Mới ] and the improvement and development of the policy and philosophy of renovations in the current period of our country 's revolution . " 
 The Eighth Five @-@ Year Plan is subordinate to the Ten Year Socio @-@ economic Development Strategy ( 2001 – 2010 ) which aims to continue comprehensive reform and achieve fast , sustainable growth rates . The main goal of the Ten Year Plan is to lift Vietnam out of the category of underdeveloped countries and to reach the status of a modern @-@ industrial nation by 2012 . The Eighth Five @-@ Year Plan , while approved by the Congress , had to earn the approval of the National Assembly before being implemented . 
 The delegates approved the general secretary 's Political Report , Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio @-@ Economic Development for the 2006 – 10 Period , and the Report on Party building and amendments made to the party statute . These reports ' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist @-@ oriented market economy . The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership . This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man . While the amendment was approved , the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state @-@ owned enterprises which have been privatized . 
 = = Democratization = = 
 An important characteristic of the 10th Congress was the internal democratization of the party leadership , most notably seen in the Politburo 's willingness to follow the " survey " voted by the 13th plenum of the Central Committee . The top five members of the " survey " were rewarded with the five highest government positions in Vietnam . While the leadership selection process was not dramatically altered , the Central Committee as a collective unit was strengthened , and the Central Committee acquired control over personnel appointments and policy @-@ making . In effect , these changes have reduced the roles of powerful individuals , who may be seen as taking too much control .

 = Tropical Storm Hermine ( 1998 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Hermine was the eighth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season . Hermine developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 5 . The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean , and on entering the northwest Caribbean interacted with other weather systems . The resultant system was declared a tropical depression on September 17 in the central Gulf of Mexico . The storm meandered north slowly , and after being upgraded to a tropical storm made landfall on Louisiana , where it quickly deteriorated into a tropical depression again on September 20 . 
 Before the storm 's arrival , residents of Grand Isle , Louisiana , were evacuated . As a weak tropical storm , damages from Hermine were light . Rainfall spread from Louisiana through Georgia , causing isolated flash flooding . In some areas , the storm tide prolonged the coastal flooding from a tropical cyclone . Gusty winds were reported . Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles , and inflicted one injury . While Hermine was not of itself a particularly damaging storm , its effects combined with those of other tropical cyclones , and resulted in agricultural damage .

The wave was not associated with any thunderstorm activity until it reached the Windward Islands , when cloud and shower activity began to increase . Continuing westward , the disturbance approached the South American coastline and turned into the northwest Caribbean . The wave interacted with an upper @-@ level low @-@ pressure system and another tropical wave that entered the region . At the time , a large monsoon @-@ type flow prevailed over Central America , part of the Caribbean Sea , and the Gulf of Mexico . An area of low pressure developed over the northwestern Caribbean , and at about 1200 UTC on September 17 , the system was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression in the central Gulf of Mexico . 
 Initially , the cloud pattern associated with the system featured a tight and well @-@ defined circulation , as well as clusters of deep convection south of the center . Due to the proximity of a large upper @-@ level low @-@ pressure area in the southern Gulf of Mexico , the surrounding environment did not favor intensification . Influenced by the low , the depression moved southward . The system completed a cyclonic loop in the central gulf , and by early on September 18 was drifting northward . As a result of wind shear , the center of circulation was separated from the deep convective activity . Early the next day , deep convection persisted in a small area northeast of the center . Forward motion was nearly stationary , with a gradual drift east @-@ southeastward . Despite the wind shear , the depression attained tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on September 19 ; as such , it was named Hermine by the National Hurricane Center . 
 Shortly after being upgraded to a tropical storm , Hermine reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . The tropical storm @-@ force winds were confined to the eastern semicircle of the cyclone . Hermine tracked northward and approached the coast , where it nearly stalled . A continually weakening storm , it moved ashore near Cocodrie , Louisiana at 0500 UTC on September 20 with winds of 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) , and then deteriorated into a tropical depression . On its landfall , associated rain bands were deemed " not very impressive " , although there was a rapid increase in thunderstorm activity east of the center . The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in parts of southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi . The storm progressively weakened as the circulation moved northeastward , and dissipated at 1800 UTC . Initially , it was believed that Hermine 's remnants contributed to the development of Hurricane Karl ; however , this belief was not confirmed .

 On September 17 , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from Sargent , Texas to Grand Isle , Louisiana . The following day , the watch was extended southward from Sargent to Matagorda , Texas , and eastward to Pascagoula , Mississippi . A tropical storm warning was posted from Morgan City , Louisiana , eastward to Pensacola , Florida on September 19 . The warning was promptly extended westward from Morgan City to Intracoastal City , Louisiana , and by 1200 UTC on September 20 all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued . As the storm moved inland , flood advisories were issued for southern Mississippi . On Grand Isle , a mandatory evacuation order was declared for the third time in three weeks , and residents in low @-@ lying areas of Lafourche Parish were ordered to leave . Shelters were opened , but few people used them . Only fifteen people entered the American Red Cross shelter in Larose , Louisiana , which had been designed to hold 500 . Workers were evacuated from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , and energy futures rose substantially in anticipation of the storm , though when Hermine failed to cause significant damage , they retreated . The Coast Guard evacuated its Grand Isle station in preparation . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In southern Florida , the combination of rainbands from Hermine and a separate upper @-@ level cyclone in its vicinity produced up to 14 @.@ 14 inches ( 359 mm ) of rainfall . Hermine 's remnants spread showers and thunderstorms across northern parts of the state . The heavy rainfall downed a tree Orlando , and led to several traffic accidents . A man died on U.S. Route 441 after losing control of his vehicle . 
 Upon landfall in Louisiana , winds were primarily of minimal tropical storm @-@ force and confined to squalls . Offshore , a wind gust of 46 miles per hour ( 74 km / h ) was reported near the mouth of the Mississippi River , and near New Orleans , wind gusts peaked at 32 miles per hour ( 51 km / h ) . Along the coast , storm tides generally ran 1 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal , which prolonged coastal flooding in some areas from previous Tropical Storm Frances . Winds on Grand Isle reached 25 miles per hour ( 40 km / h ) , and storm tides on the island averaged 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . Hermine brought 3 to 4 inches ( 76 to 102 mm ) of rainfall to the state , triggering isolated flash flooding . Near Thomas , part of Louisiana Highway 438 was submerged under flood waters . An oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico reported sustained winds of 48 miles per hour ( 77 km / h ) with gusts to 59 miles per hour ( 95 km / h ) . 
 At around 8 : 30 AM on September 20 , a man was presumed drowned in Lake <unk> , southwest of New Orleans . The man had been shrimping in the lake in choppy waters caused by the storm , and dove into the water without a life vest to untangle a net from his boat 's propeller . After he freed the propeller , the boat was carried away by the current in the lake , and he was last seen swimming after the boat . After the disappearance , the Coast Guard launched a search with rescue boats and search dogs but could not locate him . His body was eventually found on the morning of September 22 . Captain Pat <unk> , of the St. Charles Parish Sheriff 's Office , said that the storm " obviously ... played a part " in the man 's death , but Lieutenant Commander William Brewer of the United States Coast Guard told the press that he did not " think it was directly storm @-@ related . " 
 Hermine spawned two tornadoes in Mississippi . One destroyed two mobile homes , damaged seven cars , and resulted in one minor injury ; the other caused only minor damage . Rainfall of 4 to 5 inches ( 100 to 130 mm ) caused localized flooding ; in southern Walthall County , parts of Mississippi Highway 27 were under 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . Over 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rainfall was reported in Alabama , resulting in the flooding of apartments and several roads and the closure of several highways . Numerous cars were damaged , and motorists were stranded on Bibb County Route 24 . Floodwaters also covered U.S. Route 11 near Tuscaloosa , Alabama stranding several motorists and a milk truck . Flash flood warnings were issued in Bibb and Shelby counties as northern Alabama experienced its first rainfall in the month of September . The rainfall extended eastward into Georgia , where the rains led the state to lift a fire alert for three northern counties , South Carolina and North Carolina . The remnants of the storm dumped 10 @.@ 5 inches ( 27 cm ) of rain on Charleston , South Carolina and rainfall of up to one foot was reported in other parts of the state . The rain in Charleston led to over five feet of standing water in some neighborhoods , forcing several families to evacuate their mobile homes and stranding a number of vehicles . As a result , the local police closed several roads , including sections of Interstate 526 . 
 Overall , damage totaled $ 85 @,@ 000 ( 1998 USD ) ; the effects were described as minor . Although the effects from Hermine were small , counties in Louisiana and Texas were declared disaster areas due to damage associated with the earlier Tropical Storm Frances and the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness extended these funds to cover damages from Hermine as well .

 The heavy rains from Hermine combined with those from Frances caused major fish kills in southern Louisiana , the first since those caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . The rain from the two storms flooded the swamps in south Louisiana , where it rapidly lost oxygen due to decaying plant matter . After the swamps began to drain , the low @-@ oxygen water flowed into streams , canals , and bayous in the area , and testing in the days following the storm showed that the water was " almost devoid of oxygen . " Without sufficient oxygen , local fish population died quickly , filling waterways , particularly in the area of Lake Charles and Lafayette , according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . In total , the fish kills affected at least a dozen separate lakes and bayous in the state . 
 The combined effects of Hermine and other storms caused significant damage to Louisiana agriculture . The standing water after Hermine provided ideal hatching conditions for mosquitoes , who formed swarms large enough to kill livestock in the days after the storm . At least twelve bulls and horses were killed by mosquito bites in the next week , including bulls who drowned after wading into deep water to escape the insects . The rains and standing water from the storm also prevented farmers from drying out soybeans for harvest and ruined sugar cane . According to Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Bob Odom , the combined effects of Hurricane Earl , Tropical Storm Frances , and Tropical Storm Hermine caused $ 420 million in direct and indirect losses for Louisiana farmers . 
 = Bay Freeway ( Seattle ) = 
 The Bay Freeway , also referred to as the Mercer Street Connection , was a proposed elevated freeway in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle , Washington . The 0 @.@ 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) freeway would have run parallel to a section of Mercer Street between Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) and Aurora Avenue North at the Seattle Center . 
 Planning for the freeway began in 1954 , with the proposal for a freeway from Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway , later I @-@ 5 , via Broad and Mercer streets added to the city 's comprehensive plan in 1957 . Funded by a bond measure passed by Seattle voters in 1960 , plans were drawn for the newly renamed Bay Freeway to serve a multi @-@ purpose stadium at the Seattle Center via an elevated structure . Citizen groups voiced their opposition to the project at public hearings in 1967 , forcing the Seattle Engineering Department to consider other designs . After determining that a cut @-@ and @-@ cover tunnel would not be feasible , a second series of public hearings to discuss the impact of an elevated option were held in 1970 , leading to widespread controversy and a civil suit launched in opposition to the freeway . The lawsuit ended in November 1971 , with a King County Superior Court judge ruling that a major deviation from the voter @-@ approved 1960 plan occurred , forcing a referendum to be held on whether to continue the project . On February 8 , 1972 , the Bay Freeway project was rejected by a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ vote margin in a municipal referendum , alongside the repeal of the R.H. Thomson Expressway . Mercer Street would later undergo several projects that attempted to provide congestion relief promised by the rejected freeway , culminating in the Mercer Corridor Project in 2012 , which widened the street into a boulevard .

 The 0 @.@ 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) Bay Freeway , as proposed in 1972 , would have been a six @-@ lane elevated freeway on a curved box @-@ beam bridge , measuring 180 feet ( 55 m ) at its widest point . The freeway would have begun at the Seattle Center in Lower Queen Anne , as through lanes for Broad Street under Aurora Avenue North . The roadway would have immediately merged with ramps connecting to the Roy and Mercer couplet and to a parking garage for a multipurpose domed stadium , later relocated and built south of Downtown in 1976 , to form the Bay Freeway . The lanes then would have then turned southeastward next to a park on Lake Union , passing only 16 feet ( 5 m ) over Westlake Avenue North and 25 feet ( 8 m ) over Fairview Avenue North , before splitting into ramps at an interchange with I @-@ 5 . Valley Street , located 175 feet ( 53 m ) north of the planned right @-@ of @-@ way , was to be moved under the Bay Freeway structure and replaced with additional park space . 
 Earlier plans called for an extension traveling southwest on Broad Street through Belltown , including a tunnel between 5th Avenue and Denny Way , to the proposed Northwest Expressway and an extension of the existing Alaskan Way Viaduct on the Elliott Bay waterfront . The extension was deferred in 1969 , but remained a " possible future plan " until the entire project was canceled .

 The City of Seattle began planning for the Bay Freeway in 1954 , with planning studies determining that Broad and Mercer streets should become the northern east – west link of the proposed Downtown freeway system . The Seattle City Council adopted the city 's comprehensive plan in 1957 , proposing a " major highway " in the vicinity of Broad and Mercer streets from the Northwest Expressway along Elliott Bay to the Central Freeway at the foot of Capitol Hill . In anticipation of the Bay Freeway , underpasses of Aurora Avenue North on Broad and Mercer streets were completed in July 1958 , using funds from a 1954 bond issue for the construction of arterial roadways . A special municipal election concerning a $ 26 @.@ 6 million bond measure for traffic improvement was held on March 8 , 1960 , passed by 71 @,@ 000 of 109 @,@ 000 voters in King County . The funds , matched by $ 31 million from the State of Washington and federal government , were distributed to 12 projects from the Comprehensive Plan of 1957 , including $ 1 @.@ 9 million for the " Mercer Street Connection " between Aurora Avenue and the Central Freeway . 
 The Century 21 Exposition was hosted at the Seattle Center grounds from April to October 1962 , generating heavy traffic equivalent to rush hour loads on Mercer Street , where a city @-@ owned , 1 @,@ 500 @-@ stall parking garage was located . The use of Mercer Street as one of the primary routes to the fairgrounds and its selection as one of the sites for a proposed multi @-@ purpose stadium convinced city officials that the construction of the Bay Freeway was a necessity . The Mercer exit on I @-@ 5 was partially opened in November 1963 , with the northbound ramps open to traffic and the southbound ramps remaining closed until 1968 . A design team led by Perry Johanson was formed in 1966 for the Bay Freeway project , intending to blend the freeway with its surroundings and encourage mixed @-@ use development to lower its impact on the South Lake Union neighborhood . The first public hearing on the project was held by the Seattle City Council on February 17 , 1967 , where City Engineer Roy Morse said that the " Mercer mess " would be solved with the opening of the Bay Freeway in 1969 . The three proposed elevated alternatives were criticized by the public and local architects Ibsen Nelsen and Victor <unk> for blocking views of Lake Union , forcing Morse to reconsider subsurface designs despite his declaration that " a depressed roadway with the freeway would require excessively steep traffic grades " .

 The project was officially designated the " Bay Freeway " by the Seattle City Council on April 12 , 1967 , as part of an ordinance that also renamed part of State Route 99 to the Alaskan Freeway and officially named the proposed R.H. Thomson Expressway as the Thomson Freeway . During the second public hearing , held on June 23 , the city council endorsed the $ 5 million elevated option for the Bay Freeway amid appeals from local architects and the Citizens Planning Council . Among the 16 proposals considered , a cut and cover tunnel was rejected because of its $ 16 million cost , steep grades and larger disruption of local businesses and railroads . The Seattle Center was selected as the preferred site of the multi @-@ purpose domed stadium in 1968 , assuming that the Bay Freeway was built to prevent event congestion , forcing the project to be redesigned for the next two years . 
 The design report for the Bay Freeway project was published on February 10 , 1970 , and was subsequently distributed to the project . The report featured a new design for the freeway , including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center . Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970 , as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts similar to those in other American cities . During the April hearing , former State Department of Highways director Charles <unk> spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I @-@ 5 during rush hour . Voters rejected a Forward Thrust initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19 , removing one of the main reasons to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal . The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2 @,@ 610 drivers during rush hour . 
 The city council approved the $ 28 million Bay Freeway proposal , to be matched by an additional $ 28 million from the federal government , by a 5 – 3 vote on December 21 , 1970 . Right of way acquisition began the following March , with $ 6 million appropriated to purchase and condemn properties on seven blocks between Mercer and Valley streets .
