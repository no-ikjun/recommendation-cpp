 Lindsay Planer writes that two covers of the song " worth noting " are a version by Bob Koenig , issued on his Prose & Icons album in 1996 , and one by Brazilian singer Marisa Monte from the same year . Monte 's version appeared on her album <unk> Bom , later released in English @-@ speaking countries as A Great Noise . In 1998 , " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " was one of five Harrison songs that composers Steve Wood and Daniel May adapted for their soundtrack to the documentary film Everest ; part of the piece " The Journey Begins " incorporates " Give Me Love " . 
 Artists other than Harrison who have performed the song live include Elliott Smith and , in April 2002 , Sting , James Taylor and Elton John . These three musicians played " Give Me Love " as part of a tribute to Harrison during the Rock for the Rainforest benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City . In what Planer describes as a " stirring reading " , Jeff Lynne performed the song at the Concert for George on 29 November 2002 , held at the Royal Albert Hall exactly a year after Harrison 's death . Lynne was supported by a band comprising Harrison 's friends and musical associates , including Clapton , Fairweather @-@ Low , Marc Mann , Keltner , Dhani Harrison , Niles and <unk> . 
 Dave Davies of the Kinks contributed a version of " Give Me Love " to the multi @-@ artist compilation Songs from the Material World : A Tribute to George Harrison in 2003 . In a statement released in advance of the compilation , Davies explained that he was normally reluctant to perform other artists ' songs yet had made " an exception " with " Give Me Love " , in order to honour Harrison " as a great musical talent but primarily as an advanced soul who was unafraid to share his spiritual vision and journey with us " . Davies subsequently issued the recording on his 2006 album <unk> . 
 In 2010 , Broadway actress <unk> Rene Scott featured " Give Me Love " in her autobiographical musical Everyday Rapture as the show 's final number . Canadian singer Ron Sexsmith has included the song in his live performances ; a version by him appeared on Harrison Covered , a tribute CD accompanying the November 2011 issue of Mojo magazine .

 Ann Rivers ( born 1968 ) is an American politician , who has served as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate since she was appointed to represent the 18th district in 2011 , upon the resignation of Joe <unk> . Prior to this she was a member of the Washington House of Representatives . In her first full term , a Majority Coalition Caucus was formed , taking control away from the Democrats in the state senate . Rivers was appointed to be majority whip for the session , a rare appointment for a freshman senator . She won re @-@ election for another four @-@ year term in 2012 , with 67 % of the vote against 32 % for her opponent , Ralph Schmidt . 
 Prior to her holding elected office , Rivers led AMR Consulting , a political consulting firm which aided candidates in their elections for offices , as well as providing political consultation to corporate clients . In 2007 , she was on the short list for candidates to be chosen to replace Richard Curtis in the state house , but Jaime Herrera Beutler was chosen instead . Later , Rivers succeeded Herrera Beutler in the house after the latter 's election to the United States Congress . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Rivers was born in 1968 in Michigan . She earned a bachelor 's degree in political science from Central Michigan University . After graduating in 1990 , Rivers worked as a 6th grade teacher . In 2002 , she returned to school and graduated from Lewis and Clark College with a secondary teaching certificate . 
 Though she didn 't run for office herself until much later , she helped Bill Williams in his election to the Alaska legislature in 1992 , and became his chief of staff . During that election , she founded AMR Consulting , a public relations and government affairs consulting firm , which helped in many political campaigns and provided political consultation for corporations . When Representative Richard Curtis resigned from state house in 2007 , Rivers was considered by the Clark County and Lewis County commissions to be a replacement but Jaime Herrera Beutler was chosen instead .

 Rivers was elected to the Washington House of Representatives in 2010 succeeding Herrera Beutler after Beutler 's election to the United States Congress . As a state representative , Rivers was the assistant whip for the House Republican Caucus . She also served on the House 's Business and Financial Services Committee , Judiciary Committee , Transportation Committee and Rules Committee . Her website listed communication as being vital as a state representative . 
 In January 2011 , Rivers was selected to deliver the Republican response to governor Christine Gregoire 's State of the State address . In the address , she listed economic recovery and employment as well as compromise with Gregoire as being the top priorities of her party . 
 In February , Rivers submitted a bill to provide more funding for food banks and other charitable causes . The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor . It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income , allowing for it to be tax @-@ free . The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed to make it to the Senate floor .

 Rivers has spoken strongly about the Columbia River Crossing I @-@ 5 bridge replacement , saying that she disagreed with most everything about the current plan , and that it does not do enough to solve the problem . Willamette Week of Portland labeled Rivers " The CRC killer " for her leadership role in the opposition to the proposed megaproject . Due to their opposition to the project , in July 2013 , Governor Jay Inslee labeled both Rivers and Senator Don Benton from the neighboring 17th district " a brick wall to economic progress and CRC . " Speaking to a group of CRC supports , " The road to this bridge runs through two senators from this region . Those two senators have stymied any progress on this bridge project . … Until that changes , there ’ s not a lot I or you can do about that . " 
 In early 2012 , Rivers was selected for the Council of State Governments for the Western Legislative Academy . Out of 93 applicants , 39 , including Rivers , were chosen . The academy is a training institute for lawmakers in their first four years of service . 
 In November 2012 , shortly after entering office , Rivers was appointed to the Republican leadership as the minority whip . When the Majority Coalition Caucus was formed , taking control of the Senate away from the Democrats , Rivers was promoted to majority whip . It is rare for a freshman senator to be appointed to party leadership . 
 Rivers introduced a bill in February 2013 to exempt nonprofit shooting clubs from paying sales and use taxes when they buy clay pigeons . The bill is cosponsored by Senators Don Benton and Pam Roach . Earlier in February , Rivers also introduced legislation attempting to lower restrictions on initiatives in Washington State , commenting , " If the people take the time to sign their name and say this is something we need to have a look at , we ought to respect that . " Along with cosponsors Roach and Benton , Tim Eyman also is <unk> the legislation . In March 2013 , Rivers reprimanded senate Democrats for taking advantage of <unk> Holmquist <unk> 's departure from the senate floor to feed her newborn son , leaving the Democrats in temporary control of the senate floor . Immediately after she left , Democrat David <unk> attempted to pass a bill through the floor . Senator Rivers commented , " I was ashamed that in this day and age they thought they could do that , driving a wedge between a mother and her baby like that . " Commenting on Democrats ' claim to be the party of women and minorities , Rivers said , " Their actions speak so loud that I can 't hear what they are saying . " As part of her duties , Rivers has also hosted high @-@ school aged pages for the Washington State Senate Page Program . 
 Rivers introduced legislation to increase taxes on medical marijuana . Washington is one of only a few states that has legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use . Recreational marijuana has a 25 % tax for consumers . However , medical marijuana does not have any taxes . Rivers ' legislation would also force medical marijuana clinics to obtain more permits and waivers . 
 In June 2013 , fellow state senator Don Benton filed a complaint against Rivers , claiming she had broken a senate floor rule by swearing at him during a floor discussion . Benton also claimed that Rivers had screamed at him on one other occasion , during a Republican caucus . He claimed that he had felt physically threatened , saying , " It was a very uncomfortable feeling . I have been on the receiving end of many heated comments over the years , but I have never before felt the threat of physical violence . " Rivers responded with an apology ; he took issue with some of the wording in the apology and he filed the complaint . Many have come out in support of Rivers , who claims that Benton was harassing her , adding she will , " stand my ground against anyone who attempts to bully , intimidate or threaten me . " Some have labeled Benton a hypocrite , as he recently lifted sanctions against Pam Roach , who had been seen screaming on the floor and had mistreated staff . In a January 2014 decision , officials in the Washington State Legislature have decided both Senators were at fault for the spat . They determined that Benton had harassed Rivers , which provoked her . On the decision , Rivers stated , " I have to conclude that he was trying to bait me into this reaction , which unfortunately he did . ” 
 At the end of June 2014 , Rivers joined lawmakers including Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen on a state trade mission to Taiwan . Rivers ' district sells more fishing licenses than any other in the state and she would like “ to promote our area as a destination for sport fishing . ”

 In 2013 , Rivers ran for a freeholder position in Clark County 's 1st district . The freeholders are responsible for drafting a new county charter that will , with voter 's approval , turn Clark County into a Charter County . 123 people filed for the 15 freeholder seats . The primary election , held August 5 , was noted for its low turnout ( under 20 % ) , although Rivers garnered enough votes to move on to the general election . In the November 6 election , she was elected with 46 % of the vote in a 5 candidate field and took office on November 26 . 
 The Board of Freeholders submitted a home rule charter on May 27 which put it on the ballot in the November election . In the November election , the charter was approved with 53 % of the vote .

 In late 2014 and early 2015 , Rivers briefly considered running to be the chair of Clark County , a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass . There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator , but there were concerns about Rivers ' ability to balance the two offices . In December of 2014 , Rivers officially announced she would run for the office . On March 2 , 2015 , The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week . That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers would not be a candidate . Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal . She was considered the front runner for the office .

 Norfolk ( / <unk> / NOR @-@ <unk> , local / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia , United States . At the 2010 census , the population was 242 @,@ 803 ; in 2015 , the population was estimated to be 247 @,@ 189 making it the second @-@ most populous city in Virginia , behind neighboring Virginia Beach . 
 Norfolk is located at the core of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area , named for the large natural harbor of the same name located at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area , officially known as the Virginia Beach @-@ Norfolk @-@ Newport News , VA @-@ NC MSA . The city is bordered to the west by the Elizabeth River and to the north by the Chesapeake Bay . It also shares land borders with the independent cities of Chesapeake to its south and Virginia Beach to its east . One of the oldest of the cities in Hampton Roads , Norfolk is considered to be the historic , urban , financial , and cultural center of the region . 
 The city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point . The largest Navy base in the world , Naval Station Norfolk , is located in Norfolk along with one of NATO 's two Strategic Command headquarters . The city also has the corporate headquarters of Norfolk Southern Railway , one of North America 's principal Class I railroads , and Maersk Line , Limited , which manages the world 's largest fleet of US @-@ flag vessels . As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water , Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property , including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay . It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of Interstate highways , bridges , tunnels , and three bridge @-@ tunnel complexes — the only bridge @-@ tunnels in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Colonial years = = = 
 In 1619 , the Governor for the Virginia Colony , Sir George Yeardley incorporated four jurisdictions , termed <unk> , for the developed portion of the colony . These formed the basis for colonial representative government in the newly minted House of Burgesses . What would become Norfolk was put under the Elizabeth Cittie incorporation . 
 In 1634 King Charles I reorganized the colony into a system of shires . The former Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire . After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony , Adam Thoroughgood ( who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King 's Lynn , Norfolk , England ) was granted a large land holding , through the headrights system , along the Lynnhaven River in 1636 . 
 When the South Hampton Roads portion of the shire was separated , Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed New Norfolk County . One year later , it was split into two counties , Upper Norfolk and Lower Norfolk ( the latter is incorporated within present @-@ day City of Norfolk ) , chiefly on Thoroughgood 's recommendation . This area of Virginia became known as the place of entrepreneurs , including men of the Virginia Company of London . 
 Norfolk developed in the late 17th century as a " Half Moone " fort was constructed and 50 acres ( 200 @,@ 000 m2 ) were acquired from local natives of the Powhatan Confederacy in exchange for 10 @,@ 000 pounds of tobacco . The House of Burgesses established the " Towne of Lower Norfolk County " in 1680 . In 1691 , a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County split to form Norfolk County ( included in present @-@ day cities of Norfolk , Chesapeake , and parts of Portsmouth ) and Princess Anne County ( present @-@ day City of Virginia Beach ) . 
 Norfolk was incorporated in 1705 . In 1730 , a tobacco inspection site was located here . According to the Tobacco Inspection Act the inspection was " At Norfolk Town , upon the fort land , in the County of Norfolk ; and Kemp 's Landing , in Princess Anne , under one inspection . " In 1736 George II granted it a royal charter as a borough . By 1775 , Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued was the most prosperous city in Virginia . It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond . In part because of its merchants ' numerous trading ties with other parts of the British Empire , Norfolk served as a strong base of Loyalist support during the early part of the American Revolution . After fleeing the colonial capitol of Williamsburg , Lord Dunmore , the Royal Governor of Virginia , tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk . Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was forced into exile by the American rebels , commanded by Colonel Woodford . His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia . 
 On New Year 's Day , 1776 , Lord Dunmore 's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for more than eight hours . The damage from the shells , and fires started by the British and spread by the patriots , destroyed over 800 buildings , almost two @-@ thirds of the city . The patriots destroyed the remaining buildings for strategic reasons in February . Only the walls of Saint Paul 's Episcopal Church survived the bombardment and subsequent fires . A cannonball from the bombardment ( fired by the Liverpool ) remains within the wall of Saint Paul 's . 
 = = = Nineteenth century = = = 
 Following recovery from the Revolutionary War 's burning , Norfolk and her citizens struggled to rebuild . In 1804 , another serious fire along the city 's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback . During the 1820s , agrarian communities across the American South suffered a prolonged recession , which caused many families to migrate to other areas . Many moved west into the Piedmont , or further into Kentucky and Tennessee . Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to tobacco cultivation in the Tidewater , where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations . 
 Virginia made some attempts to phase out slavery , and <unk> had increased in the first two decades after the war . Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state , but by that time , increased demand from development in the Deep South created a large internal market for slavery . Invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century had enabled the profitable cultivation of short @-@ staple cotton in the uplands , which was widely used . 
 The American Colonization Society proposed to " repatriate " free blacks and freed slaves to Africa by establishing the new colony of Liberia and paying for transportation . But most African Americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the United States and achieve freedom and rights . For a period , many emigrants to Liberia from Virginia and North Carolina embarked from the port of Norfolk . Joseph Jenkins Roberts , a free person of color native to Norfolk , emigrated via the ACS and later was elected as the first president of Liberia , establishing a powerful family . 
 On June 7 , 1855 , the 183 @-@ ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin put into Hampton Roads for repairs . She had just sailed from the West Indies where there had been an outbreak of yellow fever . The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined . After eleven days a second inspection found no issues , so she was allowed to dock . A few days later , the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk , and a machinist died from the disease on July 8 . By August several people were dying per day , and a third of the city population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic . No one understood how the disease was transmitted . With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected , New York banned all traffic from those sites . Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk . The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation , affecting every family and causing widespread panic . The number of infected reached 5 @,@ 000 in September , and by the second week 1 @,@ 500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth . As the weather cooled , the outbreak began to wane , leaving a final tally of about 3 @,@ 200 dead . It took the city some time to recover . 
 In early 1861 , Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for secession . Virginia voted to secede from the Union . In the spring of 1862 , the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city 's Sewell 's Point Peninsula , marking the first fight between two ironclads , the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia . The battle ended in a stalemate , but changed the course of naval warfare ; from then on , warships were fortified with metal . 
 In May 1862 , Norfolk Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city to Union General John E. Wool and his forces . They held the city under martial law for the duration of the Civil War . Thousands of slaves from the region escaped to Union lines to gain freedom ; they quickly set up schools in Norfolk to start learning to read and write , years before the end of the war . 
 = = = 20th century to present = = = 
 1907 brought both the Virginian Railway and the Jamestown Exposition to Sewell 's Point . The large Naval Review at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula 's favorable location and laid the groundwork for the world 's largest naval base . Southern Democrats in Congress gained its location here . Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown , the exposition featured many prominent officials , including President Theodore Roosevelt , members of Congress , and diplomats from 21 countries . By 1917 , as the US built up to enter World War I , the Naval Air Station Hampton Roads had been constructed on the former exposition grounds . 
 In the first half of the 20th century , the city of Norfolk expanded its borders through annexation . In 1906 , the city annexed the incorporated town of Berkley , making the city cross the Elizabeth River . In 1923 , the city expanded to include Sewell 's Point , Willoughby Spit , the town of <unk> , and the Ocean View area . The city included the Navy Base and miles of beach property fronting on Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay . After a smaller annexation in 1959 , and a 1988 land swap with Virginia Beach , the city assumed its current boundaries . 
 With the dawn of the Interstate Highway System following World War II , new highways were constructed in the region . A series of bridges and tunnels , constructed during fifteen years , linked Norfolk with the Peninsula , Portsmouth , and Virginia Beach . In 1952 , the Downtown Tunnel opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth . The highways also stimulated development of new housing in suburbs , leading to the population spreading out . Additional bridges and tunnels included the Hampton Roads Bridge @-@ Tunnel in 1957 , the Midtown Tunnel in 1962 , and the Virginia Beach @-@ Norfolk Expressway ( Interstate 264 and State Route 44 ) in 1967 . In 1991 , the new Downtown Tunnel / Berkley Bridge complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes . 
 In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional , as the public system was supported by all taxpayers . It ordered integration , but Virginia pursued a policy of " massive resistance " . ( At this time , most black citizens were still disfranchised under the state 's turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration and elections . ) The Virginia General Assembly prohibited state funding for integrated public schools . 
 In 1958 , United States district courts in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis . In response , Governor James Lindsay Almond , Jr. ordered the schools closed . The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals declared the state law to be in conflict with the state constitution and ordered all public schools to be funded , whether integrated or not . About 10 days later , Almond capitulated and asked the General Assembly to rescind several " massive resistance " laws . In September 1959 , 17 black children entered six previously segregated Norfolk public schools . Virginian @-@ Pilot editor Lenoir Chambers editorialized against massive resistance and earned the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing . 
 With new suburban developments beckoning , many white middle @-@ class residents moved out of the city along new highway routes , and Norfolk 's population fell , a pattern repeated in numerous cities in the postwar era independently of segregation issues . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown 's Granby Street commercial corridor , located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront . The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street . 
 Norfolk 's city leaders began a long push to revive its urban core . While Granby Street underwent decline , Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses . Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished . In their place , planners created a new boulevard , Waterside Drive , along which many of the high @-@ rise buildings in Norfolk 's skyline have been erected . In 1983 the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment . Other facilities opened in the ensuing years , including the Harbor Park baseball stadium , home of the Norfolk Tides Triple @-@ A minor league baseball team . In 1995 , the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America . Norfolk 's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country . Downtown 's rising fortunes helped to expand the city 's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods .

 According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 96 square miles ( 250 km2 ) , of which 54 square miles ( 140 km2 ) is land and 42 square miles ( 110 km2 ) ( 43 @.@ 9 % ) is water . Norfolk is located at 36 ° 55 ′ N 76 ° 12 ′ W ( 36 @.@ <unk> ° N , 76 @.@ <unk> ° W ) 
 The city is located at the southeastern corner of Virginia at the junction of the Elizabeth River and Chesapeake Bay .

The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk , Virginia Beach , Chesapeake , Hampton , Newport News , Poquoson , Portsmouth , Suffolk , Williamsburg , and the counties of Gloucester , Isle of Wight , James City , Mathews , and York , as well as the North Carolina counties of Currituck and Gates . The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district , while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and Williamsburg are primarily centers of tourism . Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb . Additionally , Norfolk is part of the Virginia Beach @-@ Norfolk , VA @-@ NC Combined Statistical Area , which includes the Virginia Beach @-@ Norfolk @-@ Newport News , VA @-@ NC MSA , the Elizabeth City , North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area , and the Kill Devil Hills , NC Micropolitan Statistical Area .

 In addition to extensive riverfront property , Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the Willoughby Spit and Ocean View communities . 
 Being low @-@ lying and largely surrounded by water , Norfolk is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels . In addition , the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding . Some areas already flood regularly at high tide , and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how to address the issue in the future : it reported the cost of dealing with a sea @-@ level rise of one foot would be around one billion dollars . Since then , in 2013 , scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science have estimated that if current trends hold , the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 1 / 2 feet or more by the end of this century . 
 = = = Cityscape = = = 
 When Norfolk was first settled , homes were made of wood and frame construction , similar to most medieval English @-@ style homes . These homes had wide chimneys and thatch roofs . Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682 , the Georgian architectural style , which was popular in the South at the time , was used . Brick was considered more substantial construction ; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond . This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions , Palladian windows , balustraded roof decks , and two @-@ story porticoes . By 1740 , homes , warehouses , stores , workshops , and taverns began to dot Norfolk 's streets . 
 Norfolk was burned down during the Revolutionary War . After the Revolution , Norfolk was rebuilt in Federal style , based on Roman ideals . Federal @-@ style homes kept Georgian symmetry , though they had more refined decorations to look like New World homes . Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway , giant porticoes , gable or flat roofs , and projecting bays on exterior walls . Rooms were oval , elliptical or octagonal . Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today . A majority of buildings were made of wood and had simple construction . 
 In the early 19th century , Neoclassical architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes , such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows . Many Federal @-@ style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek @-@ style porch at the front . Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall , the old Norfolk Academy , and the Customs House . 
 Greek @-@ style homes gave way to Gothic Revival in the 1830s , which emphasized pointed arches , steep gable roofs , towers and tracer @-@ lead windows . The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary 's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival . Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas , verandas , ornamental brickwork , or corner quoins . Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings . 
 High @-@ rise buildings were first built in the late 19th century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline . Past styles were revived during the early years of the 20th century . Bungalows and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city . 
 As the Great Depression wore on , Art Deco emerged as a popular building style , as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown . Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal , with terracotta , and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles . 
 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 Norfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods . Some neighborhoods , such as Berkley , were formerly cities and towns .

Today , neighborhoods such as Downtown , Ghent and Fairmount Park have transformed with the revitalization that the city has undergone . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Norfolk has a humid subtropical climate with moderate changes of seasons . Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights , and by late May , the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days . Summers are consistently warm and humid , but the nearby Atlantic Ocean often exercises a slight cooling effect on daytime high temperatures , but a slight warming effect on nighttime low temperatures ( compared to areas farther inland ) . As such , Norfolk has occasional days over 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) . Temperatures over 100 F. are rare , but can occur on occasion . On average , July is the warmest month , and August is the year 's wettest month , due to still @-@ frequent summer thunderstorm activity combined with a rising frequency ( in August ) of tropical activity ( hurricanes and tropical storms ) , which can bring high winds and heavy rains . These usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally make landfalls in the area ; the highest @-@ risk period is mid @-@ August to the end of September . Fall is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights . Winter is usually mild in Norfolk , with average winter days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper 40s to mid 50s ( 8 to 13 ° C ) . On average , the coldest month of the year is January . Norfolk 's record high was 105 ° F ( 41 ° C ) on August 7 , 1918 and July 24 and 25 , 2010 , and record low was − 3 ° F ( − 19 ° C ) recorded on January 21 , 1985 .

 = = Economy = = 
 Since Norfolk serves as the commercial and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads ( and in its political structure of independent cities ) , it can be difficult to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole . 
 The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region play an important part in the local economy . As a strategic location at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay , its protected deep @-@ water channels serve as a major trade artery for the import and export of goods from across the Mid @-@ Atlantic , Mid @-@ West , and internationally . 
 In addition to commercial activities , Hampton Roads is a major military center , particularly for the United States Navy , and Norfolk serves as the home for Naval Station Norfolk , the world 's largest naval installation . Located on Sewell 's Point Peninsula , in the northwest corner of the city , the station is the headquarters of the United States Fleet Forces Command ( formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet ) , which compromises over 62 @,@ 000 active duty personnel , 75 ships , and 132 aircraft . The base also serves as the headquarters to NATO 's Allied Command Transformation . 
 The region also plays an important role in defense contracting , with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk . Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include : Huntington Ingalls Industries ( formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News ) in Newport News , BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair , General Dynamics <unk> Norfolk , and Colonna 's Shipyard Inc . , while the US Navy 's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth . Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy , though some private commercial repair also takes place . Over 35 % of Gross Regional Product ( which includes the entire Norfolk @-@ Newport News @-@ Virginia Beach MSA ) , is attributable to defense spending , and that 75 % of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending . 
 After the military , the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region 's cargo ports . Headquartered in Norfolk , the Virginia Port Authority ( VPA ) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned @-@ entity that , in turn , owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break @-@ bulk and container type cargo . In Norfolk , Norfolk International Terminals ( NIT ) represents one of those three facilities and is home to the world 's largest and fastest container cranes . Together , the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475 @,@ 000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006 , making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey . 
 In addition to NIT , Norfolk is home to Lambert 's Point Docks , the largest coal trans @-@ shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere , with annual throughput of approximately 48 million tons . <unk> coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia , West Virginia , and Kentucky . The coal is loaded onto trains and sent to the port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England , Europe , and Asia . 
 Between 1925 and 2007 , Ford Motor Company operated Norfolk Assembly , a manufacturing plant located on the Elizabeth River that had produced the Model T , sedans and station wagons before building F @-@ 150 pick @-@ up trucks . Before it closed , the plant employed more than 2 @,@ 600 people at the 2 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 260 @,@ 000 m2 ) facility . 
 Most major shipping lines have a permanent presence in the region with some combination of sales , distribution , and / or logistical offices , many of which are located in Norfolk . In addition , many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters . These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center office park . The French firm CMA CGM , the Israeli firm Zim Integrated Shipping Services , and Maersk Line Limited , a subsidiary of the world 's largest shipping line , A. P. Moller @-@ Maersk Group , have their North American headquarters in Norfolk . Major companies headquartered in Norfolk include Norfolk Southern , Landmark Communications , Dominion Enterprises , <unk> Health Systems ( parent company of <unk> ) , Portfolio Recovery Associates , and <unk> Products Group . 
 Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region , the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city 's economy . The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50 @,@ 000 in 2003 , to 107 @,@ 000 in 2004 and 2005 . Also in April 2007 , the city completed construction on a $ 36 million state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier . Partly due to this construction , passenger counts dropped to 70 @,@ 000 in 2006 , but is expected to rebound to 90 @,@ 000 in 2007 , and higher in later years . Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas , the downtown location of Norfolk 's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city 's hotels , restaurants , shopping , and cultural amenities . 
 Hampton Roads is home to four Fortune 500 companies . Representing the food industry , transportation , retail and shipbuilding , these four companies are located in Smithfield , Norfolk , Chesapeake and Newport News .

 = Guinness Foreign Extra Stout = 
 Guinness Foreign Extra Stout ( FES ) is a stout produced by the Guinness Brewery , an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo , a drinks multinational . First brewed by Guinness in 1801 , FES was designed for export , and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout , and typically has a higher alcohol content ( at around 7 @.@ 5 % ABV ) , which gives it a more bitter taste . The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship . 
 FES is the Guinness variant that is most commonly found in Asia , Africa and the Caribbean , and it accounts for almost half of Guinness sales worldwide . In 2011 , over 4 million hectolitres of the beer were sold in Africa , where Diageo intend to grow the product into the continent 's highest selling beer . 
 Guinness Flavour Extract , a dehydrated , hopped wort extract made from barley malt and roasted barley , is used for overseas production of the stout . The syrup is shipped from Ireland , where it is added at the ratio of 1 : 49 to locally brewed pale beer . In most overseas markets , Guinness Flavour Extract ( GFE ) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES . 
 In the 1960s , FES was marketed in Nigeria as " gives you power " . This was updated for 1999 @-@ 2006 with the Michael Power campaign , which aired across Africa . The beer is ranked highly on beer rating websites , while beer critics have varying opinions . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1801 , Guinness West India Porter , the direct predecessor of Foreign Extra Stout , was first exported from the St. James 's Gate brewery in Dublin . The product was formulated for Irish immigrant workers in the Caribbean . The beer was only brewed between October and April , which reduced acidification , and was matured in large wooden vats for up to two years , which gave the finished product greater stability . To survive the long journey overseas , which was then taken by ship , it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content , which acted as natural preservatives for the beer . Exported in barrels , the product was then bottled locally , which helped to reduce costs . 
 The first recorded shipment of the beer to the United States was in 1817 . In 1827 , the first official shipment of Guinness on the African continent arrived in Sierra Leone . The beer was renamed Foreign Extra Stout from around 1849 onwards . The first recorded exports to South East Asia began in the 1860s . 
 At the turn of the twentieth century , FES accounted for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production , with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States , where it was largely used as a medicinal product . Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910 , when it was eclipsed by the United States . Due to the expense of importation , FES was a premium product , selling for double the price of domestic stouts . By 1912 , total production had reached 105 @,@ 000 hogsheads . The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition . The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s , as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout . Following discontinuation of export during World War II , FES did not return to the United States until 1956 , but this was not successful , and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards . 
 Prior to 1920 , Guinness export sales were mostly to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts . From the 1920s onwards this changed , and among the first natives to develop a taste for the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the Malay Peninsula . In 1924 , a global Guinness salesman was appointed by the company , and sales began to be pursued among native populations . 
 In 1939 , shortly after the outbreak of World War II , the British War Office purchased 500 @,@ 000 half @-@ pint bottles of FES for distribution to hospitals . 
 In 1951 , exports totalled 90 @,@ 000 barrels , but by 1964 had grown to 300 @,@ 000 barrels . By 1959 , sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to establish a joint venture in the country with the United Africa Company . By 1962 , Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness , with around 100 @,@ 000 barrels exported to the country every year . This led the company to build a brewery in <unk> in western Nigeria to supply the demand ; it was only the third brewery in the company 's history . The brewery cost over £ 2 million , had a 150 @,@ 000 barrel capacity , and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria , 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests . Breweries followed in Malaysia ( 1965 ) , Cameroon ( 1970 ) and Ghana ( 1971 ) , whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the West Indies . Historically a small proportion of Guinness production , it was this success , especially in Africa but also in Asia , that allowed FES to grow into a 4 @.@ 5 million <unk> brand . 
 A new bottle design was debuted in Malaysia in 2005 , and later rolled out worldwide . In 2013 , FES received a packaging redesign in Africa and other selected markets , with a gold foil top and a new label . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Irish version of FES is brewed with pale malt , 25 per cent flaked barley ( for head retention and body ) and 10 per cent roasted barley , the latter being what gives the beer its dark hue . It uses the bitter Galena , Nugget and Target hop varieties . There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 Bitterness Units . The beer is force carbonated . 
 Guinness Flavour Extract , a dehydrated , hopped wort extract made from barley malt and roasted barley , is used for overseas production of the stout . The syrup is shipped from Ireland , where it is added at the ratio of 1 : 49 to locally brewed pale beer . Each year , six million litres of GFE are made using 9 @,@ 000 tonnes of barley . Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s . In 2003 , production of GFE was relocated from St James 's Gate to the former Cherry 's brewery in Mary Street , Waterford , but in 2013 production returned to St James 's . 
 FES is produced at Diageo owned breweries in Nigeria , Kenya , Ghana , Cameroon , Ethiopia , Tanzania , Uganda , Seychelles , Malaysia and Jamaica . In addition , it is produced under licence in 39 other countries . Diageo has brewing arrangements with the Castel Group to license brew and distribute Guinness in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Gambia , Gabon , Ivory Coast , Togo , Benin , Burkina Faso , Chad , Mali and Guinea . 
 FES is the oldest variant of Guinness that is still available , although its ingredients and production methods have varied over time . In 1824 , it had an original gravity ( OG ) of 1082 . After a peak in strength in 1840 , when the beer had an OG of 1098 , by 1860 , the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG . FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts . Black malt was used from 1819 , and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt . In 1883 , the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt , 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt . From 1929 – 1930 onwards , Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer 's production to roasted barley . Amber malt continued to be added to the grist until 1940 . <unk> barley was introduced in the early 1950s , and the hopping rate was decreased . 
 Originally a bottle conditioned beer , FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948 . Since 1950 , in an attempt to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES , the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days , which has developed a high lactic acid content . Finally , the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution .

 Foreign Extra Stout constitutes 45 per cent of total Guinness sales globally . Originally exported to British and Irish expatriates , from the 1920s the beer began to be drank by local populations . A 7 @.@ 5 % ABV version is sold throughout most of the world , although lower strength variants are found in some locations . 
 The beer is available in bottles and cans .

 In Africa , the product retails at a premium price , with an up to 100 per cent higher cost than rival beers . 13 breweries in Africa brew FES . It is brewed and distributed by Guinness Nigeria , which is 54 @.@ 3 per cent owned by Diageo , with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests . As of 2012 @-@ 13 , Nigeria has been the largest market for Guinness by sales . 
 FES was initially introduced into the Nigerian market through importation in the 1940s . Guinness in Nigeria is made from locally sourced sorghum or maize that has been heavily roasted . Some Nigerian versions also contain wheat . The switch from malted barley was made in 1986 when the Nigerian government briefly banned imports of the grain . The use of sorghum and maize continues as it is a cheaper alternative than barley , which has to be imported , and it is less vulnerable to local currency fluctuations . The Nigerian breweries use high gravity brewing techniques to ferment sorghum and pale malt to 1090 OG . Beer writer Roger Protz describes the Nigerian product as " strikingly different " from the Irish brewed version . 
 The brewing of FES has taken place at Sierra Leone Brewery Limited since October 1967 . 
 In Ghana , FES is brewed in <unk> by Guinness Ghana Breweries , which is 50 @.@ 5 per cent owned by Diageo . GFE is mixed with a locally brewed sorghum lager , but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it contains no wheat and has a higher proportion of roast barley . In Ghana , the product is believed to have medicinal properties , strengthening the blood and improving circulation . 
 In 2003 , a 5 @.@ 5 % ABV , lightly @-@ nitrogenated variant of FES was introduced in Ghana called Guinness Extra Smooth . It was released in Nigeria in 2005 , where it constitutes 5 @-@ 10 per cent of Guinness sales in the country . 
 = = = Asia = = = 
 In the year 2012 - 2013 , sales of Guinness in South East Asia were over £ 100 million . FES ( 6 @.@ 8 % ABV ) is brewed and distributed in Malaysia by Guinness Anchor Berhad , a listed company in which Diageo holds a 25 @.@ 5 percent stake . The Malaysian variant is distributed throughout most of South East Asia . The brew was reduced in ABV from 8 to 6 @.@ 8 % in 2008 . Malaysia is the largest Asian market for Guinness , where , in 2012 , the brand grew by between 10 and 15 per cent . In Singapore , FES is brewed and distributed by Asia Pacific Breweries . In Indonesia , Guinness is brewed to 4 @.@ 9 % ABV by PT Multi Bintang ( a subsidiary of Asia Pacific Breweries ) , and is distributed by PT Dima Indonesia . In China , small amounts of FES are sold , where it is positioned as a premium priced import in upmarket bars .

 FES was sold and then withdrawn in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout ; it returned in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased . The beer was again withdrawn from the UK market , returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora . The British market is supplied with both the Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of the beer , the latter of which has annual sales of £ 2 million . Official imports of FES into the US were resumed in 2010 , following a resurgent interest in craft beer ; this was after a period of grey imports , predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates . 
 = = Advertising and sponsorship = = 
 In the 1960s , FES was marketed in Nigeria as " gives you power " and its consumption was linked with an increase in sexual potency . This was updated for 1999 @-@ 2006 with the Michael Power campaign , which aired all over the continent . Guinness credits the campaign with allowing the company to lead the Africa beer market by 50 per cent in 2000 , experience volume growth of up to 50 per cent in some markets , achieve brand recognition of a reported 95 per cent , and by doubling Guinness sales in Africa by 2003 . In 1999 , Saatchi & Saatchi was given worldwide responsibility for marketing the FES brand . In October 2013 , BBDO was awarded responsibility for marketing Guinness in Africa . Saatchi continues to market FES in the rest of the world . Since 2008 , FES has been the largest sponsor of the Nigerian national football team .

 The beer is ranked highly on beer rating websites . Garrett Oliver notes its refreshing qualities and " distinctive acidic edge " . On the other hand , it has been criticised by British journalist Tony Naylor as being " more about treacly , boozy warmth " than " complex flavour " . 
 = HMS Iron Duke ( 1912 ) = 
 HMS Iron Duke was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy , the lead ship of her class , named in honour of Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington . She was built by Portsmouth Dockyard , and her keel laid in January 1912 . Launched ten months later , she was commissioned into the Home Fleet in March 1914 as the fleet flagship . She was armed with a main battery of ten 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 340 mm ) guns and was capable of a top speed of 21 @.@ 25 knots ( 39 @.@ 36 km / h ; 24 @.@ 45 mph ) . 
 Iron Duke served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet during the First World War , including at the Battle of Jutland . There , she inflicted significant damage on the German battleship SMS König early in the main fleet action . In January 1917 , she was relieved as fleet flagship . After the war , Iron Duke operated in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet . She participated in both the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea and the Greco @-@ Turkish War . She also assisted in the evacuation of refugees from Smyrna . In 1926 , she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet , where she served as a training ship . 
 Iron Duke only remained on active duty for a few more years ; in 1930 , the London Naval Treaty specified that the four Iron Duke @-@ class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised . Iron Duke was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship ; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat . She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a harbour defence ship . In October , she was badly damaged by German bombers and was run aground to avoid sinking . She continued to serve as an anti @-@ aircraft platform for the duration of the war , and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s . 
 = = Design = = 
 Iron Duke was 622 feet 9 inches ( 190 m ) long overall and had a beam of 90 ft ( 27 m ) and an average draught of 29 ft 6 in ( 9 m ) . She displaced 25 @,@ 000 long tons ( 25 @,@ 401 t ) as designed and up to 29 @,@ 560 long tons ( 30 @,@ 034 t ) at combat loading . Her propulsion system consisted of four Parsons steam turbines , with steam provided by eighteen Babcock & Wilcox boilers . The engines were rated at 29 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 21 @,@ 625 kW ) and produced a top speed of 21 @.@ 25 kn ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . Her cruising radius was 7 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 446 km ; 8 @,@ 976 mi ) at a more economical 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Iron Duke had a crew of 995 officers and enlisted men , though during wartime this grew to up to 1 @,@ 022 . 
 Iron Duke was armed with a main battery of ten BL 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets . They were arranged in two superfiring pairs , one forward and one aft ; the fifth turret was located amidships , between the funnels and the rear superstructure . Close @-@ range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary battery of twelve BL 6 @-@ inch Mk VII guns . The ship was also fitted with a pair of QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns and four 47 mm ( 2 in ) 3 @-@ pounder guns . As was typical for capital ships of the period , she was equipped with four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside . Iron Duke was protected by a main armoured belt that was 12 in ( 305 mm ) thick over the ship 's vitals . Her deck was 2 @.@ 5 in ( 64 mm ) thick . The main battery turret faces were 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick , and the turrets were supported by 10 in ( 254 mm ) thick barbettes . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Iron Duke was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 12 January 1912 and launched on 12 October of that year . After completing fitting @-@ out work , she began sea trials on 25 November 1913 . The ship was completed in March 1914 , and she joined the Home Fleet after completing her trials . In the Home Fleet , she served as the flagship of Admiral Sir George Callaghan . On 29 July 1914 , as war loomed on the Continent , Iron Duke and the rest of the Home Fleet was ordered to proceed to Scapa Flow from Portland to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 In August 1914 , after the outbreak of World War I , the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet ; Iron Duke remained the flagship of the fleet , now under Admiral John Jellicoe , 1st Earl Jellicoe . On the evening of 22 November 1914 , the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea ; Iron Duke stood with the main body in support of Vice Admiral David Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron . The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November . Iron Duke and most of the fleet initially remained in port during the German raid on Scarborough , Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December 1914 , though the 3rd Battle Squadron was sent to reinforce the British forces in the area . After receiving further information about the possibility of the rest of the German fleet being at sea , Jellicoe gave the order for the fleet to sortie to try to intercept the Germans , though by that time they had already retreated . Iron Duke went to sea with the 2nd and 4th Battle Squadrons for gunnery practice north of the Hebrides on 23 and 24 December . The following day , the rest of the fleet joined Iron Duke for a sweep in the North Sea , which concluded on 27 December . 
 Iron Duke and the rest of the fleet conducted gunnery drills on 10 – 13 January 1915 west of the Orkneys and Shetlands . On the evening of 23 January , the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet , but Iron Duke and the rest of the fleet did not become engaged in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day . Upon returning from the operation , Iron Duke went to Invergordon for refit ; while she was away , HMS Centurion acted as the temporary fleet flagship . The work was completed by 23 February , after which she returned to Scapa Flow . On 7 – 10 March , the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea , during which it conducted training manoeuvres . Another such cruise took place on 16 – 19 March . On 11 April , the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April ; another patrol in the area took place on 17 – 19 April , followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20 – 21 April . 
 The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 17 – 19 May without encountering any German vessels . On 25 May , Iron Duke carried Jellicoe to Rosyth to meet with Admiral Henry Jackson , the new First Sea Lord . Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow on 28 May , in time to participate in another sweep into the North Sea on 29 – 31 May . After returning to Scapa Flow , Iron Duke immediately departed for Cromarty . The fleet conducted gunnery training in mid @-@ June . Iron Duke , the 2nd Battle Squadron , and the 1st Cruiser Squadron conducted gunnery training at Cromarty on 2 August ; after completing the drills , the ships returned to Scapa Flow . On 7 August , the ship again took Jellicoe to Cromarty for another meeting , this time with the Prime Minister , H. H. Asquith . Iron Duke was back in Scapa Flow by 16 August . 
 On 2 – 5 September , the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills . Throughout the rest of the month , the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises . Iron Duke went to Invergordon on 1 October for another period of refitting — the work lasted until 11 October . Two days later , the majority of the fleet conducted another sweep into the North Sea , returning to port on 15 October . On 2 – 5 November , Iron Duke participated in another fleet training operation west of the Orkneys . Another such cruise took place on 1 – 4 December . Later in the month , Iron Duke took part in gunnery drills , and during them , conducted an experiment of sorts to determine the accuracy of the ship 's gunners . Jellicoe concluded that the " result was very satisfactory . " 
 Iron Duke collided with the tanker Prudentia on 12 January 1916 while in Scapa Flow , and the latter sank . The tanker had come loose during a severe gale , which had winds of up to 80 miles per hour ( 130 km / h ) . Iron Duke was undamaged in the accident . The typical routine of gunnery drills and squadron exercises occurred in January . The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February ; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight , but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea . As a result , the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea . On the night of 25 March , Iron Duke and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support the Battlecruiser Fleet and other light forces that raided the German zeppelin base at Tondern . By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March , the British and German forces had already disengaged and a severe gale threatened the light craft . Iron Duke guided the destroyers back to Scapa while the rest of the fleet retired independently . 
 On 21 April , the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea . The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft . The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the Germans had withdrawn , however . On 2 – 4 May , the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet , the German High Seas Fleet , composed of 16 dreadnoughts , six pre @-@ dreadnoughts , six light cruisers , and 31 torpedo boats , departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May . The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats . The Royal Navy 's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation . The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet , totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers , to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet . On the day of the battle , Iron Duke steamed with the 4th Battle Squadron , and was the 9th ship in the British line . 
 The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon , but by 18 : 00 , the Grand Fleet approached the scene . At around 18 : 14 , two large @-@ caliber shells fell near Iron Duke but caused no damage . Fifteen minutes later , Iron Duke had closed to effective gunnery range — some 26 @,@ 000 yards ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) — of the German fleet , and took the dreadnought SMS König under fire . Iron Duke 's first salvo fell short , but the next three were on target ; the ship 's gunner claimed at least six hits on the German battleship . In fact , they had scored seven hits on König and inflicted significant damage . 
 Shortly after 19 : 00 , fighting around the disabled German cruiser SMS Wiesbaden — which had been badly damaged earlier in the engagement — resumed . Iron Duke opened fire on the crippled cruiser and nearby destroyers with her secondary battery at 19 : 11 at a range of 9 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 8 @,@ 200 to 9 @,@ 100 m ) . Iron Duke 's gunners claimed to have sunk one of the destroyers and hit a second , but they had in fact missed their targets entirely . Shortly thereafter , the German destroyers attempted to launch a torpedo attack on the British line ; Iron Duke began firing at 19 : 24 . The sinking of the destroyer SMS <unk> is credited to a salvo from Iron Duke , but determining which ship fired which shells in the melee is difficult , according to naval historian John Campbell . 
 Following the German destroyer attack , the High Seas Fleet disengaged , and Iron Duke and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle . This was , in part , due to confusion aboard Iron Duke over the exact location and course of the German fleet ; without this information , Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action . At 21 : 30 , the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation . Early on the morning of 1 June , the Grand Fleet combed the area , looking for damaged German ships , but after spending several hours searching , they found none . Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow , arriving at 11 : 30 . Over the course of the battle , Iron Duke had fired ninety rounds from her main battery , along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns . 
 = = = = Subsequent actions in the North Sea = = = = 
 On 18 August , the Germans again sortied , this time to bombard Sunderland ; Scheer hoped to draw out Beatty 's battlecruisers and destroy them . British signals intelligence decrypted German wireless transmissions , allowing Jellicoe enough time to deploy the Grand Fleet in an attempt to engage in a decisive battle . Both sides withdrew , however , after their opponents ' submarines inflicted losses : the British cruisers Nottingham and Falmouth were both torpedoed and sunk by German U @-@ boats , and the German battleship SMS Westfalen was damaged by the British submarine E23 . After returning to port , Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U @-@ boats unless the odds of defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were high . 
 In the aftermath of Jutland , the Royal Navy determined that horizontal protection , particularly over ammunition magazines , was insufficient . As a result , many ships in the Grand Fleet had additional armour installed ; Iron Duke went into dock for this work in October . The work , which saw over 100 long tons ( 100 t ) of armour added to the ship , was completed by December . On 28 November 1916 , while she was still in dry dock , Admiral Beatty replaced Jellicoe as the commander of the Grand Fleet ; Iron Duke served as his flagship until January 1917 , when he transferred to Queen Elizabeth . In 1918 , flying @-@ off platforms for aircraft were installed on Iron Duke 's " B " and " Q " turrets .

 In March 1919 , Iron Duke was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , where she again served as flagship . The ship went into the Black Sea in April to participate in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . While en route , the ship stopped in Constantinople on 7 April . There , Iron Duke was involved in the destruction of warships and other materiel that might be used by the Bolsheviks . On 12 May , Iron Duke travelled from Constantinople to Smyrna , where she provided a landing party to occupy some of the city 's outer forts . She returned to the Black Sea , where she remained until June , when she returned to the Mediterranean . 
 Iron Duke returned to the Black Sea in late 1919 . She arrived in Novorossiysk on 12 October , where she met the White Russian protected cruiser General Kornilov . On 14 October , the ship stopped in Sevastopol . Iron Duke returned to Novorossiysk on 19 January 1920 . On 25 January , she stopped in the ports of Yalta and Sevastopol to inspect the situation of the White Russians there . On 17 June , shore parties from Iron Duke and the destroyer Shark destroyed Turkish guns in the forts protecting the Bosporus on the Black Sea . 
 On 2 September 1922 , Iron Duke was steaming to the Dalmatian coast for a training cruise , when she received news of the Greek defeat in Turkey . Admiral Osmond Brock , the Mediterranean Fleet commander , ordered Iron Duke to proceed to Smyrna , where he expected disturbances . There , she served as the flagship of the British naval forces participating in the evacuation of Greek refugees from the city . She was present during the Great Fire that devastated the city . During the chaos , a number of refugees managed to come alongside Iron Duke in small boats , and were brought aboard the battleship . The following month , the Allies held a conference aboard Iron Duke at <unk> to mediate the Greco @-@ Turkish dispute . The ship thereafter proceeded to Constantinople . 
 In November 1924 , Queen Elizabeth relieved Iron Duke as the Mediterranean Fleet flagship ; Iron Duke was then transferred to the 3rd Battle Squadron , Mediterranean Fleet , where she became the squadron flagship . The 3rd Squadron was moved to the Atlantic Fleet in March 1926 , where it was used as a training squadron . Iron Duke remained the squadron flagship during this period , until 30 May 1928 , when she was relieved by her sister Benbow . In 1927 , the Navy considered adding anti @-@ torpedo bulges to Iron Duke and her sister ships , but the plan was discarded because the ships were due to be replaced in 1931 – 1932 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the plan was not economical . That year , the aircraft launching @-@ platform mounted on Iron Duke 's " B " turret was removed . The ship went into dry dock in May 1928 for a periodic refit ; the work lasted until May 1929 . Two 4 in ( 100 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed on the forward superstructure . The aircraft platform on " Q " turret was also removed during this period . 
 Iron Duke returned to service on 30 May 1929 , when she was recommissioned as a gunnery training ship . She served in this capacity for only a year and a half , however . In November 1931 , under the terms of the London Naval Treaty , Iron Duke was disarmed and converted into a gunnery training vessel . The work lasted until 21 September 1932 , when she was commissioned for new sea trials . The ship 's " B " and " Y " turrets were also removed , and several small guns of various types were installed atop " B " barbette . Two 4 @.@ 7 in ( 120 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed as well , but these were later removed in 1935 . A high @-@ angle director for the anti @-@ aircraft guns was also added in place of the aft rangefinder . Over 2 @,@ 500 long tons ( 2 @,@ 500 t ) of steel from her belt armour was removed during the demilitarisation ; in all , 4 @,@ 258 long tons ( 4 @,@ 326 t ) of material was removed from the ship and 202 long tons ( 205 t ) added . The ship was recommissioned on 4 October 1932 at Devonport , again as a gunnery training ship . She was featured in the film Brown on Resolution , which was released in May 1935 . On 16 July 1935 , she was present at the Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead for King George V. She attended another Fleet Review , the coronation review for George VI , on 20 May 1937 . In 1939 , a twin QF 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch dual @-@ purpose gun mount was installed aft of " Y " barbette . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 During the Second World War , she was used as a base ship and a floating anti @-@ aircraft platform at Scapa Flow . Her secondary guns were removed and used for coastal defence around the base . On 17 October , four Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers attacked Scapa Flow , and damaged Iron Duke with several near misses . To prevent her from sinking , her crew had to run the ship aground . On 16 March , the ship , which was still beached , was attacked again by Luftwaffe aircraft . This time , eighteen Ju 88s attacked the harbour and surrounding installations . Iron Duke was again badly damaged , as was the heavy cruiser Norfolk . 
 The ship 's presence in Scapa Flow may have affected the Germans ' plans during Operation Rheinübung , the Atlantic sortie of the battleship Bismarck in May 1941 . German aerial reconnaissance spotted Iron Duke and two decoy battleships in the harbour , and erroneously identified them as active units of the Home Fleet ; under the mistaken impression that the heavy units of the Home Fleet were still in port , the German fleet commander , Günther Lütjens , decided to break into the Atlantic via the Denmark Strait , which resulted in the Battle of the Denmark Strait . 
 The ship was later repaired and returned to service as a harbour ship for the duration of the war , though she remained beached . Iron Duke remained in the Royal Navy inventory until March 1946 , when she was sold for scrapping to Metal Industries , still beached in Scapa Flow . The ship was refloated on 19 April 1946 and transferred to Faslane on 19 August . In September 1948 , she was re @-@ sold and moved to Glasgow , arriving on 30 November 1948 , and subsequently broken up for scrap . Iron Duke 's bell is on display at Winchester Cathedral . 
 = Promethium = 
 Promethium , originally prometheum , is a chemical element with the symbol Pm and atomic number 61 . All of its isotopes are radioactive ; it is one of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms , a distinction shared with technetium . Chemically , promethium is a lanthanide , which forms salts when combined with other elements . Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of + 3 ; however , a few + 2 compounds may exist . 
 In 1902 , Bohuslav Brauner suggested there was an element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium ( 60 ) and samarium ( 62 ) ; this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley who , having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known , found there was no element with atomic number 61 . In 1926 , an Italian and an American group claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61 ; both " discoveries " were soon proven to be false . In 1938 , during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University , a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium , but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced , and the discovery was not generally recognized . Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor . The discoverers proposed the name " prometheum " ( the spelling was subsequently changed ) , derived from Prometheus , the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans , to symbolize " both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind 's intellect . " However , a sample of the metal was made only in 1963 . 
 There are two possible sources for natural promethium : rare decays of natural europium @-@ 151 ( producing promethium @-@ 147 ) , and uranium ( various isotopes ) . Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium @-@ 147 , which are used in luminous paint , atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices , even though promethium @-@ 145 is the most stable promethium isotope . Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce , it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium @-@ 235 ( enriched uranium ) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium @-@ 147 .

 A promethium atom has 61 electrons , arranged in the configuration [ Xe ] <unk> . In forming compounds , the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one of the 4f @-@ electrons , which belongs to an open subshell . The element 's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements . It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius ( caused by the lanthanide contraction ) that is not caused by the filled ( or half @-@ filled ) 4f @-@ subshell . 
 Many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium . For example , the melting point , the first three ionization energies , and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium ; similarly , the estimate for the boiling point , ionic ( Pm3 + ) radius , and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium . 
 Promethium has a double hexagonal close packed ( dhcp ) structure and a hardness of 63 kg / mm2 . This low @-@ temperature alpha form converts into a beta , body @-@ centered cubic ( bcc ) phase upon heating to 890 ° C. 
 = = = Chemical properties and compounds = = = 
 Promethium belongs to the cerium group of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements . Because of its instability , chemical studies of promethium are incomplete . Even though a few compounds have been synthesized , they are not fully studied ; in general , they tend to be pink or red in color . Treatment of acidic solutions containing Pm3 + ions with ammonia results in a gelatinous light @-@ brown sediment of hydroxide , Pm ( OH ) 3 , which is insoluble in water . When dissolved in hydrochloric acid , a water @-@ soluble yellow salt , <unk> , is produced ; similarly , when dissolved in nitric acid , a nitrate results , Pm ( NO3 ) 3 . The latter is also well @-@ soluble ; when dried , it forms pink crystals , similar to Nd ( NO3 ) 3 . The electron configuration for Pm3 + is [ Xe ] <unk> , and the color of the ion is pink . The ground state term symbol is <unk> . The sulfate is slightly soluble , like the other cerium group sulfates . Cell parameters have been calculated for its <unk> ; they lead to conclusion that the density of <unk> ( SO4 ) 3 · 8 H2O is 2 @.@ 86 g / cm3 . The oxalate , <unk> ( C2O4 ) 3 · 10 H2O , has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates . 
 Unlike the nitrate , the oxide is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt . As @-@ synthesized , e.g. by heating the oxalate , it is a white or lavender @-@ colored powder with disordered structure . This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600 ° C. Further annealing at 800 ° C and then at 1750 ° C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases , respectively , and the last two phases can be <unk> by adjusting the annealing time and temperature . 
 Promethium forms only one stable oxidation state , + 3 , in the form of ions ; this is in line with other lanthanides . According to its position in the periodic table , the element cannot be expected to form stable + 4 or + 2 oxidation states ; treating chemical compounds containing Pm3 + ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Promethium is the only lanthanide and one of only two elements among the first 83 that has no stable ( or even long @-@ lived ) isotopes . This is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes ; it is also the least stable element of the first 84 . The primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes ( promethium @-@ 146 decays to both , the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture , and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay ) . Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope ( <unk> ) has a very rare alpha decay mode to praseodymium . 
 The most stable isotope of the element is promethium @-@ 145 , which has a specific activity of 940 Ci ( 35 TBq ) / g and a half @-@ life of 17 @.@ 7 years via electron capture . Because it has 84 neutrons ( two more than 82 , which is a magic number which corresponds to a stable neutron configuration ) , it may emit an alpha particle ( which has 2 neutrons ) to form praseodymium @-@ 141 with 82 neutrons . Thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed alpha decay . Its partial half @-@ life for alpha decay is about 6 @.@ 3 × 109 years , and the relative probability for a <unk> nucleus to decay in this way is 2 @.@ 8 × 10 − 7 % . Several other Pm isotopes ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> etc . ) also have a positive energy release for alpha decay ; their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed . 
 The element also has 18 nuclear isomers , with mass numbers of 133 to 142 , 144 , 148 , 149 , 152 , and 154 ( some mass numbers have more than one isomer ) . The most stable of them is promethium @-@ <unk> , with a half @-@ life of 43 @.@ 1 days ; this is longer than the half @-@ lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes , except only for promethium @-@ 143 to 147 ( note that promethium @-@ <unk> has a longer half @-@ life than the ground state , promethium @-@ 148 ) . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 In 1934 , Willard Libby found weak beta activity in pure neodymium , which was attributed to a half @-@ life over 1012 years . Almost 20 years later , it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10 − 20 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium . However , these observations were disproved by newer investigations , because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes , any single beta decays ( which can produce promethium isotopes ) are forbidden by energy conservation . In particular , careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference <unk> @-@ <unk> is negative ( − 87 keV ) , which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of <unk> to <unk> . 
 Both isotopes of natural europium have larger mass excesses than sums of those of their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle ; therefore , they ( stable in practice ) may alpha decay . Research at <unk> <unk> del Gran Sasso showed that europium @-@ 151 experimentally decays to promethium @-@ 147 with the half @-@ life of 5 × 1018 years . It has been shown that europium is " responsible " for about 12 grams of promethium in the Earth 's crust . Alpha decays for europium @-@ 153 have not been found yet , and its theoretically calculated half @-@ life is so high ( due to low energy of decay ) that this process will probably never be observed . 
 Finally , promethium can be formed in nature as a product of spontaneous fission of uranium @-@ 238 . Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores : a sample of pitchblende has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion ( 1018 ) by mass . Uranium is thus " responsible " for 560 g promethium in Earth 's crust . 
 Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star HR 465 in Andromeda ; it also has been found in HD <unk> ( Przybylski 's star ) and HD 965 . Because of the short half @-@ life of promethium isotopes , they should be formed near the surface of those stars .

 = = = Searches for element 61 = = = 
 In 1902 , Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner found out that the difference between neodymium and samarium is the largest of all neighboring lanthanides pairs ; as a conclusion , he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them . This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who , having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements , found a few atomic numbers had no element to correspond : the gaps were 43 , 61 , 72 , 75 , 85 , and 87 . With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment . 
 The first claim of a discovery was published by Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of Florence , Italy . After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the Brazilian mineral monazite by fractionated crystallization , they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium . This solution gave x @-@ ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61 . In honor of their city , they named element 61 " <unk> . " The results were published in 1926 , but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924 . Also in 1926 , a group of scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign , Smith Hopkins and Len <unk> published the discovery of element 61 . They named it " <unk> , " after the university . Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that " corresponded " to element 61 was identical to that of <unk> ; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities ( barium , chromium , and platinum ) . 
 In 1934 , Josef <unk> finally formulated the isobar rule . One of the indirect consequences of this rule was that element 61 was unable to form stable isotopes . In 1938 , a nuclear experiment was conducted by H. B. Law et al. at Ohio State University . The nuclides produced certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium , and the name " <unk> " was proposed , but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced and the discovery not largely recognized . 
 = = = Discovery and synthesis of promethium metal = = = 
 Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( Clinton Laboratories at that time ) in 1945 by Jacob A. <unk> , Lawrence E. <unk> and Charles D. Coryell by separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in the graphite reactor ; however , being too busy with military @-@ related research during World War II , they did not announce their discovery until 1947 . The original proposed name was " <unk> " , after the laboratory where the work was conducted ; however , the name " prometheum " was suggested by Grace Mary Coryell , the wife of one of the discoverers . It is derived from Prometheus , the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans and symbolizes " both the daring and the possible misuse of the mankind intellect . " The spelling was then changed to " promethium , " as this was in closer in accordance with other metals . 
 In 1963 , promethium ( III ) fluoride was used to make promethium metal . Provisionally purified from impurities of samarium , neodymium , and americium , it was put into a tantalum crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible ; the outer crucible contained lithium metal ( 10 times excess compared to promethium ) . After creating a vacuum , the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal : 
 <unk> + 3 Li → Pm + 3 LiF 
 The promethium sample produced was used to measure a few of the metal 's properties , such as its melting point . 
 In 1963 , ion @-@ exchange methods were used at ORNL to prepare about ten grams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes . 
 Today , promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission ; it can also be produced by bombarding <unk> with neutrons , turning it into <unk> which decays into <unk> through beta decay with a half @-@ life of 11 days . 
 = = Production = = 
 The production methods for different isotopes vary , and only that for promethium @-@ 147 is given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications . Promethium @-@ 147 is produced in large quantities ( compared to other isotopes ) by bombarding uranium @-@ 235 with thermal neutrons . The output is relatively high , at 2 @.@ 6 % of the total product . Another way to produce promethium @-@ 147 is via neodymium @-@ 147 , which decays to promethium @-@ 147 with a short half @-@ life . <unk> @-@ 147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium @-@ 146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator . Another method is to bombard uranium @-@ 238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission , which , among multiple reaction products , creates promethium @-@ 147 . 
 As early as the 1960s , Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650 grams of promethium per year and was the world 's only large @-@ volume synthesis facility . Gram @-@ scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s , but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor . Currently , Russia is the only country producing promethium @-@ 147 on a relatively large scale . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Most promethium is used only for research purposes , except for promethium @-@ 147 , which can be found outside laboratories . It is obtained as the oxide or chloride , in milligram quantities . This isotope does not emit gamma rays , and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half @-@ life . 
 Some signal lights use a luminous paint , containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium @-@ 147 and emits light . This isotope does not cause aging of the phosphor , as alpha emitters do , and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years . Originally , radium @-@ 226 was used for the purpose , but it was later replaced by promethium @-@ 147 and tritium ( hydrogen @-@ 3 ) . Promethium may be favored over tritium for safety reasons . 
 In atomic batteries , the beta particles emitted by promethium @-@ 147 are converted into electric current by sandwiching a small Pm source between two semiconductor plates . These batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years . The first promethium @-@ based battery was assembled in 1964 and generated " a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about 2 cubic inches , including shielding " . 
 Promethium is also used to measure the thickness of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample . It has possible future uses in portable X @-@ ray sources , and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites ( although the alpha emitter plutonium @-@ 238 has become standard for most space @-@ exploration @-@ related uses ) . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 The element , like other lanthanides , has no biological role . Promethium @-@ 147 can emit X @-@ rays during its beta decay , which are dangerous for all lifeforms . Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium @-@ 147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed . In general , gloves , footwear covers , safety glasses , and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used . 
 It is not known what human organs are affected by interaction with promethium ; a possible candidate is the bone tissues . Sealed promethium @-@ 147 is not dangerous . However , if the packaging is damaged , then promethium becomes dangerous to the environment and humans . If radioactive contamination is found , the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap , but , even though promethium mainly affects the skin , the skin should not be abraded . If a promethium leak is found , the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated , and emergency services must be contacted . No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known . 
 = Zero ( Drakengard ) = 
 Zero ( ゼロ , Zero ) is the main protagonist and playable character of the 2013 action role @-@ playing game Drakengard 3 , the third main entry in the Drakengard series , developed by Access Games and published by Square Enix . She also appeared in the arcade game Lord of Vermilion III . Zero is an Intoner , one of a race of god @-@ like beings who control magic through their singing abilities . In trying to destroy the flower which gave birth to her powers and tried to use her to destroy humanity , she sets out to kill clones spawned by the flower to carry out its mission , referred to as her sisters . 
 Zero was created by Taro Yoko , the game 's director and co @-@ writer , and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka . Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist that had not been featured very often in games . Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series , although he also added features to create a feminine vibe , such as the flower in her eye . Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality , she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists . Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively . 
 = = Creation and design = = 
 Zero was conceived by Taro Yoko , the director and co @-@ writer of Drakengard 3 . While conceiving her , Yoko thought it would be interesting to do a character who had worked in a brothel , as the concept had not been often explored and the Drakengard series offered an opportunity for such a protagonist to be created . This sexual aspect of the character was generally conveyed through dialogue rather than cutscenes . One of the earlier ideas for Zero 's role in the game was to have her as a schoolgirl with a cellphone in a contemporary setting , but this was quickly decided against . Eventually , Yoko decided to create more female characters for Zero to interact with : one of the reasons behind this was that all other possible choices for the game had been rejected . Her number @-@ based name , along with the names of all her sisters , were meant to make it easier for players to identify and distinguish them . Yoko helped write her dialogue to complement the game 's unusual situations , such as rude conversations between her and the disciples during moments of carnage . Multiple aspects of Zero 's character and worldview were incorporated into the game 's theme song " This Silence is Mine " by composers Keiichi Okabe and Onitsuka Chihiro . The choice of Zero 's voice actress was an important part of her design , as the team wanted to both have a good performance and surprise the audience : Maaya Uchida , normally known for gentler female roles in anime and video games , was chosen for the role . 
 Zero was designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka , a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series . His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god @-@ like being , and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance , but as the game 's atmosphere was finalized , Fujisaka redesigned her with some <unk> elements , taking direct influence from the game atmosphere : this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm . The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka 's part . Her color palate was intended as a reverse of Caim , the protagonist of Drakengard . Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal , a key character in the earlier Drakengard games . She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied . Her final design , along with the flower in her eye , emphasized her sexuality . She originally had no flower in her design , but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance . The decision to place it in her eye was to add originality to the character : while the game 's producer <unk> Shiba originally feared it was too much of a risk in conjunction with her gender , Yoko approved of the design . After Zero was finalized , Yoko decided on more female characters , and told Fujisaka to " think Puella Magi Madoka Magica " while designing them . Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners . Her design , along with the rest of the main characters , was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the " medieval " inspiration of previous games . 
 = = Fictional biography = = 
 In Zero 's prequel novella , " A Rain to End and a Flower to Begin " , it is revealed that Zero was abused by her mother and sold into prostitution . Eventually escaping , she grew to live by killing and stealing , with the killing eventually becoming an unconscious instinct . Eventually , she was weakened by a deadly disease and was caught and imprisoned , dying from her illness there . Upon dying , she was revived and turned into an Intoner by a magical flower intent on destroying mankind . Learning the flower 's plans for her , Zero tried to kill herself , but the flower kept her alive , and spawned five clones as a safety measure : these clones were Zero 's " sisters " , who were modeled after five rebels Zero was imprisoned with . The sisters eventually took control of the land from the native warlords . Eventually , Zero decides to kill her sisters , then herself to rid the world of the flower . In the prequel manga Drag @-@ On Dragoon 3 : Utahime Five , told from the point of view of the other Intoners , it is revealed that she is directly responsible for the creation of the Disciples , used by her in an attempt to destroy the Intoners . 
 By the events of Drakengard 3 , Zero had forged a partnership with the dragon Michael : as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners , Michael would help Zero kill her sisters , then kill her to finish off the flower . Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster , with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail . During their second attempt , they attack each one individually : after killing one , Zero takes on their disciple , a servant created to magnify the Intoners ' powers , who each help in battle and act as a personal harem . Before facing One , Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms , releasing them from their servitude . During the battle , both One and Mikhail are killed , then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail @-@ safe in the event of Zero 's victory . 
 Around this central timeline , various " branches " appear , caused by " singularities " , namely Zero , her sisters and the Disciples . During her progression through these branches , Zero is monitored by Accord , one of a race called Recorders charged with monitoring and recording history . In the second branch , while going to kill her sister Three , Zero witnesses the flower driving her sisters insane , with Three dying from poisons in the forest and One being murdered by an unhinged Two . In the ensuing battle , the disciples and Two are killed , then Mikhail is poisoned . Zero uses the flower to form a " pact " with Mikhail , resurrecting him . In the third branch , Mikhail is regressed by the Intoners to a childlike form incapable of properly defending Zero , and Zero 's disciples are killed when Two self @-@ destructs . When Mikhail is killed by One 's dragon , Zero and One do battle and One is killed . Mentally unbalanced by the event , Zero sets off to find another dragon , but it is hinted that she fails . 
 In the fourth branch , Zero manages to kill all of her sisters and absorb their powers , managing to take down One with help from Accord . After absorbing all their powers , she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into . With this , the flower 's magic is sealed away , although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form . In the novel Drag @-@ On Dragoon 3 Story Side , a novel detailing the events leading into Drakengard , a combination of events from other branches occurs . During the final confrontation with One , Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him . After killing One , One 's clone kills Zero .

 Zero has received a mixed to positive reaction from western video game critics . GamesRadar 's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt 's performance in the role , and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her . GameSpot 's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal , enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game 's puzzles and finding that she " related to [ Zero ] as the game progressed , which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters . " Eurogamer 's Chris Schilling found that Zero 's presence turned the game into " a jet @-@ black comedy " , comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort : while both unlikable characters , there was " something magnetic about their <unk> " . Destructoid 's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero , saying " [ he ] was drawn into [ Drakengard 3 's ] world and its cast of characters , and I wanted to see Zero 's journey through from start to finish . " This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt , who called story , characters , world , and in particular Zero , the reasons for playing the game . In addition , he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed . 
 Jim Sterling of The Escapist wrote that Zero 's portrayal , especially her sexual empowerment and the fact that she had dominance over the male characters , was " refreshing " . Capsule Computers ' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is " largely the villain of the series " , but that he felt the need to see her journey through to its end . Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo , while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters , claimed that Zero was " the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch . " Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character , calling her actions , attitudes and language " a nicely self @-@ contained example of how [ Drakengard 3 ] plays with juxtaposition . " Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed , stating " the character designs were fantastic . I loved Zero 's look in particular ; her white <unk> dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons . " RPGFan 's Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as " foul @-@ mouthed butcher " , although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples , calling the latter " strange and often hilarious " . Andrew Barker , in an analysis of the game for RPGFan , referred to her as " violence personified " , noting how the game gradually justified her actions . She was also noted , alongside One , as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple . In a final note , he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game 's fourth branch , where her motives were revealed . Anime News Network 's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action @-@ game protagonists , referring to her as " murderous , foul @-@ mouthed , impulsive , abusive , and all but impossible to like . " 
 In contrast , Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer was not as enthusiastic , saying that while Zero had some good one @-@ liners , " the better efforts are buried in a lot of bad party banter . " RPGamer 's Michael Cunningham found Zero to be an " angry , vulgar woman [ ... ] impatient , aggressive , and easily irritated " , and that the lack of explanation behind Zero 's actions negatively affected the plot . IGN 's Meghan Sullivan was also fairly negative , saying that Zero 's character , interactions and motivation were badly let down by poor writing . USGamer 's Kat Bailey was generally unenthusiastic about Zero 's general attitude and portrayal , saying that she was " characterized in large part by her apparent love of killing and her aggressive bitchiness toward her companion dragon " . Roger Hargreaves for Metro agreed , finding Zero to be a " thoroughly unpleasant and unlikeable main character . " Crunchyroll 's Nate Ming was highly critical of Zero , calling her " a ruthless , backstabbing , front @-@ stabbing , cold @-@ hearted bitch " , and said that she would be the villain in any other game . 
 The character has been positively received by series fans in Japan . In a popularity contest for the characters of Drakengard 3 , Zero came in as the fourth most popular character of the game , with her dragon Mikhail taking first place . In the 2014 Dengeki PlayStation Awards , Zero was placed as the fourth best character of 2013 . Beyond the Drakengard universe , both Zero had her dragon Mikhail appeared in the second sequel to the arcade game Lord of Vermilion .

 = John McCain presidential campaign , 2000 = 
 John McCain , the United States Senator from Arizona , launched his first candidacy for the presidency of the United States in the 2000 presidential election . 
 Announcing his run for the Republican Party nomination in September 1999 , McCain was the main challenger to Texas Governor George W. Bush , who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment . McCain staged an upset win in the February 2000 New Hampshire primary , capitalizing on a message of political reform and " straight talk " that appealed to moderate Republican and independent voters and to the press . McCain 's momentum was halted when Bush won the South Carolina primary later that month , in a contest that became famous for its bitter nature and an underground smear campaign run against McCain . 
 McCain won some subsequent primaries , but after the March 2000 Super Tuesday contests he was well behind in delegates and withdrew . He grudgingly endorsed Bush two months later and made occasional appearances for him during the general election . 
 = = Leading up to the announcement = = 
 McCain was mentioned as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997 , but he took few steps to pursue it , instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re @-@ election . The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain that there might be an opening for him . McCain later wrote that he had a " vague aspiration " of running for president for a long time . He would also be candid about his motivation : " I didn 't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism . In truth , I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president . I was sixty @-@ two years old when I made the decision , and I thought it was my one shot at the prize . " 
 Potential weaknesses of a McCain candidacy included his senatorial accomplishments skewing towards the maverick side rather than those that would appeal to the party core , a lack of funds and of fund @-@ raising prowess , and an unpredictability of personality and temperament . Potential assets included a lot of favorable treatment in the political media , and well as being featured on A & E 's Biography series , and support from veterans . National polls showed McCain with low name recognition , but once voters were asked about a hypothetical candidate with a similar military biography , the numbers improved dramatically . 
 = = Announcements and Kosovo = = 
 McCain had initially planned on announcing his candidacy and beginning active campaigning on April 6 , 1999 . There was to be a four @-@ day roadshow , whose first day would symbolically begin at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , then see early primary states New Hampshire and South Carolina , before concluding in home Phoenix , Arizona with a big audience , marching bands , and thousands of balloons . 
 However , the Kosovo War intervened . On March 24 , the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began . McCain had voted the day before in favor of approval for the Clinton administration 's action , saying " Atrocities are the signature of the Serbian Army . They 've been carrying out atrocities since 1992 . We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic has in mind for Kosovo to continue . We are at a critical hour . " He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter , and within days was urging that the use of ground troops not be ruled out . McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict , and his " We are in it , now we must win it " stance drew much attention . On March 31 , three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia ; the next day , McCain canceled his planned roadshow , stating " this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign . " He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo ; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that , " In thirty @-@ five years in Washington , I have never seen a debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I 've seen this one dominated by John McCain . " 
 On April 13 , McCain simply issued a statement without fanfare that he would be a candidate : " While now is not the time for the celebratory tour I had planned , I am a candidate for president and I will formally kick off my campaign at a more appropriate time . " McCain and his wife Cindy would make some campaign @-@ related appearances over the spring and summer . 
 McCain 's co @-@ authored , best @-@ selling family memoir , Faith of My Fathers , published in August 1999 , helped promote the new start of his campaign . The book garnered largely positive reviews , and McCain went on a 15 @-@ city book tour during September . The tour 's success and the book 's high sales led to the themes of the memoir , which included McCain talking more about his Vietnam prisoner @-@ of @-@ war experience than he had in the past , becoming a major part of McCain 's campaign messaging . 
 McCain finally formally announced his candidacy on September 27 , 1999 before a thousand people in Greeley Park in Nashua , New Hampshire , saying " It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am a candidate for president to the United States . " He further said he was staging " a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve . " As originally planned , he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy .

 McCain 's campaign used many veteran Washington political insiders , including some who had an insurgency @-@ oriented or contrarian mindset . Rick Davis was the campaign manager for the McCain effort , while Mike Murphy was the overall strategist and John Weaver the chief political adviser . Greg Stevens was the media adviser and Mark Salter was the chief speechwriter ( and credited co @-@ author of McCain 's books ) . Howard <unk> was the campaign 's press officer . Craig Turk was the general counsel . 
 After a while , a rivalry formed between Davis , at campaign headquarters , and Weaver and Murphy , who traveled on the campaign bus . Davis wanted a larger role in campaign strategy , and eventually differences between the two factions escalated to attacks made via the press .

 There was a crowded field of Republican candidates , but the big leader in terms of establishment party support and fundraising was Texas Governor and presidential son George W. Bush . Indeed , by the time of McCain 's formal announcement , top @-@ echelon Republican contenders such as Lamar Alexander , John Kasich , and Dan Quayle were already withdrawing from the race due to Bush 's strength . As McCain would later write , " No one thought I had much of a chance , including me . " Four of McCain 's fifty @-@ five fellow Republican senators endorsed his candidacy . 
 The day after McCain announced , Bush made a show of visiting Phoenix and displaying that he , not McCain , had the endorsement of Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull and several other prominent local political figures . McCain did have the support of the rest of the Republican Arizona congressional delegation . Hull would continue to attack McCain during the campaign , and was featured in high @-@ profile Arizona Republic and New York Times stories about McCain 's reputation for having a bad temper , with the latter featuring on @-@ the @-@ record criticism from Governor of Michigan John Engler . By early November , stories about McCain 's temper problem were frequent enough that Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz wrote a survey article about them . Some of McCain 's opponents , including those in or close to the Senate Republican leadership , intimated that McCain 's temper was a sign of mental instability . The notion that this was due to McCain 's POW days caused Admiral James Stockdale , a fellow former POW and 1992 vice @-@ presidential candidate for Ross Perot , to write an op @-@ ed piece for The New York Times , " John McCain in the Crucible " . In it , Stockdale said that the reverse was true : that the experience of resisting during the POW experience made former POWs more emotionally stable in later life , not less . In early December , McCain released some 1 @,@ 500 pages of his medical and psychiatric records , which showed several psychiatric evaluations over a number of years following his POW release that indicated no signs of lingering mental or emotional difficulty from that period . 
 Bush avoided most of the scheduled Republican Party debates during 1999 , including one held on November 21 at Arizona State University in McCain 's home state . There McCain debated second @-@ tier candidates Alan Keyes , Orrin Hatch , and Steve Forbes instead . Bush finally did participate in the December 6 debate from the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix , by which time McCain was so busy campaigning in New Hampshire that he had to join via a video linkup . There McCain 's signature push for campaign finance reform led to one of the few lively exchanges in an otherwise placid event . 
 Following political consultant Mike Murphy 's advice , McCain decided to skip the initial event of the nomination season , the Iowa caucus , where his long opposition to ethanol subsidies would be unpopular and his late start and lack of base party support would hurt him in the grassroots organizing necessary for success in the state . ( He had earlier skipped the August 1999 Iowa Straw Poll , labeling it a sham . ) McCain focused on introducing his biographical story , especially his Vietnam and POW experiences ; a videocassette telling the story was sent to 50 @,@ 000 voters in the first two primary states , as well as to military veterans in other states . 
 = = Caucuses and primaries 2000 = = 
 = = = New Hampshire = = = 
 By skipping Iowa , McCain was able to focus instead on the New Hampshire primary , where his message held appeal to independents and where Bush 's father had never been very popular . At first , McCain attracted small crowds and little media attention . But by November 1999 , McCain had become competitive , measuring evenly with Bush in polls . Bush said he realized McCain was a strong candidate there : " If I had to guess why Senator McCain is doing well , it 's people respect him and so do I. He 's a good man . " 
 McCain traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express , whose name capitalized on his reputation as a political maverick who would speak his mind . In visits to towns he gave a ten @-@ minute talk focused on campaign reform issues , then announced he would stay until he answered every question that everyone had . He pledged that " I will never tell you a lie . " He conducted 114 of these town hall meetings , speaking in every town in New Hampshire in an example of " retail politics " that overcame Bush 's familiar name . His growing number of supporters became known as " <unk> " . 
 McCain was famously accessible to the press , using free media to compensate for his lack of funds . As one reporter later recounted , " McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus ; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn 't have , and that 's why the media loved him . " Some McCain aides saw the senator as naturally preferring the company of reporters to other politicians . 
 McCain and Bush argued over their proposals for tax cuts ; McCain criticized Bush 's plan as too large and too beneficial to the wealthy . McCain preferred a smaller cut that would allocate more of the surplus towards the solvency of Social Security and Medicare . McCain pushed his signature issue of campaign finance reform , and was the only candidate to talk much about foreign policy and defense issues . 
 On February 1 , 2000 , McCain won the primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush 's 30 percent , and suddenly was the celebrity of the hour . Other Republican candidates had dropped out or failed to gain traction , and McCain became Bush 's only serious opponent . Analysts predicted that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his insurgency campaign unstoppable momentum ; a degree of fear and panic crept into not only the Bush campaign but also the Republican establishment and movement conservatism . Bush 's top campaign staff met and strategized what to do about McCain ; one advisor said , " We gotta hit him hard . " 
 = = = South Carolina = = = 
 The battle between Bush and McCain for South Carolina has entered American political lore as one of the nastiest , dirtiest , and most brutal ever . On the one hand , Bush switched his label for himself from " compassionate conservative " to " reformer with results " , as part of trying to co @-@ opt McCain 's popular message of reform . On the other hand , a variety of business and interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past now pounded him with negative ads . 
 The day that a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state , Bush allied himself on stage with a marginal and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch , who accused McCain of having " abandoned the veterans " on POW / MIA and Agent Orange issues : " He came home from Vietnam and forgot us . " Incensed , McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton , which Bush complained was " about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary . " An unidentified party began a semi @-@ underground smear campaign against McCain , delivered by push polls , faxes , e @-@ mails , flyers , audience plants , and the like . These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock ( the McCains ' dark @-@ skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh ; this misrepresentation was thought to be an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central ) , but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict , that he was a homosexual , and that he was a " Manchurian Candidate " traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days . The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks ; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls . During a break in a debate , Bush put his hand on McCain 's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks ; McCain replied , " Don 't give me that shit . And take your hands off me . " 
 Bush mobilized the state 's evangelical voters , and leading conservative broadcaster Rush Limbaugh entered the fray supporting Bush and going on at length about how McCain was a favorite of liberal Democrats . Polls swung in Bush 's favor ; by not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign , Bush was not limited in how much money he could spend on advertisements , while McCain was near his limit . With three days to go , McCain shut down his negative ads against Bush and tried to stress a positive image . But McCain 's stressing of campaign finance reform , and how Bush 's proposed tax cuts would benefit the wealthy , did not appeal to core Republicans in the state . 
 McCain lost South Carolina on February 19 , with 42 percent of the vote against Bush 's 53 percent , allowing Bush to regain the momentum . 
 = = = On to Super Tuesday = = = 
 McCain 's campaign never completely recovered from his defeat in South Carolina . He did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan on February 22 , mocking Governor Hull 's opposition in the former . In Michigan , which he won 50 percent to 43 percent in an upset , he captured many Democratic and independent votes , who combined made up over half of the primary electorate . 
 Still reeling from his South Carolina experience , McCain made a February 28 speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders , including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , as divisive ; McCain declared , " ... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community . But that does not mean that we will pander to their self @-@ appointed leaders . " He also made an off @-@ the @-@ cuff , unserious remark on the Straight Talk Express that referred to Robertson and Falwell as " forces of evil " , that came across as angry hostility to many Christian conservatives . McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29 , as well as one in Washington . 
 McCain had stated in mid @-@ February that " I hate the gooks " , in reference to his captors during the Vietnam War . This use gained some media attention in California , which had a large Asian American population . After criticism from some in that community , McCain vowed to no longer use the term , saying , " I will continue to condemn those who unfairly mistreated us . But out of respect to a great number of people for whom I hold in very high regard , I will no longer use the term that has caused such discomfort . " Reaction among Vietnamese Americans to McCain 's use of this term was mixed although supportive of McCain himself , and exit polls in the primary in California showed that they strongly supported him . This was not the first or the last example of controversial remarks by McCain . 
 A week later on March 7 , 2000 , he lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush , including large states such as California , New York , Ohio , and Georgia ; McCain 's wins were confined to the New England states of Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut and Vermont . His overall loss on that day has been attributed to his going " off message " , ineffectively accusing Bush of being anti @-@ Catholic due to having visited Bob Jones University and getting into a verbal battle with leaders of the Religious Right . Throughout the campaign , McCain had achieved parity with Bush among self @-@ identified Republicans only in the northeastern states ; in most of the rest of the country , Bush ran way well ahead of McCain among Republicans , enough to overcome McCain 's strength among independents and Democrats . With little hope of overcoming Bush 's delegate lead after Super Tuesday , McCain withdrew from the race on March 9 , 2000 . 
 = = General election = = 
 Following the end of his campaign , McCain returned to the Senate , where he was welcomed with respect for the effort he had made , his openness in the campaign , and for the attacks he had undergone . Other Republicans sought out his endorsement in their general election races . In the Senate , McCain continued his push for campaign finance reform . The question of whether McCain would endorse Bush remained uncertain . 
 The events of South Carolina stayed with McCain . In an interview during this time , McCain would say of the rumor spreaders , " I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those , " and in another interview he called the rumor spreaders " the ugly underside of politics . " McCain regretted some aspects of his own campaign there as well , in particular changing his stance on flying the Confederate flag at the state capitol from a " very offensive " " symbol of racism and slavery " to " a symbol of heritage " . He would later write , " I feared that if I answered honestly , I could not win the South Carolina primary . So I chose to compromise my principles . " He had done so woodenly , reading his revised statement from a piece of paper . According to one report , the South Carolina experience overall left McCain in a " very dark place . " 
 McCain finally did announce he would campaign for Bush , in a joint appearance with him on May 9 , but did not use the actual word " endorse " until reporters pressed him to do so . The Guardian characterized the endorsement as " tepid " and said that McCain " betrayed little outward enthusiasm " during the appearance , while The New York Times wrote that " there was a tight , grudging quality to the event , " and that McCain had been " looking a bit like a teenager forced to attend a classical music concert . " McCain also made it clear that he was not interested in a vice @-@ presidential nomination . 
 When the 2000 Republican National Convention began in Philadelphia at the end of July , McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and supporters before formally releasing them to Bush . There were tears from McCain , his wife Cindy , and some of the campaign staff and delegates . Many of McCain 's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush , and the Times wrote that , " Politics as usual with its compromises , cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend . " McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention , not his antagonist Governor Hull . On August 1 , the second night of the convention , McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush , in particular trying to solidify Bush 's national security and foreign policy credentials . In it , McCain connected his family to Bush 's , making reference to former President George H. W. Bush 's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain , Sr. , McCain 's grandfather . He said directly of the nominee , " I support him . I am grateful to him . And I am proud of him . " The Almanac of American Politics called it " a moving , elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key . " 
 McCain 's plans to campaign for Bush in fall 2000 were delayed later in August by a recurrence of melanoma . This Stage IIa instance on his temple required extensive surgery that removed the lesion , surrounding lymph nodes , and part of the parotid gland . The final pathology tests showed that the melanoma had not spread , and his prognosis was good , but McCain was left with cosmetic aftereffects including a puffy cheek and a scar down his neck . 
 McCain did join Bush for a few days of appearances in late October , emphasizing , in the wake of the October 12 USS Cole bombing , his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats . Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying , " The tension was palpable . The two were cordial , but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together . " McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates , and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands . McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 ( although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not ) . When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute , McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship , though he did appear on CBS ' Face the Nation to say , " I think the nation is growing a little weary of this . We 're not in a constitutional crisis , but the American people are growing weary , and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate , to say the least . " Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001 , McCain 's battles with him would resume , with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000 .

 = = = South Carolina investigated and revisited = = = 
 While South Carolina was known for legendary hard @-@ knuckled political consultant Lee Atwater and rough elections , this had been more : Michael Graham , a native writer , radio host , and political operative , would say " I have worked on hundreds of campaigns in South Carolina , and I 've never seen anything as ugly as that campaign . " In subsequent years there would be persistent accounts trying to tie the anti @-@ McCain smears to high levels of the Bush campaign : the 2003 book Bush 's Brain would use it to build up their " evil genius " depiction of Bush chief strategist Karl Rove , while a 2008 PBS NOW program showed a local political consultant stating that Warren Tompkins , a Lee Atwater protégé and then Bush chief strategist for the state , was responsible . In contrast , in 2004 National Review 's Byron York would try to debunk many of the South Carolina smear reports as unfounded legend . McCain 's campaign manager said in 2004 they never found out where the smear attacks came from , while McCain himself never doubted their existence . 
 When McCain ran for president again in 2008 , South Carolina again proved crucial , in his battle with former Governors Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee and former Senator Fred Thompson . This time , McCain had the support of much of the state Republican establishment , although Rush Limbaugh and other talk radio figures were still lambasting him , and aggressively moved to thwart any smear campaign before it got started . McCain won the primary on January 19 , 2008 ; in his victory remarks to supporters that evening , he said , " It took us awhile , but what 's eight years among friends ? " The New York Times described McCain 's win as " exorcising the ghosts of the attack @-@ filled primary here that derailed his presidential hopes eight years ago . "

 = 104th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 104th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army . Today , it is known as the 104th Division ( Leader Training ) and based at Fort Lewis , Washington , as a training unit of the United States Army Reserve . 
 Activated in 1921 , the division was created as an infantry unit with a focus on nighttime combat operations . Deployed during World War II , the division saw almost 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe as it fought through France , Belgium , and western Germany , fighting back several fierce German counterattacks as it advanced through the theater throughout late 1944 and 1945 . This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history . At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 ( V @-@ E Day ) , this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from the Soviet Army . 
 After World War II , this division was reorganized primarily as a training division for Reserve forces . After several decades , the division then expanded its role to conducting entry @-@ level training for soldiers of all branches of the Army in the northwestern United States . Its role and size have expanded over that time due to consolidation of other training commands , and the division subsequently took charge of a number of brigades specializing in various entry @-@ level training for soldiers of all types . 
 = = History = = 
 The 104th Infantry Division was first constituted on 24 June 1921 as the 104th Division , before being organized and activated in October of that year in Salt Lake City , Utah . Assigned to the division were the 207th and 208th Infantry Brigades , containing the 413th , 414th , 415th , and <unk> Infantry Regiments . As a unit of the Organized Reserves , the division represented assets from the states of Montana , Wyoming , Idaho , Utah , and Nevada . In 1924 it received its shoulder sleeve insignia . The division would not see significant duty until World War II . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II , the 104th Infantry Division began preparing to participate in the war in Europe . The division was ordered into active military service on 15 September 1942 and reorganized as the 104th Infantry Division at Camp Adair , Oregon . The 207th and 208th Brigades did not reactivate as part of an army @-@ wide elimination of brigade commands within its divisions . The division was instead centered on three infantry regiments ; the 413th Infantry Regiment , the 414th Infantry Regiment , and the 415th Infantry Regiment . Also assigned to the division were the 385th , 386th , <unk> and 929th Field Artillery Battalions , as well as the 104th Signal Company , the 804th Ordnance Company , the 104th Quartermaster Company , the 104th Reconnaissance Troop , the 329th Engineer Battalion , the 329th Medical Battalion , and the 104th Counter Intelligence Detachment . From that point it began training as a division in preparation for deployment to Europe . The division trained in the northwestern United States during the next two years , earning its name " <unk> Division " from its time in the area . The division was the first army division to train specifically for fighting in nighttime conditions . After training at Camp Adair , the division participation in the Oregon Maneuver combat exercise in the fall of 1943 .

 The 104th Infantry Division sailed for Europe on 27 August 1944 . It landed in France on 7 September 1944 . In early October , Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen , Sr. took command of the division . He would command the division during most of its time in combat . The division was assigned to III Corps of the Ninth United States Army , part of the Twelfth United States Army Group . The division then organized and assembled at Manche , France before heading into combat . 
 Joining the Battle of Hürtgen Forest , the division moved into defensive positions in the vicinity of <unk> , Belgium on 23 October 1944 . The Timberwolves were then assigned to British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery 's Anglo @-@ Canadian 21st Army Group under the British I Corps , along with the U.S. 7th Armored Division , in order to clear out the Scheldt Estuary and open the port of Antwerp . While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation , the 104th Infantry Division was to assist the First Canadian Army in the taking of the Scheldt . The Timberwolves traveled across France by train and debarked near the Belgian @-@ Dutch border and waited for word to attack , taking the place of the experienced British 49th Infantry Division on the left flank and the Polish 1st Armored Division on the right . 
 The Americans were given responsibility for taking 22 miles of wet , low country from the Belgian border to the Maas River . The width of their front was approximately 8 @,@ 000 yards . General Allen planned to employ all three of his regiments at the same time , shoulder to shoulder . The 104th began combat operations on 25 and 26 October , and began to attack the Germans , who offered varying levels of resistance . Along the division 's front , the Germans were spread thinly and did not have continuous lines of defense . However , they did possess deadly strong points , and endeavored to make the Timberwolves ' progress as time consuming and costly as possible , making heavy use of mines , booby traps , and roadblocks . Despite this , advance was steady , though paid for in the lives of the 104th Division soldiers . Conditions were rainy , chilly , wet and muddy . Moisture seemed to grip everything and everyone . Sleet beat down on the troops , who went for days soaked to the skin and slimy with mud . On 30 October , after five days of continuous operations the division had pushed about 15 miles to within sight of the Mark River and had liberated Zundert , gained control of the Breda @-@ Roosendaal Road , and overrun the Vaart Canal defenses . <unk> and Etten fell as the division advanced to the Mark River , arriving there by 31 October . A coordinated attack over the Mark River at <unk> on 2 November established a bridgehead and the rest of the division crossed the river . With the Allies firmly on the north side of the Mark River , German resistance collapsed . For the next two days , the Timberwolves pursued enemy remnants north to the Maas River . <unk> was captured and the Maas River was reached on 5 November . That same day , General Allen received orders from the U.S. First Army , releasing it from British control . While the bulk of the division moved near Aachen , Germany , elements remained to secure Moerdijk until 7 November , when they were relieved . During this time , the division was reassigned to VII Corps of the U.S. 1st Army , also part of the Twelfth Army Group . By 7 November , the fighting in the Netherlands cost the Timberwolves 1 @,@ 426 casualties , including 313 killed and 103 missing . Montgomery and the Canadian commanders sent their congratulations , and General Allen disseminated copies of their letters to his regiments and wrote a personal letter of thanks to everyone in the division , concluding with his favorite motto , " Nothing in Hell must stop the Timberwolves ! " As a result of the actions of the 104th and their Allied counterparts , the Scheldt Estuary was cleared . The Royal Navy took three weeks to sweep the estuary waters clear of mines , and in early December 1944 , the port of Antwerp was open to Allied shipping . 
 While under American command on 16 November 1944 , the division went on another offensive , taking Stolberg and pushing on against heavy resistance . <unk> fell on 21 November and the enemy was cleared from the area west of the <unk> River , including Inden by 2 December 1944 . <unk> was held against enemy counterattacks on 3 December , and all strongholds west of the Roer River were captured by the 23rd . It took temporary command of the 60th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division . During the Battle of the Bulge , the 104th actively defended its sector near Duren and <unk> from 15 December 1944 to 22 February 1945 . During that time , it was reassigned to XIX Corps of the Ninth United States Army . It then moved across the Roer taking <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> , and North Duren . On 5 March , after heavy fighting , it entered Köln . After defending the west bank of the Rhine River , the division crossed the river at <unk> on 22 March 1945 , and attacked to the east of the Remagen bridgehead . During this time , some of the division 's assets fell under command of the 1st Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division . After a period of mopping up and consolidation , it participated in the trap of enemy troops in the Ruhr pocket . The 104th repulsed heavy attacks near <unk> and captured Paderborn on 1 April 1945 . After regrouping , it advanced to the east and crossed the Weser River on 8 April , blocking enemy exits from the Harz Mountains . The division then crossed the Saale River and took Halle in a bitter five @-@ day struggle from 15 to 19 April . The sector to the <unk> River was cleared by 21 April , and after vigorous patrolling , contacted the Red Army at <unk> on 26 April . The division took temporary command of assets from the 69th Infantry Division in early May .

 The division returned to the United States on 3 July 1945 . Upon return , it continued the process of demobilization until 20 December of that year , when it was inactivated . The division suffered 1 @,@ 294 killed in action , 5 @,@ 305 wounded in action , 385 missing in action , and 27 prisoners of war .

 During World War II , soldiers of the division were awarded two Medals of Honor , 14 Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , 642 Silver Star Medals , six Legion of Merit medals , 20 Soldier 's Medals , 2 @,@ 797 Bronze Star Medals , and 40 Air Medals . The division received 9 Distinguished Unit Citations and three campaign streamers during 200 days of combat . 
 = = = Training Division = = = 
 The division was reactivated on 1 December 1946 in the organized reserves in Portland , Oregon . It began taking on the responsibility of holding training programs for new soldiers of the US Army Reserve . In July 1948 , the division held its first session of summer training . By the end of the training , it had turned out 300 new reservists . By 1952 , the division was turning out 1 @,@ 500 new reservists per training camp . The division was reorganized specifically as a training division in 1959 . In 1961 , the division was relocated to Vancouver Barracks , Washington . 
 In 1967 , the division was reorganized . As part of an army wide initiative known as the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan , the division 's regiments were disbanded and replaced with larger and more versatile brigades . The 1st Brigade , 104th Division , activated at Vancouver Barracks , and the 2nd Brigade , 104th Division activated at Pasco , Washington . Meanwhile , the 3rd Brigade , 104th Division , as well as the 4th Brigade , 104th Division both activated at Fort Lawton , Washington . Each of these brigades carried the history of other historic units which fought under the 104th Infantry Division in World War II . The 104th Division was then assigned the mission of conducting One Station Unit Training , Basic Combat Training , Advanced Individual Training , and Combat Support training . 1st Brigade took on basic combat training , while 3rd Brigade undertook combat support training , 4th Brigade conducted combat service support training . 
 In 1996 , three more brigades were added to the division 's structure . The 5th Brigade , 104th Division was activated at Salt Lake City , Utah . The 6th Brigade , 104th Division was activated at Aurora , Colorado . The 7th Brigade , 104th Division activated at Vancouver , Washington . The 5th Brigade conducted health services training , 6th Brigade took charge of professional development training and 7th Brigade provided training support to the other brigades . These units were redesignated from other training commands and put under the command of the division . 
 Two additional provisional brigades were created under the 104th Division in 1999 ; the 8th Brigade , 104th Division was created at Fort Lewis as a unit for training Reserve Officers ' Training Corps cadets , and the <unk> US Army Reserve Forces School at Fort Shafter , Hawaii was redesignated as the <unk> Brigade , 104th Division , for service as a multifunctional training unit . In 2005 , the Base Realignment and Closure suggestions included the closure of the Vancouver Barracks , and the 104th Division was subsequently relocated to Fort Lewis , Washington . In 2005 , the current Distinctive Unit Insignia was designed under the direction of Major General Terrill K. ( TK ) Moffett . The 104th received its new distinctive unit insignia in 2006 . 
 In October 2007 , the division was renamed the 104th Division ( Leader Training ) . This change reflected a change in the division 's mission , specifically training officer and non @-@ commissioned officer candidates in their assigned fields .

Deane , Jr. and Bryant Moore . In addition , actor James G. Snitzer was a member of the 104th and died in combat in 1945 . NFL Player Bob Shaw also served with the 104th and was awarded the Bronze Star during World War II . 
 In addition , two soldiers from this division were awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in combat . They are Willy F.

 = Heraclius = 
 Heraclius ( Latin : Flavius Heraclius Augustus , Greek : Φλάβιος <unk> , Armenian : <unk> <unk> , c . 575 – February 11 , 641 ) was Byzantine Emperor from 610 to 641 . 
 He was responsible for introducing Greek as the Eastern Empire 's official language . His rise to power began in 608 , when he and his father , Heraclius the Elder , the exarch of Africa , led a revolt against the unpopular usurper Phocas . 
 Heraclius 's reign was marked by several military campaigns . The year Heraclius came to power , the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers . Heraclius immediately took charge of the Byzantine – Sassanid War of 602 – 628 . The first battles of the campaign ended in defeat for the Byzantines ; the Persian army fought their way to the Bosphorus but Constantinople was protected by impenetrable walls and a strong navy and Heraclius was able to avoid total defeat . Soon after , he initiated reforms to rebuild and strengthen the military . Heraclius drove the Persians out of Asia Minor and pushed deep into their territory , defeating them decisively in 627 at the Battle of Nineveh . The Persian king Khosrau II was overthrown and executed by his son Kavadh II , who soon sued for a peace treaty , agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory . This way peaceful relations were restored to the two deeply strained empires . 
 Heraclius soon experienced a new event , the Muslim conquests . Emerging from the Arabian Peninsula , the Muslims quickly conquered the Sassanid empire . In 634 the Muslims marched into Roman Syria , defeating Heraclius ' brother Theodore . Within a short period of time , the Arabs conquered Mesopotamia , Armenia and Egypt . 
 Heraclius entered diplomatic relations with the Croats and Serbs in the Balkans . He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church in regard to the Monophysites , by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism . The Church of the East ( commonly called Nestorian ) was also involved in the process . Eventually , however , this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Heraclius was the eldest son of Heraclius the Elder and <unk> , of an Armenian family from Cappadocia , probably of Arsacid descent . Beyond that , there is little specific information known about his ancestry . His father was a key general during Emperor Maurice 's war with <unk> Chobin , usurper of the Sassanid Empire , during 590 . After the war , Maurice appointed Heraclius the Elder to the position of Exarch of Africa . 
 = = = Revolt against Phocas and accession = = = 
 In 608 , Heraclius the Elder renounced his loyalty to the Emperor Phocas , who had overthrown Maurice six years earlier . The rebels issued coins showing both <unk> dressed as consuls , though neither of them explicitly claimed the imperial title at this time . Heraclius ' younger cousin Nicetas launched an overland invasion of Egypt ; by 609 , he had defeated Phocas ' general <unk> and secured the province . Meanwhile , the younger Heraclius sailed eastward with another force via Sicily and Cyprus . 
 As he approached Constantinople , he made contact with prominent leaders and planned an attack to overthrow aristocrats in the city , and soon arranged a ceremony where he was crowned and acclaimed as Emperor . When he reached the capital , the Excubitors , an elite Imperial Guard unit led by Phocas ' son @-@ in @-@ law Priscus , deserted to Heraclius , and he entered the city without serious resistance . When Heraclius captured Phocas , he asked him , " Is this how you have ruled , wretch ? " Phocas said in reply , " And will you rule better ? " With that , Heraclius became so enraged that he beheaded Phocas on the spot . He later had the genitalia removed from the body because Phocas had raped the wife of Photius , a powerful politician in the city . 
 On October 5 , 610 , Heraclius was crowned for a second time , this time in the Chapel of St. Stephen within the Great Palace ; at the same time he married Fabia , who took the name Eudokia . After her death in 612 , he married his niece Martina in 613 ; this second marriage was considered incestuous and was very unpopular . In the reign of Heraclius ' two sons , the divisive Martina was to become the center of power and political intrigue . Despite widespread hatred for Martina in Constantinople , Heraclius took her on campaigns with him and refused attempts by Patriarch Sergius to prevent and later dissolve the marriage . 
 = = Byzantine @-@ Sassanid War of 602 – 628 = = 
 = = = Initial Persian advantage = = = 
 During his Balkan Campaigns , Emperor Maurice and his family were murdered by Phocas in November 602 after a mutiny . Khosrau II ( Chosroes ) of the Sassanid Empire had been restored to his throne by Maurice , and they had remained allies . Thus , the Persian King Khosrau II seized the pretext to attack the Byzantine Empire and reconquer the Byzantine province of Mesopotamia . Khosrau had at his court a man who claimed to be Maurice 's son Theodosius , and Khosrau demanded that the Byzantines accept this Theodosius as Emperor . 
 The war initially went the Persians ' way , partly because of Phocas ' brutal repression and the succession crisis that ensued as the general Heraclius sent his nephew Nicetas to attack Egypt , enabling his son Heraclius the younger to claim the throne in 610 . Phocas , an unpopular ruler who is invariably described in historical sources as a " tyrant " ( in its original meaning of the word , i.e. illegitimate king by the rules of succession ) , was eventually deposed by Heraclius , who sailed to Constantinople from Carthage with an icon affixed to the prow of his ship . 
 By this time , the Persians had conquered Mesopotamia and the Caucasus , and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia . A major counter @-@ attack led by Heraclius two years later was decisively defeated outside Antioch by Shahrbaraz and Shahin , and the Roman position collapsed ; the Persians devastated parts of Asia Minor and captured Chalcedon across from Constantinople on the Bosporus . Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt ( by mid @-@ 621 the whole province was in their hands ) and to devastate Anatolia , while the Avars and Slavs took advantage of the situation to overrun the Balkans , bringing the Empire to the brink of destruction . In 613 , the Persian army took Damascus with the help of the Jews , seized Jerusalem in 614 , damaging the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and capturing the True Cross , and afterwards capturing Egypt in 617 or 618 . 
 With the Persians at the very gate of Constantinople , Heraclius thought of abandoning the city and moving the capital to Carthage , but the powerful church figure Patriarch Sergius convinced him to stay . Safe behind the walls of Constantinople , Heraclius was able to sue for peace in exchange for an annual tribute of a thousand talents of gold , a thousand talents of silver , a thousand silk robes , a thousand horses , and a thousand virgins to the Persian King . The peace allowed him to rebuild the Empire 's army by slashing non @-@ military expenditure , devaluing the currency , and melting down , with the backing of Patriarch Sergius , Church treasures to raise the necessary funds to continue the war . 
 = = = Byzantine counter @-@ offensive and resurgence = = = 
 On April 5 , 622 , Heraclius left Constantinople , entrusting the city to Sergius and general Bonus as regents of his son . He assembled his forces in Asia Minor , probably in Bithynia , and , after he revived their broken morale , he launched a new counter @-@ offensive , which took on the character of a holy war ; an <unk> image of Christ was carried as a military standard . 
 The Roman army proceeded to Armenia , inflicted a defeat on an army led by a Persian @-@ allied Arab chief , and then won a victory over the Persians under Shahrbaraz . Heraclius would stay on campaign for several years . On March 25 , 624 he again left Constantinople with his wife , Martina , and his two children ; after he celebrated Easter in Nicomedia on April 15 , he campaigned in the Caucasus , winning a series of victories in Armenia against Khosrau and his generals Shahrbaraz , Shahin , and Shahraplakan . However , in the same year the Visigoths succeeded in recapturing Cartagena , capital of the western Byzantine province of Spania , resulting in the loss of one of the few minor provinces that had been conquered by the armies of Justinian I. In 626 the Avars and Slavs supported by a Persian army commanded by Shahrbaraz , besieged Constantinople , but the siege ended in failure ( the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin which were led in procession by Sergius about the walls of the city ) , while a second Persian army under Shahin suffered another crushing defeat at the hands of Heraclius ' brother Theodore . 
 With the Persian war effort disintegrating , Heraclius was able to bring the Gokturks of the Western Turkic Khaganate , Ziebel , who invaded Persian Transcaucasia . Heraclius exploited divisions within the Persian Empire , keeping the Persian general Shahrbaraz neutral by convincing him that Khosrau had grown jealous of him and had ordered his execution . Late in 627 he launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia , where , despite the desertion of his Turkish allies , he defeated the Persians under <unk> at the Battle of Nineveh . Continuing south along the Tigris he sacked Khosrau 's great palace at Dastagird and was only prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the Nahrawan Canal . Discredited by this series of disasters , Khosrau was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II , who at once sued for peace , agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories . In 629 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in a majestic ceremony . 
 Heraclius took for himself the ancient Persian title of " King of Kings " after his victory over Persia . Later on , starting in 629 , he styled himself as Basileus , the Greek word for " sovereign " , and that title was used by the Roman Emperors for the next 800 years . The reason Heraclius chose this title over previous Roman terms such as Augustus has been attributed by some scholars as relating to his Armenian origins . 
 Heraclius ' defeat of the Persians ended a war that had been going on intermittently for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire . Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne , plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war . Ardashir III , Heraclius ' ally Shahrbaraz , and Khosrau 's daughters <unk> and <unk> all succeeded to the throne within months of each other . Only when Yazdgerd III , a grandson of Khosrau II , succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability . But by then the <unk> Empire was severely disorganised and had been severely weakened by years of war and civil strife over the succession to the throne . 
 However , the Byzantine victory was ultimately a pyrrhic one , as the devastating impact of the war left the Byzantines in much weakened state . Within a few years both empires were overwhelmed by the onslaught of the Arabs who had become newly united by Islam , ultimately leading to the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 and the fall of the Sassanid dynasty in 651 . 
 = = War against the Arabs = = 
 In 629 , the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had recently succeeded in unifying all of the nomadic tribes of the Arabian Peninsula . Those tribes had previously been too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians . Now unified and animated by their new conversion to Islam , they comprised one of the most powerful states in the region . The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the Battle of Mu 'tah in September 629 . A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of Arabia in response to their ambassador 's murder at the hands of the Ghassanid Roman governor , but were repulsed . Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory , there was no apparent reason to make changes to the military configuration of the region . Also , the Byzantines had little preceding battlefield experience with the Arabs , and even less with zealous soldiers united by a prophet . Even the <unk> of Maurice , a manual of war praised for the variety of enemies it covers , does not mention warfare against Arabs at any length . 
 The following year the Muslims launched an offensive into the Arabah south of Lake Tiberias , taking Al Karak . Other raids penetrated into the Negev reaching as far as Gaza . The Battle of Yarmouk in 636 resulted in a crushing defeat for the larger Byzantine army ; within three years , the Levant had been lost again . By the time of Heraclius ' death in Constantinople , on February 11 , 641 , most of Egypt had fallen as well . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Looking back at the reign of Heraclius , scholars have credited him with many accomplishments . He enlarged the Empire , and his reorganization of the government and military were great successes . His attempts at religious harmony failed , but he succeeded in returning the True Cross , one of the holiest Christian relics , to Jerusalem . 
 = = = Accomplishments = = = 
 Although the territorial gains produced by his defeat of the Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims , Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors . His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocas ' reign , and he reorganized the military with great success . Ultimately , the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in Asia Minor and held on to Carthage for another 60 years , saving a core from which the empire 's strength could be rebuilt . 
 The recovery of the eastern areas of the Roman Empire from the Persians once again raised the problem of religious unity centering on the understanding of the true nature of Christ . Most of the inhabitants of these provinces were Monophysites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon . Heraclius tried to promote a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism ; however , this philosophy was rejected as heretical by both sides of the dispute . For this reason , Heraclius was viewed as a heretic and bad ruler by some later religious writers . After the Monophysite provinces were finally lost to the Muslims , <unk> rather lost its raison d 'être and was eventually abandoned . 
 One of the most important legacies of Heraclius was changing the official language of the Empire from Latin to Greek in 620 . The Croats and Serbs of Byzantine Dalmatia initiated diplomatic relations and dependencies with Heraclius . The Serbs , who briefly lived in Macedonia , became foederati and were baptized at the request of Heraclius ( before 626 ) . At his request , Pope John IV ( 640 – 642 ) sent Christian teachers and missionaries to Duke <unk> and his Croats , who practiced Slavic paganism . He also created the office of sakellarios , a comptroller of the treasury . 
 Up to the 20th century he was credited with establishing the Thematic system but modern scholarship now points more to the 660s , under Constans II . 
 Edward Gibbon in his work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire wrote : 
 Of the characters conspicuous in history , that of Heraclius is one of the most extraordinary and inconsistent . In the first and last years of a long reign , the emperor appears to be the slave of sloth , of pleasure , or of superstition , the careless and impotent spectator of the public calamities . But the languid mists of the morning and evening are separated by the brightness of the meridian sun ; the Arcadius of the palace arose the Caesar of the camp ; and the honor of Rome and Heraclius was gloriously retrieved by the exploits and trophies of six adventurous campaigns . [ ... ] Since the days of Scipio and Hannibal , no bolder enterprise has been attempted than that which Heraclius achieved for the deliverance of the empire . 
 = = = Recovery of the True Cross = = = 
 Heraclius was long remembered favourably in the Western church for his reputed feat in recovering the True Cross , which had been captured by the Persians . As Heraclius approached the capital , Khosrau fled from his favourite residence , Dastagird near Baghdad , without offering resistance . Meanwhile , some of the Persian grandees freed his eldest son Kavadh II , whom Khosrau II had imprisoned , and proclaimed him King on the night of 23 – 24 February , 628 . Kavadh however was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir . So , as a goodwill gesture , he sent the True Cross with a peace negotiator to sue for peace in 628 . 
 After a tour of the Empire Heraclius returned the cross on March 21 , 629 or 630 . For Christians of the Western Medieval Europe , Heraclius was the " first crusader " . The iconography of the emperor appeared in the sanctuary at Mont Saint @-@ Michel ( ca . 1060 ) , and then it became popular especially in France , Italian Peninsula and Holy Roman Empire . The story was included in the Golden Legend , the famous 13th century compendium of hagiography , and he is sometimes shown in art , as in The History of the True Cross sequence of frescoes painted by Piero della Francesca in Arezzo , and a similar sequence on a small altarpiece by Adam <unk> ( <unk> , Frankfurt ) . Both of these show scenes of Heraclius and Constantine I 's mother Saint Helena , traditionally responsible for the excavation of the cross . The scene usually shown is Heraclius carrying the cross ; according to the Golden Legend he insisted on doing this as he entered Jerusalem , against the advice of the Patriarch . At first , when he was on horseback ( shown above ) , the burden was too heavy , but after he dismounted and removed his crown it became miraculously light , and the barred city gate opened of its own accord . 
 Probably because he was one of the few Eastern Roman Emperors widely known in the West , the Late Antique Colossus of Barletta was considered to depict Heraclius . 
 = = = = Opposing view : returned relic a fake = = = = 
 Some scholars disagree with this narrative , Professor Constantin Zuckerman going as far as to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost , and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake . In his analysis , the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe , recently turned ally and co @-@ father @-@ in @-@ law , Persian general and soon @-@ to @-@ become king , Shahrvaraz . 
 = = = Islamic view of Heraclius = = = 
 In Surah 30 , the Qur 'an refers to the Roman @-@ Sassanid wars as follows : 
 30 : 2 The Romans have been defeated 3 In the nearest land . But they , after their defeat , will overcome . 4 Within several years . To Allah belongs the command before and after . And that day the believers will rejoice 5 In the victory of Allah . He gives victory to whom He wills , and He is the Exalted in Might , the Merciful . 
 In Islamic and Arab histories Heraclius is the only Roman Emperor who is discussed at any length . Owing to his role as the Roman Emperor at the time Islam emerged , he was remembered in Arabic literature , such as the Islamic hadith and sira . 
 The Swahili <unk> wa <unk> , an epic poem composed in 1728 at Pate Island ( off the shore of present @-@ day Kenya ) and depicting the wars between the Muslims and Byzantines from the former 's point of view , is also known as <unk> kya <unk> ( " The book of Heraclius " ) . In that work , Heraclius is portrayed as declining the Prophet 's command to renounce his false belief in Christianity ; he is therefore defeated by the Muslim forces . 
 In Muslim tradition he is seen as a just ruler of great piety , who had direct contact with the emerging Islamic forces . The 14th century scholar Ibn Kathir ( d . 1373 ) went even further stating that " Heraclius was one of the wisest men and among the most resolute , shrewd , deep and opinionated of kings . He ruled the Romans with great leadership and splendor . " Historians such as Nadia Maria El @-@ Cheikh and Lawrence Conrad note that Islamic histories even go so far as claiming that Heraclius recognized Islam as the true faith and Muhammad as its prophet , by comparing Islam to Christianity . 
 Islamic historians often cite a letter that they claim Heraclius wrote to Muhammad : " I have received your letter with your ambassador and I testify that you are the messenger of God found in our New Testament . Jesus , son of Mary , announced you . " According to the Muslim sources reported by El @-@ Cheikh , he tried to convert the ruling class of the Empire , but they resisted so strongly that he reversed his course and claimed that he was just testing their faith in Christianity . El @-@ Cheikh notes that these accounts of Heraclius add " little to our historical knowledge " of the emperor ; rather , they are an important part of " Islamic <unk> , " attempting to legitimate Muhammad 's status as a prophet . 
 However , most scholarly historians view such traditions as " profoundly <unk> " and that " enormous difficulties " exist in using these sources for actual history . Furthermore , any messengers sent by Muhammad to Heraclius would not have received an imperial audience or recognition . Outside of Islamic sources there is no evidence to suggest Heraclius ever heard of Islam , and it is possible that he and his advisors actually viewed the Muslims as some special sect of Jews . 
 = = Family = = 
 Heraclius was married twice : first to Fabia Eudokia , a daughter of <unk> , and then to his niece Martina . He had two children with Fabia and at least nine with Martina , most of whom were sickly children . Of Martina 's children at least two were disabled , which was seen as punishment for the illegality of the marriage : Fabius ( Flavius ) had a paralyzed neck and Theodosios , who was a deaf @-@ mute , married Nike , daughter of Persian general Shahrbaraz or daughter of Niketas , cousin of Heraclius . 
 Two of Heraclius ' children would become Emperor : Heraclius Constantine ( Constantine III ) , his son from Eudokia , from 613 – 641 , and Martina 's son Constantine Heraclius ( Heraklonas ) , from 638 – 641 . 
 Heraclius had at least one illegitimate son , John <unk> , who conspired a plot against Heraclius with his cousin , the magister Theodorus , and the Armenian noble David <unk> . When Heraclius discovered the plot , he had <unk> ' nose and hands cut off , and he was exiled to <unk> , one of the Princes ' Islands . Theodorus had the same treatment but was sent to <unk> ( possibly modern day Gozo Island ) with additional instructions to cut off one leg . 
 During the last years of Heraclius ' life , it became evident that a struggle was taking place between Heraclius Constantine and Martina , who was trying to position her son Heraklonas in line for the throne . When Heraclius died , he willed the empire to both Heraclius Constantine and Heraklonas to rule jointly with Martina as Empress .

 = New Slang = 
 " New Slang " is a song by American rock band The Shins , released on February 19 , 2001 as the lead single from the group 's debut studio album , Oh , Inverted World ( 2001 ) . Written by guitarist and vocalist James Mercer , it concerns his hometown of Albuquerque , New Mexico and his experiences there in his late twenties . The lyrics are fueled with " angst and confusion , " as Mercer was finding himself constantly depressed and disconnected from his friends and scene . The song attracted attention from Sub Pop Records , who issued the song as a single in February 2001 . The buzz created by the song led to positive press for the group 's debut album , Oh , Inverted World . 
 The song began to be licensed in a variety of media beginning in 2002 , including various television programs and a McDonald 's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics . Although the song never charted on any international charts , it became a sensation following its appearance in the film Garden State ( 2004 ) , where a character referred to it as a song that " will change your life . " The band saw increased record sales and notoriety as a result . Critics were very positive in their assessments of " New Slang " , with many calling it one of the best songs from Oh , Inverted World . 
 The song 's music video was directed by Lance Bangs , and features shots filmed in Albuquerque and Portland , Oregon . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Shins were not truly a band when James Mercer composed the song , and the idea of making music his career seemed uncertain . The song 's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque , New Mexico , the band 's hometown , which Mercer described as " macho , really heavy , and aggressive . " He characterized it as a punk rock @-@ esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town . The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future . " It 's definitely a moment in my life , that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be , " he remarked . He described it as a " Saturn return " period of his life , in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing . He had become a " hermit " working on the band 's debut album , Oh , Inverted World , and had lost interest in partying with friends . The line " Gold teeth and a curse for this town " refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque . 
 Friends of the band , including Zeke Howard from Love As Laughter and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse sent record labels cassette demos of the band 's songs , including " New Slang " . Mercer sent a demo to Sub Pop Records in Seattle , Washington , and label co @-@ founder Jonathan Poneman caught a concert in San Francisco while the band was on tour with Modest Mouse . He offered the band a one @-@ off single deal , and the label included it in their Single @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Month series , issuing a 7 " single to fan club members in February 2001 . Positive press for " New Slang " made the group 's debut , Oh , Inverted World , one of the most anticipated indie rock albums of 2001 , and Sub Pop signed the band in full .

 " New Slang " received positive critical reception . Stewart Mason of the Weekly Alibi in the band 's hometown of Albuquerque called it " the most immediately appealing song on the album , " praising it as " simply brilliant , [ ... ] mostly acoustic ballad with the absolute finest melody the band has yet concocted and Mercer 's typically oblique but evocative lyrics . " 
 AllMusic called the song a " mid @-@ tempo , strummy folk tune with a real catch @-@ on falsetto melody , " giving its 7 " single a four @-@ star review , summarizing that the release " could be a lost single from a brilliant , obscure ' 60s psych @-@ folk band while still sounding far ahead of its time . " Rolling Stone ranked it the " most affecting " song from Oh , Inverted World , describing it as " a shuffling folk ballad with a spaghetti @-@ western feel and a somber melody that could have come off an Elliott Smith album . " Pitchfork Media panned the song , deeming it an imitation of Simon & Garfunkel . The New York Times also covered the song , noting that " It has an odd , slightly serpentine vocal melody ( it sounds a bit like an adapted madrigal ) , and the lyrics are absurd and somehow touching . " 
 The A.V. Club called " New Slang " one of the year 's " loveliest ballads . " Will Hermes , in a piece on NPR 's All Things Considered , called the song a " masterpiece , " as well as " ridiculously melodic and structurally flawless . " Pitchfork Media later included the song at number 62 on its list of " The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s , " calling it " An agoraphobic bedroom @-@ pop gem that shuffled its way onto a stage larger than anyone imagined possible . " New Slang " paved the way for Norah , Nick , Juno , and the many lovely , odd , and grating mainstream / indie pairings to come . "

 The song 's music video was filmed in various locations in Albuquerque and Portland . Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande , junkyards , and near Mercer 's home . The clip was directed by Lance Bangs , an associate of Spike Jonze . It features the band re @-@ enacting the cover art of other bands ' albums , including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü , Let It Be by The Replacements , Moon Pix by Cat Power , Double Nickels on the Dime by The Minutemen , Squirrel Bait 's first EP , Sonic Youth 's Sister and Slint 's Spiderland . Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed in cities such as Los Angeles , Minneapolis , and Louisville . For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime , the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover ( a Volkswagen Beetle ) , and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street , which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover . 
 The video was in rotation on M2 , Much Music , and on the program 120 Minutes . The clip was also available for download from Sub Pop 's website in 2002 .

 The song proved to be a " stealth hit , " helping Oh , Inverted World move over 100 @,@ 000 copies within two years , considered remarkable for an independent label ; Sub Pop had hoped the record would sell 10 @,@ 000 copies . The song was also used on an episode of Scrubs , The O.C. , The Sopranos , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and the MTV reality series Newlyweds : Nick and Jessica . Mercer was positive in licensing the song to a variety of media , confirming to The New York Times that he received more money from touring and licensing than record sales . 
 The song was featured in a McDonald 's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics . Mercer elaborated on the song 's in an interview : " That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald ’ s hired to do a “ hip commercial , ” or whatever . So the kid who offered the whole thing up to us was a Shins fan . " Online message boards ( many on <unk> ) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively <unk> . The band 's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled " <unk> , New Corporate Suck @-@ ass " in reaction . The ad 's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company 's typical upbeat themes , and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive , considering a set of the song 's lyrics , which at times refer to " the dirt in your fries . " The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home . In addition , the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland , Oregon , where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album , Chutes Too Narrow ( 2003 ) . Mercer nevertheless " recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising , " remarking , " Imagine us playing " New Slang , " and everyone in the audience going , ' That 's the song from the McDonald 's commercial — I 'm loving it . ' " 
 " New Slang " achieved a new level of cultural significance when it was prominently featured in the film Garden State ( 2004 ) . In a scene from the film , Sam ( portrayed by Natalie Portman ) tells Andrew <unk> ( played by director Zach Braff ) that the song " will change your life . " The song " changed everything " for the group , leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film 's debut . " Almost overnight , the Shins became indie @-@ rock icons , " wrote Robert Levine of Spin . The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity . " We saw a change in our audience . By the time we were done touring for Chutes Too Narrow , there was this new interest , " said Mercer . " We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie , and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses . We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them . I mean , it just kept growing ! " This additional exposure helped Oh , Inverted World move 500 @,@ 000 units in the United States . 
 The band performed the song on their debut appearance at Saturday Night Live in 2007 . Mercer was disappointed the show 's producers requested he perform a song at that point six years old , but obliged after hearing stories of artists that argued their setlist and were not invited back .

His parents met while Benji attended Northwest Missouri State University , where he played Division II basketball after spending time at Northeastern Oklahoma A & M College . His mother had just completed her tenure at Ruskin High School . 
 By the age of five , Burke 's local youth basketball league had to change its rules so that he would not keep stealing the ball from the other team . As a result of his prowess , he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball . He became Jared Sullinger 's best friend in fourth grade , but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated . The reassignment only lasted one year , however . At the age of nine , Burke 's father made him do everything with his left hand , including brushing his teeth and eating dinner , in order to develop his ambidexterity .

 <unk> Sullinger , father of current Boston Celtics forward Jared Sullinger , was the coach at Northland High School , while Burke 's father was an assistant coach at <unk> Academy .

 Burke made the high school varsity team as a freshman , but did not play much . Between his freshman and sophomore years , his summer league team was defeated when Darian Cartharn scored 35 points against them . Cartharn had been trained by Anthony <unk> , so Burke sought his tutelage . Burke became a regular client of <unk> 's despite his hectic scholastic , training and competition schedules .

After the season , Burke was recognized as one of the best point guards in the nation by <unk> He was named a second @-@ team All @-@ American by the website based on the premise that every team needed a " dribbler " . A few days later , however , the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke 's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his family : " When you have a season as a freshman like he did , the NBA , they like them young , " Trey 's father , Benji Burke said . " They think their ceiling is higher when they 're young . Trey had ... a solid season for a freshman . It 's going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years . " On March 21 , Burke submitted himself for evaluation by the NBA Draft Advisory Council , which had encouraged Michigan 's DeShawn Sims and Manny Harris to return to school in 2009 but advised Harris in 2010 and Darius Morris in 2011 to declare for the draft .

Nonetheless , CBS Sports reported on April 4 that Burke would declare for the draft . Burke 's early departure for the NBA would have been the third in a row for a Michigan guard after Manny Harris in 2010 and Darius Morris in 2011 .

On April 9 , Burke announced he would return to Michigan for his sophomore season instead of staying in the NBA draft . He decided to wait in hopes of becoming a more likely first round selection .

 Burke stated on March 27 that he would almost certainly enter the draft if Michigan won the national title . On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four , head coach Beilein met with Burke , Hardaway , Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek the advice of the NBA advisory committee . The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft . On April 13 , reports surfaced that Burke would announce that he would enter the NBA Draft at a press conference the following day . On April 14 , he entered the 2013 NBA Draft . 
 Within days of entering the draft , some draft analysts , such as ESPN 's David Thorpe , said that Burke should be the first overall selection in the draft : " Burke might not have the prototypical physical attributes of an NBA superstar , but if the team that lands the No. 1 overall pick in this year 's NBA draft does not have its long @-@ term point guard already in place , it should select Burke without hesitation . " He was expected to be the first point guard taken , especially since Marcus Smart opted out of the draft . By early May , several NBA general managers acknowledged the possibility of Burke going # 1 overall . 
 Burke 's father became his agent . Burke was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine . Before the draft , Burke was expected to post better NBA combine numbers than Chris Paul . At the combine , Burke strengthened his case for the number one overall draft selection with his physical measurements and his athletic results . Burke was invited to sit in the " green room " during the 2013 NBA Draft . Most mock drafts , including Draft Express , NBA <unk> , The Times @-@ Picayune , Yahoo ! Sports , and Bleacher Report , predicted that Burke would be selected by the New Orleans Pelicans with the 6th overall selection . He was in contact with Orlando who had rights to the second overall draft pick and Phoenix , New Orleans , Sacramento and Detroit , who owned the fifth through eighth selections . 
 On June 27 , 2013 , Burke was selected 9th in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and then traded to the Utah Jazz for the 14th and 21st picks , which were used to select Shabazz Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng . Burke and Hardaway Jr. became the first Michigan duo selected in the first round since Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose in the 1994 NBA Draft . Burke also became the first Wolverine selection in the top 10 of the first round since Jamal Crawford in the 2000 NBA Draft . In addition , Burke joined Indiana University players Victor Oladipo ( 2nd ) and Cody Zeller ( 4th ) to give the Big Ten its first top ten first round trio since the 1990 NBA Draft .

 On July 6 , Burke signed a maximum rookie contract — 120 percent of the preset salary scale of $ 2 @,@ 032 @,@ 300 — with the Jazz , resulting in a contract worth in $ 4 @,@ 987 @,@ 320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons , while the Jazz have team option rights for the third and fourth years . This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7 – 12 Orlando Summer League . At point guard , the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams . In the NBA Summer League , Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field , including 1 – 19 on three @-@ point shots , while trying to adjust to the pace of the NBA game . He was even benched for a game . Following Burke 's Summer League performance , the Jazz signed John Lucas III . 
 On October 12 , Burke broke his right index finger below the middle knuckle . He had been a favorite for NBA Rookie of the Year , but was listed as out indefinitely . On October 14 , an October 15 surgery to insert surgical pins was announced . The 2013 – 14 Jazz were scheduled to begin the 2013 – 14 NBA season on October 30 . Although early reports suggested an 8 – 12 week hiatus , ESPN The Magazine 's Chris Broussard reported only a 6 @-@ week absence was expected . On November 11 , Burke 's finger was reevaluated . Without Burke , the Jazz began the season 0 – 8 with Lucas and Jamaal Tinsley playing point guard . On November 12 , the Jazz announced that Burke had only been cleared to begin individual drills , that he would be reevaluated November 25 and that Tinsley had been waived . Jazz head coach Tyrone Corbin reported that by November 13 Burke was dribbling a basketball <unk> . On November 20 , Burke announced he would make his career debut against the New Orleans Pelicans for the 1 – 11 Jazz , but he was not expected to start . 
 Burke debuted for the Jazz on November 20 with 11 points on 5 – 8 shooting in 12 minutes of play . His first basket was a left @-@ handed finish on a drive down the lane and his first assist was a pick and roll with Derrick Favors . Ironically , Burke 's second game was against the 2013 NBA draft 18th overall selection Shane Larkin and the Dallas Mavericks . Point guard Larkin returned to action two days before Burke did after injuring his ankle prior to summer league . In his second game , Burke posted 5 rebounds and 3 assists , but struggled with only 5 points on 8 shots during 20 minutes of play . 
 Burke started in his third game . He again played for 20 minutes , but only tallied four points and four assists .

 = Economy of the Han dynasty = 
 The Han dynasty ( 206 BC – 220 AD ) of ancient China experienced contrasting periods of economic prosperity and decline . It is normally divided into three periods : Northern Han ( 206 BC – 9 AD ) , the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 AD ) , and Eastern Han ( 25 – 220 AD ) . The Xin regime , established by the former regent Wang Mang , formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule . Following the fall of Wang Mang , the Han capital was moved eastward from Chang 'an to Luoyang . In consequence , historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively . 
 The Han economy was defined by significant population growth , increasing urbanization , unprecedented growth of industry and trade , and government experimentation with nationalization . In this era , the levels of minting and circulation of coin currency grew significantly , forming the foundation of a stable monetary system . The Silk Road facilitated the establishment of trade and tributary exchanges with foreign countries across Eurasia , many of which were previously unknown to the people of ancient China . The imperial capitals of both Western Han ( Chang 'an ) and Eastern Han ( Luoyang ) were among the largest cities in the world at the time , in both population and area . Here , government workshops manufactured furnishings for the palaces of the emperor and produced goods for the common people . The government oversaw the construction of roads and bridges , which facilitated official government business and encouraged commercial growth . Under Han rule , industrialists , wholesalers , and merchants — from minor shopkeepers to wealthy businessmen — could engage in a wide range of enterprises and trade in the domestic , public , and even military spheres . 
 In the early Han period , rural peasant farmers were largely self @-@ sufficient , but they began to rely heavily upon commercial exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates . Many peasants fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent @-@ paying tenants of the land @-@ owning classes . The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers , who had to compete with powerful and influential nobles , landowners , and merchants . The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation . Emperor Wu 's ( r . 141 – 87 BC ) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries ; however , these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han . Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BC severely weakened the commercial merchant class . This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian @-@ dominated economy . The wealthy landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well , maintaining control over the rural peasants — upon whom the government relied for tax revenues — military manpower , and public works labor . By the 180s AD , economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized , while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities . 
 = = Monetary system and urbanization = = 
 = = = Urbanization and population = = = 
 During the Warring States period ( 403 – 221 BC ) , the development of private commerce , new trade routes , handicraft industries , and a money economy led to the growth of new urban centers . These centers were markedly different from the older cities , which had merely served as power bases for the nobility . The use of a standardized , nationwide currency during the Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) facilitated long @-@ distance trade between cities . Many Han cities grew large : the Western Han capital , Chang 'an , had approximately 250 @,@ 000 inhabitants , while the Eastern Han capital , Luoyang , had approximately 500 @,@ 000 inhabitants . The population of the Han Empire , recorded in the tax census of 2 AD , was 57 @.@ 6 million people in 12 @,@ 366 @,@ 470 households . The majority of commoners who populated the cities lived in extended urban and suburban areas outside the city walls and gatehouses . The total urban area of Western @-@ Han Chang 'an — including the extensions outside the walls — was 36 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) . The total urban area of Eastern @-@ Han Luoyang — including the extensions outside the walls — was 24 @.@ 5 km2 ( 9 @.@ 5 sq mi ) . Both Chang 'an and Luoyang had two prominent marketplaces ; each market had a two @-@ story government office demarcated by a flag and drum at the top . Market officials were charged with maintaining order , collecting commercial taxes , setting standard commodity prices on a monthly basis , and authorizing contracts between merchants and customers . 
 = = = Variations in currency = = = 
 During the early Western Han period , founding Emperor Gaozu of Han ( r . 202 – 195 BC ) closed government mints in favor of coin currency produced by the private sector . Gaozu 's widow Empress Lü Zhi , as grand empress dowager , abolished private minting in 186 BC . She first issued a government @-@ minted bronze coin weighing 5 @.@ 7 g ( 0 @.@ 20 oz ) , but issued another , weighing 1 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 053 oz ) , in 182 BC . The change to the lighter coin caused widespread inflation , so in 175 BC Emperor Wen of Han ( r . 180 – 157 BC ) lifted the ban on private minting ; private mints were required to mint coins weighing exactly 2 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 092 oz ) . Private minting was again abolished in 144 BC during the end of Emperor Jing of Han 's ( r . 157 – 141 BC ) reign . Despite this , the 2 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 092 oz ) bronze coin was issued by both central and local commandery governments until 120 BC , when for one year it was replaced with a coin weighing 1 @.@ 9 g ( 0 @.@ 067 oz ) . Other currencies were introduced around this time . Token money notes made of embroidered white deerskin , with a face value of 400 @,@ 000 coins , were used to collect government revenues . Emperor Wu also introduced three tin @-@ silver alloy coins worth 3 @,@ 000 , 500 , and 300 bronze coins , respectively ; all of these weighed less than 120 g ( 4 @.@ 2 oz ) . 
 In 119 BC , the government issued the bronze wushu ( 五銖 ) coin weighing 3 @.@ 2 g ( 0 @.@ 11 oz ) ; the coin remained the standard currency in China until the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 AD ) . During the brief interruptive Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 AD ) of Wang Mang ( 45 BC – 23 AD ) , the government introduced several new denominations in 7 , 9 , 10 , and 14 AD . These new units ( including bronze knife money , gold , silver , tortoise , and cowry shell currencies ) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased the value of coin currency . Once the widespread civil wars following Wang 's overthrow abated , the wushu coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han ( r . 25 – 57 AD ) in 40 AD at the instigation of Ma Yuan ( 14 BC – 49 AD ) . Since commandery @-@ issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight , the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government 's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the exclusive right to mint coins . Although the issue of central government coinage was transferred to the office of the Minister of Finance ( one of Nine Ministers of the central government ) by the beginning of Eastern Han , the central government 's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted . 
 Gary Lee Todd ( Ph.D. in History from University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign and Professor of History at <unk> International University in <unk> , Henan , China ) provides the following images of coins issued during the Western Han and Xin periods on his website : 
 = = = Circulation and salaries = = = 
 Merchants and peasant farmers paid property and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with a portion of their crop yield . Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners , in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets . The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary . 
 From 118 BC to 5 AD , the government minted over 28 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins , with an annual average of 220 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins minted ( or 220 @,@ 000 strings of 1 @,@ 000 coins ) . In comparison , the <unk> period ( <unk> ) ( 742 – 755 AD ) of the Tang dynasty produced 327 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins every year while 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins in 1045 AD and 5 @,@ 860 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins in 1080 AD were made in the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 AD ) . Coin cash became the common measure of wealth during Eastern Han , as many wages were paid solely in cash . <unk> Lun ( <unk> ) ( fl . 40 – 85 AD ) , Governor of Shu Province ( modern Sichuan ) , described his subordinate officials ' wealth not in terms of landholdings , but in the form of aggregate properties worth approximately 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coin cash . Commercial transactions involving hundreds of thousands of coins were commonplace . 
 Angus Maddison estimates that the country 's gross domestic product was equivalent to $ 450 per head in 1990 United States dollars — a sum that was above subsistence level , and which did not significantly change until the beginning of the Song dynasty in the late 10th century . Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China 's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards , holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire . The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants , who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners . The government 's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes , fines , confiscations , and price regulation schemes .

 = = = Landowners and peasants = = = 
 After Shang Yang ( d . 338 BC ) of the State of Qin abolished the communal and aristocratic well @-@ field system in an effort to curb the power of nobles , land in China could be bought and sold . Historical scholars of the Han dynasty like Dong Zhongshu ( 179 – 104 BC ) attributed the rise of the wealthy landowning class to this reform . The Han Feizi describes these landowners ' use of hired labor in agriculture , a practice dating back to the 3rd century BC , possibly earlier . Some landowners owned small numbers of slaves , but many relied on peasant tenant farmers who paid rent with a portion of their agricultural produce . More numerous than tenants , small landowner @-@ cultivators lived and worked independently , but often fell into debt and sold their land to the wealthy . The court official Chao Cuo ( d . 154 BC ) argued that if the average independent landowning family of five could cultivate no more than 4 @.@ 57 hectares ( 11 @.@ 3 acres ) of land and produce no more than 2 @,@ 000 litres ( 530 US gal ) of grain annually , then natural disasters and high taxation rates would force many into debt , to sell their land , homes , and even children , and to become dependent upon work as tenant farmers for the wealthy . 
 Officials at the court of Emperor Ai of Han ( r . 7 – 1 BC ) attempted to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally , but were unsuccessful . When Wang Mang took control of the government in 9 AD , he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King 's Fields ( <unk> ) . This was a variation of the well @-@ field system , where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate . Within three years , complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform . After Gengshi ( r . 23 – 25 AD ) and Guangwu ( r . 25 – 57 AD ) restored the Han dynasty , they relied on the service of great landholding families to secure their position in society . Many of their government officials also became wealthy landowners . 
 By the late Eastern Han period , the peasantry had become largely landless and served wealthy landowners . This cost the government significant tax revenue . Although the central government under Emperor He of Han ( r . 88 – 105 AD ) reduced taxes in times of natural disaster and distress without much effect upon the treasury , successive rulers became less able to cope with major crises . The government soon relied upon local administrations to conduct relief efforts . After the central government failed to provide local governments with provisions during both a locust swarm and the flooding of the Yellow River in 153 AD , many landless peasants became retainers of large landowners in exchange for aid . Patricia Ebrey writes that the Eastern Han was the " transitional period " between the Western Han — when small independent farmers were the vast majority — and the Three Kingdoms ( 220 – 265 AD ) and later Sixteen Kingdoms ( 304 – 439 AD ) , when large family estates used unfree labor . 
 The Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 AD , the slaughter of the eunuchs in 189 AD , and the campaign against Dong Zhuo in 190 AD destabilized the central government , and Luoyang was burnt to the ground . At this point , " ... private and local power came to replace public authority . " 
 The Han Chancellor and King of Wei Cao Cao ( 155 – 220 AD ) made the final significant attempt to limit the power of wealthy landowners . Cao Cao established government @-@ managed agricultural colonies for landless commoners ; in exchange for land and cheap equipment , the farmers paid a portion of their crop yield . In the 120s BC , Emperor Wu had attempted to establish agricultural colonies in the northwestern frontier of the newly conquered Hexi Corridor ( in modern Gansu ) . 600 @,@ 000 new settlers farmed on these state lands using seeds , draft animals and equipment loaned by the government . An imperial edict in 85 AD ordered the local governments of commanderies and subordinate kingdoms to resettle landless peasants onto state @-@ owned lands , where they would be paid wages , provided with crop seeds , loaned farming tools and exempted from rent payments for five years and poll taxes for three years . The edict also allowed peasants to return to their native counties at any time . Subsequent governments of the Three Kingdoms established agricultural colonies on these models . 
 = = = Tax reforms = = = 
 Because small landowning families represented the mainstay of the Han tax base , the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants . The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters . Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants to return to their land . An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms . The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one @-@ fifteenth of crop yield to one @-@ thirtieth , and abolished in 167 BC . However , the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one @-@ thirtieth . At the beginning of the Eastern Han , the land tax rate was one @-@ tenth of the crop yield , but following the stabilization following Wang Mang 's death , the rate was reduced to the original one @-@ thirtieth in 30 AD . 
 Towards the end of the Han dynasty , the land tax rate was reduced to one @-@ hundredth , with lost revenue recouped by increasing the poll and property tax rates . The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually , 240 coins for merchants , and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years . The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han ( r . 48 – 33 BC ) and onwards . Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread , since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government . 
 Though requiring additional revenue to fund the Han – Xiongnu War , the government during Emperor Wu of Han 's reign ( 141 – 87 BC ) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners . To increase revenue , the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants , confiscated land from nobles , sold offices and titles , and established government monopolies over the minting of coins , iron manufacture and salt mining . New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats , carts , carriages , wheelbarrows , shops and other properties . The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BC from 120 coins for every 10 @,@ 000 coins @-@ worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2 @,@ 000 coins @-@ worth of property owned . Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown , except for that of liquor . After the government monopoly on liquor was abolished in 81 BC , a property tax of 2 coins for every 0 @.@ 2 litres ( 0 @.@ 05 US gal ) was levied on liquor merchants . 
 The sale of certain offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by Empress Dowager Deng Sui — who reigned as regent from 105 – 121 AD — to raise government revenues in times of severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the Qiang people in western China . The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the eunuch @-@ dominated government of Emperor Ling of Han ( r . 168 – 189 AD ) , when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of being filled by vetted candidates who had taken Imperial examinations or attended the Imperial University . 
 = = = Conscription = = = 
 Two forms of mass conscription existed during the Han period . These were civilian conscription ( <unk> <unk> ) and military conscription ( zhengzu 正卒 ) . In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes , all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty @-@ six were required to undertake mandatory conscription duties for one month of each year . These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects . 
 At the age of twenty @-@ three years male peasants were drafted to serve in the military , where they were assigned to infantry , cavalry , or navy service . After one year of training , they went on to perform a year of actual military service in frontier garrisons or as guards in the capital city . They remained liable to perform this year of service until the age of fifty @-@ six . This was also the age when they were dismissed from their local militias , which they could join once they had finished their year of conscripted service . These non @-@ professional conscripted soldiers comprised the Southern Army ( Nanjun 南軍 ) , while the Northern Army ( Beijun 北軍 ) was a standing army composed of paid career soldiers . 
 During the Eastern Han , peasants could avoid the month of annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in commutation ( <unk> <unk> ) . This development went hand in hand with the increasing use of hired labor by the government . In a similar manner , because the Eastern @-@ Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers , the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty @-@ three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution . 
 = = = Merchants = = = 
 There were two categories of Han merchants : those who sold goods at shops in urban markets , and the larger @-@ scale itinerant traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries . The small @-@ scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes . Although these registered merchants were taxed , an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who had to resort to peddling were to be exempted from taxation . 
 Itinerant merchants were often wealthy and did not have to register . These itinerant merchants often participated in large @-@ scale trade with powerful families and officials . Nishijima writes that most of the biographies of " wealthy men " in the Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were those of itinerant merchants . 
 In contrast , registered marketplace merchants had a very low social status and were often subject to additional restrictions . Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes , forbidding merchants from wearing silk , and barring their descendants from holding public office . These laws were difficult to enforce . Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and unregistered merchants with higher taxes . While registered merchants were not allowed to own land , if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated . However , wealthy unregistered merchants owned large tracts of land . Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace , where he set up government @-@ managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes .

 = = = = Iron and salt = = = = 
 At the beginning of the Han dynasty , China 's salt and iron enterprises were privately owned by a number of wealthy merchants and subordinate regional kings . The profits of these industries rivaled the funds of the imperial court . A successful iron or salt industrialist might have employed over a thousand peasants , causing a severe loss of agricultural tax revenue to the central government . To restrict the power of the industrialists , Emperor Wu had nationalized the salt and iron industries by 117 BC . 
 The government also instituted a liquor monopoly in 98 BC . However , this was repealed in 81 BC in an effort to reduce government intervention in the private economy . 
 The Reformist Party supported privatization , opposing the Modernist Party , which had dominated politics during the reign of Emperor Wu and the subsequent regency of Huo Guang ( d . 68 BC ) . The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials , good working conditions , and high quality iron ; the Reformists countered that state @-@ owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be of practical use , were of inferior quality , and were too expensive for commoners to purchase . In 44 BC , the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished , but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy . 
 Wang Mang preserved these central government monopolies . When Eastern Han began , they were once again repealed , the industries given to local commandery governments and private entrepreneurs . Emperor Zhang of Han ( r . 75 – 88 AD ) briefly reintroduced the central government monopolies on salt and iron from 85 to 88 AD , but abolished them in the last year of his reign . After Emperor Zhang , the Han never returned the salt and iron industries to government ownership . 
 = = = = Grain = = = = 
 The grain trade was a profitable private enterprise during the early Western Han , yet Emperor Wu 's government intervened in the grain trade when it established the equable marketing system ( also known as the ever @-@ normal granary system ) in 110 BC . The government purchased grain when it was plentiful and inexpensive , shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where grain was scarce . The system was intended to eliminate grain speculation , to create a standard price and to increase government revenue . The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang ( d . 80 BC ) — who was previously a merchant . Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls . This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han , although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han ( r . 57 – 75 ) . Emperor Ming also abolished the system in 68 AD , when he believed that the government 's storage of grain increased prices and made wealthy landowners richer . 
 Ebrey argues that although most of Emperor Wu 's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han , their damage to the merchant class and the subsequent laissez @-@ faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society , ensuring that China 's economy would remain firmly agrarian @-@ based for centuries . The Eastern Han central government lost an important source of revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies ' swords and shields from private manufacturers . However , this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants . 
 = = = Government workshops = = = 
 Han government workshops produced common , luxury , and even artistic funerary items , such as the ceramic figurines and tomb tiles which adorned the walls of underground tombs . Imperial workshops were operated by the Minister Steward , whose ministry controlled the treasury and the emperor 's private finances . 
 The Office of Arts and Crafts , subordinate to the Minister Steward , produced weapons , bronze mirrors , vessel wares , and other goods . The Office of Manufactures , also subordinate to the Minister Steward , made the cheaper weapons , utensils , and armor . Textiles and clothing worn by the emperor and royal family were made in the Weaving House of the West and Weaving House of the East ; the latter was abolished in 28 BC , and the Weaving House of the West was renamed the Weaving House . 
 Workshops located in the commanderies made silks and embroidered fabrics , silver and gold luxury items , and weapons . One workshop , in modern Anhui province , had a shipyard where battle ships were built . Although the government used the labor of state @-@ owned slaves , corvée laborers , and convicts in its workshops , they also hired skilled craftsmen who were well @-@ paid . 
 Han lacquerwares were privately made as well as being manufactured in government workshops . Hundreds of laborers could be employed to work on a single luxury item , such as a lacquered cup or screen . Some lacquerwares were inscribed simply with the clan name of the family who owned them . Others were inscribed with the titles of the owner , the specific type of the vessels , their capacities , the precise day , month , and year of manufacture ( according to Chinese era names and their lunisolar calendar ) , the names of the floor managers who oversaw the items ' production and the names of the workers who made them . Even some iron implements made during the age of the monopoly bore inscriptions of the date they were made and the name of the workshop . Bronze calipers from the Xin dynasty , used for minute measurements , had an inscription stating that it was " made on a gui @-@ you day at new moon of the first month of the first year of the <unk> guo period . " The calipers date from 9 AD . Han lacquerwares bearing the imperial mark of the emperor have been found far beyond the Han capital regions by modern archaeologists , in places such as <unk> ( in Guizhou ) , Pyongyang ( in North Korea ) , and <unk> Ula ( in Mongolia ) . 
 = = = Public construction projects = = = 
 The Court Architect was charged by central government with overseeing all imperial construction and public works projects , including the building of palaces and tombs . 
 During the Western Han period , conscripted peasants were organized into work teams consisting of over a hundred thousand laborers . About 150 @,@ 000 conscripted workers , serving in consecutive periods of thirty days each over a total of five years , worked on the massive defensive walls of Chang 'an , which were completed in 190 BC . <unk> laborers were commissioned to build and maintain shrines dedicated to various deities and the spirits of the emperor 's ancestors . Conscripts also maintained canal systems used for agricultural transport and irrigation . Some of the larger Han canal renovation projects included repairs to the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and Zhengguo Canal , built by the previous State of Qin and Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) , respectively . 
 Nineteen stone inscriptions survive commemorating the building of new roads and bridges by the Eastern Han government . Archaeological excavations at Chang 'an show that wooden bridges were built over the defensive moat and led to the gatehouses . Roadways also needed periodic repairs ; in 63 AD the route leading from the Qilian Mountains , through Hanzhong ( modern southern Shanxi ) , and towards the capital Luoyang underwent major repairs . For this project , 623 trestle bridges , five large bridges , 107 km ( 66 mi ) of new roadways , and 64 buildings — including rest houses , post stations , and relay stations — were built . Those commissioned with military authority also built bridges . For example , during his campaign against the Xiongnu in the Ordos Desert in 127 BC , the general Wei Qing ( d . 106 BC ) had a new bridge built over the <unk> River ( a former tributary of the Yellow River ) in today 's Inner Mongolia . He used this bridge to move troops and supplies for an attack on the Xiongnu , northwest of modern Wuyuan County ( <unk> ) . Ebrey writes : 
 There were , of course , numerous reasons for maintaining roads . A unified political system could be maintained only as long as the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials , troops , or messengers as needed . Such a system of transportation , once established , facilitated commerce . At the local level , road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated as much for the sake of traveling merchants as for officials .

 = = = Traded goods and commodities = = = 
 Han @-@ era historians like Sima Qian ( 145 – 86 BC ) and Ban Gu ( 32 – 92 AD ) , as well as the later historian Fan Ye ( 398 – 445 AD ) , recorded details of the business transactions and products traded by Han merchants . Evidence of these products has also emerged from archaeological investigations . 
 The main agricultural staple foods during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet , proso millet , rice ( including glutinous rice ) , wheat , beans , and barley . Other food items included sorghum , taro , mallow , mustard plant , jujube , pear , plum ( including Prunus salicina and Prunus <unk> ) , peach , apricot , and <unk> . Chicken , duck , goose , beef , pork , rabbit , sika deer , turtle dove , owl , Chinese bamboo partridge , magpie , common pheasant , crane , and various types of fish were commonly consumed meats . 
 The production of silk through sericulture was profitable for both small @-@ time farmers and large @-@ scale producers . Silk clothing was too expensive for the poor , who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp . The rural women usually wove all the family 's clothes . 
 Common bronze items included domestic wares like oil lamps , incense burners , tables , irons , stoves , and dripping jars . Iron goods were often used for construction and farmwork , such as plowshares , pickaxes , spades , shovels , hoes , sickles , axes , adze , hammers , chisels , knives , saws , scratch awls , and nails . Iron was also used to make swords , halberds , arrowheads and scale armor for the military . 
 Other common goods included : consumables ( liquor , pickles and sauces , sheep and pigs , grain , yeast for fermentation , bean relish , dried fish and abalone , dates , chestnuts , fruits and vegetables ) , raw materials ( cattle hide , boat timber , bamboo poles , dyes , horns , cinnabar , raw lacquer , jade , amber ) , clothing and clothing materials ( silk fabrics , fine and coarse cloth , sable and <unk> garments , felt and mats , deerskin slippers ) , eating utensils ( bronze utensils and chopsticks , silver , wood and iron vessels , ceramic wares ) , art objects ( lacquerware , ceramics ) , elegant coffins ( made of catalpa , locust , juniper , and lacquered wood ) , vehicles such as light two @-@ wheeled carts and heavy oxcarts , and horses . 
 In addition to general commodities , Han historians list the goods of specific regions . Common trade items from the region of modern Shanxi included bamboo , timber , grain , and gemstones ; Shandong had fish , salt , liquor , and silk ; Jiangnan had camphor , catalpa , ginger , cinnamon , gold , tin , lead , cinnabar , rhinoceros horn , tortoise shell , pearls , ivory , and leather . Ebrey lists items found in a 2nd @-@ century AD tomb in Wuwei , Gansu ( along the Hexi Corridor fortified by the Great Wall of China ) , evidence that luxury items could be obtained even in remote frontiers . 
 ... fourteen pieces of pottery ; wooden objects such as a horse , pig , ox , chicken , chicken coop , and a single @-@ horned animal ; seventy copper cash ; a crossbow mechanism made of bronze ; a writing brush ; a lacquer @-@ encased <unk> ; a lacquer tray and bowl ; a wooden comb ; a jade ornament ; a pair of hemp shoes ; a straw bag ; the remains of an inscribed banner ; a bamboo hairpin ; two straw satchels ; and a stone lamp . 
 = = = Estate management and trade = = = 
 In the early Eastern Han , Emperor Ming passed laws which prohibited those involved in agriculture from simultaneously engaging in mercantile trade . These laws were largely ineffective , since wealthy landowners and landlords made significant profits from the trading of goods produced on their estates . Cui Shi ( 催寔 ) ( d . 170 AD ) , a local commandery administrator who later served as an official in the central government 's secretariat , started a winery business in his home to pay for his father 's funeral . His fellow gentry criticized him , claiming the practice was immoral , but not illegal . 
 Cui Shi 's book Simin yueling ( 四民月令 ) is the only significant surviving work on agriculture from the Eastern Han period , though about 3 @,@ 000 written characters of the Fan Shengzhi shu ( 氾勝之書 ) , dated to the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han ( 33 – 7 BC ) , still survive . Cui Shi 's book provides descriptions of rituals for ancestor worship , festival and religious holiday celebrations , conduct for family and kinship relations , farmwork , and the schooling season for boys . Cui Shi 's book also provides detailed instructions on which months were the most profitable times to buy and sell certain types of farm @-@ produced goods . 
 The following table is modelled on Ebrey 's " Estate and Family Management in the Later Han as Seen in the Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People " ( 1974 ) . Ebrey writes : " ... the same item was often bought and sold at different times of the year . The rationale for this is very clearly financial : items were bought when the price was low and sold when it was high . " The specific amounts for each commodity traded are not listed , yet the timing of sale and purchase during the year is the most valuable information for historians . Missing from Cui Shi 's list are important items which his family certainly bought and sold at specific times of the year , such as salt , iron farm tools and kitchen utensils , paper and ink ( the papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun in 105 AD ) , as well as luxury items of silk and exotic foods . 
 There was mass unemployment among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period . However , archaeological and literary evidence shows that those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived comfortably . In addition to Cui 's work , the inventor , mathematician , and court astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78 – 139 AD ) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies . He mentions grain fields , ponds filled with fish , and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots , autumn leeks , winter rape @-@ turnips , <unk> , <unk> , and purple ginger . 
 Bricks lining the walls of the tombs of wealthy Han were adorned with carved or molded reliefs and painted murals ; these often showed scenes of the tomb occupant 's estate , halls , wells , carriage sheds , pens for cattle , sheep , chickens , and pigs , stables for horses , and employed workers picking mulberry leaves , plowing crop fields , and <unk> vegetable patches . 
 Small and medium @-@ sized estates were managed by single families . The father acted as the head manager , the sons as field workers . Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk . Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government 's system for state @-@ owned lands . Under this system , peasants would receive land , tools , oxen , and a house in exchange for a third or a half of their crop yield . 
 = = Foreign trade and tributary exchange = = 
 Prior to the Han dynasty , markets close to China 's northern border engaged in trade with the nomadic tribes of the eastern Eurasian Steppe . The heqin agreement between the Han and nomadic Xiongnu stipulated the transfer of tributary goods from China . The exact amount of annual tribute sent to the Xiongnu in the 2nd century BC is unknown . In 89 BC , when <unk> Chanyu ( <unk> ) ( r . 95 – 85 BC ) requested a renewal of the heqin agreement , he demanded an annual tribute of 400 @,@ 000 litres ( 11 @,@ 000 US bu ) or 10 @,@ 000 dan of wine , 100 @,@ 000 litres ( 2 @,@ 800 US bu ) or 5 @,@ 000 hu of grain , and 10 @,@ 000 bales of silk . These amounts of wine , grain , and silk were considered to be a significant increase from earlier amounts of tribute , which must have been much less . Besides these arrangements , the most common commercial exchanges between the Xiongnu and Han merchants consisted of the trading of Xiongnu horses and furs for Han agricultural foodstuffs and luxury items , most notably silk . By means of the black market , the Xiongnu were also able to smuggle Han iron weapons across the border . 
 The Han established a diplomatic presence in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia during Emperor Wu of Han 's reign ( 141 – 87 BC ) . Han envoys brought gifts of sheep , gold , and silk to the urban oasis city @-@ states . The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency ; however , silk was favored as a means to pay for food and lodging . Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and established a Protectorate there , Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging . These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs , precious stones , and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court . The Arsacid court sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court , and a king ruling in what is now Burma sent elephants and rhinoceroses . Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits . 
 The Han court received tributary submission from the Xiongnu leader Huhanye ( 呼韓邪 ) ( r . 58 – 31 BC ) , an important rival to Zhizhi Chanyu ( r . 56 – 36 BC , died at the Battle of Zhizhi ) . Huhanye 's tribute , exchange of hostages , and presence at Chang 'an in the New Year of 51 BC were rewarded with the following gifts from the emperor : 5 kg ( 160 ozt ) of gold , 200 @,@ 000 coins , 77 suits of clothes , 8 @,@ 000 bales of silk fabric , 1 @,@ 500 kg ( 3 @,@ 300 lb ) of silk floss , 15 horses , and 680 @,@ 000 l ( 19 @,@ 000 US bu ) of grain . However , this is the only occurrence of rewarded gifts that present materials other than fabric . As shown in the table below , based upon <unk> Ying @-@ shih 's " Han Foreign Relations " ( 1986 ) , the gifts consisted only silk after 51 BC , and the Xiongnu leader 's political submission was guaranteed only for as long as the Han could provide him with ever greater amounts of imperial largesse of silk with each succeeding visit to the Chinese court . 
 The establishment of the Silk Road occurred during Wu 's reign , owing to the efforts of the diplomat Zhang Qian . The increased demand for silk from the Roman Empire stimulated commercial traffic in both Central Asia and across the Indian Ocean . Roman merchants sailed to <unk> near present @-@ day Karachi , Pakistan , and <unk> in present @-@ day Gujarat , India to purchase Chinese silks ( see Roman trade with India ) . When Emperor Wu conquered Nanyue — in what is now Southwest China and northern Vietnam — in 111 BC , overseas trade was extended to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean , as maritime merchants traded Han gold and silk for pearls , jade , lapis lazuli , and glasswares . 
 The Book of Later Han states that Roman envoys sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius ( r . 161 – 180 AD ) , following a southern route , brought gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han ( r . 146 – 168 AD ) in 166 AD . This Roman mission followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Han diplomat Gan Ying to reach Rome in 97 . Gan Ying was delayed at the Persian Gulf , by Arsacid authorities , and could only make a report on Rome based on oral accounts . Historians Charles Hucker and Rafe de Crespigny both speculate that the Roman mission of 166 AD involved enterprising Roman merchants instead of actual diplomats ; Hucker writes : 
 Tributary missions from vassal states were commonly allowed to include traders , who thus gained opportunities to do business in the capital markets . No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at all . This was unquestionably the case , most notably , with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus . 
 The main trade route leading into Han China passed first through Kashgar , yet Hellenized Bactria further west was the central node of international trade . By the 1st century AD , Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire . Silk was the main export item from China to India . Indian merchants brought various goods to China , including tortoise shell , gold , silver , copper , iron , lead , tin , fine cloth , woolen textiles , perfume and incense , crystal sugar , pepper , ginger , salt , coral , pearls , glass items , and Roman wares . Indian merchants brought Roman <unk> and frankincense to China , while the Chinese knew <unk> as a fragrant item from Persia , although it was native to West India . The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China . The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes ( i.e. vitis vinifera ) were used to make grape wine , although the Chinese had rice wine before this . Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia have been found in Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn Period ( 771 – 476 BC ) . Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC , with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou . <unk> from <unk> and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites . 
 = The Cincinnati Kid = 
 The Cincinnati Kid is a 1965 American drama film . It tells the story of Eric " The Kid " Stoner , a young Depression @-@ era poker player , as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best . This quest leads him to challenge Lancey " The Man " Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . 
 The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his " ugly duckling " film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . 
 The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Eric Stoner , nicknamed " The Kid , " is an up @-@ and @-@ coming poker player in New Orleans . He hears that Lancey Howard , a longtime master of the game nicknamed " The Man , " is in town , and sees it as his chance to finally become the Man himself . The Kid 's friend Shooter cautions him , reminding the Kid how he thought he was the best five @-@ card stud player in the world , until Howard " gutted " him when they played . 
 Howard arranges a game with wealthy William Jefferson Slade , who secures Shooter 's services as dealer . Howard wins $ 6 @,@ 000 ( over $ 90 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) from Slade over a 30 @-@ hour game , angering Slade and wounding his pride . That night at Slade 's home , he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid 's favor when the two players meet . Shooter declines , but Slade calls in Shooter 's markers worth $ 12 @,@ 000 ( over $ 200 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) , and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about Shooter 's wild wife , Melba . Shooter agonizes over his decision , having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity . 
 With the Kid 's girl Christian visiting her parents , Melba tries to seduce him , even though she and Christian are close friends . Out of respect for Shooter , he rebuffs her , and spends the day before the game with Christian at her family 's farm . 
 The big game starts with six players , including Howard and the Kid , with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break . In the first big confrontation between the Kid and Howard , the Kid is short $ 2 @,@ 000 ( $ 35 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) and Slade steps in to stake him . Several hours later , Howard busts a player called Pig , perhaps with a bluff , and the remaining players take a break . Following the break , Lady Fingers , who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening , takes over as dealer and continues to needle him . 
 As the game wears on , Shooter only deals , and then after another hand when Howard <unk> them , two more players , Yeller and Sokal , drop out . That leaves just Howard and the Kid . After a few unlikely wins , the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter , who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade . The Kid insists he can win on his own and tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle , destroying Shooter 's reputation . Before the game resumes , Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid . Christian makes a surprise visit to the room , catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid . 
 Slade tells the Kid that Shooter will continue to cheat for him and confronts him with a menacing thug , but the Kid flatly refuses . Back at the game , The Kid maneuvers to have Shooter replaced by Lady Fingers , lying that Shooter is ill . He then wins several major pots from Howard , who is visibly losing confidence .
