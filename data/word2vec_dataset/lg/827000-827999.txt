 The early stages of Alzheimer 's disease are difficult to diagnose . A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities , although the person may still be living independently . The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems , such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non @-@ cognitive disturbances , eliminating any possibility of independent living , especially in the late stages of the disease . 
 Life expectancy of the population with the disease is reduced . The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately six years . Fewer than 3 % of people live more than fourteen years . Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment , decreased functional level , history of falls , and disturbances in the neurological examination . Other coincident diseases such as heart problems , diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival . While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years , life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger . Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women . 
 The disease is the underlying cause of death in 68 % of all cases . Pneumonia and dehydration are the most frequent immediate causes of death brought by AD , while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Two main measures are used in epidemiological studies : incidence and prevalence . Incidence is the number of new cases per unit of person – time at risk ( usually number of new cases per thousand person – years ) ; while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time . 
 Regarding incidence , cohort longitudinal studies ( studies where a disease @-@ free population is followed over the years ) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person – years for all dementias and 5 – 8 for AD , which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD . Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages : every five years after the age of 65 , the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles , increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years . There are also sex differences in the incidence rates , women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85 . The risk of dying from Alzheimer 's disease is twenty @-@ six percent higher among the non @-@ Hispanic white population than among the non @-@ Hispanic black population , whereas the Hispanic population has a thirty percent lower risk than the non @-@ Hispanic white population . 
 Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival . Since the incidence of AD increases with age , it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest . In the United States , Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1 @.@ 6 % in 2000 both overall and in the 65 – 74 age group , with the rate increasing to 19 % in the 75 – 84 group and to 42 % in the greater than 84 group . Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower . The World Health Organization estimated that in 2005 , 0 @.@ 379 % of people worldwide had dementia , and that the prevalence would increase to 0 @.@ 441 % in 2015 and to 0 @.@ 556 % in 2030 . Other studies have reached similar conclusions . Another study estimated that in 2006 , 0 @.@ 40 % of the world population ( range 0 @.@ 17 – 0 @.@ 89 % ; absolute number 26 @.@ 6 million , range 11 @.@ 4 – 59 @.@ 4 million ) were afflicted by AD , and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050 . 
 It may contribute to 60 % to 70 % of cases of dementia . 
 = = History = = 
 The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia . It was not until 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer 's disease in a fifty @-@ year @-@ old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case until she died in 1906 , when he first reported publicly on it . During the next five years , eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature , some of them already using the term Alzheimer 's disease . The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical ( delusions and hallucinations ) and pathological features ( <unk> changes ) contained in the original report of Auguste D. He included Alzheimer 's disease , also named <unk> dementia by Kraepelin , as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry , published on 15 July , 1910 . 
 For most of the 20th century , the diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia . The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of <unk> and senile dementia were almost identical , although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes . This eventually led to the diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease independent of age . The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ( <unk> ) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65 , with classical Alzheimer 's disease being used to describe those who were younger . Eventually , the term Alzheimer 's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern , disease course , and neuropathology .

 = = = Social costs = = = 
 Dementia , and specifically Alzheimer 's disease , may be among the most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States , while their costs in other countries such as Argentina , and South Korea , are also high and rising . These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society , becoming an important social problem . AD @-@ associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care , direct nonmedical costs such as in @-@ home day care , and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver . Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $ 160 billion , while costs of Alzheimer 's disease in the United States may be $ 100 billion each year . 
 The greatest origin of costs for society is the long @-@ term care by health care professionals and particularly institutionalisation , which corresponds to 2 / 3 of the total costs for society . The cost of living at home is also very high , especially when informal costs for the family , such as caregiving time and caregiver 's lost earnings , are taken into account . 
 Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural disturbances , and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care . Therefore , any treatment that slows cognitive decline , delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers ' hours will have economic benefits . Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results . 
 = = = Caregiving burden = = = 
 The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative . Alzheimer 's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social , psychological , physical or economic aspects . Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families . This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care . Nevertheless , two @-@ thirds of nursing home residents have dementias . 
 Dementia caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and mental disorders . Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home , the carer being a spouse , demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression , behavioural disturbances , hallucinations , sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation . Regarding economic problems , family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD , while the costs of caring for them are high . Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer 's patient average between $ 18 @,@ 000 and $ 77 @,@ 500 per year in the United States , depending on the study . 
 Cognitive behavioural therapy and the teaching of coping strategies either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers ' psychological health . 
 = = = Notable cases = = = 
 Because Alzheimer 's disease is common , many notable people have developed it . Well @-@ known examples are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch , both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities deteriorated with the disease . Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Puskás , former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson ( United Kingdom ) and Adolfo Suárez ( Spain ) , Indian politician George Fernandes , actress Rita Hayworth , actor Charlton Heston , actor @-@ director Robert Loggia , author Harnett Kane , Nobel laureate Charles K. Kao , novelist Terry Pratchett , director Jacques Rivette , and politician and activist Sargent Shriver .

 AD has been portrayed in films such as : Iris ( 2001 ) , based on John Bayley 's memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch ; The Notebook ( 2004 ) , based on Nicholas Sparks ' 1996 novel of the same name ; A Moment to Remember ( 2004 ) ; <unk> ( 2005 ) ; Memories of Tomorrow ( Ashita no Kioku ) ( 2006 ) , based on Hiroshi <unk> 's novel of the same name ; Away from Her ( 2006 ) , based on Alice Munro 's short story " The Bear Came over the Mountain " ; Still Alice ( 2014 ) , about a Harvard professor who has early onset Alzheimer 's disease , based on Lisa Genova 's 2007 novel of the same name and featuring Julianne Moore in the title role . Documentaries on Alzheimer 's disease include Malcolm and Barbara : A Love Story ( 1999 ) and Malcolm and Barbara : Love 's Farewell ( 2007 ) , both featuring Malcolm Pointon . 
 = = Research directions = = 
 As of 2014 , the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments had been or were being investigated in over 1 @,@ 500 clinical trials worldwide , and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in Phase III trials , the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies . 
 One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology . Reduction of beta @-@ amyloid levels is a common target of compounds ( such as apomorphine ) under investigation . Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study . Unlike preventative vaccination , the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed . It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise , attack , and reverse deposition of amyloid , thereby altering the course of the disease . An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC @-@ 001 , although the trials were suspended in 2008 . Another similar agent is <unk> , an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti @-@ amyloid antibody . Other approaches are neuroprotective agents , such as AL @-@ 108 , and metal @-@ protein interaction attenuation agents , such as <unk> . A TNFα receptor @-@ blocking fusion protein , etanercept has showed encouraging results . 
 In 2008 , two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with methylthioninium chloride , a drug that inhibits tau aggregation , and dimebon , an antihistamine . The consecutive phase @-@ III trial of dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints . Work with methylthioninium chloride showed that bioavailability of methylthioninium from the gut was affected by feeding and by stomach acidity , leading to unexpectedly variable dosing . A new stabilized formulation , as the prodrug <unk> , is in phase @-@ III trials ( in 2014 ) . 
 The common herpes simplex virus HSV @-@ 1 has been found to <unk> with amyloid plaques . This suggested the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with antiviral medication . 
 Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging . 
 A 2015 review suggests that mindfulness @-@ based interventions may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease . 
 Rare cases of possible transmission between people are being studied , e.g. to growth hormone patients . 
 = = = Imaging = = = 
 Of the many medical imaging techniques available , single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) appears to be superior in differentiating Alzheimer 's disease from other types of dementia , and this has been shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and medical history analysis . Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria . 
 <unk> PET remains investigational , but a similar PET scanning radiopharmaceutical called <unk> , containing the longer @-@ lasting radionuclide fluorine @-@ 18 , has recently been tested as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer 's disease , and given FDA approval for this use . 
 Amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative . Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions . Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer 's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator . It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study . 
 In 2011 An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of <unk> , which is currently used in an investigational study . The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer 's brain plaques , but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially . 
 = = = Early diagnosis = = = 
 Emphasis in Alzheimer 's research has been placed on diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin . A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection . One such test involves the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta @-@ amyloid or tau proteins , both total tau protein and phosphorylated <unk> protein concentrations .

 Lauren Elizabeth Jackson AO ( born 11 May 1981 ) is an Australian former professional basketball player . The daughter of two national basketball team players , Jackson was awarded a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport ( AIS ) in 1997 , when she was 16 . In 1998 , she led the AIS side that won the Women 's National Basketball League ( WNBL ) championship . Jackson joined the Canberra Capitals for the 1999 season when she turned 18 , and played with the team off and on until 2006 , winning four more WNBL championships . From 2010 to 2016 , Jackson played with the Canberra Capitals , which she did during the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) offseason during the time she continued WNBA play . 
 Jackson made the Australian under @-@ 20 team when she was only 14 years old , and was first called up to the Australian Women 's National Basketball Team ( nicknamed The Opals ) when she was 16 years old . She was a member the 2000 Summer Olympics , and 2004 Summer Olympics teams , captain of the 2008 Summer Olympics team , winning three silver medals . She was also part of the Australian team that won the bronze at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Jackson was a member of the Australian Senior Women 's Team that won a silver medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship for Women in China , co @-@ captain of the team that won a gold medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , and captain of the team that won a gold medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship for Women in Brazil . 
 In 2001 , Jackson entered the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) draft and was selected by the Seattle Storm , which viewed Jackson as a franchise player . She has won two WNBA titles with the Storm , in 2004 and 2011 , the latter also earning Jackson the WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award . Jackson ranks among the top WNBA players in played games and minutes , field goals and three point shoots , and turnover percentage . 
 Jackson has played club basketball in Europe with WBC Spartak Moscow in Russia and Ros Casares Valencia in Spain . She has also played with the Women 's Korean Basketball League , where she was named the league 's Most Valuable Player and set a league record scoring 56 points , and the Women 's Chinese Basketball Association . Jackson announced her retirement from basketball on 31 March 2016 , citing a persistent knee injury as the reason for her decision . Besides her basketball career Jackson is in the process of attaining her university degree at the Macquarie University , majoring in gender studies .

 Lauren Elizabeth Jackson , whose nicknames include " Loz " , " Jacko " and " LJ " , was born in Albury , New South Wales , on 11 May 1981 , the oldest of two children of Gary Jackson and his wife Maree Bennie . Both her parents played for Australia 's national basketball teams . Jackson inherited her height from her father , Gary , who played for the Boomers in 1975 , while her mother , Maree , played for the Opals from 1974 to 1982 . She played in two World Championships , and for the women 's basketball team at Louisiana State in the late 1980s , wearing the number 15 , the number Jackson wears in her mother 's honour . She was one of the first Australians to play in the American collegiate system , where she was known for her aggressive style of play and was nicknamed " the assassin " . Her parents continued to play basketball locally on the social level when Lauren and her brother were young , and her family had a basketball court in their backyard when Jackson was growing up . Her grandfather played for the Western Suburbs Magpies . 
 Jackson grew up in Albury , where she attended Murray High School . She earned her Higher School Certificate in Canberra while she was training with the Australian Institute of Sport . Jackson studied for a psychology degree at Lomonosov Moscow State University and continued via correspondence from America . In 2007 she was working on a university course in business management . When she finishes her playing career , Jackson wants to become a basketball administrator . She said " Where I put my time and energy is now crucial . I want to get involved in the political side of sport rather than the media and I need to learn from the people who have been there before . " In 2010 , she was taking classes at Macquarie University in Sydney . Her course work was centred in cultural studies and included topics like women 's rights and racism . Injuries have prevented her from studying around 2010 , but in 2012 , she was back working on her degree , and her aspirations have included becoming a United Nations diplomat . She has also considered becoming an advocate for women . Her interests regarding gender studies were inspired by a book regarding the rape during the Rwandan Genocide , and Jackson is even an <unk> of a foundation that seeks to empower the abused women of that war . 
 As a youngster , Jackson was active in other sports . She was involved in athletics at school and played tennis , which she gave up because competitions conflicted with her ability to play basketball . Similarly , she played on her school netball team , until the age of 14 , giving it up because of basketball commitments . In the off season , Jackson trains by pumping weights . 
 Jackson is 195 centimetres ( 77 in ) tall . She was this tall by the time she turned 16 , after she gained 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in height when she was 15 years old . 
 = = Celebrity = = 
 By 2003 , she was being recognised around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan . She said of her private life : " I don 't really have a private life . I 've found it difficult as an athlete , to maintain a relationship . It 's not one of my best points but I 've got family and friends who compensate for that . When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun , and there were moments when people criticised me for that , and you know what , I 'm young , I 'm going to do that , and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn 't care . " She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons : First , she gets recognised by too many people . Second , everyone wants to comment on her height . In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies , internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved . These rumours were incorrect . Jackson said of them : " When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like , ' Oh ... My ... God ! When I tell you we were in hysterics ... because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind . A 7 foot 8 Chinese man ? That 's just not my thing . I really respect him as a player . And people who know me know I can be wild and over @-@ the @-@ top . I 'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person . I guess the Chinese people don 't do that stuff very often , so the cultural [ differences ] was a big thing . But I don 't care . You have to laugh about things or you 'll be crying , which I would probably have been doing anyway [ because of the loss and surgery ] . I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time . " She partied a fair amount in her early 20s . By 2010 , she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5 : 30 am any more because she lacked the stamina . 
 When people google Jackson , some of the first search results feature her in the nude . Jackson said of this : " Instead of being known for my basketball skills , all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see . " She posed nude in an Australian magazine , Black + White , that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics . The expensively printed magazine / book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and , by the 2004 edition , was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its " artistic " approach to nude photography , and its equal coverage of male and female athletes , although it did create a stir in the United States . She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue . Of posing nude , she said , " if offered the opportunity , I think that it 's a personal decision . Whether you do it for the money or whatever , again , I think it 's a personal decision . I don 't know whether I would say yes or no . I guess you cross that bridge when you come to it . I don 't think it 's a bad thing , I 'm not against it . " 
 Jackson has had multiple injuries . In 2008 , after the Olympics , she had surgery to fix her ankle . In 2009 , she had two stress fractures in her back . In December 2010 , she had an Achilles injury . She sustained the injury playing in Australia . Between January 2011 and February 2012 , she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries . She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail , Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic . She said of the surgery : " This is a really , really tough decision , but after talking with my doctors and my family , we felt that immediate surgery is the best course of action . With something painful like this hip injury , I want to be especially proactive . I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible . My goal is to be at full strength by the end of the season . " She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery . Afterwards , Jackson injured her right knee , requiring surgery in 2012 . Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years , including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected . All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson 's retirement in March . Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction , as " I don 't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life . " 
 As Jackson got older , she took on a more activist role , working for domestic violence charities and helping children from Australia 's outback get involved in sport . In December 2002 , she helped launch the Smith Family Toy Drive at the Canberra Centre with the help of Ainslie school children . She is the patron for the NSW Rape Crisis Centre . She is passionate about preventing domestic abuse . In 2010 , she visited young basketball players at Batemans Bay 's Moruya Basketball .

 Lauren is the most famous basketball player in Australia , a position she reached by 2003 . Prior to this , Australia 's most famous player was Michelle Timms , Australia 's first player of either gender to play internationally . She was recognised as one of the world 's best basketball players by the time she was 21 . She has been described as Australia 's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O 'Neal , and the best female basketball player in the world . She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world : " I don 't really think about it . Nobody really talks to me like that . It 's not something I 'm conscious of . My family and people who have known me all my life , they see me for who I am , and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me . They know I have to train , but the rest of it is really laid @-@ back . "

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Jackson started playing basketball at the Albury Sports Centre when she was four years old . As a six @-@ year @-@ old , she told others that she would one day play for the Australian national team in Basketball . Her mother taught her how to play . She first played competitive basketball as a six @-@ year @-@ old she played on a local under @-@ 10 side . Her mother was her coach for two years . This was difficult for both mother and daughter in order to change their personal dynamics . As an 11 @-@ year @-@ old , Jackson was not the best player in Albury , but she played in the under @-@ 14 Australian Country Championships . Her team made it to the Grand Final one year , and she played in the match despite having hurt her knee . She was upset after the event . In response to this , her parents sat down with her and explained she did not need to continue to play if she did not want to . Following this conversation , she went to her room and typed a message on her computer that said " from this day on , nothing will stand in my way ... " 
 When she was 14 years old , she led her New South Wales side to a national championship gold . Her performance in the tournament attracted the attention of the national team selectors . Tom Maher said of the game : " Right then and there , I said , ' Is this the best thing I 've ever seen ? ' It was just unbelievable . Those old guys had seen a lot of basketball , and they were drooling . " As a competitor at the 1999 Australian Under @-@ 20 national championships , she won the Bob Staunton Award for the tournament MVP . She was described as a basketball prodigy by the time she was seventeen years old . 
 She has played with Robyn Maher , Michelle Timms and Shelley Gorman . Jackson admires them . They all won bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics . Jackson had a rivalry with American basketball player Lisa Leslie . Both women dislike each other , a dislike that goes back to when Jackson was on tour in the United States with the Opals as a 16 @-@ year @-@ old . The rivalry intensified in 2000 at the Olympics in the gold medal match when Jackson accidentally pulled off Leslie 's hair extension when Jackson was trying to grab a rebound . Jackson treated the incident as a joke , saying " It was something to joke about even though we lost the gold medal . " Leslie did not feel the same way about the extension pulling incident . The rivalry continued when Jackson transitioned to the WNBA and her Seattle Storm team played Leslie 's Los Angeles Sparks , who at the time were the best team in the league . The rivalry was so intense that their coaches had to coach around it , sometimes choosing to keep one off the floor when the other was on . The coaches feared if they left the players on the floor together , their own player would foul out in an attempt to get the best of the other player . Leslie and Jackson have played together as team members in the WNBA 's All @-@ Star game . Their relationship thawed some by 2007 but they did not become friends .

Jackson claimed this allowed her to play drama free basketball . In a game with Samsung <unk> against the Kumho Redwings , she scored 56 to set a league record in her team 's 96 – 76 victory . This was a personal best for her in her career . Two weeks prior to the 56 @-@ point record , she scored 47 points in a single game . She competed in the league 's all star game and was declared the Most Valuable Player of the match . She played two games a week with the league .

 Jackson has played club basketball in Europe . She first signed with a European side at the end of the 2005 WNBA season , and went to Russia on a lucrative contract . In 2007 , she was paid six figures American , four times her WNBA base salary , to play with WBC Spartak Moscow Region for one month . Her team mates included other international basketball Olympians : Sue Bird , Diana Taurasi and Tina Thompson . While playing for the team , she lived in a mansion owned by the team 's owner with a view of a nuclear power plant . As a member of the team , she helped Spartak win the 2007 Russian Superleague title . Subsequently , she continued playing for Spartak and won two more Russian Superleague titles with the team , in 2008 and 2009 . She scored 35 points in a EuroLeague Women 2008 in an 11 April 2008 game against <unk> Ekaterinburg while playing for Spartak . This was the most number of points she scored in a single game in a Euroleague game . Subsequently , Jackson played for Spartak in the EuroLeague Women finals in Brno , which her team won . She finished the 2008 season with an average of 23 @.@ 6 points per game and 7 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . 
 In 2009 , Jackson had an option of extending her contract with Spartak for two more years . First , it looked likely that Jackson would stay with Spartak . However , following the assassination of Shabtai <unk> , the owner of the team , she announced in November 2009 that she would stop playing for the team and not extend her contract She subsequently changed her mind and returned to play with the Spartak in 2010 . In the 2009 / 2010 season games she averaged 15 @.@ 2 points per game and 5 @.@ 7 rebounds per game . On 3 December 2010 while playing with Spartak , she was named the EuroLeague Women Player of the Week . Playing in the team 's second match against a Kaunas Lithuanian side , she scored 28 points , had 2 blocks and had 5 rebounds while playing 31 minutes to lead her team to victory after having missed the first game where her team lost . 
 In the 2010 / 2011 season , Jackson played for Spartak where she averaged 17 @.@ 3 points per game and 8 @.@ 4 rebounds per game . She left the team in early January 2011 because of an injury , returning to Australia in order to recover . Part of her treatment involved getting an MRI . According to Jackson , she left Russia for Australia because " I couldn 't move , the swelling was very obvious and the pain was just a little bit too painful . That 's when I got home to all these messages and emails from people back in Australia who had seen the scans and said ' you need to come back ( to Australia ) and start your rehab right away ' . " 
 She played for the Ros Casares Valencia , Spain in 2011 and 2012 . She joined the team in 2011 . It was her first year with a Spanish team . She played in the power forward position with the team . She ranked 16th in the league for 3 @-@ point field goal shooting percentage at 41 @.@ 5 % . She ranked 17th in the league for 3 @-@ point field foals made per game at 1 @.@ 4 .

 " North Star " was the third episode of the season to be directed by David Straiton , while writer David A. Goodman had previously written the episodes " Judgment " and " Precious Cargo " . He also wrote the Star Trek themed Futurama episode " Where No Fan Has Gone Before " . Goodman explained after the episode that he was inspired by The Original Series episodes " A Piece of the Action " and " Patterns of Force " after executive producer Rick Berman set him the challenge of writing a " parallel Earth " story similar to those featured in TOS but would fit with Enterprise . These types of stories were featured in Gene Roddenberry 's original pitch for Star Trek to NBC , which was where humans had evolved societies on other planets similar to our own . 
 Goodman also added a reference to the TOS episode " Spectre of the Gun " with the naming of the character Cronin , but said that the character Kitty was named after a character in the 1940 film Santa Fe Trail rather than the radio / television series Gunsmoke . Goodman later described " North Star " as his favourite episode of the series . It was the third Western @-@ themed episode of Star Trek , after The Original Series 's " Spectre of the Gun " and The Next Generation 's " A Fistful of Datas " . This episode included a number of guest cast members . Emily Bergl appeared as Bethany in " North Star " , having previously appeared in the miniseries Taken , produced by the Sci Fi Channel . Glenn Morshower had previously appeared in episodes of The Next Generation and Voyager , and appeared once more in this episode as Sheriff MacReady . James Parks had also appeared in Voyager , and played Deputy Bennings in " North Star " . 
 It was the first episode to be filmed on location during season three , but the production only moved from the Paramount Studios lot to the Universal Studios backlot where the Western town set " Six Points Texas " was used . The shoot there started on the second day of filming over five days and utilized a number of sets including the main street , livery stable , saloon and schoolhouse . The sets have been used to film more movies than any other set in the world ; the livery stable in particular was used in the 1940 film My Little <unk> . A shuttlepod set @-@ piece was brought from Paramount Studios and was used for filming scenes after it had landed , while in @-@ air shots were added with special effects after filming was completed . 
 Twelve horses were used , and due to safety considerations , in some scenes stunt doubles undertook the action scenes where main cast members were required to ride on horseback . The episode was heavy on the number of stunts , which were supervised by Vince Deadrick , Jr . Scenes using the standing sets at Paramount were filmed on the first and last days of shooting , which overlapped with the first day of shooting of the following episode , " Similitude " . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " North Star " was first aired on November 12 , 2003 on UPN . It received a 2 @.@ 6 / 4 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 6 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 4 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This was the same as the ratings received by the previous episode entitled " Twilight " , but showed a loss of 200 @,@ 000 viewers overall . " North Star " received lower ratings than the following episode " Similitude " , which received a ratings share of 3 @.@ 0 / 5 % . 
 Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation , saying that she was expecting something similar to The Original Series episode " Spectre of the Gun " but was pleased to find it was more similar to Voyager 's " The 37 's " . She said that , " because the episode is stylish and beautifully paced , the morality play doesn 't get too heavy @-@ handed or silly " , but felt that it was one @-@ sided because of the lack of information on the Skagarans . She summed up the " North Star " by describing it as a " fun , throw away " episode . Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website " Jammer 's Reviews " described it as a " shallow Trek adventure by the numbers " which was " all about setting and rarely about substance " . He gave it a score of two out of four . When Epsicokhan was summing up the whole of season three , " North Star " was described as one of the mediocre episodes in the season . 
 " North Star " was released as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The season was released on Blu @-@ ray in the United States on January 7 , 2014 .

 Michael Anthony Monsoor ( April 5 , 1981 – September 29 , 2006 ) was a United States Navy SEAL who was killed during the Iraq War and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . Monsoor enlisted in the United States Navy in 2001 and graduated from Basic Underwater Demolition / SEAL training in 2004 . After further training he was assigned to Delta Platoon , SEAL Team 3 . 
 Delta Platoon was sent to Iraq in April 2006 and assigned to train Iraqi Army soldiers in Ramadi . Over the next five months , Monsoor and his platoon frequently engaged in combat with insurgent forces . On September 29 , 2006 , an insurgent threw a grenade onto a rooftop where Monsoor and several other SEALs and Iraqi soldiers were positioned . Monsoor quickly smothered the grenade with his body , absorbing the resulting explosion and saving his comrades from serious injury or death . Monsoor died about 30 minutes later from serious wounds caused by the grenade explosion . 
 On March 31 , 2008 , the United States Department of Defense confirmed that Michael Monsoor would posthumously receive the Medal of Honor . U.S. President George W. Bush presented the medal to Monsoor 's parents on April 8 , 2008 . In October 2008 , Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter announced that DDG @-@ 1001 , the second ship in the Zumwalt @-@ class of guided missile destroyers , would be named Michael Monsoor in his honor .

 During Operation Kentucky Jumper , SEAL Team Three was sent to Ramadi , Iraq in April 2006 and assigned to train Iraqi Army soldiers . As a communicator and machine @-@ gunner on patrols , Monsoor carried 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) of gear in temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees . He took a lead position to protect the platoon from frontal assault and the team was frequently involved in engagements with insurgent fighters . During the first five months of deployment , the team reportedly killed 84 insurgents . 
 During an engagement on May 9 , 2006 , Monsoor ran into a street while under continuous insurgent gunfire to rescue an injured comrade . Monsoor was awarded the Silver Star for this action , and was also awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq . 
 = = Death = = 
 On September 29 , 2006 , Monsoor 's platoon engaged four insurgents in a firefight , killing one and injuring another . Anticipating further attacks , Monsoor , three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers took up a rooftop position . Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets , and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people to fight against the Americans and the Iraqi soldiers . Monsoor was protecting other SEALs , two of whom were 15 feet away from him . Monsoor 's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route . 
 A grenade was thrown onto the rooftop by an insurgent on the street below . The grenade hit Monsoor in the chest and fell onto the floor . Immediately , Monsoor yelled " Grenade ! " and jumped onto the grenade , covering it with his body . The grenade exploded seconds later and Monsoor 's body absorbed most of the force of the blast . Monsoor was severely wounded and although evacuated immediately , he died 30 minutes later . Two other SEALs next to him at the time were injured by the explosion but survived . 
 Monsoor died on September 29 , 2006 , in ar @-@ Ramadi , Iraq , and was described as a " quiet professional " and a " fun @-@ loving guy " by those who knew him . He is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego .

 During the funeral , as the coffin was moving from the hearse to the grave site , Navy SEALs were lined up forming a column of twos on both sides of the pallbearers route , with the coffin moving up the center . As the coffin passed each SEAL , they slapped down the gold Trident each had removed from his own uniform and deeply embedded it into the wooden coffin . For nearly 30 minutes the slaps were audible from across the cemetery as nearly every SEAL on the West Coast repeated the act . 
 The display moved many attending the funeral , including President Bush , who spoke about the incident later during a speech stating : " The procession went on nearly half an hour , and when it was all over , the simple wooden coffin had become a gold @-@ plated memorial to a hero who will never be forgotten . ”

 = Little Boy = 
 " Little Boy " was the codename for the type of atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 by the Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress Enola Gay , piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets , Jr . , commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces . It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare . The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history , after the Trinity test , and the first uranium @-@ based detonation . It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT ( 63 TJ ) . The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima . 
 Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group of Captain William S. Parsons 's Ordnance ( O ) Division at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II . Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer . The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb . Like Thin Man , it was a gun @-@ type fission weapon , but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium @-@ 235 . This was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium ( the " bullet " ) onto a solid cylinder of the same material ( the " target " ) by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder . It contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium , of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission . Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . 
 After the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed , but by mid @-@ 1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect , so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base . The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft ( which could be launched from but not land on the Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers ) . All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951 . 
 = = Naming = = 
 The names for all three atomic bomb design projects during World War II — Fat Man , Thin Man , and Little Boy — were created by Robert Serber , a former student of Los Alamos Laboratory director Robert Oppenheimer who worked on the Manhattan Project . According to Serber , he chose them based on their design shapes . The " Thin Man " was a long device , and its name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel and series of movies of the same name . The " Fat Man " was round and fat , and was named after Sydney Greenstreet 's " Kasper Gutman " character in The Maltese Falcon . Little Boy came last , and was named after Elisha Cook , Jr . ' s character in the same film , as referred to by Humphrey Bogart . 
 = = Development = = 
 Because uranium @-@ 235 was known to be fissionable , it was the first approach to bomb development pursued . As the first design developed ( as well as the first deployed for combat ) , it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work came in the form of the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon , since uranium @-@ 235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium . Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , where the electromagnetic separation plant , known as Y @-@ 12 , became fully operational in March 1944 . The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944 . 
 Most of the uranium necessary for the production of the bomb came from the Shinkolobwe mine and was made available thanks to the foresight of the CEO of the High Katanga Mining Union , Edgar Sengier , who had 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) of uranium ore transported to a New York warehouse in 1939 . At least part of the 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 200 t ) of uranium ore and uranium oxide captured by the Alsos Mission in 1944 and 1945 was used in the bomb . 
 Little Boy was a simplification of Thin Man , the previous gun @-@ type fission weapon design . Thin Man , 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) long , was designed to use plutonium , so it was also more than capable of using enriched uranium . The Thin Man design was abandoned after experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P @-@ 5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor @-@ produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 . This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than the cyclotron @-@ produced plutonium on which the original measurements had been made , and its inclusion in reactor @-@ bred plutonium appeared unavoidable . This meant that the background fission rate of the plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely the plutonium would predetonate and blow itself apart in the initial forming of a critical mass . 
 In July 1944 , almost all research at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion @-@ type plutonium weapon . Overall responsibility for the uranium gun @-@ type weapon was assigned to Captain William S. Parsons 's Ordnance ( O ) Division . All the design , development , and technical work at Los Alamos was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch 's group . 
 In contrast to the plutonium implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun @-@ type fission weapon , the uranium gun @-@ type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design . The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop a plutonium bomb , it would still be possible to use the gun principle . The gun @-@ type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only , and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified . A high @-@ velocity gun was no longer required , and a simpler weapon could be substituted . The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B @-@ 29 bomb bay . 
 The design specifications were completed in February 1945 , and contracts were let to build the components . Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design . The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington , D.C. ; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line , Michigan ; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit , Michigan . The bomb , except for the uranium payload , was ready at the beginning of May 1945 . The uranium 235 projectile was completed on 15 June , and the target on 24 July . The target and bomb pre @-@ assemblies ( partly assembled bombs without the fissile components ) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard , California , on 16 July aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis , arriving 26 July . The target inserts followed by air on 30 July . 
 Although all of its components had been tested , no full test of a gun @-@ type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima . The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion @-@ type device employing plutonium as its fissile material , and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test . There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device . Primarily , there was little uranium @-@ 235 as compared with the relatively large amount of plutonium which , it was expected , could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors . Additionally , the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun @-@ type assembly . Unlike the implosion design , which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges , the gun @-@ type design was considered almost certain to work . 
 The danger of accidental detonation made safety a concern . Little Boy incorporated basic safety mechanisms , but an accidental detonation could still occur . Tests were conducted to see whether a crash could drive the hollow " bullet " onto the " target " cylinder resulting in a massive release of radiation , or possibly nuclear detonation . These showed that this required an impact of 500 times that of gravity , which made it highly unlikely . There was still concern that a crash and a fire could trigger the explosives . If immersed in water , the uranium halves were subject to a neutron moderator effect . While this would not have caused an explosion , it could have created widespread radioactive contamination . For this reason , pilots were advised to crash on land rather than at sea . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Little Boy was 120 inches ( 300 cm ) in length , 28 inches ( 71 cm ) in diameter and weighed approximately 9 @,@ 700 pounds ( 4 @,@ 400 kg ) . The design used the gun method to explosively force a hollow sub @-@ critical mass of uranium @-@ 235 and a solid target cylinder together into a super @-@ critical mass , initiating a nuclear chain reaction . This was accomplished by shooting one piece of the uranium onto the other by means of four cylindrical silk bags of cordite . The bomb contained 64 kg ( 141 lb ) of enriched uranium . Most was enriched to 89 % but some was only 50 % uranium @-@ 235 , for an average enrichment of 80 % . Less than a kilogram of uranium underwent nuclear fission , and of this mass only 0 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 021 oz ) was transformed into several forms of energy , mostly kinetic energy , but also heat and radiation . 
 = = = Assembly details = = = 
 Inside the weapon , the uranium @-@ 235 material was divided into two parts , following the gun principle : the " projectile " and the " target " . The projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60 % of the total mass ( 38 @.@ 5 kg ( 85 lb ) ) . It consisted of a stack of 9 uranium rings , each 6 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 159 mm ) in diameter with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) bore in the center , and a total length of 7 inches ( 180 mm ) , pressed together into the front end of a thin @-@ walled projectile 16 @.@ 25 inches ( 413 mm ) long . Filling in the remainder of the space behind these rings in the projectile was a tungsten carbide disc with a steel back . At ignition , the projectile slug was pushed 42 inches ( 1 @,@ 100 mm ) along the 72 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 800 mm ) long , 6 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 170 mm ) smooth @-@ bore gun barrel . The slug " insert " was a 4 inches ( 100 mm ) cylinder , 7 inches ( 180 mm ) in length with a 1 inch ( 25 mm ) axial hole . The slug comprised 40 % of the total fissile mass ( 25 @.@ 6 kg or 56 lb ) . The insert was a stack of 6 washer @-@ like uranium discs somewhat thicker than the projectile rings that were slid over a 1 inch ( 25 mm ) rod . This rod then extended forward through the tungsten carbide tamper plug , impact @-@ absorbing anvil , and nose plug backstop eventually protruding out the front of the bomb casing . This entire target assembly was secured at both ends with <unk> . 
 When the hollow @-@ front projectile reached the target and slid over the target insert , the assembled super @-@ critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel , both materials having a combined mass of 2 @,@ 300 kg ( 5 @,@ 100 lb ) . Neutron initiators at the base of the projectile were activated by the impact . 
 = = = Counter @-@ intuitive design = = = 
 For the first fifty years after 1945 , every published description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small , solid projectile was fired into the center of a larger , stationary target . However , critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger , hollow piece would be the projectile . The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium 235 . This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass , with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron @-@ reflecting tungsten carbide tamper . 
 A hole in the center of the larger piece dispersed the mass and increased the surface area , allowing more fission neutrons to escape , thus preventing a premature chain reaction . But , for this larger , hollow piece to have minimal contact with the tamper , it must be the projectile , since only the projectile 's back end was in contact with the tamper prior to detonation . The rest of the tungsten carbide surrounded the sub @-@ critical mass target cylinder ( called the " insert " by the designers ) with air space between it and the insert . This arrangement packs the maximum amount of fissile material into a gun @-@ assembly design . 
 = = = Fuze system = = = 
 The bomb employed a fusing system that was designed to detonate the bomb at the most destructive altitude . Calculations showed that for the largest destructive effect , the bomb should explode at an altitude of 580 metres ( 1 @,@ 900 ft ) . The resultant fuze design was a three @-@ stage interlock system : 
 A timer ensured that the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release , one @-@ quarter of the predicted fall time , to ensure safety of the aircraft . The timer was activated when the electrical pull @-@ out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell , switching it to internal ( 24V battery ) power and starting the timer . At the end of the 15 seconds , the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage . 
 The purpose of the barometric stage was to delay activating the radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude . A thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber ( a similar design is still used today in old @-@ fashioned wall barometers ) gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent . The barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate the bomb at the precise ignition height , because air pressure varies with local conditions . When the bomb reached the design height for this stage ( reportedly 2 @,@ 000 metres , 6 @,@ 600 ft ) , the membrane closed a circuit , activating the radar altimeters . The barometric stage was added because of a worry that external radar signals might detonate the bomb too early . 
 Two or more redundant radar altimeters were used to reliably detect final altitude . When the altimeters sensed the correct height , the firing switch closed , igniting the three BuOrd <unk> , Mod 1 Navy gun primers in the breech plug , which set off the charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing two pounds of WM slotted @-@ tube cordite . This launched the uranium projectile towards the opposite end of the gun barrel at an eventual muzzle velocity of 300 metres per second ( 980 ft / s ) . Approximately 10 milliseconds later the chain reaction occurred , lasting less than 1 microsecond . The radar altimeters used were modified U.S. Army Air Corps APS @-@ 13 tail warning radars , nicknamed " Archie " , normally used to warn a fighter pilot of another plane approaching from behind .

Tibbets , the commander of the 509th Composite Group . Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July , using the L @-@ 2 and L @-@ 5 units in order to test all components . Tibbets was the pilot for both missions , but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit . L @-@ 6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July . The B @-@ 29 Next Objective , piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney , flew to Iwo Jima , where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced . This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July , but this time L @-@ 6 was reloaded onto a different B @-@ 29 , Enola Gay , piloted by Tibbets , and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian . L @-@ 11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb . 
 = = Bombing of Hiroshima = = 
 Parsons , the Enola Gay 's weaponeer , was concerned about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed in takeoff , so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight . Parsons and his assistant , Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson , made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side . Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires , removed the breech plug , inserted the powder bags , replaced the breech plug , and reconnected the wires . Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target , Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red . The bomb was then fully armed . Jeppson monitored the bomb 's circuits . 
 The bomb was dropped at approximately 08 : 15 ( JST ) 6 August 1945 . After falling for 44 @.@ 4 seconds , the time and barometric triggers started the firing mechanism . The detonation happened at an altitude of 1 @,@ 968 ± 50 feet ( 600 ± 15 m ) . It was less powerful than the Fat Man , which was dropped on Nagasaki , but the damage and the number of victims at Hiroshima were much higher , as Hiroshima was on flat terrain , while the hypocenter of Nagasaki lay in a small valley . According to figures published in 1945 , 66 @,@ 000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast , and 69 @,@ 000 were injured to varying degrees . Of those deaths , 20 @,@ 000 were members of the Imperial Japanese Army . 
 The exact measurement of the yield was problematic , since the weapon had never been tested . President Harry S. Truman officially announced that the yield was 20 kilotons of TNT ( 84 TJ ) . This was based on Parsons 's visual assessment that the blast was greater than what he had seen at the Trinity nuclear test . Since that had been estimated at 18 kilotons of TNT ( 75 TJ ) , speech writers rounded up to 20 kilotons . Further discussion was then suppressed , for fear of lessening the impact of the bomb on the Japanese . Data had been collected by Luis Alvarez , Harold Agnew , and Lawrence H. Johnston on the instrument plane , The Great Artiste , but this was not used to calculate the yield at the time . 
 After hostilities ended , a survey team from the Manhattan Project that included William Penney , Robert Serber , and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate the effects of the blast . From evaluating the effects on objects and structures , Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons . Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons . In 1953 , Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons . This figure became the official yield . 
 = = = Project Ichiban = = = 
 In 1962 , scientists at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as " Project Ichiban " in order to answer some of the unanswered questions , but it failed to clear up all the issues . In 1982 , Los Alamos created a replica Little Boy from the original drawings and specifications . This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion . A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile , and experiments were run to assess neutron emission . Based on this and the data from The Great Artiste , the yield was estimated at 16 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 3 kilotons . After considering many estimation methods , a 1985 report concluded that the yield was 15 kilotons ± 20 % . 
 When 1 pound ( 0 @.@ 45 kg ) of uranium @-@ 235 undergoes complete fission , the yield is 8 kilotons . The 16 kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 91 kg ) of uranium @-@ 235 , out of the 141 pounds ( 64 kg ) in the pit . The remaining 139 pounds ( 63 kg ) , 98 @.@ 5 % of the total , contributed nothing to the energy yield . 
 = = Physical effects of the bomb = = 
 After being selected in April 1945 , Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target , where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed . While damage could be studied later , the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation , using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb . Radio @-@ transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons . 
 Comparing this yield to the observed damage produced a rule of thumb called the 5 psi lethal area rule . Approximately 100 % of people inside the area where the shock wave carries an overpressure of 5 psi or greater would be killed . At Hiroshima , that area was 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) in diameter . 
 The damage came from three main effects : blast , fire , and radiation . 
 = = = Blast = = = 
 The blast from a nuclear bomb is the result of X @-@ ray @-@ heated air ( the fireball ) sending a shock wave or pressure wave in all directions , initially at a velocity greater than the speed of sound , analogous to thunder generated by lightning . Knowledge about urban blast destruction is based largely on studies of Little Boy at Hiroshima . Nagasaki buildings suffered similar damage at similar distances , but the Nagasaki bomb detonated 3 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) from the city center over hilly terrain that was partially bare of buildings . 
 In Hiroshima almost everything within 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 0 mi ) of the point directly under the explosion was completely destroyed , except for about 50 heavily reinforced , earthquake @-@ resistant concrete buildings , only the shells of which remained standing . Most were completely gutted , with their windows , doors , sashes , and frames ripped out . The perimeter of severe blast damage approximately followed the 5 psi ( 34 kPa ) contour at 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) . 
 Later test explosions of nuclear weapons with houses and other test structures nearby confirmed the 5 psi overpressure threshold . Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed , toppled , or gutted by the force of air pressure . The picture at right shows the effects of a nuclear @-@ bomb @-@ generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in Nevada in 1953 . 
 A major effect of this kind of structural damage was that it created fuel for fires that were started simultaneously throughout the severe destruction region . 
 = = = Fire = = = 
 The first effect of the explosion was blinding light , accompanied by radiant heat from the fireball . The Hiroshima fireball was 370 metres ( 1 @,@ 200 ft ) in diameter , with a surface temperature of 6 @,@ 000 ° C ( 10 @,@ 830 ° F ) . Near ground zero , everything flammable burst into flame . One famous , anonymous Hiroshima victim , sitting on stone steps 260 metres ( 850 ft ) from the hypocenter , left only a shadow , having absorbed the fireball heat that permanently bleached the surrounding stone . Simultaneous fires were started throughout the blast @-@ damaged area by fireball heat and by overturned stoves and furnaces , electrical shorts , etc . Twenty minutes after the detonation , these fires had merged into a firestorm , pulling in surface air from all directions to feed an inferno which consumed everything flammable . 
 The Hiroshima firestorm was roughly 3 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) in diameter , corresponding closely to the severe blast damage zone . ( See the USSBS map , right . ) Blast @-@ damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire . Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about . Debris @-@ choked roads obstructed fire fighters . Broken gas pipes fueled the fire , and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless . At Nagasaki , the fires failed to merge into a single firestorm , and the fire @-@ damaged area was only one fourth as great as at Hiroshima , due in part to a southwest wind that pushed the fires away from the city . 
 As the map shows , the Hiroshima firestorm jumped natural firebreaks ( river channels ) , as well as prepared firebreaks . The spread of fire stopped only when it reached the edge of the blast @-@ damaged area , encountering less available fuel . 
 Accurate casualty figures are impossible to determine , because many victims were cremated by the firestorm , along with all record of their existence . The Manhattan Project report on Hiroshima estimated that 60 % of immediate deaths were caused by fire , but with the caveat that " many persons near the center of explosion suffered fatal injuries from more than one of the bomb effects . " In particular , many fire victims also received lethal doses of nuclear radiation . 
 = = = Radiation = = = 
 Local fallout is dust and ash from a bomb crater , contaminated with radioactive fission products . It falls to earth downwind of the crater and can produce , with radiation alone , a lethal area much larger than that from blast and fire . With an air burst , the fission products rise into the stratosphere , where they dissipate and become part of the global environment . Because Little Boy was an air burst 580 metres ( 1 @,@ 900 ft ) above the ground , there was no bomb crater and no local radioactive fallout . 
 However , a burst of intense neutron and gamma radiation came directly from the fireball . Its lethal radius was 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 8 mi ) , covering about half of the firestorm area . An estimated 30 % of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation , but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent . Over 6 @,@ 000 people survived the blast and fire , but died of radiation injuries . Among injured survivors , 30 % had radiation injuries from which they recovered , but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk . To date , no radiation @-@ related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors ' children . 
 = = = Conventional weapon equivalent = = = 
 Although Little Boy exploded with the energy equivalent of 16 @,@ 000 tons of TNT , the Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the same blast and fire effect could have been caused by only 2 @,@ 100 tons of conventional bombs : " 220 B @-@ 29s carrying 1 @,@ 200 tons of incendiary bombs , 400 tons of high @-@ explosive bombs , and 500 tons of anti @-@ personnel fragmentation bombs . " Since the target was spread across a two @-@ dimensional plane , the vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted . A cluster bomb pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy @-@ efficient match to the target . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 When the war ended , it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required , and many plans and diagrams were destroyed . However , by mid @-@ 1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect . Faced with the prospect of no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced , Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found . No Little Boy assemblies were available , and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found , although there were drawings of the various components , and stocks of spare parts . 
 At Sandia Base , three Army officers , Captains Albert Bethel , Richard Meyer and Bobbie Griffin attempted to re @-@ create the Little Boy . They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ , an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian , and was now leader of the Z @-@ 11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory 's Z Division at Sandia . Gradually , they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts , and figured out how they went together . Eventually , they built six Little Boy assemblies . Although the casings , barrels , and components were tested , no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs . By early 1947 , the problem caused by the Wigner effect was on its way to solution , and the three officers were reassigned . 
 The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the nuclear @-@ capable Lockheed P2V Neptune aircraft carrier aircraft ( which could be launched from but not land on the Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers ) . Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello , Idaho , and Louisville , Kentucky . Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets , although there were only enough initiators for six . All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951 . 
 The Smithsonian Institution displays a Little Boy ; it was complete , except for enriched uranium , until 1986 . The Department of Energy took the weapon from the museum to remove its inner components , so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material . The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993 . Three other disarmed bombs are on display in the United States ; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London .

 Jab Tak Hai Jaan ( English : As Long as I Live , literally " as long , or as far , as there is life " ) is a 2012 Indian romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by Aditya Chopra under their production banner , Yash Raj Films . It features Shah Rukh Khan , Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma in lead roles . The movie is the first collaboration between Khan and Kaif , and the second between Khan and Sharma ( they previously featured in the 2008 film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi ) . Yash Chopra returned to directing eight years after Veer @-@ Zaara . This was to be his final film before his death in October 2012 , at age 80 . The background score and soundtrack was composed by A.R. Rahman , with lyrics from Gulzar . 
 Set in London , England , Jab Tak Hai Jaan tells the story of Akira Rai ( Anushka Sharma ) , an ambitious , hardworking intern at the Discovery Channel . Akira finds the diary of Samar Anand ( Shah Rukh Khan ) , a bomb @-@ disposal expert . The diary recounts Samar 's time as a struggling immigrant to London , and later details his whirlwind romance with Meera Thapar ( Katrina Kaif ) . The film was released during the six @-@ day Diwali weekend beginning on 13 November 2012 . The movie received positive @-@ to @-@ mixed reviews from critics in India and positive reviews overseas . It opened well at the box office , and Box Office India declared the film a " hit " in India and a " blockbuster " overseas . Jab Tak Hai Jaan emerged as the third @-@ highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film overseas at that time , after 3 Idiots and My Name Is Khan ( 2010 ) . 
 The film was praised for its direction , cinematography and the chemistry between its lead actors . Khan and Sharma were lauded for their performances , though the movie 's predictable plot drew criticism . At the end of its theatrical run Jab Tak Hai Jaan received a number of awards , including four Filmfare Awards , which included trophies for Best Supporting Actress ( Anushka Sharma ) and Best Lyrics for Gulzar . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Samar Anand ( Shahrukh Khan ) , a major in the Indian Army , defuses a bomb in Ladakh without fear or regard for his safety . Akira Rai ( Anushka Sharma ) , a Discovery Channel filmmaker , dives into a river in Ladakh on a dare and soon regrets it after learning she has plunged into freezing water . Samar , who happens to be by the shore , rescues her . Samar gives her his jacket and leaves without retrieving it . Later , Akira finds his diary in the jacket pocket and begins reading . 
 The diary recounts Samar 's earlier years as a struggling immigrant in London , working as a busker who also performs other odd jobs to support himself and his roommate Zain ( <unk> Hashmi ) . One day while cleaning snow outside a church , he sees Meera Thapar ( Katrina Kaif ) for the first time and instantly begins to like her . Samar is working part @-@ time as a waiter when he meets Meera again at her and her fiance Roger 's engagement party . Samar is a little bit disheartened seeing that . Meera grew up , motherless , in an affluent Indian family . Meera 's mother ( Neetu Singh ) left her family for another man ( Rishi Kapoor ) when Meera was twelve . This leaves the dominant parental figure in her life to be her father ( Anupam Kher ) , for whose company she works . Meera approached Samar to teach her a beautiful Punjabi song for her father 's 50th birthday and in return Samar asks Meera to give him language <unk> for one <unk> , Samar founds out the real naughty Meera inside Meera . Samar notices that Meera often prays when he sees her at church , and after a night of wild street dancing , Samar and Meera begin to fall in love . Samar helps Meera face her past , taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation . Some days later Meera decides to confess to her father about her relationship with Samar and break her engagement , but Samar has a serious accident on his motorbike . Meera , believing she is the cause of Samar 's spate of bad luck , prays to God to save his life and promises never to see him again . Samar recovers and Meera admits her vow to him . Angry , he leaves her and even London . Samar challenges God to keep him alive while he risks his life every day , because he believes his death is the only way to make Meera lose her faith in God . He goes to India and enlists in the army , becoming a bomb @-@ disposal expert . 
 When Akira finishes reading the diary , she obtains permission to make a documentary about bomb @-@ disposal squads . She asks Samar for help to make her film and develops an acquaintance with him and his team . Akira develops a crush on Samar ; however , he does not reciprocate her feelings owing to his unresolved passion for Meera . Akira makes a successful film and prepares to leave for London . She wants Samar come along to help her publicise the documentary . After he reluctantly agrees to come to London , he is struck by a car . 
 Samar is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia , and he remembers only the events before his first accident a decade ago . Concerned , Akira tracks Meera down and persuades her to aid in Samar 's recovery . Meera agrees , pretending to be Samar 's wife . In the meantime , Akira realises that Major Samar is only a fragment of the young Samar ; he used to be happy and sociable , but is now bitter and lonely . One day Samar finds a bomb planted in the London Underground , and helps defuse it . The event jogs his memory , and he realises that Meera is lying to him . Samar confronts Meera with a choice : to either be with him honestly , or to see him keep risking his life until he is dead . Meera is unable to give a definitive answer ; heartbroken , Samar leaves for Kashmir , where he continues defusing bombs . During a conversation with Akira , Meera realises that her beliefs and prayers subjected Samar to a fate worse than death ; realising her mistake , she goes to Kashmir and they reunite . Samar defuses his last bomb , and then proposes to her .

 In June 2011 , Yash Raj Films released a statement announcing a new directorial venture by Yash Chopra coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his Bollywood career . The producers also announced that the film would be released during the Diwali 2012 weekend . Chopra said the film was untitled at that time , similar to previous project Veer @-@ Zaara ( which was named on the day of its submission to the Central Board of Film Certification ) . The producers considered a number of titles but were not satisfied with any of them . In September 2012 , it was announced that the title of the film was Jab Tak Hai Jaan . It was inspired by a similarly titled song from the 1975 film , Sholay . 
 Aditya Chopra wanted his father , Yash Chopra , to make another film and approached him with the concept for Jab Tak Hai Jaan . Shah Rukh Khan was their first choice for the role of Samar Anand , due to his long @-@ standing relationship with the production house and the Chopra family . Khan , who was working on other projects at that time , was unavailable for the shooting schedule so it was changed . As in his previous productions , Yash Chopra wanted to introduce a fresh pairing in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and chose Katrina Kaif to star with Khan . Anushka Sharma was cast in a supporting role to complete her three @-@ film contract with Yash Raj Films , with whom she had worked on many previous projects . Though casting was quickly completed , shooting was delayed because the lead actors were busy with other projects . 
 Khan 's role spans two ages : one ( age 28 ) as a London @-@ based street musician and the other ( ten years later ) as an introverted , composed and dutiful army officer in Kashmir . In an interview , Khan revealed details about his character : Samar is " angry , unforgiving , with loads of emotional baggage . I play him sweet when he needs to be . Actually , he is a lot like I am . Samar is a combination of angst , tenderness , anger , and yeah , he ’ s pretty unforgiving . " 
 Kaif 's role was described as " the archetypal Yash Chopra seductress , an unattainable beauty " . She worked hard to make her character believable ( with help from Khan , who had previous experience with the director ) . Sharma 's character , Akira , was described as a " 21 @-@ year @-@ old who works for the Discovery Channel and makes documentaries . She is on a quest to discover the truth behind the story of The Man Who Cannot Die ( Samar Anand ) in the film . She is extremely ambitious and will do anything to make it big and realize her dreams . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The film 's principal photography was expected to begin in November 2011 but was delayed because Khan wanted to take a break after his two previous films , Ra.One and Don 2 . Principal photography began on 9 January 2012 at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai , where a significant part of was shot . 
 After filming in India , the crew began a 35 @-@ day shooting schedule in London on 22 February 2012 . It was shot under the working title Production 45 . Khan arrived in London on 21 February 2012 , and finished filming on 26 March 2012 . During the filming , photos of the actors on @-@ set were leaked on the Internet , triggering a camera ban by the producers and increased security . A number of locations throughout the city featured in Jab Tak Hai Jaan , including the Borough Market , Jubilee Walk , the Great Conservatory , the Palace of Westminster , Westminster Bridge , Trafalgar Square , the Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges , the O2 Arena , the Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf . A dance sequence was filmed next to the law school of King 's College London in Somerset House . A car @-@ crash scene was filmed at Shepherd 's Bush by closing four streets in the area . Filming was completed on 27 March 2012 at an indoor location in East London . 
 The romantic scenes were directed by Chopra 's son , Aditya , to give them a more contemporary feel . The " Ishq Shava " dance scene was shot with the leading duo and freestyle dancers in an underground club and aboard a boat on the River Thames . The film 's climax , initially planned by Chopra to be shot in the mountains of Kashmir , was moved to Ladakh . This was reportedly suggested by Khan , whose Dil Se .. was shot in the area many years earlier . Portions of Jab Tak Hai Jaan were filmed in three Kashmiri cities : Srinagar , <unk> and Gulmarg . 
 Yash Chopra wanted to add scenes from the Swiss Alps to the title song ; however , the scheduled shoot was cancelled after his death . Aditya Chopra wanted to keep the film as it was because he felt that doing otherwise would " tamper " with his father 's vision .

 A preliminary trailer was released with Ek Tha Tiger and through the company 's official YouTube channel on 15 August 2012 . The 90 @-@ second clip featured glimpses of Yash Chopra 's successful , acclaimed directorial ventures and highlighted his upcoming film , incorporating the prelude of " Challa " as background music . The film remained untitled : A Yash Chopra Romance . The trailer had over one million views in less than three days . 
 The two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute main theatrical trailer , with the film 's title , was released on 20 September 2012 on Yash Raj Films ' YouTube channel . It received a million views on the first day and thirty thousand " likes " within a week ( surpassing the record held by The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn – Part 2 ) , making it the first film trailer to have so many views so quickly . The trailer recorded more than eight million views on YouTube , making it the most @-@ watched Bollywood film trailer at that time . 
 Following the trailer 's success , Yash Raj Films released promotional videos of songs on YouTube and Bollywood Hungama . " Challa " , " Saans " , " Jiya Re " , " Heer " and " Ishq Shava " were well received . The marketing also involved public appearances by Kaif , Khan and Sharma . A premiere of Jab Tak Hai Jaan was held on 12 November 2012 ( a day before its worldwide release ) in honour of Yash Chopra .

 The music for the film was composed by A.R. Rahman , who teamed up with Yash Chopra for the first time . He signed to compose the soundtrack in May 2011 . The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011 . By February 2012 , Rahman said in an interview with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film . He summarized the soundtrack album : " It 's a combination . They wanted to do my kind of songs at the same time they wanted the old charm and soul of music that Indian audience would love and which I wanted to do for a long time . " The soundtrack features nine songs , with eight lyrics by Gulzar and the title track written by Aditya Chopra . It was released by YRF Music on 9 October 2012 .

 Two weeks before Jab Tak Hai Jaan 's release , Ajay Devgn sent a notice to the Competition Commission of India accusing Yash Raj Films of monopolistic business practices ; the notice contended that they used " their dominant position in the Bollywood film market " to secure many desirable single @-@ screen theatres for their release . Yash Raj Films responded by saying that they were " shocked " and questioned Devgn 's " motives " . The studio denied Devgn 's claim that high @-@ quality single @-@ screens were unavailable , pointing out that they had only booked 1 @,@ 500 single @-@ screens for Jab Tak Hai Jaan out of the 10 @,@ 500 available in India . After the rebuttal by Yash Raj Films , Devgn said he only managed to book 600 single @-@ screens for Son of Sardaar and would take legal action if not allotted more . He accused Yash Raj Films of signing tie @-@ in agreements for Ek Tha Tiger with exhibitors , requiring them to show Jab Tak Hai Jaan on Diwali and keep it in cinemas for at least two weeks thereafter . A week before the release of Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Son of Sardaar , the commission dismissed Devgn 's claim . In an interview a commission spokesperson said , " We considered the plea application . We have not found any merit in the case as there is no case of abuse of dominant position . There is no violation . " After his notice was rejected , Devgn appealed the decision ; the Appellate Tribunal refused Devgn 's request to nullify agreements made with single @-@ screen exhibitors for the release of Jab Tak Hai Jaan , but agreed to reexamine the case to determine if Yash Raj Films engaged in monopolistic practices . Both films were released on 13 November 2012 in the number of single @-@ screens originally contracted .

Priya Joshi of Digital Spy gave it 3 ( out of 5 ) stars : " The film is invested with a healthy dose of Shah Rukh , the very heart and <unk> of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films : that love is eternal . " Simon Foster of the Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 ( out of 5 ) stars , calling it " a grand cinematic work boasting all the pros and cons of the genre . " He observed , " Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer @-@ director had become mired in a rut , or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music ( here , a typically string @-@ heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman ) and over @-@ active camerawork . One could argue that it 's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy , even when the dialogue ( at times , awful ) and plotting ( rarely based in logical realism ) can test one 's patience . " Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote , " The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80 @-@ year @-@ old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone , a certainty about itself even at its most audacious , that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master ... Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra . " Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " Director @-@ producer Yash Chopra 's film , his final project before he died , delivers not only the romance and human touch , but also reflects a modern sensibility . " Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote , " Even though the film drags , the magic of Bollywood is that this story 's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties . " Mazhar <unk> of the Gulf News wrote , " Despite its inherent flaws , JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra . In his swan song , the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match . "

 = Tjunkiya Napaltjarri = 
 Tjunkiya Napaltjarri ( also known as Tjunkiya <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) ( c . 1927 – 2009 ) was a Pintupi @-@ speaking Indigenous artist from Australia 's Western Desert region . She is the sister of artist Wintjiya Napaltjarri . 
 Tjunkiya 's paintings are held in major public art collections , including those of the National Gallery of Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria . 
 = = Life = = 
 Tjunkiya was born around 1927 : the main biographical reference work for the region gives a date of circa 1927 ; while the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests circa 1930 . The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time , often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events . 
 'Napaljarri ' ( in Warlpiri ) or ' Napaltjarri ' ( in Western Desert dialects ) is a skin name , one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people . These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems . Although they may be used as terms of address , they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans . Thus ' Tjunkiya ' is the element of the artist 's name that is specifically hers . 
 A Pintupi speaker , Tjunkiya was born in the area northwest of <unk> ( known as Kintore , Northern Territory ) , near the Western Australian border , and west of Alice Springs ) , after which her family moved to Haasts Bluff . She became second wife to Toba Tjakamarra , father of one of the prominent founders of the Papunya Tula art movement , Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula . At Haasts Bluff she had ten children : these included sons Billy Rowe and Riley Rowe , both of whom painted for Papunya Tula , and daughter <unk> ( born c . 1948 ) , who married Long Tom <unk> and went on to paint at Haasts Bluff . From Haasts Bluff the family moved to Papunya and in 1981 to Kintore . 
 Tjunkiya was the sister of artist Wintjiya Napaltjarri , who was also a wife to Toba . Seriously ill in the mid @-@ 1990s , Tjunkiya died in 2009 .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971 , assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon . Their work , which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly following the commencement of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and 1990s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists ' company , had been men , and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting . However , there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate , and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings . In the western desert communities such as Kintore , Yuendumu , Balgo , and on the outstations , people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Like a number of the other central and western desert women in the region , Tjunkiya was introduced to painting through the <unk> Tjukurrpa ( Women 's Dreaming ) painting project in the mid @-@ 1990s . Along with sister Wintjiya and other women , she participated in a painting camp in 1994 which resulted in " a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group 's shared Dreamings " . Western Desert artists such as Tjunkiya frequently paint particular ' dreamings ' , or stories , for which they have responsibility or rights . In this case , twenty @-@ five women were involved in planning the works , which included three canvases that were 3 metres square , as well as two that were 3 by 1 @.@ 5 metres , and Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations . Tjunkiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision . Sources differ on when Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya had the cataracts removed : Vivien Johnson implies around 1999 , but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi , who worked closely with the women , states that both had the operation in 1994 . 
 In the early 2000s she and her sister painted at Kintore , but in 2008 they were working from their home : " the widows ' camp outside her ' son ' Turkey Tolson 's former residence " . Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases . The National Gallery of Victoria in 2001 purchased a collaborative batik work , created in 1994 by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists , together with a work completed by Tjunkiya alone . The sisters also worked using drypoint etching , with 2004 a print by Tjunkiya – <unk> <unk> # 2 – held by the National Gallery of Australia . 
 Works by Tjunkiya are held in major private collections , such as Nangara ( also known as the Ebes Collection ) . Her work has been acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the National Gallery of Australia , the National Gallery of Victoria , the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory , and the Northern Territory Supreme Court . Works by both Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya are traded in the auction market , fetching prices of a few thousand dollars . 
 In 1996 , Tjunkiya was represented in the Papunya Women group exhibition at Utopia Art Gallery in Sydney , while in 2000 she had an exhibition at Melbourne 's William Mora Galleries and was included in the Art Gallery of New South Wales ' major exhibition , Papunya Tula : Genesis and Genius .

 = ReactOS = 
 ReactOS is an open @-@ source operating system for x86 / x64 PCs intended to be binary @-@ compatible with computer programs and device drivers made for Windows Server 2003 . 
 Development started in 1996 , as a Windows 95 clone project , which was in 1998 continued as ReactOS with the incremental addition of features of later Windows versions . ReactOS has been noted as a potential open @-@ source drop @-@ in replacement for Windows and for its information on undocumented Windows APIs . As stated on the official website , " The main goal of the ReactOS project is to provide an operating system which is binary compatible with Windows ... such that people accustomed to the familiar user interface of Windows would find using ReactOS straightforward . The ultimate goal of ReactOS is to allow you to remove Windows and install ReactOS without the end user noticing the change . " As of May 2016 , ReactOS is considered alpha software , feature @-@ incomplete but with many Windows applications already working ( e.g. Adobe Reader 6 @.@ 0 , <unk> etc ) , and therefore recommended by the developers only for evaluation and testing purposes . 
 ReactOS is primarily written in C , with some elements , such as ReactOS File Explorer , written in C + + . The project partially implements Windows API functionality and has been ported to the ARM and AMD64 processor architectures . ReactOS , as part of the FOSS ecosystem , re @-@ uses and collaborates with many other FOSS projects , most notably the Wine project which develops a Windows compatibility layer for Unix @-@ like operating systems . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early development = = = 
 Around 1996 , a group of free and open @-@ source software developers started a project called <unk> to implement a clone of Windows 95 . The project stalled in discussions of the design of the system . 
 While <unk> had started out with high expectations , there still had not been any builds released to the public by the end of 1997 . As a result , the project members , led by coordinator Jason <unk> , joined together to revive the project . The revived project sought to duplicate the functionality of Windows NT . In creating the new project , a new name , ReactOS , was chosen . The project began development in February 1998 by creating the basis for a new NT kernel and basic drivers . The name ReactOS was coined by Jeff Knox . While the term " OS " stood for operating system , the term " react " referred to the group 's dissatisfaction with – and reaction to – Microsoft 's monopolistic position . 
 = = = <unk> OS fork = = = 
 In 2004 , a copyright / license violation of ReactOS GPL 'ed code ( and other FOSS code ) was found when someone distributed a ReactOS fork under the name <unk> OS . The webpage later went offline . 
 = = = Internal audit = = = 
 In order to avoid copyright prosecution , ReactOS must be expressively completely distinct and non @-@ derivative from Windows , a goal which needs very careful work . A claim was made on 17 January 2006 , by now former developer Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list ( ros @-@ dev ) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows . The code that Birr disputed involved the function <unk> in <unk> as well as other unspecified items . Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP , Birr argued that the <unk> function was simply copy @-@ pasted from Windows XP , given that they were identical . Alex Ionescu , the author of the code , asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied , the code was not merely copy @-@ pasted , but reimplemented ; the reason why the functions were identical , Ionescu claimed , was because there was only one possible way to implement the function . 
 On 27 January 2006 , the developers responsible for maintaining the ReactOS code repository disabled access after a meeting was held to discuss the allegations . When approached by <unk> , Microsoft declined to comment about the incident . Since ReactOS is a free and open source software development project , the claim triggered a negative reaction by the free software community ; in particular , Wine barred several ( as of 2016 ) inactive developers from providing contributions and formal high level cooperation between the two projects remains difficult to this date . Contributions from several active ReactOS developers have been accepted post @-@ audit , and low level cooperation for bug fixes still occurs . 
 In a statement on its website , ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean @-@ room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict . Some countries , including the United States , require that a <unk> based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code , whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual . Consequently , ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law . An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used , and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them to comply with the project 's policies on reverse engineering . Contributors to its development were not affected by these events , and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward . In September 2007 , with the audit nearing completion , the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage . Though the audit was completed , specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project 's own policies . 
 Much of the assembly code that was allegedly copied has also been replaced as a natural progression in ReactOS development , with developers having reimplemented the functionality in C for portability reasons . 
 Also , the 2004 leaked Windows source code was not seen as legal risk for ReactOS , as the trade secret was considered indefensible in court due to broad spread . 
 = = = Public demonstration = = = 
 Demonstrations of the operating system have been given , mainly to Russian political figures . Viktor Alksnis met with project coordinator Aleksey <unk> , who gave a presentation and demonstration of the project , showing ReactOS running with Total Commander and Mozilla Firefox in 2007 . Dmitry Medvedev was also given a demonstration during a visit as President of Russia to a high school in <unk> , Stavropol , attended by one of the development team members in 2011 .

The Thorium Core Cloud Desktop dubbed Cloud computing service would use ReactOS as core and could allow the use of Windows compatible applications from mobile devices ( like smartphones , tablets ) , workstations or any other connected device .

 ReactOS is primarily written in C , with some elements , such as ReactOS Explorer and the sound stack , written in C + + . The project compiles using both <unk> and Microsoft Visual Studio , and contributes to the development of the build systems used through the submission of patches to its components . 
 The developers aim to make the kernel more compatible with Windows NT version 5 @.@ 2 ( Windows Server 2003 ) , the <unk> APIs with Windows NT 6 @.@ 3 ( Windows 8 @.@ 1 ) , and to add support for more applications and hardware . DirectX support is undertaken through <unk> , an in @-@ house implementation . 2D hardware @-@ accelerated rendering is done natively , while other drawing functionality is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution . 
 The development progress is influenced by the size of the development team and the level of experience among them . As an estimate of the effort required to implement Windows 7 , Microsoft employed 1 @,@ 000 or so developers , organized into 25 teams , with each team averaging 40 developers . As of 2 September 2011 , in the ReactOS entry in <unk> , the page followed through the " Very large , active development team " link lists 33 developers who have contributed over a 12 @-@ month period and a cumulative total of 104 present and former users who have contributed code to the project via Subversion since its inception . In his presentation at <unk> 2009 in Milan , ReactOS developer Michele C. noted that most of the developers learn about Windows architecture while working on ReactOS and have no prior knowledge . 
 While ReactOS targets currently mainly the x86 / AMD64 PC platform , it has been also partially ported to the ARM architectures . Support for the Xbox , a variant IA @-@ 32 architecture , was added through the use of an architecture @-@ specific HAL , although this , along with a port to PowerPC , are no longer actively maintained .

 While ReactOS has the aim to build a Windows @-@ compatible kernel as open @-@ source software , much of the surrounding required functionality to create a complete OS is already available in the greater open @-@ source ecosystem .

 = = = = Wine collaboration = = = = 
 The ReactOS and the Wine projects share the goal to run binary Windows software natively and can share therefore many dependencies and development . ReactOS uses portions of the Wine project so that it can benefit from Wine 's progress in implementing the Win32 API . While Wine 's <unk> , USER32 , <unk> , GDI32 and <unk> components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences , code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects . The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing <unk> kernels . 
 Separately , the experimental Arwinss branch was created as an alternative means to improve USER32 and GDI32 support through an alternative implementation of the Win32 API . Whereas ReactOS 's original Win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in Windows , Arwinss combines the architecture of that subsystem with the corresponding implementation in Wine . To this end , Arwinss uses Wine 's GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine 's existing software compatibility . Arwinss also allows the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display .

 = = Reception = = 
 Various people have acknowledged ReactOS and the implications of having a viable open @-@ source drop @-@ in replacement for Windows . A 2004 article and interview of the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel describes ReactOS as directed at Windows users who want to renounce use of proprietary commercial software without having to switch to Linux . <unk> , a Linux distribution 's monitoring website , lists also ReactOS and describes it as " a free and open @-@ source operating system based on the best design principles found in the Windows NT architecture . " . 
 In his column for Free Software Magazine , David Sugar noted in 2006 that ReactOS would allow the use of applications depending on older versions of Windows whose APIs have been deprecated . He also recognized its potential to expand the total deployed base of free software , and as a resource for developers wanting to know undocumented Windows APIs in the course of writing portable applications . PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak remarked in 2008 that the Windows NT architecture had remained largely unchanged , making it an ideal candidate for cloning , and believed that ReactOS could be " a bigger threat than Linux to Microsoft 's dominance " . In response to Dvorak 's column , ZDNet technology journalist Dana <unk> noted in 2008 that a lack of corporate sponsors and partners had rendered the project harmless to Microsoft . Echoing this , Thom <unk> of <unk> in 2009 categorized ReactOS under a family of hobby operating systems maintained only by small groups of developers working in their spare time , lacking the financial support of more mainstream operating systems and the legacy of formerly mainstream ones such as RISC OS . 
 In October 2015 , a Network World review of ReactOS <unk> noted impressed " It 's just like running Windows 2000 " and praised the extension by an application package manager , a feature the original Windows is missing .

 = Friday the 13th ( 2009 film ) = 
 Friday the 13th is a 2009 American slasher film written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift , and directed by Marcus Nispel . The film is a reboot of the Friday the 13th film series , which began in 1980 , and is the twelfth installment in the franchise . Nispel also directed the 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper 's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ( 1974 ) . Shannon and Swift wrote the screenplay for the 2003 crossover Freddy vs. Jason . Friday the 13th follows Clay Miller ( Jared Padalecki ) as he searches for his missing sister , Whitney ( Amanda Righetti ) , who is captured by Jason Voorhees ( Derek Mears ) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake . 
 The 2009 film was originally conceived as an origin story , but the project evolved into a re @-@ imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films . The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean , quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel a little sympathy for him , but not enough that he would lose his menace . Although this film rewrote the continuity , Jason 's iconic hockey mask — which was not introduced until the third film in the series — is acquired during the film . In keeping with the tone of the film , Jason 's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III ; though there were subtle changes . Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini 's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status . 
 Friday the 13th was released in theaters on Friday , February 13 , 2009 . It received mainly negative reviews and earned approximately US $ 19 million on its opening night and $ 40 million during its opening weekend , when it broke two records ; the highest @-@ earning opening day for the film series and the highest @-@ earning opening weekend for any horror film . As of July 2014 , it is the second @-@ highest grossing film in the Friday the 13th film series ( $ 65 million ) , and has earned over $ 91 @.@ 3 million worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On June 13 , 1980 , a young Jason Voorhees ( Caleb Guss ) watches as his mother Pamela ( Nana Visitor ) is beheaded by a camp counselor ( Stephanie Rhodes ) , who was trying to escape Mrs. Voorhees 's murder spree around Camp Crystal Lake . Almost thirty years later , a group of friends — Wade ( Jonathan Sadowski ) , Richie ( Ben Feldman ) , Mike ( Nick Mennell ) , Whitney ( Amanda Righetti ) and Amanda ( America Olivo ) — arrive at Crystal Lake on a camping trip to search for marijuana growing in the woods . That night , Jason ( Derek Mears ) , now an adult , kills Wade , Amanda , and Richie . Jason also kills Mike , but he spares Whitney because she resembles his mother at a young age , and kidnaps her . 
 Six weeks later , Trent ( Travis Van Winkle ) , his girlfriend Jenna ( Danielle Panabaker ) , Chelsea ( Willa Ford ) , Bree ( Julianna Guill ) , Chewie ( Aaron Yoo ) , Nolan ( Ryan Hansen ) , and Lawrence ( Arlen <unk> ) arrive at Trent 's summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake . Meanwhile , Whitney 's brother Clay Miller ( Jared Padalecki ) arrives at the lake to search for her . Clay visits Trent 's cabin , and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney . As they search , Jason kills Chelsea and Nolan while they are wakeboarding on the lake . Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house . 
 Jenna and Clay run to warn the others about Jason , who arrives and disconnects the cabin 's electricity . Jason kills Chewie and Lawrence outside the cabin and sneaks inside and kills Bree .

 New Line Cinema 's Toby Emmerich approached Platinum Dunes producers Michael Bay , Brad Fuller and Andrew Form about remaking Friday the 13th in the same way they restarted the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise . They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures , New Line , and Crystal Lake Entertainment — the latter run by Friday the 13th creator Sean S. Cunningham . Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films , including the title . Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights . Fuller and Form said they did not want to make Friday the 13th Part 11 or 12 , but wanted to rework the mythology . They liked elements from the first four films — such as plot points and ways particular characters are killed — and planned to use these in their remake , which they did with Paramount 's approval . Fuller said , " I think there are moments we want to address , like how does the hockey mask happen . It ’ ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one . Where is Jason from , why do these killings happen , and what is Crystal Lake ? " The producers initially expressed an interest in using Tommy Jarvis , a recurring character who first appeared in Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter , but the idea was scrapped . 
 Though the producers decided that Friday the 13th would not be an origin story , they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed . Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask , and is given a reason for why he puts it on . Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head — similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2 — to finding and wearing his hockey mask , whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off @-@ screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it . 
 Unlike The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake ( 2003 ) and the The Amityville Horror remake ( 2005 ) — both of which were produced by Bay , Form , and Fuller — it was decided that Friday the 13th would not be a period piece . Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s . In October 2007 , Damian Shannon and Mark Swift , the writers of Freddy vs. Jason , were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th . Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film , but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel . Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job , mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise , but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project . Principal photography began on April 21 , 2008 , in Austin , Texas , and finished on June 13 , 2008 .

 Stuntman Derek Mears was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of special make @-@ up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard . Before the producers contacted him , Mears had already heard about the production of a new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role . He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers . The studio worried that Mears ' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character , but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role . Mears said he related to " Jason the victim " when he was growing up , and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film . To Mears , Jason represents people who were bullied in high school — specifically those with physical deformities — for being outcasts . Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake . 
 When Mears went to audition for the role , he was asked , " Why do we need an actor as opposed to just a guy in a mask ? " Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work , in which the mask and the actor are separate entities , and depending on the scene , there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance . Mears said the energy from the actor 's thoughts will be picked up by the camera . He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race : he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew . As he performs , the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera . 
 Amanda Righetti had not read the script when she was offered the role of Whitney Miller . She wanted to be part of the Friday the 13th franchise from the start . Righetti said she wanted to act in the film after she read the script . Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out " to do the right thing " when his sister goes missing , and goes about it as a " lone wolf " who wants to take on the responsibility alone . Adjustments were made to the filming schedule to accommodate Aaron Yoo , who portrays Chewie . Yoo had his appendix removed shortly before filming began , and could not film his scenes immediately . As soon as Yoo was ready for filming , Nispel immediately hung him upside down from some rafters , exposing the staples over his surgical wound for the character 's post @-@ death shot . 
 Fuller and Form said the casting process for Friday the 13th was more difficult than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th , as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together . This recasting process lasted until the start of filming . Hostel : Part II 's Richard Burgi , who was cast as Sheriff Bracke , did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 When Shannon and Swift began writing the script for Friday the 13th , they imposed some rules based on their experiences of writing Freddy vs. Jason on themselves . They wanted their teenage characters to " sound normal " . Shannon and Swift said they did not want the characters to know Jason 's name or to become what they considered " the Scooby @-@ Doo cliché where it 's a bunch of kids trying to figure something out " . The writers also wanted to distance themselves from self @-@ referential slasher films such as Scream and to give the film a gritty , more 1980s feel that had been lost in recent films . They wanted to create a quick , loose Jason . The writing team decided to create a version of Jason " who was actually in the woods surviving off the land " , and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along . 
 The writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason 's childhood experiences , which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character . They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude , like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels . Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost $ 100 @,@ 000 . Because of budget constraints , certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned . 
 The writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford 's character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore . Eventually , the girl would tire and drown . Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films , but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral . A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker 's character Jenna . Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film ; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason 's lair and recite a " cute line " about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death . The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in previous installments of the series . To accomplish this , Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason 's tunnels ; the character Mark ( Tom McBride ) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the 13th . 
 The writers altered Jason 's character . Mears describes him as a combination of John Rambo , Tarzan , and the Abominable Snowman from Looney Tunes . To Mears , Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps . Like Rambo , he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back ; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film . However , Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience . They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason 's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would " demystify " the character in an unhelpful manner . Fuller said , " We do not want him to be sympathetic . Jason is not a comedic character , he is not sympathetic . He 's a killing machine . Plain and simple . " 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 The producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for Friday the 13th . Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects , Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look . Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects ; they first analyzed the script in pre @-@ production to decide which shots would need digital effects . Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film . 
 One of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda , in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire . The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland was deemed too great to physically perform the scene . Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag . Instead of creating a computer generated ( CGI ) model of the campfire , a real campfire was filmed . Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot . Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames . Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat . Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform , Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect . 
 Asylum also enhanced some of Jason 's signature machete kills . In several scenes , the company used a computer @-@ generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters ' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths . In one scene , Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head . Instead of using a real machete with a fake head , Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle — with only a portion of the blade attached — away from Feldman 's head . Then , Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect . For this scene , Asylum adjusted the actor 's facial expressions to create a " post mortem " look . The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor 's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason 's machete . 
 Asylum digitally created weapons for various scenes . In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason 's arrow , Asylum created the arrow in post @-@ production . Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away , striking him in the back . The shot of a hatchet flying through the air — in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor — would be too difficult to achieve practically . Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back . One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent 's death scene . Here , Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent 's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck . 
 = = = Creating Jason = = = 
 Effects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason 's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton 's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini 's design for Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter . Stoddard 's vision of Jason included hair loss , skin rashes , and the traditional deformities in his face . Stoddard tried to craft Jason 's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen . Mears was required to wear full body make @-@ up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason . The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements . He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had scoliosis . A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears ' face to show realistic eye movements . Stoddard initially spent three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours applying the make @-@ up to Mears ' head and torso . He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask . For scenes in which Jason 's face is revealed , it took approximately four hours to apply the make @-@ up . 
 For Jason 's wardrobe , Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a " high @-@ priced t @-@ shirt " that allowed the special effects make @-@ up to be seen through holes in the shirt . The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket . Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket , but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his " kill movements . " The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket . Mears called it a " giant Frankenstein jacket . " He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much . A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back . Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason 's hockey mask . Using an original mold , Stoddard made six new versions of the mask . He said , " Because I didn 't want to take something that already existed . There were things I thought were great , but there were things I wanted to change a bit . Make it custom , but keep all the fundamental designs . Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks . Age them down a bit . Break them up . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Form and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four Friday the 13th films . For their 2009 film , they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music , which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini . They did not plan to use the score in its entirety , but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini 's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film . Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Nispel told Jablonsky he wanted him to create something that Nispel could " whistle when [ he ] left the theater " , but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film . Nispel said , " I don 't believe that , when you watch a Friday the 13th film , you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra " .

 Alonso Duralde wrote that the film should please slasher fans , but that it added nothing new to the genre or the franchise and would not appeal to people who did not like slasher films . Duralde criticized the film for adding a black and an Asian character in an attempt to " update the movie for the new millennium " . He also said the prospect of another Friday the 13th — crafted by the film 's " sequel @-@ friendly " ending — did not leave him with a feeling of dread . Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said the film accepts the " ridiculousness " of what it is trying to accomplish — mainly the " death and dismemberment " of " party @-@ hungry kids " , and that audiences would enjoy it if they also recognized that . Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters ' deaths , he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki 's presence gave the film a " less @-@ good episode of Supernatural " vibe . 
 The Washington Post 's Dan Zak wrote that the film fails to provide laughs , scares , suspense , or gore . Zak also said it fails to provide the exhibition of nudity expected of horror films that cannot deliver on the previously listed criteria . Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said Nispel captured the despair he created with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake . Olsen also said the film failed to provide the " giddiness " , " teenage lust " , and " rambunctiousness " that made the previous Friday the 13th films work . Wesley Morris said Friday the 13th did have humor ; he said the characters continually act the clichéd role of would @-@ be @-@ victim , making it hard to fear for their safety . In his opinion , the 2009 film lacked the " psycho @-@ social " aspect — a mother killing out of revenge for her son 's death — crafted by its 1980 predecessor , and ultimately the film is " more hilarious than terrifying " . 
 The New York Post 's Kyle Smith said Nispel made no attempt to create a movie beyond blood and guts , and even those attempts were " forgettable " . Smith said that apart from Clay and Trent , the rest of the cast were merely " faces in the crowd " with no attempt to give them any sort of backstory . USA Today 's Claudia Puig said that the film keeps to the same formula as its predecessors , with a story that adds little to nothing to the franchise . She also said Padalecki and Panabaker filled their lead roles well , and that Aaron Yoo 's comic relief made him one of the most likable characters on screen . Rob Nelson of Variety also praised Panabaker and Yoo 's performances . 
 In contrast to the film 's detractors , The New York Times 's Nathan Lee said Friday the 13th managed to " reboot the concept " of the original films with style . Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters , that there is a desire among cinemagoers for this type of material , and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire . Adam Graham from The Detroit News said the film is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th series ; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victims — as opposed to slowly walking behind them , as became prominent in later sequels — because it made him more menacing . Graham also said the film does not " soften " Jason 's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory . Entertainment Weekly 's Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night ( 2008 ) and My Bloody Valentine 3D ( 2009 ) , although it does provide a few too many unbelievable character moments . 
 Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star said the film added freshness to the standard formula of the previous films by focusing on the chasing and killing aspects instead of lingering on the prolonged suffering of victims like the Saw films . IGN 's Chris Carle said Aaron Yoo stole the film with his comic timing and with his " memorable death " . Carle said Derek Mears ' portrayal of Jason adds more to the character than being simply a stuntman ; Mears 's subtle movements , athleticism , and physicality created an imposing image of Jason .

 The Prospect Park Zoo is a 12 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 9 ha ) zoo located off Flatbush Avenue on the eastern side of Prospect Park , Brooklyn , New York City . Its precursor , the Menagerie , opened in 1890 . The present facility first opened as a city zoo on July 3 , 1935 , and was part of a larger revitalization program of city parks , playgrounds and zoos initiated in 1934 by Parks Commissioner Robert Moses . It was built , in large part , through Civil Works Administration and Works Project Administration ( WPA ) labor and funding . 
 After 53 years of operation as a city zoo run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation , Prospect Park Zoo closed on June 1988 for reconstruction . The closure signaled the start of a five @-@ year , $ 37 million renovation program , that , save for the exteriors of the 1930s @-@ era buildings , completely replaced the zoo . It was rededicated on October 5 , 1993 , as the Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center , joining an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , all of which are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( AZA ) . 
 The Prospect Park Zoo presently offers children 's educational programs , is engaged in restoration of endangered species populations , runs a wildlife theater and reaches out to the local community through volunteer programs .

Side exhibits center on cotton @-@ top tamarins , meerkats , emerald tree boas , dwarf mongooses , desert monitors , among others . Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals . The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity , a part of the larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society . 
 The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit consists of a troop of hamadryas baboons . Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed @-@ in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop . Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather .

 The original 1866 proposal of Prospect Park featured a " Zoological Garden " on the western flank of the park , near the present Litchfield Villa , but the garden had not been started by the time Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux separated from the park in 1874 . This notwithstanding , a few features of the original park design did serve zoological purposes . A Wild Fowl Pond , once occupying the northern quadrant of the zoo grounds , served as a haven for water birds . A Deer Paddock , once occupying the southern quadrants of the zoo grounds , was a penned @-@ in area for deer . In addition , a flock of sheep regularly maintained the grass in the park meadows and were kept in a paddock on the eastern flank of Sullivan Hill , near the now @-@ demolished Dairy Farmhouse . 
 Interest in zoological gardens flowered in the last decade of the 19th century . An informal Menagerie began to take shape within Prospect Park in May 1890 when the newly appointed president of the City of Brooklyn Parks Commission , George V. Brower , donated " three young cinnamon bears . " State Treasurer Harry Adams followed with a donation of three white deer , establishing a pattern . It was mainly through donations of animals by rich or prominent individuals that the Menagerie grew . By 1893 , one observer noted that “ seven seals arrived , one buffalo , from the estate of Samuel B. Duryea , three red foxes , three bears , one sacred cow , two white deer , five red deer , seven seals , and twelve to fifteen peacocks . " 
 The animals were kept in pens on Sullivan Hill , situated across the East Drive from the zoo 's present location , near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse . Of the original zoological facilities in the park , the Deer Paddock , located near the present Carousel , was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie , The Wild Fowl Pond remained , located on the east side of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo . The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century . These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world .

 After assuming office in January 1934 , New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia tapped Robert Moses to head a newly unified Parks Department . Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city 's parks , renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools , zoos , playgrounds and parks . Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration , and later , Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight @-@ year city @-@ wide construction program , relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year . 
 Plans for the new Prospect Park Zoo , prepared by Aymar Embury II , were announced in March 1934 . The area between the Wild Fowl Pond and former Deer Paddock on the east side of the park , situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie , was chosen as the site for the new zoo . Architect Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on a seal pool . Built of red brick with limestone trim , the buildings featured bas @-@ relief scenes from Rudyard Kipling 's The Jungle Book . 
 Five sculptors executed a total of thirteen such scenes , not only on the front and back walls of zoo buildings , but also on all four sides of both brick entrance shelters at Flatbush Avenue . However , the positioning of some of the bas @-@ reliefs makes them less accessible than others . 
 Dedicated on July 3 , 1935 , as the Prospect Park Zoo , the buildings constituted an integrated facility and were seen as a great improvement over the somewhat haphazardly developed Menagerie . The zoo featured an extensive bear pit , a seal pool , a lion 's house ( the current Animals in our Lives building ) an elephant 's house ( the current Animal Lifestyles building ) and a house for monkeys , birds , and horned animals ( now the World of Animals building ) . With the completion of the new zoo , The Dairy Farmhouse , sheep paddock , and Menagerie were demolished and the sheep flock was replaced with mechanical mowers . The site of the old Menagerie has since been allowed to revert to forest land .

 For the next fifty years , the zoo served as a showcase of large animals from far away places , appealing to a sense of wonder . An estimated one million people visited the Prospect Park Zoo annually prior to World War II , but attendance gradually declined , reaching about a half million by the early 1980s . Around this time , the facility showed signs of deterioration . Writing in New York Magazine in late 1970 , writer Erik <unk> @-@ <unk> termed the zoo the ' <unk> ' in New York – " in the literal sense of the word . ( I 've never been there without seeing several rodents romping in the bear lair ) " . He reported that ' <unk> ' , a Southern United States black vulture which was one of the zoo 's earliest residents " … is still there , looking down his beak at visitors littering the walks , and celebrating his 35th anniversary in the same old cage . " 
 A decade later , a New York Times reporter visiting the zoo noted that " ... an Asiatic Black Bear lay on a rock a short distance from a guard rail . A shattered wine bottle , a cracked stick , and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him . ' How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print ? ' said John Kinzig , a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo . ' Vandalism is a major problem , and deterioration is overtaking repairs . ' " Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo , which , in 1983 , was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the " 10 worst " zoos in the country . Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds . A fatal accident of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty @-@ year @-@ old facility . 
 After fifteen years of off @-@ again , on @-@ again , conversations , The Koch Administration and the then @-@ named NY Zoological Society ( now Wildlife Conservation Society ) , signed a fifty @-@ year agreement in April 1980 , where the Central , Prospect , and Queens zoos would be administered by the Society . Specific plans for Prospect Park Zoo were another seven years in the making . By late summer 1987 , an $ 18 million , two and a half year renovation plan was put forth to renovate Prospect Park Zoo and coordinate its venue with other facilities to avoid redundant programming . Prospect Park Zoo was slated to specialize in children programs and house smaller , unaggressive animal species . 
 = = = Renovation of a re @-@ purposed zoo = = = 
 The Prospect Park Zoo closed to the public in June 1988 . Over the next six months , new homes were found for the displaced animals in other zoos throughout the US . Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989 , commencing what became nearly a five @-@ year , $ 37 million effort , overrunning initial estimates by two years and $ 19 million . The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved , but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted , pits and cages were demolished , and new structures were built . The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993 . 
 A further six months were needed to repopulate the zoo , prepare exhibits , and ready the facility for the public . The re @-@ purposed zoo opened on October 5 , 1993 under the rubric " Prospect Park Wildlife Conservation Center " . The Zoological Society hoped that the new name would suggest that the ' Wildlife Conservation Center ' was far more than a mere ' zoo ' ; it was indeed a facility designed to preserve animal species . This name change coincided with the renaming of the zoological society to the ' Wildlife Conservation Society ' . 
 The programs of the new center were geared toward educating children . Classrooms for the Discovery Center were housed in a dedicated building on the north wing of the zoo . Exhibits housed smaller species , eschewing elephants , tigers , and lions , and augmented displays with interactive exhibits . The public , however , continued to call the facility ' The Prospect Park Zoo ' , and over the ensuing thirteen years the old name quietly stuck . Even in WCS literature ' Prospect Park Zoo ' is now used interchangeably with the new name . 
 = = = Budget issues = = = 
 The Wildlife Conservation Society , which supports the Prospect Park Zoo through a combination of private funds and subsidies from the city , is vulnerable to funding shortfalls such as the one on April 15 , 2003 , when Mayor Michael Bloomberg published his " doomsday budget " proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July 2003 . Among other cuts to help close an overall $ 3 @.@ 8 billion budget deficit , the Mayor proposed to cut all city funding for the Prospect Park Zoo and the Queens Zoo , as well as trim funding for the New York Aquarium and the Bronx Zoo . The two zoos were the smallest among the facilities managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society , and had the lowest annual attendance rates , approximately 200 @,@ 000 for each threatened zoo . In contrast , the Bronx Zoo boasted annual attendance of two million and the Central Park Zoo enjoyed one million visitors annually . Over the next two months , the fate of the two zoos hung in limbo while the city 's executive branch and City Council hammered out a compromise budget . While there were a number of items on the budget , the zoo closures remained among the more visible of anticipated losses . 
 In the middle of June , City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo , and in a press conference outlined some of the pragmatic consequences of closure : a savings estimated by the city of $ 6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $ 8 million , to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals . If the estimates were correct , reasoning went , it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down . 
 By the start of the new fiscal year in July 2003 , the approved budget restored a reduced funding level to the affected WCS facilities . To keep the Prospect Park and Queens Zoos open , the WCS had to close two classroom @-@ based instructional programs , lay off the supporting full- and part @-@ time instructors , and double admission fees . Funding levels for the Wildlife Conservation Society were restored in the 2007 city budget , though vulnerability to shortfalls remain . In the opening months of 2009 , the WCS itself faced the prospect of losing its fiscal year 2010 New York State funding . While not citing specifics concerning Prospect Park Zoo , the Wildlife Conservation Society reported in the NY Daily News that the proposed cuts will involve " ' layoffs [ that ] would cut across the board , ' and include ' front @-@ line workers ' in sales , <unk> and other positions , and include both union and nonunion positions " . 
 In 2007 , 234 @,@ 000 people visited the Prospect Park Zoo , a drop of 1 @,@ 000 from the 2006 level of 235 @,@ 000 . Visitation since then has shown a steady increase , with 269 @,@ 914 people visiting in 2009 .

 Thomas Dunderdale ( 6 May 1887 – 15 December 1960 ) was a professional ice hockey forward . Born in Australia , he moved to Canada at the age of 6 , in 1894 . He played in Winnipeg for three seasons , from 1906 to 1910 . In 1910 , he joined the Montreal Shamrocks of the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , before moving on to the Quebec Bulldogs the following season . In 1911 – 12 , he joined the Victoria Aristocrats of the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , playing nine seasons in total in Victoria . He split his seasons in Victoria with a three @-@ season stint with the Portland Rosebuds between 1915 and 1918 . After the PCHA folded in 1923 , Dunderdale played one season in the West Coast Hockey League ( WCHL ) , splitting the season between the Saskatoon Crescents and the Edmonton Eskimos . In 1974 , he became the only Australian @-@ born player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . Dunderdale is credited with scoring the first penalty shot goal in ice hockey history . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Dunderdale was born in Benalla , Victoria , Australia , on 6 May 1887 . His parents were originally from England , but in 1904 , the <unk> resettled to Ottawa , Ontario . Tommy first played organised ice hockey at the age of 17 with his Waller Street School team . In 1905 he moved to Winnipeg , Manitoba and played the 1905 – 06 season with the amateur Winnipeg Ramblers . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Dunderdale turned professional in 1906 – 07 season with the Winnipeg <unk> . He played three seasons for the franchise , which was also known as the Winnipeg Maple Leafs and the Winnipeg Shamrocks , scoring on average more than two points per game , with the majority of the points being goals . In 1909 – 10 , Dunderdale moved east , and played with the Montreal Shamrocks , first with the Canadian Hockey Association , and later with the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . That season , he appeared in 15 games overall , and scored 21 goals . He played the 1910 – 11 season for the Quebec Bulldogs of the NHA , finishing second on the team in scoring , with 13 goals , even though he played only nine out of 16 games , and receiving 25 penalty minutes . 
 Dunderdale went back west in the 1911 – 12 season , joining the Victoria Aristocrats of the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) . He would spend the rest of his career playing in the west , having played only two seasons east of the Manitoba @-@ Ontario border . Scoring 24 goals in 16 games , Dunderdale received his first out of six First All @-@ Star team selections in the PCHA , as well as his first of four consecutive . In the next two seasons , Dunderdale recorded similar statistics to his first season in the PCHA , again scoring 24 goals in both seasons , and he was named to the First All @-@ Star team in both seasons . The 1912 – 13 season saw the Victoria Aristocrats challenge the Quebec Bulldogs for the Stanley Cup . Although the Aristocrats won the series , their challenge was not accepted by the Stanley Cup trustees . The 1914 – 15 season saw Dunderdale named to the First All @-@ Star team for his fourth consecutive time , as he scored 17 goals and assisted on 10 others , for 27 points in 17 games . 
 In the 1915 – 16 season , Dunderdale joined the Portland Rosebuds . In his first season with the Rosebuds , he dropped below a point per game for the first time in his career . The Rosebuds became the first American team to challenge for the Stanley Cup that year , losing a best @-@ of @-@ five series 3 – 2 to the Montreal Canadiens . Dunderdale played in all five games of the series , scoring two points . The following season , he scored 22 goals in 24 games , returning to his usual offensive output . However , he was more noted that season for his number of penalty minutes , setting a league record with 141 minutes . The 1917 – 18 season was his last in Portland , as he scored 14 goals in 18 games . Dunderdale left as their leading penalty minute getter , and as their second @-@ most prolific goal scorer , with 50 goals . 
 Dunderdale rejoined the Victoria Aristocrats in the 1918 – 19 season . After recording only nine points in 20 games in his first season back with the Aristocrats , he scored 26 goals in 22 games in the 1919 – 20 season , en route to his fifth First All @-@ Star team selection . Dunderdale played three more seasons for Victoria , which was renamed from the Aristocrats to the Cougars for the 1921 – 22 season , playing 75 games in total and scoring 41 points . He scored a bit under a point per game during the 1920 – 21 and the 1921 – 22 season , while in the 1922 – 23 season , his last with Victoria , he was limited to only two goals in 27 games . He was named for his sixth time to the First All @-@ Star Team in 1922 . Following the conclusion of the 1922 – 23 season , the PCHA folded . Dunderdale played another season in the West Coast Hockey League ( WCHL ) , splitting the 1923 – 24 season between the Saskatoon Crescents and the Edmonton Eskimos , scoring three points in 17 games overall . 
 Dunderdale is credited with scoring the first penalty shot goal in history . The first goal was scored on 12 December 1921 by Dunderdale on Hugh Lehman . The shot was taken from one of three dots painted on the ice 35 feet ( 11 m ) from the goal . Players had to skate to the dot and shoot the puck from the dot .

 = Dal Lake = 
 Dal Lake is a lake in Srinagar , the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir . The urban lake , which is the second largest in the state , is integral to tourism and recreation in Kashmir and is named the " Jewel in the crown of Kashmir " or " Srinagar 's Jewel " . The lake is also an important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant harvesting . 
 The shore line of the lake , is about 15 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) , is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens , parks , houseboats and hotels . Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens , such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful <unk> . During the winter season , the temperature sometimes reaches − 11 ° C ( 12 ° F ) , freezing the lake . 
 The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 9 sq mi ) and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21 @.@ 1 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 sq mi ) , including its floating gardens . The floating gardens , known as " Rad " in Kashmiri , blossom with lotus flowers during July and August . The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins ; <unk> , <unk> Dal , Bod Dal and Nagin ( although Nagin is also considered as an independent lake ) . <unk> @-@ dal and Bod @-@ dal each have an island in the centre , known as <unk> Lank ( or Char <unk> ) and Sona Lank respectively . 
 At present , the Dal Lake and its Mughal gardens , Shalimar Bagh and the Nishat Bagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake . Massive investments of approximately US $ 275 million ( ₹ 11 billion ) are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its original splendour . 
 = = History = = 
 Dal lake is mentioned as <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ् ) in ancient Sanskrit texts . Ancient history records mention that a village named <unk> to the east of Dal Lake was the residence of goddess Durga . This place was known as <unk> on the bank of the lake , which was sourced by a spring called the <unk> . 
 During the Mughal period , the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir , Srinagar in particular , as their summer resort . They developed the precincts of the Dal lake in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal @-@ type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to enjoy the salubrious cool climate . After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 , which led to the disintegration of the Mughal Empire , Pashtun tribes in the area around the lake and city increased , and the Durrani Empire ruled the city for several decades . In 1814 a significant part of the Kashmir valley , including Srinagar , was annexed by Raja Ranjit Singh to his kingdom , and the Sikhs grew in influence in the region for 27 years . 
 During the British Raj , the British also made Srinagar their capital during the summer months , attracted by the cool climate of the Kashmir valley , amidst the back drop of the majestic snow covered Himalayan ranges . The lake precincts experience temperatures in the range of 1 – 11 ° C ( 34 – 52 ° F ) during winter and 12 – 30 ° C ( 54 – 86 ° F ) during the summer season . The lake freezes when temperatures drop to about − 11 ° C ( 12 ° F ) during severe winter . Although the Dogra Maharaja of Kashmir restricted the building of houses in the valley , the British circumvented this rule by commissioning lavish houseboats to be built on the Dal Lake . The houseboats have been referred to as , " each one a little piece of England afloat on Dal Lake . " 
 After the independence of India , the Kashmiri <unk> people have built , owned and maintained these houseboats , cultivating floating gardens and producing commodities for the market , making them the centre of their livelihoods . The houseboats , closely associated with Dal Lake also provide accommodation in Srinagar . Following the Mughal and British rule , the place has earned the epithet , " Jewel in the crown of Kashmir " .

 The lake is located within a catchment area covering 316 square kilometres ( 122 sq mi ) in the Zabarwan mountain valley , in the foothills of the <unk> hills , which surrounds it on three sides . The lake , which lies to the east and north of Srinagar city covers an area of 18 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 9 sq mi ) , although including the floating gardens of lotus blooms , it is 21 @.@ 2 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 2 sq mi ) ( an estimated figure of 22 – 24 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 3 sq mi ) is also mentioned ) . The main basin draining the lake is a complex of five interconnected basins with causeways ; the Nehru Park basin , the Nishat basin , the Hazratbal basin , the Nagin basin and the <unk> <unk> basin . Navigational channels provide the transportation links to all the five basins . 
 The average elevation of the lake is 1 @,@ 583 metres ( 5 @,@ 194 ft ) . The depth of water varies from 6 metres ( 20 ft ) at its deepest in Nagin lake to 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) , the shallowest at <unk> . The depth ratio between the maximum and minimum depths varies with the season between 0 @.@ 29 and 0 @.@ 25 , which is interpreted as flat bed slope . The length of the lake is 7 @.@ 44 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 62 mi ) with a width of 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) . The lake has e basin <unk> shore length of 15 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) and roads run all along the periphery . Irreversible changes through <unk> lake is located within a catchment area covering 316 square kilometres ( 122 sq mi ) in the Zabarwan mountain <unk> further restrictions on the flow of the lake and as a result , marshy lands have emerged on the peripheral zones , notably in the foothill areas of the Shankaracharya and <unk> hills . These marshy lands have since been reclaimed and converted into large residential complexes . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Multiple theories explaining the origin of this lake have been formulated . One version is that it is the remnants of a post @-@ glacial lake , which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory is that it is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox @-@ bows of the Jhelum River . The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity . <unk> , a variety of rock types have been discerned namely , igneous , metamorphic and sedimentary . The <unk> Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments . Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern . The water table cuts the hill slopes , which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley . Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India , the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected . In the year 2005 , Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7 @.@ 6 on the Richter 's scale , which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties , leaving many homeless . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The shallow , open @-@ drainage lake is fed by <unk> @-@ Telbal Nallah ( with perennial flow ) , Dara Nallah ( ' Nallah ' means " stream " ) and many other small streams . The lake is classified as ' warm <unk> ' under the sub @-@ tropical lake category . Spring sources also contribute to the flow , although no specific data is available to quantify their contribution . To address this , water balance studies to analyse and assess the characteristics of flow have been conducted in order to approximate the discharge contributed by the springs in the lake bed . The complex land use pattern of the valley is reflected in the urbanised Srinagar in its north , with rice fields , orchards and gardens in the lower slopes , and barren hills beyond steep sloping hills . The flat topography also affects drainage conditions . It receives an average annual rainfall of 655 millimetres ( 25 @.@ 8 in ) in the catchment , but during the summer , snow melt from the higher ranges of the catchment results in large inflows into the lake . The maximum flood discharge of Telbal Nallah has been assessed as 141 @.@ 5 metres3 / s for a one in hundred return period ; the 1973 observed flood in Telbal Nallah has been estimated as 113 metres3 / s . The average annual flow , according to discharge measurements , has been estimated as 291 @.@ 9 million cubic metres , with Telbal <unk> accounting for 80 % of the total and 20 % contributed by other sources . The silt load has been estimated at 80 @,@ 000 tonnes per year with 70 % contribution from the <unk> <unk> , with 36 @,@ 000 tonnes recorded as settling in the lake . 
 There are two outlets from the lake , namely the Dalgate and Amir Khan Nallah that connects the lakes of Nagin and <unk> Lake . Dalgate is controlled by a weir and lock system . The outflow from these two outlets has been estimated as 275 @.@ 6 million cubic metres . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The ecosystem of Dal Lake is ecologically rich in macrophytes , submerged macrophytes , floating macrophytes and phytoplankton . <unk> flora recorded in the lake 's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species , belonging to 69 genera and 42 families . The lake is noted in particular for its <unk> nucifera ( lotus flowers ) which bloom in July and August . The prolific growth of Ceratophyllum <unk> in the eutrophic zones has been reported , with Myriophyllum spicatum and <unk> <unk> cited as dominant species . Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include <unk> angustata , Phragmites australis , Myriophyllum , <unk> <unk> and Myriophyllum <unk> , which contribute to the production of <unk> . The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of <unk> nucifera , Nymphaea alba , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Salvinia natans , <unk> dubia , Nymphaea sp. and Potamogeton natans , all of which occupy 29 @.@ 2 % of the lake . <unk> include <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> duplex , <unk> minimum , <unk> aeruginosa and <unk> elegans . 
 Since 1934 , some important changes have been observed in the lake 's biota , including a reduction in the number of Chara species , and an increase in the area covered by Salvinia since 1937 . Analysis of the lake has also revealed the tendency for it to develop monospecific communities of submerged macrophytes such as Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum . 
 One of the Char <unk> 
 Woody vegetation in the catchment of the lake consists of Melia , Ailanthus , Robinia , Daphne , <unk> , Rose , Ephedra , Pinus <unk> , Pinus halepensis , Pinus <unk> , Cupressus torulosa and Cupressus <unk> . The valley also has a rich cultivation of crops such as paddy , wheat and fodder . 
 Floating gardens , labelled the ' Rad ' in <unk> Kashmiri language are a special feature of the lake . They basically constitute of matted vegetation and earth , but are floating . These are detached from the bottom of the lake and drawn to a suitable place ( generally to the north west of the houseboats ' location ) and anchored . Given its rich nutrient properties , tomatoes , cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results . 
 The faunal distribution consists of <unk> , Benthos and Fish . <unk> found in the lake include <unk> <unk> , K. <unk> , <unk> vulgaris , <unk> <unk> , <unk> bulla , Alona <unk> , Cyclops <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Benthos include <unk> sp. and Tubifex sp. and fish include Cyprinus carpio <unk> ( economically important ) , C. carpio communis , <unk> niger , S. <unk> , S. <unk> and <unk> <unk> . It is also reported that Cyprinus , introduced during early sixties , is dominant and that the indigenous species <unk> is showing a declining trend . 
 Fishing resources 
 The fishing industry on Dal Lake is the second largest industry in the region and is central to many of the people 's livelihoods who reside on the lake 's periphery . Dal lake 's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species , which were introduced into the lake in 1957 . As a result , carp constitutes 70 % of all the fish caught in the lake while the <unk> constitutes 20 % and other species account for 10 % . Fishermen use a locally manufactured cast net which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres . It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of <unk> , typically <unk> in size . The gradual decline in quality of the lake water through pollution has resulted in lower fish stocks and the extinction of endemic varieties of fish . The causes for such deterioration have been identified and remedial actions have been <unk> various fishing nets being used in Dal Lake are cast net ( <unk> / <unk> ) , Long line ( <unk> ) , Gill net ( <unk> , Shaitan <unk> ) , Rod and line ( <unk> ) , Scoop net ( <unk> <unk> ) ( Bhat et al . , 2008 ) 
 The lake is warm <unk> ( mixing type ) and the pH value recorded has varied from a minimum of 7 @.@ 2 to a maximum of 8 @.@ 8 on the surface over a yearly period . The Dissolved oxygen [ mg l − 1 ] value has varied from a minimum of 1 @.@ 4 to a maximum of 12 @.@ 3 on the surface within a year . The Recorded maximum nitrogen concentration ( NH4 @-@ N [ micro l − 1 ] has been recorded as 1315 on the surface and 22 at the bottom of the lake . Phosphorus concentration expressed in Total @-@ P [ micro l − 1 ] has varied from a high of 577 to a low of 35 during the 12 months of the year . The lake water temperature has varied from a minimum of 3 ° C ( 37 ° F ) in January to 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in June at the surface . Transparency , expressed as depth in metres , has varied from a maximum of 1 @.@ 95 metres ( 6 @.@ 4 ft ) in July to a minimum of 0 @.@ 53 metres ( 1 @.@ 7 ft ) in March , over the 12 months period . 
 Studies of the water quality of the lake in 1983 – 84 indicate a decline in quality since the 1965 – 66 analysis . Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal , <unk> , and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake . <unk> , fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156 @.@ 62 tonnes ( 56 @.@ 36 tonnes by drains alone ) of phosphorus , and 241 @.@ 18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11 @.@ 701 million cubic metres / year . Non @-@ point sources , such as seepage and diffused runoff , also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4 @.@ 5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18 @.@ 14 tonnes of nitrogen ( NO3 – N and NH4 – N ) to the lake . Based on the values mentioned above , it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated . 
 The major environmental problem facing the lake is eutrophication , which has required immediate remedial measures to combat it . <unk> , the size of the lake has shrunk from its original area of 22 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 5 sq mi ) to the present area of 18 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 9 sq mi ) , and there is a concerning rate of sediment deposition due to catchment area degradation . The water quality has also deteriorated due to intense pollution caused by the untreated sewage and solid waste that is fed into the lake from the peripheral areas and from the settlements and houseboats . Besides , some experts like Dr. A.A. Kazmi ( Associate Professor , IIT Roorkee and in charge of the Environmental Engineering Lab ) believe that deforestation in the catchment of Dal Lake and Telbal stream may have led to more nitrogen and phosphorus @-@ rich run @-@ off , further aiding eutrophication . <unk> of water channels and consequent clogging has diminished the circulation and inflows into the lake , so with the building up of phosphates and nitrogen , this has led to extensive weed growth and consequences on the biodiversity of the lake .

 Identifying the above major issues as causes for the deterioration of the lake , a multidisciplinary team of experts have prepared a Detailed Project Report ( DPR ) , a responsible management plan entitled " Conservation and Management of Dal Lake " , which has the objective of achieving environment compatibility , cost effectiveness and sustainability , ecological improvement with minimum interventions and displacement and balancing the conflicts of interest . This plan is now under implementation with the financial assistance of the Government of India . 
 The serious nature of the environmental problems the lake has been experienced has been widely publicised and has been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of India . Public Interest Litigations ( PILs ) have been filed in court demonstrating the environmental dangers posed to the lake by sewage , wastes and effluents . The PILs have sought injunctions of the court for setting up of an integrated ring sewage system encircling the Lake ; release of funds by the Government of India to undertake measures to check pollution and to inaugurate a High Powered Committee to monitor proper utilisation of the allotted funds . The committee is under obligation to post feedback of progression developments from time to time , directly to the Supreme Court . The PIL , filed in 2001 , has resulted in a number of directives from the court to the funding and implementing agencies and the case is continuing . Consequently , under the National Lake Conservation Plan of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India , funds to the extent Rs <unk> @.@ 6 million were sanctioned in September 2005 for the conservation of the lake . The restoration and rehabilitation measures envisaged under the " Conservation and Management of Dal Lake " are under various stages of implementation with the funds allocated by the Government of India for the purpose . Some of the measures undertaken for rehabilitating the lake to bring it to its original eutrophication free status involved measures such as construction of siltation tanks , mechanical <unk> , regrouping of houseboats , deepening of outflow channel and removal of bunds and barricades , including some floating gardens . In addition , a moratorium has been imposed on new construction works close to the lakefront , including the building of new house boats . Resettlement plans for migrating the population from the lakefront have also evolved . The long @-@ term development plans also deal with the <unk> of catchment area to reduce erosion movement and movement of silt and to regulate grazing by livestock . Recent reports indicate that , as of 2010 , 40 % of the measures have been implemented . 
 = = Uses and attractions = = 
 The lake is popular as a visitor attraction and a summer resort . Fisheries and the harvesting of food and fodder plants are also important on Dal Lake . Weeds from the lake are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens . It also serves as a flood lung of the Jhelum River . Swimming , boating , snow skiing ( particularly when the lake is frozen during the severe winter ) , and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on the lake . 
 The lake has numerous sites and places of interest , many of which are important to the cultural heritage of Srinagar .

 = 36th Engineer Brigade ( United States ) = 
 The 36th Engineer Brigade is a combat engineer brigade of the United States Army based at Fort Hood , Texas . The brigade is a subordinate unit of III Corps . 
 The unit is responsible for providing command and control to subordinate Engineer units . The unit was formerly designated as the 36th Engineer Group , and before that as the 36th Engineer Regiment . The 36th is the only unit that has been organized in all three command structures that are commanded by a Colonel in the U.S. Army ; regiment , group , and brigade .

The group would follow IX Corps for the remainder of the Korean war . 
 After its withdrawal from Korea , the unit did not participate in any notable campaigns until its inactivation on 30 May 1972 at Fort Lewis . It was reactivated shortly after on 1 July 1973 as the 36th Engineer Group ( Construction ) at Fort Benning , Georgia . It would see no conflicts until the start of the Gulf War . In 1989 , it participated in " Exercise Camino De La Paz , " an unscheduled exercise conducted in the first half of 1989 on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica . 
 = = = Present day = = = 
 During the 1991 Gulf War , the 36th Engineer Group ( Construction ) fought in support of the 24th Infantry Division ’ s rapid attack to the Euphrates . The unit also deployed in support of peace enforcement missions during Operation Continue Hope in Somalia and Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti . Most recently , the 36th Engineer Group ( Construction ) has twice deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom , executing a wide variety of construction missions in support of combat operations , including the construction of enemy prisoner of war camps , theater convoy support centers , and soldier life support areas . Some of the soldiers from the unit were still in Iraq as late as October 2007 . 
 On 16 June 2006 , the unit was reorganized and redesignated the 36th Engineer <unk> and reassigned to Fort Hood , Texas as the United States Army ’ s first modular engineer brigade headquarters . The brigade deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2007 , holding a ceremony at III Corps Headquarters , casing its unit colors in preparation for its deployment on 28 February 2007 . The brigade supports operations conducted by the 82nd Airborne Division .
