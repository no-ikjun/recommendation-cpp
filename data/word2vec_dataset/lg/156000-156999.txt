 " Welcome Party " received mixed reviews from critics . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote that while the series had two goals to perform by the end of the episode — to turn Nellie into a relatable character and break Andy and Jessica up — he felt that both plots failed in execution . He wrote that because the audience knew nothing about Jessica and that he had " already given up on " Nellie as a character , the episode ultimately became an " ' unfunny ' experience " . He ultimately gave the episode a C. Cindy White of IGN compared the writer 's attempt to humanize Nellie to the previous seasons , specifically " The Dundies " when the writers humanized Michael and wrote that she hoped the writers would continue to do this with Nellie . She also went on to praise the interaction between Jim and Pam , saying " Their ability [ ... ] to communicate volumes with a few words or merely a glance demonstrates why their chemistry has been so difficult to replicate with other couples . " . Despite her mainly positive review , she criticized the Andy and Erin subplot because she neither cared about Jessica or Andy and Erin 's relationship and called the whole subplot " a waste of time " . She ultimately gave the episode a 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , calling it " Good " . Writing for New York , Lucy <unk> unfavorably compared the Andy @-@ Erin plotline to Jim and Pam 's from the early seasons of the series , writing that the romance wasn 't able to " take off , because Erin has no real agency " and that the scene where Andy returned to the bachelorette party felt too superficial to reach its potential of becoming a " classic " Office scene . 
 The cold open received particularly positive reviews from critics . Myles McNutt called it " clever " and noted that even he had forgotten whether Stanley had a mustache . Lucy <unk> positively compared it to Guys and Dolls . Cindy White considered a " great ensemble bit " and that it showed promise for the episode , although it didn 't reach that promise . 
 = Providence , Rhode Island = 
 Providence is the capital and most populous city in Rhode Island . Founded in 1636 , it is one of the oldest cities in the United States . It is located in Providence County , and is the third @-@ largest city in the New England region after Boston and Worcester . Providence has a city population of 179 @,@ 154 and is part of the 38th @-@ largest metropolitan population in the country , with an estimated population of 1 @,@ 604 @,@ 291 , exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60 % , as it extends into southern Massachusetts . This can be considered in turn to be part of the Greater Boston commuting area , which contains 7 @.@ 6 million people . The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River , at the head of Narragansett Bay . 
 Providence was founded by Roger Williams , a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony . He named the area in honor of " God 's merciful Providence " , which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle . After becoming one of the first cities in the country to industrialize , Providence became noted for its jewelry and silverware industry . Today , the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning , which has shifted the city 's economy into service industries , though it still retains significant manufacturing activity . 
 Once nicknamed the " Beehive of Industry " , Providence began rebranding itself as the " Creative Capital " in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Settlement = = = 
 The area that is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams , and was one of the original Thirteen Colonies of the United States . Williams and his company felt compelled to withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony . They were greeted by the Narragansetts on rocks near present @-@ day Gano Street with the greeting , " What Cheer , <unk> . " They sought refuge with the Narragansett tribe at a place on the banks of a salt cove , as the chief of the Narragansett , Canonicus , made them welcome . In 1636 , Canonicus gave Williams the large tract of land which became the first nucleus of the colony of Providence Plantation . Williams ' Providence soon became a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters , as he himself had been exiled from Massachusetts . Providence 's growth would be slow during the next quarter @-@ century — the subsuming of its territory into surrounding towns , difficulty of farming the land , and differing of local traditions and land conflicts all slowed development . 
 = = = Revolution = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1770s , the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence 's maritime , fishing and agricultural industries , the mainstay of the city 's economy . One example was the Sugar Act , which was a tax levied against Providence 's distilleries that adversely affected its trade in rum and slaves . These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown . In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws , Providence residents spilled blood in the leadup to the American Revolution in the notorious Gaspée Affair of 1772 . 
 Though during the American Revolutionary War the city escaped British occupation , the capture of nearby Newport disrupted industry and kept the population on alert . Troops were quartered for various campaigns and Brown University 's University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital . French troops were quartered in the city 's Market House . 
 After departing from Newport , French troops sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau passed through Providence on their way to join the attack against British forces . The march from Newport to Providence was the beginning of a campaign led jointly by Rochambeau and General George Washington in a decisive march that ended with the defeat of General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown , Virginia , and the Battle of the Chesapeake . 
 = = = Incorporation as a city = = = 
 Following the war , Providence was the country 's ninth @-@ largest city with 7 @,@ 614 people . The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing , in particular machinery , tools , silverware , jewelry , and textiles . By the start of the 20th century , Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country , including Brown & Sharpe , Nicholson File , and Gorham Silverware . The city 's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland , Germany , Sweden , England , Italy , Portugal , Cape Verde , and French Canada . Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife , notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s . 
 In response to these troubles and the economic growth , Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = City Government = = = 
 From its incorporation as a city in 1832 until 1878 , the seat of city government was located in the Market House , located in Market Square , which was the geographic and social center of the city . The city offices quickly outgrew this building , and in 1845 the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building . The city spent the next 30 years searching for a suitable location , resulting in what some historians have referred to as " Providence 's Thirty Years ' War " , as the council bickered over where to site the new building . Finally , in 1878 the city offices moved into the newly completed City Hall . 
 = = = Civil War = = = 
 During the Civil War , local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton . Despite ambivalence concerning the war , the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota , and the city 's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union . Postwar , horsecar lines covering the city enabled its growth and Providence thrived with waves of immigrants and land annexations bringing the population from 54 @,@ 595 in 1865 to 175 @,@ 597 by 1900 . From the 1890s until around 1951 , a Chinatown existed around the Burrill Street and Empire Street neighborhoods , which were razed under controversy for a highway extension . 
 = = = Growth and decline = = = 
 The city 's boom began to wane in the mid @-@ 1920s as industries , notably textiles , shut down . Jewelry manufacturing continued to grow , taking up the slack and employing many of the city 's new immigrants , coming from Portuguese , Italian , Polish , Lithuanian , and Jewish backgrounds . A number of hospitals also opened . The Great Depression hit the city hard , and Providence 's downtown was subsequently flooded by the New England Hurricane of 1938 . Though the city received a boost from World War II , this ended with the war . The city saw further decline as a result of nationwide trends , with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization . The population would drop by 38 % over the next three decades . From the 1950s to the 1980s , Providence was a notorious bastion of organized crime . The mafia boss Raymond L.S. <unk> ruled a vast criminal enterprise . 
 = = = Renaissance = = = 
 The city 's " Renaissance " began in the 1970s . From 1975 until 1982 , US $ 606 million of local and national Community Development funds were invested throughout the city , and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize . In the 1990s , Mayor Vincent " Buddy " Cianci , Jr showcased the city 's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization , ultimately resulting in the uncovering of the city 's natural rivers ( which had been covered by paved bridges ) , relocation of a large section of railroad underground , creation of Waterplace Park and river walks along the river 's banks , and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink ( now the Bank of America Skating Rink ) downtown and the 1 @.@ 4 million ft ² Providence Place Mall . 
 New investment triggered within the city , with new construction including numerous condo projects , hotels , and a new office high @-@ rise all filling in the freed space . Despite new investment , poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most post @-@ industrial New England cities . Approximately 27 @.@ 9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line . Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels , as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region , with a total area of 20 @.@ 5 square miles ( 53 km2 ) . 18 @.@ 5 square miles ( 48 km2 ) of it is land and the remaining 2 @.@ 1 square miles ( 5 @.@ 4 km2 ) ( roughly 10 % ) of it is water . 
 Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay , with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city , formed by the confluence of the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . The Waterplace Park amphitheater and <unk> line the river 's banks through downtown . 
 Providence is one of many cities claimed , like Rome , to be founded on seven hills . The more prominent hills are : Constitution Hill ( near downtown ) , College Hill ( east of the Providence River ) , and Federal Hill ( west of downtown and is New England 's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts ) . The other four are : <unk> Hill at Fox Point , Smith Hill ( where the State House is located ) , Christian Hill at Hoyle Square ( junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets ) , and <unk> Hill at the lower end of <unk> Street , which was leveled in the early 1880s . 
 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 Providence has 25 official neighborhoods , though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively : 
 The East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone , Hope ( aka Summit ) , Mount Hope , College Hill , Wayland , and Fox Point . 
 The Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I @-@ 95 , the old I @-@ 195 , and the Providence River . The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area 's newly developing life sciences and technology @-@ based economy . 
 The North End is formed by the combination of the neighborhoods of Charles , <unk> , Smith Hill , Elmhurst , and Mount Pleasant . 
 The South Side ( or South Providence ) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood , Lower South Providence , Upper South Providence , and the West End . 
 West Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association . It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End . 
 The West Side is a vague term sometimes used to mean the West End , Olneyville , and Silver Lake . 
 = = = Cityscape = = = 
 The city of Providence is geographically very compact , characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile . It is among the most densely populated cities in the country . For this reason , Providence has the eighth @-@ highest percentage of pedestrian commuters . The street layout is irregular — over one thousand streets ( a great number for the city 's size ) run haphazardly , connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square . 
 Downtown Providence has numerous 19th @-@ century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles , as well as several post @-@ modern and modernist buildings , located throughout the area . In particular , a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre @-@ 1980s development and post @-@ 1980s development . West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two . 
 The newer area , sometimes called " Capitol Center " , includes Providence Place Mall ( 1999 ) , the Omni Providence Hotel ( 1993 ) and The Residences Providence ( 2007 ) , GTECH Corporation ( 2006 ) , Waterplace condominiums ( 2007 ) , and Waterplace Park ( 1994 ) ; the area tends toward newer development , since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the " Chinese Wall " . This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces , wide roads , and intent landscaping . 
 The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago . Many of the state 's tallest buildings are found here . The largest structure , to date , is the art @-@ deco @-@ styled former Industrial Trust Tower , currently the Bank of America Building at 426 feet ( 130 m ) . By contrast , nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza , designed in modern taut @-@ skin cladding , constructed a half @-@ century later . In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza . The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline . Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade , the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S. , built in 1828 . 
 The city 's southern waterfront , away from the downtown core , is the location of many oil tanks , a docking station for a ferry boat , a non @-@ profit sailing center , bars , strip clubs , and power plants . The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008 , after the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss . The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here , built to protect Providence from storm surge , like that which it had endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol . 
 The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills , double- and triple @-@ decker housing ( though row houses , found so commonly in other Northeast cities , are rare here ) , a small number of high @-@ rise buildings ( predominantly for housing the elderly ) , and single family homes . I @-@ 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city 's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill , and the West End . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Providence has a humid continental or humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa or Dfa ) depending on the January isotherm used , with warm summers , cold winters , and high humidity year @-@ round . The USDA places the city in Hardiness zone 6b , with the suburbs falling in zones 6a – 7b . The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps Providence , and the rest of the state of Rhode Island , warmer than many inland locales in New England . January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29 @.@ 2 ° F ( − 1 @.@ 6 ° C ) , and low temperatures dropping to 10 ° F ( − 12 ° C ) or lower an average of 11 days per winter , while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73 @.@ 5 ° F ( 23 @.@ 1 ° C ) , and highs rising to 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) or higher an average of 10 days per summer . Extremes range from − 17 ° F ( − 27 ° C ) on February 9 , 1934 to 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) on August 2 , 1975 ; the record cold daily maximum is 1 ° F ( − 17 ° C ) on February 5 , 1918 , while the record warm daily minimum is 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) on June 6 , 1925 . Temperature readings of 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) or lower are uncommon in Providence , and generally occur once every several years . The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total ; one day in January and seven days in February . Conversely , temperature readings of 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) or higher are even rarer , and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days , all of which were in August . 
 As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard , Providence receives ample precipitation year @-@ round . Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4 @.@ 43 inches ( 112 @.@ 5 mm ) in March to a low of 3 @.@ 17 inches ( 80 @.@ 5 mm ) in July . In general , precipitation levels are slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months , when powerful storms known as Nor 'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions . Although hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England , Providence 's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 As of the census of 2000 , the population comprised 173 @,@ 618 people , 162 @,@ 389 households , and 35 @,@ 859 families .

 The Providence metropolitan area , which includes Providence , Fall River , Massachusetts , and Warwick is estimated to have a population of 1 @,@ 622 @,@ 520 . In 2006 , this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area ( CSA ) , the fifth @-@ largest CSA in the country . In the last fifteen years , Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under @-@ 18 population . The median age of the city is 28 years , while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds , owing to the city 's large student population .

 By 1830 , Providence had manufacturing industries in metals , machinery , textiles , jewelry , and silverware . Though manufacturing has declined , the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing . Services , in particular education , healthcare , and finance , also make up a large portion of the city 's economy . Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility ( SCF ) , a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service .

 After calling Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) " faggy " , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) learns that Oscar finds the word offensive because he is homosexual . Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the entire office . Jan Levenson ( Melora Hardin ) berates Michael for his behavior , after Michael 's seminar on homosexuality is a disaster . When Oscar threatens to quit , Michael attempts to reconcile with Oscar , first by hugging him , and then kissing him on the lips . Oscar is given three months paid vacation and use of a company car in exchange for not suing Dunder Mifflin . 
 It is revealed that after their kiss , Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) confirmed to Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) her intention to marry Roy Anderson ( David Denman ) . However , a few days before the wedding , Pam got cold feet and decided to call it off . She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes . Pam 's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral , hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest . When being interviewed by the camera crew , Roy makes a vow to win Pam back . 
 Jim has transferred to Dunder Mifflin 's Stamford branch and settles into his new office . He befriends smug co @-@ worker Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) who brags about his wild college days at Cornell University . Meanwhile , sales representative Karen Filippelli ( Rashida Jones ) is disconcerted by Jim 's constant smirks to the camera . Mr. Brown ( Larry Wilmore ) is briefly seen giving the Stamford branch a diversity day seminar due to " more problems at the Scranton branch . " 
 Dwight had contacted Jim in Stamford regarding a " gaydar " device .

 " Gay Witch Hunt " was the eighth episode of the series directed by Ken Kwapis . Kwapis had previously directed " Pilot " , " Diversity Day " , " Sexual Harassment " , " The Fire " , " The Fight " , " Booze Cruise " , and " Casino Night " . " Gay Witch Hunt " was written by executive producer and show runner Greg Daniels . 
 The kiss between Michael and Oscar in the conference room was not scripted . The scene had been shot a couple of times with Steve Carell not kissing Oscar Nunez . Then on one take , Oscar saw " [ Carell 's ] lips coming closer and closer " . Nunez recalled " I 'm like , ' Dear God , he 's going to kiss me . ' And sure enough , he planted one on my face . " The other cast members were laughing during the kiss but because the camera stays focused on Carell and Nunez , the scene was still usable . 
 At Paleyfest in early 2007 , Steve Carell later recalled that he enjoyed the episode " because it spoke to the fact that Michael is not a <unk> ; he just doesn 't understand the world . They are two very different things . It 's not that he 's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist , he just doesn 't have a frame of reference . He 's not capable of understanding . And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether . But I think at least the way I feel about the character is he 's a decent heart , a decent person and he 's just trying his best . " 
 The third season DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode , including Karen pulling a prank on Jim by setting his dial tone to call Hong Kong , Andy comparing his jumping skills to Michael Jordan to Jim , Michael asking Pam how she is holding up since the wedding broke off , and Jan being furious at Michael .

 = Bouldering = 
 Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or harnesses . While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever , most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds , chalk to keep their hands dry , and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls . Unlike free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , bouldering problems ( the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb ) are usually less than 6 meters ( 20 ft . ) tall . Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders . Bouldering competitions , which employ a variety of formats , take place in both indoor and outdoor settings . 
 The sport originated as a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering . Bouldering enabled climbers to practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground . Additionally , the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength . Throughout the 1900s , bouldering evolved into a separate discipline . Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty . There have been many different rating systems used throughout the history of the sport , but modern problems usually use either the V @-@ scale or the Fontainebleau scale . 
 The growing popularity of the sport has caused several environmental concerns , including soil erosion and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off @-@ trail to reach bouldering sites . This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Bouldering is a form of rock climbing which takes place on boulders and other small rock formations , usually measuring less than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from ground to top , but in some cases can measure up to 30 + ft . Unlike top rope climbing and lead climbing , no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber . Bouldering routes or " problems " require the climber to reach the top of a boulder , usually from a specified start position . Some boulder problems , known as " traverses , " require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another . 
 The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed . Granite , for example , often features long cracks and slabs . Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks . Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock . 
 There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States , including Hueco Tanks in Texas , Mount Evans in Colorado , and The <unk> in Bishop , California . Squamish , British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada . Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites , such as Fontainebleau in France , Albarracín in Spain , and various mountains throughout Switzerland . 
 = = = Indoor bouldering = = = 
 Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment , usually at climbing gyms . These walls are constructed with wooden panels , polymer cement panels , concrete shells , or precast molds of actual rock walls . Holds , usually made of plastic , are then bolted onto the wall to create problems . The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces , forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength . 
 Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall . In the US the most common method <unk> use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold — for example , holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem , while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area . Across much of the rest of the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem . For example , green may be v0 @-@ v1 , blue may be v2 @-@ v3 and so on . Setting via color has certain advantages , the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are , and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds . Smaller , resource @-@ poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large , expensive holds can be used in multiple routes simply by marking them with more than one color of tape . 
 = = = Competitions = = = 
 Bouldering competitions occur in both indoor and outdoor settings . The International Federation of Sport Climbing ( IFSC ) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds : qualifications , semi @-@ finals , and finals . The rounds feature different sets of four or five boulder problems , and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem . At the end of each round , competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems , with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems . 
 There are several other formats used for bouldering competitions . Some competitions give climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between each attempt , unlike the IFSC format , in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose . In an open @-@ format competition , all climbers compete simultaneously , and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible . More points are awarded for more difficult problems , while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem . 
 In 2012 , the IFSC submitted a proposal to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to include lead climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics . The proposal was later revised to an " overall " competition , which would feature bouldering , lead climbing , and speed climbing . In May 2013 , the IOC announced that climbing would not be added to the 2020 Olympic program . 
 = = History = = 
 Rock climbing first emerged as a sport in the mid @-@ 1800s . Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering , not as a separate discipline , but as a form of training for larger ascents . In the early 20th century , the Fontainebleau area of France established itself as a prominent climbing area , where some of the first dedicated <unk> ( or " boulderers " ) emerged . The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete , Pierre Allain . 
 In the 1960s , the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician John Gill , who contributed several important innovations . Gill 's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics , a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions . He applied this idea to bouldering , which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds . Gill developed a closed @-@ ended rating system : B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time , B2 problems were more difficult , and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once . 
 Gill introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber 's hands dry . He also emphasized the importance of strength training to complement technical skill . Neither of these practices had been popular among climbers , but as Gill 's ability level and influence grew , his ideas became the norm . 
 Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s : Bouldering mats and artificial climbing walls . The former , also referred to as " crash pads " , prevented injuries from falling , and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise . Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing , and allowed serious climbers to train year @-@ round regardless of weather conditions . 
 As the sport grew in popularity , new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States , and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions . The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s , as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques , find hard problems , and announce newly completed projects . 
 In early 2010 , two American climbers claimed first ascents on boulder problems that have come to be regarded as the most difficult in the world : The Game near Boulder , Colorado , established by Daniel Woods ; and Lucid Dreaming near Bishop , California , established by Paul Robinson . The following year , fellow American Carlo <unk> claimed the second ascent of The Game and in January 2014 , American Daniel Woods completed the second ascent of " Lucid Dreaming . " In 2011 , Czech climber Adam <unk> claimed the second ascent of Gioia , originally established three years earlier by Italian <unk> Christian Core , and suggested that it was among the world 's most challenging boulder problems . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 Unlike other climbing sports , bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment , an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers . Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that " The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders " . Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a <unk> as the bare minimum , while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes , chalk , brushes , crash pads , and a skincare kit . 
 Of the aforementioned equipment , climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance . Besides protecting the climber 's feet from rough surfaces , climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds . Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear , and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork . They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations : High @-@ top shoes , for example , provide better protection for the ankle , while low @-@ top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement . <unk> shoes excel at securing small edges , whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity . The front of the shoe , called the " toe box " , can be asymmetric , which performs well on overhanging rocks , or symmetric , which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs . 
 Most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands to absorb sweat . It is stored in a small <unk> which can be tied around the waist , allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb . Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs ; they are often attached to the end of a stick , pipe , or other straight object in order to reach higher holds . Crash pads , also referred to as bouldering mats , are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls . 
 = = Safety = = 
 Boulder problems are generally shorter than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from ground to top . This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , but with no upper limit on the height of the climb . However , minor injuries are common in bouldering , particularly sprained ankles and wrists . Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering : first , boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines , making falls more common . Second , without ropes to arrest the climber 's descent , every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground . 
 To prevent injuries , boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing , as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads . Upon landing , boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics : spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures , and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact . 
 = = Technique = = 
 As with other forms of climbing , bouldering technique is largely centered on proper footwork . Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles ; thus , proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning , relying on their legs to push them up the boulder . <unk> also keep their arms straight whenever possible , allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles . 
 Bouldering movements are described as either " static " or " dynamic " . Static movements are those that are performed slowly , with the climber 's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs . Dynamic movements use the climber 's momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically , with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately . 
 = = Grading = = 
 Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by <unk> and climbers . The two most widely used rating systems are the V @-@ scale and the Fontainebleau system . 
 The V @-@ scale , which originated in the United States , is an open @-@ ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty . The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts . The scale begins at <unk> , and as of 2013 , the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is <unk> . Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems . 
 The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system , with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters a , b , and c . For example , Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6 , while Fontainebleau 7C + is equivalent to V10 . In both systems , grades are further differentiated by appending " + " to indicate a small increase in difficulty . Despite this level of specificity , ratings of individual problems are often controversial , as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber . Height , arm length , flexibility , and other body characteristics can also be relevant . 
 = = Environmental impact = = 
 Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks , such as mosses and lichens . This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder , or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds . Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse , particularly by climbers laying down crash pads . Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails , or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer . Other environmental concerns include littering , improperly disposed feces , and graffiti . These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering , as was the case in Tea Garden , a popular bouldering area in <unk> , South Africa .

 " The Red Throne " is the forty @-@ seventh episode from the fifth season of Adventure Time , an animated television series . In the episode , Flame Princess ( Jessica DiCicco ) , with the help of Cinnamon Bun ( Dee Bradley Baker ) and Finn ( Jeremy Shada ) , tries to escape from an arranged marriage between her and Don John the Flame Lord ( Roddy Piper ) , as set up by her father the Flame King ( Keith David ) . Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone wrote the episode from a synopsis devised by several other writers , including show creator Pendleton Ward . 
 Piper and David , stars of They Live ( 1987 ) , a John Carpenter film , lent their voices for two of the aforementioned characters . The episode contains a parody from a popular combat sequence in the film , in which the actors box for close to six minutes . Meanwhile , background art was accomplished by Derek Ballard , whose experience growing up in Utah inspired one of his pieces for the episode . Originally aired on 10 February 2014 , " The Red Throne " was seen by roughly two million viewers . Writers of <unk> and education @-@ related websites praised the episode for its writing and themes , as well as the performances by Piper and David . Despite this praise , the Adventure Time crew perceived its online response from fans as negative .

 " The Red Throne " was written by Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone . A separate group of writers – Kent Osborne , Pendleton Ward , Jack Pendarvis , and Adam Muto – came up with the idea for the episode , which Kim and Xayaphone adapted to a storyboard . The creator of Adventure Time , Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season . Employing other crew members , background artist Derek Ballard depicted a derelict van , a wrecked truck , and ruined musical instruments in one piece for the episode . This was inspired by his growing up in the desert of Utah . Since he himself was in a band , he would often let other bands temporarily stay at his house during their tours , often taking them to auto shops due to their vans and campers breaking down . 
 The voice of Don John the Flame Lord was supplied by " Rowdy " Roddy Piper , in unison with Keith David , who provided the voice of the Flame King . A distinguished wrestler and actor , Piper had appeared in numerous films . One of his most famous roles is that of the unnamed man ( dubbed Nada ) in They Live , directed by John Carpenter and released in 1988 . A well @-@ known scene in the film – lasting for nearly six minutes – has the man fight with his friend ( David ) , whom Nada wants to share his glasses with . In similar fashion , the Adventure Time episode includes a parody of that scene , in which Don John and the Flame King engage in combat . The scene in They Live was previously the subject of spoofs in South Park and Saints Row IV , though this parody was called exemplar for reuniting both Piper and David . WWE similarly found Don John 's line , " my gym is magic , and my protein shake is rage " , seemingly written for Piper 's wrestling persona .

 Cartoon Network originally aired " The Red Throne " on 10 February 2014 . Approximately two million people saw the episode live on broadcast ; according to TV by the Numbers , 0 @.@ 4 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old residents of households with television sets watched the episode , as indicated by its Nielsen rating . The network released the episode on DVD , first in the year of that broadcast , as part of the Finn the Human box set , and later in 2015 , as part of a box set for the complete fifth season . 
 The Adventure Time crew was satisfied with the episode on its completion . In spite of that , Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative , much to their surprise . It earned an A − grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club , who compared Cinnamon Bun 's evolution from a simple @-@ minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself . Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity . Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience , as well as the nostalgia felt over such a relationship . Separate from romance , Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler . 
 The Huffington Post writer Cat Blake cited Cinnamon Bun gaining the affection of Flame Princess as a reason for secondary schoolers not to underestimate people . Staff writers of TV.com called this character progression for " seemingly one @-@ note characters " a strength of the show , as similarly applied to the Ice King . Writing in DVD Talk , Adam Tyner described the episode as showing Finn at his most embarrassing . In memoriam of Piper , who died in July 2015 , Brandon Stroud of <unk> called Don Jon one of his best roles in pop culture . In the The Official Tribute Commemorative Magazine for Piper , editor Jeff Ashworth and staff supposed that fans of the series were likely foreign to the " grizzly tones " of Piper 's voice . The commemoration saw his guest role as showing his mastery of pop culture while calling Don Jon 's bizarre fate normal in the show 's universe . 
 = Running to Stand Still = 
 " Running to Stand Still " is a song by rock band U2 , and it is the fifth track from their 1987 album , The Joshua Tree . A slow ballad based on piano and guitar , it describes a heroin @-@ addicted couple living in Dublin 's Ballymun flats ; the towers have since become associated with the song . Though a lot of time was dedicated to the lyrics , the music was improvised with co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois during a recording session for the album . 
 The group explored American music for The Joshua Tree , and as such , " Running to Stand Still " demonstrates folk rock and acoustic blues influences . The song was praised by critics , many of them calling it one of the record 's best tracks . It has since been included in the regular set lists of four U2 concert tours , in two different arrangements and with several possible thematic interpretations . Since the song 's release , the phrase " running to stand still " has become more widely used . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Running to Stand Still " was written by U2 in the context of the heroin addiction epidemic in Dublin of the 1980s , much like " Bad " ( and to some extent " Wire " ) had been from their 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire . Bassist Adam Clayton has referred to the song as " Bad Part II " . Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott 's decline and death from addiction also resonated with Clayton at the time . 
 Until their 2014 album Songs of Innocence , U2 had written relatively few songs directly related to their growing up in Dublin , often giving higher priority to works about The Troubles in Northern Ireland or to international concerns . When they have written about Dublin , allusions to it have often been disguised . But " Running to Stand Still " was one of those with specific Dublin connections : 
 This lyric was a reference to the Ballymun flats , a group of seven local authority , high @-@ rise residential tower blocks built in the Ballymun neighborhood of Dublin during the 1960s . Paul Hewson ( later known as U2 's lead vocalist Bono ) had grown up on <unk> Road in the adjacent Glasnevin neighborhood , in a house across fields behind the towers , near his friends and future artists <unk> <unk> ( later known as Gavin Friday ) and Derek Rowan ( later known as Guggi ) . Bono had played in the towers ' foundations as they were being built , then traveled in their elevators for the novel experience . Over time , poor maintenance , lack of facilities for children , transient tenancies , and other factors caused social conditions and communal ties to break down in the flats . The place began to stink of urine and vomit , and glue <unk> and used needles were common sights , as were appearances of the Garda Síochána . Guggi later lived in the towers during years that he was struggling personally with drugs . It was through his exposure to people without hope in the flats that Bono began to develop his social consciousness . 
 Bono may have used Ballymun as the inspiration ( without any explicit lyrical references to it ) for the 1980 U2 song " Shadows and Tall Trees " , and later likened living in the area to some of the scenes portrayed in the 1992 Mike Newell film Into the West . Driving by there in 1987 , Bono said , " See the seven tall buildings there ? They 're ' the seven towers . ' They have the highest suicide rate in Ireland . After they discovered everywhere else in the world that you don 't put people living on top of each other , we built them here . " 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 The song 's title phrase originated from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going , and the brother responding , " It 's like running to stand still . " Bono had not heard the phrase before , and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction and the effects of the drug on the body were like ; a writer later described the title as a " perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction . " Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts , a man and a woman , who lived in the Ballymun towers . Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit , the man became a heroin smuggler , operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday . Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions , as well as poor choices , and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives . The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly , but instead <unk> the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in . In doing so , the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman . A character monologue from Wim Wenders ' 1984 film Paris , Texas , was also a significant influence on Bono 's writing of the song . 
 Although the lyrics of " Running to Stand Still " were worked on a great deal , the musical composition was essentially improvised by the band during the recording process at Dublin 's Windmill Lane Studios . Guitarist the Edge began playing some chords during a session for another song . Producer Daniel Lanois joined in on guitar , and the rest of the group followed . This initial improvised version incorporated all the elements of the final song structure , and the sound and feel of the group playing in a room together without overdubs contributed to the track 's effectiveness . Lou Reed 's " Walk on the Wild Side " and Elton John 's " Candle in the Wind " , both of which had served as end snippets for " Bad " on the Unforgettable Fire Tour , were loose inspirations . The influence of Reed 's works can be felt throughout the song , as can Van Morrison to an extent . Indeed , in a published tribute following Reed 's 2013 death , Bono offered " Running to Stand Still " as " red @-@ handed proof " of the influence that Reed and the Velvet Underground had had upon U2 . 
 = = Composition and interpretation = = 
 Much of The Joshua Tree showed the band 's fascination with American culture , politics , and musical forms , and while the lyrics of " Running to Stand Still " were Irish @-@ based , the musical arrangement for it began with touches of acoustic blues and country blues that represented an idiomatic stretch for the group . Although producer Brian Eno was known for introducing European textural music into U2 's sound , he also had a strong fondness for folk and gospel music . Indeed , writers have seen echoes of Bruce Springsteen 's stark acoustic 1982 album Nebraska in the song 's sound . 
 " Running to Stand Still " is a soft , piano @-@ based ballad played in a key of D major at a tempo of 92 beats per minute . The song follows a traditional verse @-@ chorus form . In the introduction and conclusion is a mournful slide acoustic guitar in Eno and Lanois ' production that Rolling Stone called both grim and dreamy . Most of the piano part alternates between the D and G chords , an example of the Edge 's longtime practice of composing around two @-@ chord progressions . The part gives the song an elegiac feel . Accompanying the piano for much of the song is Lanois ' soft playing of a so @-@ called electric " scrape guitar " , which he contributed to add texture . Soft , echoing drums from Larry Mullen , Jr . , enter after the second chorus . A harmonica part from Bono takes the song to its faded conclusion . Bono 's vocal range in the song runs from A3 to D6 . 
 In the song , the woman 's addiction and misdirected desire for transcendence are reflected in lines such as " She runs through the streets / With her eyes painted red " and " She will suffer the needle chill " . Bono 's lyrics evoke helplessness and frustration in the lines " You 've got to cry without weeping , talk without speaking , scream without raising your voice " . The title phrase is not used until the last line of the song . This compositional technique relies upon delayed gratification and is heard in a few other popular songs , such as the Cure 's " Just Like Heaven " and George Michael 's " One More Try " . 
 U2 songs often have multiple interpretations , and " Running to Stand Still " has ones beyond its immediate context . On the website <unk> , there are several posts from readers who never realized the song is about drug addiction and heard it instead in contexts ranging from personal challenge to religious salvation . A staffer for the fan website <unk> found the song to be a very meaningful inspiration towards personal discovery . In the liner notes to the 20th anniversary reissue of The Joshua Tree , writer Bill Flanagan stated , " ' Running to Stand Still ' is for anyone who feels trapped in an impossible circumstance by overwhelming responsibility . " Uncut magazine writer Andrew Mueller noted that the theme was effective in depicting " the drug as another bogus escape , another fraudulent promise that there 's ever any evading the truth . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Running to Stand Still " earned critical praise upon The Joshua Tree 's release , which itself received very favourable reviews and went on to become the group 's best @-@ selling album . Rolling Stone wrote , " After the first few times through [ it ] , you notice the remarkable music ... It sounds like a lovely , peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie 's reverie , and when that realization hits home , the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power . " In Time magazine 's 1987 cover story on the band , Jay Cocks wrote that " A U2 tune like ' Running to Stand Still ' , with a <unk> melody that slips over the transom of consciousness , insinuates itself into your dreams . " The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono 's best . The 1991 Trouser Press Record Guide , however , said that the song " has mood but no presence " . 
 " Running to Stand Still " became a Dublin anthem of sorts , <unk> the Ballymun towers . It has been considered by pop music writer Brent Mann as one of the more powerful songs written about drug addiction , joining the likes of Jefferson Airplane 's 1967 " White Rabbit " , Neil Young 's 1972 " The Needle and the Damage Done " , Martika 's 1989 " Toy Soldiers " , and Third Eye Blind 's 1997 " Semi @-@ Charmed Life " . 
 Irish music writer Niall Stokes considers " Running to Stand Still " to be one of the most important songs on The Joshua Tree , not only on its own merits as a " mature and compelling ... haunting , challenging piece of pop poetry " , but also because its moral ambiguity and lack of condemnation of its characters presaged the chaotic direction the band would take a few years later with Achtung Baby and the Zoo TV Tour . Rolling Stone 's 2003 list of " The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " – which placed The Joshua Tree at 26th – said that while the album is remembered for the Edge 's trademark guitar sounds and the group 's spiritual quests , " Running to Stand Still " remains one of its most moving songs . This latter sentiment was echoed by the Irish Independent . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Throughout its live history , " Running to Stand Still " has nearly always followed " Bullet the Blue Sky " , matching the order they appear on the album . It was first played live on the Joshua Tree Tour , with the Edge playing keyboards and Bono playing guitar , usually acoustic . During the 27 May 1987 show at Rome 's Stadio Flaminio – the opener of that tour 's second leg , and the first in Europe – 35 @,@ 000 people sang along to the song 's " Ha la la la de day " refrain , bringing a side @-@ of @-@ stage Brian Eno to tears . One performance of the song was captured on the 1988 filmed documentary of the tour , Rattle and Hum , but was not included on the accompanying album . A different tour performance was included on both the DVD and album Live from Paris , released in 2007 . On the Lovetown Tour , during one Dublin show that was broadcast worldwide , the song segued into a verse of Ewan MacColl 's classic ode to industrial bleakness , " Dirty Old Town " ; this show was released in 2004 as Live from the Point Depot . 
 During the Zoo TV Tour , the song 's performance was significantly altered . In these shows , the Edge played guitar on his Fender Stratocaster with the band on the main stage , while Bono sang the song on the B @-@ stage with a headset microphone . Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict , rolling up his sleeves and then spiking his arm during the final lyric , after which he would sing " Hallelujah " over and over while reaching up into a pillar of white light . Writer Robyn Brothers sees the addition of the " Hallelujah " coda as indicating that while organized religion may act in the role of a sedative , a notion akin to other Zoo TV themes , the role of personal faith may still have a " desiring , affirming , and ' <unk> ' force . " At the culmination of the " Bullet to Blue Sky " to " Running to Stand Still " sequence , red and yellow smoke flares came out from either end of the stage ( an idea of U2 's security chief , who was a U.S. Vietnam veteran ) , as the coda segued into " Where the Streets Have No Name " . This arrangement and performance of " Running to Stand Still " was included in the 1994 concert film Zoo TV : Live from Sydney . 
 " Running to Stand Still " was not played on the PopMart Tour or Elevation Tour , but it returned to U2 concerts on the 2005 Vertigo Tour , with the original combination of the Edge on keyboards and Bono on guitar . During most of its performance on the Vertigo Tour , it once again followed " Bullet the Blue Sky " and culminated with a video clip of several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights being read . ( After July 2005 , it was replaced in that role and in the set list by " Miss Sarajevo " . ) During the 19 June 2005 show on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi 's birthday , " Running to Stand Still " included snippets of " Walk On " , a song originally written for her . Author Steve Stockman felt that in this tour 's uses , " Running to Stand Still " was one of the band 's songs from the 1980s that had lost its original meaning and was no longer about drug @-@ dealing in the Ballymun towers . Rather , it was now being used to develop the show 's theme that a belief in faith and in human potential could overcome the bleakest and most desperate situations ; in this , it fit within the Vertigo Tour 's emphasis on coexistence and the ONE Campaign . This assessment agreed to by an <unk> review , and author John Jobling has called the new interpretation an " anti @-@ persecution paean " that was used to remove the sting of " Bullet the Blue Sky " being used to criticize American behavior during the Iraq War . In contrast , USA Today 's veteran rock writer Edna Gundersen found the song 's performance still established a " devastating " mood and the New York Daily News said that the group " thinned ' Running To Stand Still ' to give it a new mourning " . Two other U.S. reviewers remarked that the song was lesser known to audiences , with Variety saying its inclusion helped the band connect with the past while avoiding cliché . One tour performance of " Running to Stand Still " was included on the Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago DVD , during which Bono dedicated the Hallelujah coda to members of the American and British militaries fighting overseas . The song was not performed during the U2 360 ° Tour , with The Vancouver Sun bemoaning the absence of this " stone @-@ cold classic of the U2 canon " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The use of the phrase " running to stand still " dates to at least to the 1920s and 1930s . It comes from the image presented in Lewis Carroll 's 1871 children 's novel Through the Looking @-@ Glass . Since the album and song 's release , use of the phrase seems to have increased . Between 1851 and 1986 , the phrase occurred four times in The New York Times ; from 1987 to 2009 , the phrase has occurred ten times ( not counting mentions of the song itself ) . The phrase occurs many more times in Google News archive searches from 1987 on ( excluding those to the song itself ) than from 1986 and before . The phrase has been used in connection with drug addiction and closely related issues a number of times , including in academic papers and in New York magazine 's description of the heroin @-@ centric 1993 Irvine Welsh novel Trainspotting . 
 Future music video director Dave Meyers wrote a movie script to the song while a film student at Loyola Marymount University . The 2004 first @-@ season episode " Running to Stand Still " of the U.S. television series Desperate Housewives was named after the song . It featured the Lynette Scavo character resorting to taking her children 's ADD medication in order to cope with the overwhelming demands of her domestic life . A fifth @-@ season episode of the U.S. television series One Tree Hill , itself named after a U2 song , was called " Running to Stand Still " . 
 By mid @-@ 2000s , the Ballymun towers were in the process of being torn down , and the Ballymun area was the target of a € 1 @.@ 8 billion regeneration scheme intended to create a self @-@ sustaining community of 30 @,@ 000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan . Despite their failure as housing , the towers had left a long cultural legacy , of which " Running to Stand Still " was the first and perhaps best @-@ known exemplar ; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin . Former towers residents were not always happy with the song . Lynn Connolly , whose 2006 memoir The Mun : Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s , readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time . But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media . She thus wrote , " regardless of what U2 say in their song , ' Running to Stand Still ' , there was certainly more than one way out . " In a newspaper interview , Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect : " It doesn 't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person , living alone in a flat in Ballymun , listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying . " She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself , and said , " Perhaps it gave him a sort of street @-@ cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice , safe , respectable <unk> Road in Glasnevin . " 
 The Ballymun area was still so associated with " Running to Stand Still " and the drug problem of the time , that local backers of the regeneration went to pains to point out the recent progress . A Bono remark that it was dangerous to walk in Ballymun at night found a good deal of publicity . A fansite listing U2 @-@ related Dublin area sights in 2004 mentioned Ballymun 's connection to the song , cautioning , " do not go here on foot – this is a bad area " . U2 's official website noted that the area was much changed now ; Bono himself said " he 's very proud to come from the Ballymun area " ; the fansite subsequently modified its listing and said an on @-@ foot visit to Ballymun was warranted .

 Diddy Kong Racing is a racing video game developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64 . It was first released on 14 November 1997 in Japan , 21 November 1997 in Europe and 24 November 1997 in North America . The game is set in " Timber 's Island " and revolves around Diddy Kong and his friends ' attempt to defeat the intergalactic pig @-@ wizard antagonist , Wizpig , through winning a series of races . The player can take control of any of the featured characters throughout the game . Diddy Kong Racing features five worlds with four racetracks each , and the ability to drive a car , hovercraft , or pilot an aeroplane . 
 Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2 , and was intended to be a real @-@ time strategy game known as " Wild Cartoon Kingdom " during early stages . As time progressed , the game shifted from a Walt Disney World @-@ influenced racing game to a unique title named " Pro @-@ Am 64 " , in which Nintendo had no involvement with . Due to the delays of Banjo @-@ Kazooie , Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997 , thus making the decision to revolve a game around the character of Diddy Kong . 
 Diddy Kong Racing received positive reviews from critics upon release . The graphics , audio and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game , however minor criticism was directed at its repetitiveness . The game has sold 4 @.@ 5 million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo 64 's sixth best @-@ selling game . A cancelled sequel , Donkey Kong Racing , was in development for the GameCube , however it was abandoned after Microsoft 's purchase of Rare for £ 375 million in 2002 . An enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS titled Diddy Kong Racing DS was released worldwide in 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Diddy Kong Racing , players can choose one of eight characters , who have access to three different vehicles : car , hovercraft and aeroplane . The car is an all @-@ round vehicle , however it is slowest on surfaces such as sand and water . The hovercraft is designed for both sand and water areas but lacks in acceleration and manoeuvrability . The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas ; it is good at acceleration and manoeuvring , however it has the slowest speed . Each racetrack has a set of boosters known as " zippers " that temporarily boost the player 's speed , as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various colours that provide power @-@ ups . There are five different types of balloons : red , blue , green , yellow , and rainbow . Red balloons grant missiles to attack racers ahead , blue balloons grant a speed boost , yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks , green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers , and rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer to the nearest racer . If multiple balloons of the same colour are picked up , the power @-@ up will be upgraded to a more powerful version . A total of two upgrades are available for each balloon . Additionally , racetracks contain non @-@ regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up . A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed but can also be obtained to prevent other players from gaining speed . If a racer gets hit , two bananas will be deducted . 
 In " Adventure Mode " , players control the racer of their choice to progress through the story . Players begin on Timber 's Island , which consists of five interconnected worlds ; Dino Domain , Snowflake Mountain , Sherbet Island , Dragon Forest , and Future Fun Land . Each world contains four race tracks , an unlockable battle stage and a race against a boss character . Depending on the race track , players may have a choice of using either a car , hovercraft or aeroplane . Each race track contains boosters to racers that cross them , and balloons of various colours that provide power @-@ ups to racers . If the player defeats Wizpig in Future Fun Land , obtains all amulet pieces and collect all of the gold medals , the player will be able to play in a mode called " Adventure 2 " . In this mode , all of the balloons change colour to platinum and the tracks are inverted from left to right . The game also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps , a capture @-@ the @-@ flag @-@ style battle and a mode which involves opponents capturing eggs .

 Timber the Tiger 's parents go on holiday and leave their son in charge of the island they live on , leaving him and his friends to organise a race . Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig @-@ wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber 's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet 's racetracks . He turns the island 's four guardians ( Tricky the Triceratops , <unk> the Octopus , Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon ) into his henchmen . The only solution available to the island 's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars , hovercrafts , and aeroplanes . Drumstick the Rooster , the best racer on the island , failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig 's black magic . 
 Timber recruits a team of eight racers : Diddy Kong , the first recruit ; Conker the Squirrel and Banjo the Bear , recruited by Diddy ; <unk> the <unk> , Diddy 's enemy who follows after him ; and <unk> the Turtle , T.T. the Stopwatch , <unk> the Mouse , and Bumper the Badger , inhabitants of Timber 's island . Aided by Taj , an Indian elephant genie residing on the island , they eventually complete all of Wizpig 's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him . Shortly afterwards , Drumstick is turned back into a rooster , and Wizpig leaves for his home planet , Future Fun Land . Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber 's Island , the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge . When Wizpig loses the second race , the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon . However , an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig 's spaceship flying through the sky , unscathed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct 2 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console . At its first stage of development , Diddy Kong Racing was conceived as a real @-@ time strategy game with a caveman / time @-@ travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members ; Chris Stamper , Lee Musgrave , Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman . During later stages of development , the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom , in which Nintendo had no involvement with . In June 1997 , the game was altered to Pro Am 64 , an unrelated follow @-@ up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro @-@ Am . According to Schuneman , the Pro Am 64 project featured three @-@ wheeled <unk> in contrast to radio @-@ controlled cars . 
 Due to Banjo @-@ Kazooie being delayed until the summer of 1998 , the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video game in time for Christmas 1997 . Rare felt that Pro Am 64 did not have a strong enough intellectual property to capture the attention of consumers , and thus changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong . According to Musgrave , the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice , a decision which Nintendo " enjoyed " . Once the intellectual property was changed , the team were left to adapt the visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released . Musgrave stated that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it " run as fast " as Mario Kart 64 , which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilised sprites of characters whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully 3D models . Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall project due to the " small team " of 14 people who worked on it . In an October 2012 interview , Musgrave stated that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character of Pro Am 64 had the intellectual property for Diddy Kong Racing not been conceived . At least two of the characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing , Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel , went on to feature in their own series , the Banjo @-@ Kazooie series and Conker series , respectively . 
 = = = Soundtrack = = = 
 The music for the game was composed by David Wise . The soundtrack was first released in Japan on 1 April 1998 , with 42 tracks , a German version of the album was released in Europe with the same number of tracks . For its United States release only 16 tracks were featured . The disc itself was specially shaped in the form of Diddy Kong 's head , which was unplayable in certain CD players . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game received positive reviews from critics upon release . The Nintendo 64 version holds an aggregate score of 88 % at both GameRankings and Metacritic , whereas the Nintendo DS remake received a score of 66 % at GameRankings and a score of 63 at Metacritic , based on 39 reviews . Diddy Kong Racing sold approximately 4 @.@ 5 million copies worldwide ; which included 3 @.@ 78 million copies sold in the United States and PAL regions , and 653 @,@ 928 copies in Japan . It also stands as the Nintendo 64 's sixth best @-@ selling game . 
 The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game . Scott McCall of AllGame asserted that Rare proved it was " the only developer " who offered no distance fog in their games . However , McCall acknowledged its only shortcoming was its " excessive " amount of clipping , although he admitted it was not " unbearable " . Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot stated that the game was a " pleasure to look at " and praised the detail of the tracks . Doug Perry of IGN heralded the visuals as the most " spectacular of its kind " , and praised Rare 's ability to master dynamic animation through enabling polygons to span larger surfaces without loss of framerate . Furthermore , Perry stated that the game 's technical achievements were enough to leave " even the most critical Japanese gamer [ to ] look upon with smiling eyes " . In a retrospective review , Andrew Donaldson of Nintendo Life stated that the game was visually " incredibly vibrant " and " captivating " for a game of the early Nintendo 64 era . 
 McCall praised the wide range of audio in the game , including its voice acting and soundtrack ; he heralded the music as " interesting " and " fitting " to its race tracks , also considering it superior to that of Mario Kart 64 . Although Gerstmann considered the gameplay to be similar to Mario Kart 64 and at times " repetitive " , he praised the game 's range of transportation and dynamics , which included utilising hovercrafts on water @-@ based tracks and flying an aeroplane . Perry felt that the vocals of characters in the game were " heartwarming " and " comical " , while also stating that the music in each environment was " charming " and " dynamic " . Donaldson criticised game 's presentation as too " cutesy " , especially in terms of the characters ' voices . However , he praised the " upbeat " and " catchy " soundtrack , saying that each track had its own unique tune to suit the distinct environment . 
 Diddy Kong Racing won the Console Racing Game of the Year at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 1998 , beating Mario Kart 64 , Moto Racer and NASCAR 98 .

 After the release of Diddy Kong Racing , Rare began development on a sequel named Donkey Kong Racing for the GameCube , which featured Donkey Kong as the titular character . A pre @-@ rendered CGI video of the game was shown at E3 2001 , which displayed a parody of a scene from Star Wars : Return of the Jedi . According to Lee Musgrave , the game featured a unique mechanic which involved riding on animals rather than driving vehicles , in which the player could switch between different types of animals mid @-@ race ; larger animals could destroy obstacles whereas smaller ones allowed more manoeuvrability . Development of Donkey Kong Racing was cancelled when Nintendo turned down the opportunity to purchase its remaining 51 percent stake in Rare , and was eventually bought out by Microsoft for £ 375 million in 2002 . 
 After the cancellation of Donkey Kong Racing , Rare created a prototype for the GameCube which expanded into an adventure game similar to the original setup of Diddy Kong Racing . Musgrave stated that the concept was " built from scratch " and featured a limited multiplayer version at one point . The unnamed concept was in development over 18 months and evolved from being an animal @-@ orientated racing game to an open world game with Tamagotchi @-@ style features , in which nurturing animals was a " key mechanic " . During this time , the original concept for Donkey Kong Racing was reworked into Sabreman Stampede , which was eventually cancelled . 
 Aside from Donkey Kong Racing , another sequel to Diddy Kong Racing named Diddy Kong Pilot was planned for release on the Game Boy Advance . Originally announced alongside Donkey Kong Racing at E3 2001 , the game eventually became Banjo @-@ Pilot after Microsoft 's acquisition of Rare . At the time of its announcement , the game featured the ability to play using a tilt function as well as a D @-@ pad , and contained at least five available tracks . 
 = = = Remake = = = 
 Diddy Kong Racing was remade for the Nintendo DS as Diddy Kong Racing DS . Developed and published by Rare , it was released on 5 February 2007 in North America , and on 20 April 2007 in Europe . This version received enhanced visuals and framerate in addition to a touchscreen function . The DS version also features new modes which allows the player to create their own racetracks , customise their characters through recording voices and an online multiplayer function . The game was met with mixed reviews upon release , with critics asserting that the new additions were " gimmicky " and the touchscreen controls felt " horribly sensitive " . 
 = HMS Forester ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Forester was one of nine F @-@ class destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the early 1930s . Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 during the Abyssinia Crisis . A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939 , she helped to sink one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 . Forester was sent to Gibraltar in mid @-@ 1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir and the Battle of Dakar between escorting the aircraft carriers of Force H as they flew off aircraft for Malta and covering convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941 . During this time the ship helped to sink another German submarine . 
 Converted into an escort destroyer midway through the war , Forester was assigned to escort convoys to Russia for the next year and a half and then in the North Atlantic until mid @-@ 1944 . The ship helped to sink another German submarine before she was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings . Forester assisted in sinking a German submarine before returning to the North Atlantic for a few months . The ship was under repair for the first half of 1945 and was then reduced to reserve in November before being scrapped in early 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The F @-@ class ships were repeats of the preceding E class . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Forester carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' in sequence from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The F class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Forester had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder ( 76 mm ) AA gun when she returned to England in October 1941 . In April – June 1943 , she was converted into an escort destroyer . A Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge , replacing the director @-@ control tower and rangefinder . The ship also received a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast . Her short @-@ range AA armament was augmented by four 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon guns and the .50 @-@ calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons . A split Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast ' A ' gun and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that ' Y ' gun and the 12 @-@ pounder had to be removed to compensate for their weight . By 1944 the ship carried 115 depth charges . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Forester was built by J. Samuel White at its Cowes shipyard under the 1932 Naval Programme . The ship was laid down on 15 May 1933 , launched on 28 June 1934 , as the eleventh ship to carry the name , and completed on 19 April 1935 . The ship cost 248 @,@ 898 pounds , excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets . Forester was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( DF ) of the Home Fleet , but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet , together with most of her sister ships , during the Abyssinian crisis in June and remained here until February 1936 . She was deployed to Gibraltar in September – October 1937 during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 . The ship then returned home and spent the next two years with the 6th DF . The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939 , five months before the start of World War II . Forester remained assigned to it until June 1940 , escorting the larger ships of the fleet . 
 After a pair of fishing trawlers were sunk by a submarine off the Hebrides after the start of World War II in September 1939 , the 6th and 8th DFs were ordered to sweep the area on 19 September . The following day , Forester and three of her sisters sank the German submarine U @-@ 27 and then resumed their normal escort duties . On 11 February 1940 , she helped to tow the damaged tanker MV Imperial Transport to port after she was torpedoed by U @-@ 53 . Two months later , Forester escorted the battleship Warspite during the Second Battle of Narvik on 13 April and engaged several German destroyers . Only lightly damaged herself , she escorted the badly damaged destroyer Cossack to Skjelfjord for temporary repairs after the battle . Two days later , Forester was one of the screen for the battleship Rodney and the battlecruiser Renown as they sailed back to Scapa Flow to refuel . In early June , the ship was escorting the battlecruiser Repulse and two cruisers as they searched for illusory German commerce raiders off Iceland ; they were recalled to Norwegian waters on 9 June after the Germans launched Operation Juno , an attack on the Allied convoys evacuating Norway , but the Germans had already returned to base by the time the ships arrived . 
 = = = Force H = = = 
 In late June , the 8th DF was ordered to Gibraltar where they were to form the escorts for Force H. A few days later , they participated in the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir against the Vichy French ships stationed there . During Operation MA 5 , a planned air attack on Italian airfields in Sardinia , the destroyer Escort was torpedoed by the Italian submarine Guglielmo Marconi on 11 July after the attack had been cancelled due to lack of surprise . The torpedo blew a large hole in the ship , but the British tried to salvage her . Despite their efforts , she foundered later that morning after Forester and the flotilla leader Faulknor took off the survivors . A month later Forester was one of the escorts for Force H during Operation Hurry , a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August . On 13 September , Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French . Ten days later , they attacked Dakar , but were driven off by the Vichy French defences . In early October , Forester escorted a troop convoy from Freetown , Sierra Leone , to French Cameroon . 
 She then returned to Gibraltar and escorted the aircraft carriers Argus and Ark Royal during Operations Coat and White in November . On 21 November , the light cruiser Despatch , Forester and Faulknor intercepted the Vichy French blockade runner MV Charles Plumier and escorted her to Gibraltar . The ship escorted Force F to Malta during Operation Collar later in the month and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November . In early January , she screened Force H during Operation Excess and rescued the crew of a shot @-@ down Italian bomber on 9 January . 
 Later that month , Forester and Faulknor temporarily relieved some of the escorts for Convoy WS 5B bound for Egypt via the Cape of Good Hope and stayed with the convoy to Freetown . Before arriving there on 26 January , they were detached from Force H to reinforce the Freetown Escort Force . This did not last long as they were ordered to escort Convoy SL 67 and the battleship Malaya en route back to Gibraltar . On 7 March , the German battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst spotted the convoy , but Admiral Günther Lütjens declines to attack when Malaya was spotted . Their report caused attacks by two U @-@ boats that sank five ships from the convoy before Force H rendezvoused with it three days later . The following month Forester was part of the escort screen , with five other destroyers , for the battleship Queen Elizabeth and the light cruisers Naiad , Fiji and Gloucester which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet . This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to Egypt and the transfer of warships to and from the Mediterranean Fleet . Forester and her sisters had their Two @-@ Speed Destroyer Sweep ( TSDS ) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as a fast minesweepers en route to Malta . Despite this , one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged . Later that month , she participated in Operation Splice , another mission in which the carriers Ark Royal and Furious flew off fighters for Malta . 
 Force H was ordered to join the escort of Convoy WS 8B in the North Atlantic on 24 May , after the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 23 May , but they were directed to search for the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen on 25 May . Heavy seas increased fuel consumption for all of the escorts and Forester was forced to return to Gibraltar to refuel later that day before rejoining the capital ships of Force H on 29 May , after Bismarck had been tracked down and sunk . In early June the destroyer participated in two more aircraft delivery missions to Malta ( Operations Rocket and Tracer ) . While returning to Gibraltar to refuel , after covering another WS convoy west of Gibraltar , she participated in the sinking of U @-@ 138 , together with four of her sisters on 18 June . In late June , Forester screened Ark Royal and Furious as they flew off more fighters for Malta in Operation Railway . 
 On 23 July , during a Malta supply convoy ( Operation Substance ) , Forester rescued survivors from her sister Fearless , which had been attacked by Italian torpedo @-@ bombers , and then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes . A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as they covered another Malta convoy ( Operation Style ) . Over the next several months , Forester participated in Operation Halberd , another Malta convoy and escorted Ark Royal and Furious as they made several trips to fly off aircraft for Malta ( Operations Status , Status II and <unk> ) . Upon her return to the UK on 26 October , the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November . She then began a lengthy refit and work up that lasted until April 1942 .

 In mid @-@ April , Forester was part of the close cover for Convoy PQ 14 to Murmansk . On 28 April , Forester joined the escort of returning Convoy QP 11 , and two days later , when the light cruiser Edinburgh was torpedoed , she and her sister Foresight were detached to escort the crippled cruiser back to Murmansk . On 1 May Edinburgh and her escorts were attacked by the German destroyers Z24 , Z25 and Z7 Hermann Schoemann . Forester fired her torpedoes at Z25 , but was almost simultaneously hit by three shells . They disabled ' B ' and ' X ' guns and the hit in No. 1 boiler room temporarily disabled her propulsion machinery . Twelve crewmen were killed , including her captain , and nine were wounded . Foresight was also temporarily disabled and the Germans put another torpedo into Edinburgh , crippling her , before breaking off the engagement to rescue the crew of the crippled Z7 Hermann Schoemann . The two British destroyers took off the survivors from the cruiser and Foresight scuttled the cruiser with a torpedo before heading back to Murmansk for temporary repairs . She sailed on 13 May with Foresight and the destroyers Somali and Matchless as escorts for the light cruiser Trinidad that had been damaged while escorting Convoy PQ 13 . The next day the ships came under heavy air attack , and Trinidad was further damaged and set on fire . Forester took off the wounded and other survivors , and Trinidad was sunk by Matchless . Forester arrived at Scapa Flow on 18 May and immediately took passage to a shipyard on the Tyne for repairs that lasted until October . That month , she rejoined the 8th DF and resumed escorting convoys to Russia until April 1943 . The ship was then refitted at Leith until June .

 In June 1943 , Forester joined the 1st Canadian Escort Group for Atlantic convoy duty . On 10 March 1944 , while escorting Convoy SC 154 , Forester , along with the destroyer HMCS St. Laurent , the frigate HMCS Swansea and the corvette HMCS Owen Sound sank the German submarine U @-@ 845 . The ship remained on convoy duty in the North Atlantic until 29 May when she was transferred to the English Channel to support the Normandy landings for the next several months . On 20 August , Forester , and the destroyers Wensleydale and Vidette sank the U @-@ 413 off Beachy Head . The next day she engaged and drove off E @-@ boats with the destroyers <unk> and Watchman while defending a Channel coastal convoy . In October , the ship was transferred to the 14th Escort Group at Londonderry Port for convoy defence . On 1 December 1944 Forester arrived at Liverpool for repairs , returning to service in May 1945 , and joining the Rosyth Escort Force . 
 Forester was paid off in August and reduced to reserve at Dartmouth on 2 November . She was turned over to the British Iron and Scrap Company on 22 January 1946 for disposal and arrived at Rosyth to be broken up for scrap on 26 February by Metal Industries , Limited . 
 = Wilfred Arthur = 
 Wilfred Stanley ( Wilf ) Arthur , DSO , DFC ( 7 December 1919 – 23 December 2000 ) was a fighter ace and senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) during World War II . Commonly known as " Woof " , and sometimes " Wolf " or " Wulf " , he was officially credited with ten aerial victories . As a commander , he led combat formations at squadron and wing level , becoming at 24 the youngest group captain in the history of the RAAF . 
 Arthur joined the Air Force the day after Australia declared war in September 1939 . He first saw action with No. 3 Squadron in North Africa , where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four aircraft in a single sortie . Posted to the South West Pacific , he commanded first No. 75 Squadron , and later Nos. 81 and 78 Wings . He earned the Distinguished Service Order for continuing to lead an attack on a formation of Japanese bombers after discovering that his guns were inoperable , and was twice mentioned in despatches . Arthur also played a leading part in — and gave name to — the " Morotai Mutiny " of April 1945 . Pursuing various interests in Australia and Vietnam following his discharge from the Air Force after the war , he died in 2000 at the age of 81 . 
 = = Education and early career = = 
 Wilfred Arthur was the son of stock inspector Stanley Oswald Darley Arthur from <unk> , Queensland , a veteran of World War I who had served overseas for the duration of the conflict . His mother , Helena Elizabeth <unk> , was from the Isle of Wight , of Welsh descent . Born in Sydney on 7 December 1919 , Wilf grew up around his father 's home town near the New South Wales border . The boy 's early education was by correspondence , but he later attended school at <unk> , Queensland , commuting on horseback . He then spent four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years at The Scots College in Warwick , where he matriculated . 
 At the age of 19 and still at The Scots College , Arthur applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He enlisted on 4 September 1939 , the day after Australia 's entry into World War II . Training at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , and RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales , he was commissioned a pilot officer on 30 March 1940 , despite being prone to airsickness early on . He served initially with No. 22 ( City of Sydney ) Squadron at Richmond , operating Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons .

 = = = North Africa = = = 
 Promoted to flying officer , Arthur was posted to No. 3 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron and departed with the unit for North Africa in July 1940 . Piloting a Gloster Gladiator biplane , he scored his first aerial victory by shooting down an Italian Fiat CR.42 north @-@ west of <unk> , Egypt , on 12 December . The next day he himself was shot down by a CR.42 and had to bail out , narrowly avoiding disaster when he became entangled first with his oxygen hose and then with the Gladiator 's wing @-@ bracing wires ; he was only torn loose at a height of 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) by the force of rushing air as his stricken plane fell to earth . Arthur claimed one further victim in a Gladiator before his unit re @-@ equipped with Hawker Hurricanes in January 1941 . He was flying a Hurricane when he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in April . 
 No. 3 Squadron began replacing its Hurricanes with P @-@ 40 Tomahawks in May 1941 . In October , Arthur was promoted to flight lieutenant and appointed a flight commander . He shot down four enemy aircraft in a single sortie near Bir El <unk> on 30 November . Flying one of No. 3 Squadron 's new Tomahawks , he claimed two Junkers Ju 87 Stukas , one Fiat G.50 and one Macchi <unk> He destroyed the last of the four after his plane had been damaged and he was on his way back to base ; he had to land in the desert and make his way to the airfield on foot . His " great skill and gallantry " in this action earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) , which was gazetted on 20 January 1942 . 
 Around this time , Arthur met his future wife , Lucille , in a shop in Alexandria . They married on 24 December 1941 and honeymooned in Palestine and Syria . The sudden romance came as a shock to Arthur 's parents ; he later recalled , " the first letter I got was a fair imitation of panic I think " . While on leave , he was also able to make contact with his brother Norman , who was serving as a military policeman in Beirut . Completing his tour with No. 3 Squadron , Arthur was repatriated to Australia with his new bride in March 1942 . Their ship journeyed to Melbourne via Bombay and Colombo , where it picked up many refugees following the recent fall of Singapore . The couple eventually had four children . 
 = = = South @-@ West Pacific = = = 
 As the Japanese advanced in the South West Pacific during early 1942 , the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units for Australia 's northern defence , Nos. 75 , 76 and 77 Squadrons . Arthur was posted to No. 76 Squadron in April , flying P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks in New Guinea . His brother Norman was killed in action on 9 November 1942 while serving with the 2 / 31st Infantry Battalion in Papua . Promoted to squadron leader , in February 1943 Wilf succeeded Les Jackson as commanding officer of No. 75 Squadron , based at Milne Bay under the control of No. 9 Operational Group RAAF . Arthur developed a reputation for diligence , courtesy , and concern for the welfare of his men . Despite the fact that , at 23 , he was the youngest officer in his new squadron , he commanded the respect of his fellows because , he believed , " they like that I work hard ; they like that I am not frightened of anything ( i.e. <unk> not to be ) and above those , they like that I don 't boast " . Having shot down a Mitsubishi G4M " Betty " bomber on 10 March , Arthur was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his " gallantry , matchless leadership and devotion to duty " on 14 April 1943 . On this occasion , in spite of his guns jamming , he led 34 Allied aircraft , including Kittyhawks of Nos. 75 and 77 Squadrons and P @-@ 38 Lightnings of the USAAF , in " a determined head @-@ on attack " to intercept 100 Japanese raiders , 14 of which were destroyed by the defenders . Arthur described the situation of being in combat but unable to shoot as " sort of awkward . Fortunately nobody else would know except me . " To compensate for his lack of offensive weaponry , he repeatedly made as though attempting to ram one of the raiders , to try and force it down into the sea . 
 Promoted acting wing commander in June 1943 , Arthur became wing leader of No. 71 Wing , which controlled No. 75 Squadron and three other combat units . On 5 November , he was involved in a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No. 79 Squadron . The Spitfire pilot was killed , and Arthur received serious burns . He later recalled , " ... I felt my hands disappear , felt my face go but the rest of my body was ... was just flames ... And then all of a sudden the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I 'd try to put the flames out ... " Although his family was informed that his injuries were " of a very slight nature " and that he had been " burnt but not badly " , Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina . He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at <unk> Military Hospital ( now Concord Hospital ) . After his recovery in April 1944 , he attended a staff course before taking over command of No. 2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura , Victoria . In August , at the age of 24 , he was promoted to temporary group captain , the youngest in the RAAF . That December he took command of No. 81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force ( No. 1 TAF ) , based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies . 
 In April 1945 , having recently assumed command of No. 1 TAF 's No. 78 Wing , Arthur helped trigger an incident that became known as the " Morotai Mutiny " ( a phrase originating in one of his aide memoires at the time ) . He was one of eight senior pilots , including Australia 's top @-@ scoring ace , Group Captain Clive Caldwell , and fellow veterans from the North African campaign , Bobby Gibbes and John Waddy , who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions . Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No. 1 TAF to a " balance sheet " he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results , Arthur later said that his object for the " mutiny " was to " make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected . " A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots , finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere . Arthur remained in charge of No. 78 Wing for the Battle of Tarakan , which commenced on 1 May . He handed over command of the wing on 24 May , but remained on Tarakan until the end of the war . 
 In addition to receiving the DFC and DSO , Arthur was twice mentioned in despatches during the war . His official final tally of victories was ten enemy aircraft destroyed , though this has also been reported as eight confirmed kills and two " probables " . Reflecting later on being a fighter pilot throughout his military career , Arthur said that he was glad to have flown single @-@ seat aircraft rather than bombers , because " I would always have felt very uncomfortable with anybody else for whom I 'd be responsible " .

 Arthur was discharged from the RAAF on 14 February 1946 , and took up residence in Darwin , Northern Territory . Initially working for the Repatriation Department , in 1950 he joined the Australian School of Pacific Administration , and later travelled to Vietnam to establish a dairy farm at Bến Cát under the Colombo Plan . He was captured by the Viet Cong in 1961 and was not released until a ransom was paid — reportedly an Olivetti typewriter . He continued to work in Vietnam after this incident , and by 1966 was running a business supplying duck feathers to the American military for use in life jackets . Returning to Australia , he was administration manager for <unk> , the exploration unit responsible for discovering the Ranger uranium deposit at Jabiru . Wilf Arthur died on 23 December 2000 , at the age of 81 .

 The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Center for Public Affairs is the presidential library and final resting place of Ronald Wilson Reagan , the 40th President of the United States ( 1981 – 1989 ) , and his wife Nancy Reagan . Designed by Hugh Stubbins and Associates , the library is located in Simi Valley , California , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of Downtown Los Angeles and 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of Chatsworth . 
 The Reagan Library is the largest of the 13 federally operated presidential libraries . The street address , 40 Presidential Drive , is numbered in honor of Reagan 's place as the 40th President .

 It was initially planned to build the Reagan Library at Stanford University , and an agreement was reached with the university in 1984 . Those plans were canceled in 1987 , and the freestanding site in Simi Valley was chosen the same year . Construction of the library began in 1988 , and the center was dedicated on November 4 , 1991 . The dedication ceremonies were the first time in United States history that five United States Presidents gathered together in the same place : Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford , Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan himself , and George H. W. Bush . Six First Ladies also attended : Lady Bird Johnson , Pat Nixon , Betty Ford , Rosalynn Carter , Nancy Reagan , and Barbara Bush . Only Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend ; but , her children Caroline Kennedy @-@ Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr. were in attendance along with Luci Johnson Turpin , younger daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson , as well as descendants of Franklin D. Roosevelt .

 When the Reagan Library opened it was the largest of the presidential libraries , at approximately 153 @,@ 000 square feet ( 14 @,@ 200 m2 ) . It held that title until the dedication of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock , Arkansas , on November 18 , 2004 . With the opening of the 90 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 8 @,@ 400 m2 ) Air Force One Pavilion in October 2005 , the Reagan Library reclaimed the title in terms of physical size ; however , the Clinton Library remains the largest presidential library in terms of materials ( documents , artifacts , photographs , etc . ) . Like all presidential libraries since that of Franklin D. Roosevelt , the Reagan Library was built entirely with private donations , at a cost of $ 60 million ( equivalent to $ 137 million in 2015 ) . Major donors included Walter Annenberg , Lew Wasserman , <unk> Cook , Joe Albritton , Rupert Murdoch , Richard Sills , and John P. McGovern . For fiscal year 2007 , the Reagan Library had 305 @,@ 331 visitors , making it the second @-@ most @-@ visited presidential library , following the Lyndon B. Johnson Library ; that was down from its fiscal year 2006 number of 440 @,@ 301 visitors , when it was the most visited library . 
 As a presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) , the Reagan Library , under the authority of the Presidential Records Act , is the repository of presidential records for Reagan 's administration . Holdings include 50 million pages of presidential documents , over 1 @.@ 6 million photographs , a half @-@ million feet of motion picture film and thousands of audio and video tapes . The library also houses personal papers collections including documents from Reagan 's eight years as Governor of California .

 The museum features continually changing temporary exhibits and a permanent exhibit covering President Reagan 's life . This exhibit begins during Reagan 's childhood in Dixon , Illinois , and follows his life through his film career and military service , marriage to Nancy Davis Reagan , and political career . The " Citizen Governor " gallery shows footage of Reagan 's 1964 " A Time for Choosing " speech and contains displays on his eight years as governor . The gallery includes a 1965 Ford Mustang used by Reagan during his first gubernatorial campaign , as well as the desk he used as governor . His 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns are also highlighted , as well as his inauguration suit and a table from the White House Situation Room is on display . News footage of the 1981 assassination attempt on his life is shown , and information about the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI , dubbed " Star Wars " ) is included . 
 A full @-@ scale replica of the Oval Office — a feature of most presidential libraries — is a prominent feature of this museum as well . Among the items Reagan kept on his desk was a 16 inches ( 41 cm ) copy of a bronze statue of " Old Bill Williams " , by B. R. Pettit ; Williams was a renowned mountain man of Arizona . Other parts of the exhibit focus on Reagan 's ranch , the presidential retreat Camp David , life in the White House , and First Lady Nancy Reagan . The most recent temporary exhibit ran from November 10 , 2007 , to November 10 , 2008 ; titled " Nancy Reagan : A First Lady 's Style , " it featured over 80 designer dresses belonging to Nancy Reagan . 
 The hilltop grounds provide expansive views of the area , a re @-@ creation of a portion of the White House Lawn , and a piece of the Berlin Wall . An F @-@ 14 Tomcat ( BuNo <unk> ) is also located on the grounds .

NARA labeled the Reagan Library as having the most serious problems with its inventory . In an audit , U.S. Archivist Allen Weinstein blamed the library 's poor inventory software for the mishap . Frederick J.

Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush . In 1990 , it became a backup aircraft after the Boeing 747s entered into service and was retired in 2001 . The aircraft was flown to San Bernardino International Airport in September 2001 , where it was presented to the Reagan Foundation . In what was known as Operation Homeward Bound , Boeing , the plane 's manufacturer , disassembled the plane and transported it to the library in pieces . After the construction of the foundation of the pavilion itself , the plane was reassembled and restored to museum quality , as well as raised onto pedestals 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) above ground . The pavilion was dedicated on October 24 , 2005 , by Nancy Reagan , President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush . 
 SAM 27000 is part of a comprehensive display about presidential travel that also includes a Johnson @-@ era Sikorsky VH @-@ 3 Sea King , call sign Marine One , and a presidential motorcade — Reagan 's 1984 presidential parade limousine , a 1982 Los Angeles Police Department police car ( as well as two 1980s police motorcycles ) , and a 1986 Secret Service vehicle used in one of President Reagan 's motorcades in Los Angeles . The pavilion is also home to the original O 'Farrell 's pub from <unk> in the Republic of Ireland that President and Mrs. Reagan visited in June 1984 , now called the " Ronald Reagan Pub .

 = Portland Castle = 
 Portland Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Isle of Portland , Dorset , between 1539 and 1541 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the Portland Roads anchorage . The fan @-@ shaped castle was built from Portland stone , with a curved central tower and a gun battery , flanked by two angular wings . Shortly after its construction it was armed with eleven artillery pieces , intended for use against enemy shipping , operating in partnership with its sister castle of Sandsfoot on the other side of the anchorage . During the English Civil War , Portland was taken by the Royalist supporters of King Charles I , and then survived two sieges before finally surrendering to Parliament in 1646 . 
 Portland continued in use as a fort until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , when it was converted into a private house . Fresh concerns over invasion led to the War Office taking it over once again in 1869 , but the castle was not rearmed and was instead formed accommodation for more modern neighbouring fortifications . During the First and Second World Wars it was used as offices , accommodation and as an ordnance store . In 1949 , the War Office relinquished control , and in 1955 it was opened to the public by the state . In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction , receiving 22 @,@ 207 visitors in 2010 . Historic England consider the castle to form " one of the best preserved and best known examples " of King Henry 's forts . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Portland Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Basic defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and he took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 As a consequence , Lord Russell inspected the coast along an anchorage known as Portland Roads , and concluded that two castles , Portland and Sandsfoot , should be constructed to protect it from naval attack . Work began that summer , with Oliver Lawrence acting as the royal paymaster for the project , and was completed by 1541 , at a cost of £ 4 @,@ 964 . Thomas Mervin was appointed as captain , with a garrison of four gunners and two other men . In 1545 , Mervin was replaced by John <unk> , who also took on responsibilities as the Lieutenant of Portland , along with a larger garrison of 13 men , paid for out of the proceeds of the recent Dissolution of the Monasteries . A survey between 1547 and 1548 reported that the castle was equipped with one brass demi @-@ cannon , two brass demi @-@ culverins , four breech @-@ loading portpieces and four slings ; it also held eight <unk> – a type of early arquebus – along with twenty @-@ three bows , twenty @-@ nine bills and twelve pikes . 
 The threat of a French invasion passed , and peace was declared in 1558 . Attention shifted away from Portland , and a 1574 survey reported that the castle was in a poor condition , with similar concerns being repeated in 1583 . Tensions with Spain grew and military attention focused on the threat to the south @-@ west of England . War broke out in 1585 , and £ 228 was spent on renovating Portland Castle . In 1596 , the garrison still comprised a captain and 13 men . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 In the early 1600s , England was at peace with France and Spain and the coastal forts , included Portland , received little attention . A 1623 survey reported that the castle was equipped with three culverins , nine demi @-@ culverins and a saker , but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs . Fourteen years later , the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men . 
 When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 , Portland was initially controlled by Parliamentary forces . The castle was captured in 1643 by a group of Royalists who gained access by pretending to be Parliamentary soldiers . As the war turned against the King in the south @-@ west , Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644 , and once again the following year . The castle finally surrendered to Vice @-@ Admiral William Batten in April 1646 . It is uncertain why the castle , which was not easily defensible on the landward side , proved so difficult to take ; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low @-@ lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea . 
 During the Interregnum , Portland Castle continued to be garrisoned and used a prison , with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651 . It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo @-@ Dutch War of 1653 , seeing action in a three @-@ day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces . When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 , he reduced the garrison to its pre @-@ war levels but repaired the fortifications in the light of the continuing Dutch threat ; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns . 
 Portland Castle continued in use through the 18th century , primarily protecting vessels against privateers , including merchant vessels carrying stone from the local Portland quarries . Reports in 1702 and 1715 complained about the dilapidated condition of the fortification – the sea had washed away 112 feet ( 34 m ) of its foundations – and the number of artillery pieces was reduced to seven . By 1779 , the castle had a caretaker garrison of three men and eight guns , and reportedly had not been repaired in the previous 30 years . During the Napoleonic Wars , the castle 's guns were increased to comprise six 24 @-@ pounder , six 12 @-@ pounders and two 9 @-@ pounder guns ( 10 @.@ 9 kg , 5 @.@ 4 kg and 4 @.@ 1 kg respectively ) , but the fortification remained in a poor condition overall . 
 Following the final defeat of Napoleon , the castle was disarmed and leased to John Manning , a Portland churchman , who converted it from a fortress into a private house . John 's son , Charles Manning , took over the house in 1834 and continued to develop it . Among the Mannings ' work was the conversion of an older house alongside the main castle , which had once housed the master gunner , into a grander property , known today as the Captain 's House . In the late 1840s , the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour through the construction of a breakwater , and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it , although the structure of the old castle itself was left untouched by the growing complex of forts . Charles died in 1869 and , amid ongoing invasion fears , the War Office took over the castle again for use as accommodation for commissioned officers , including as a house for the adjutant of the Verne Citadel . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 In the early years of the 20th century , the War Office and the Office of Works held discussions on how to manage the castle . In 1908 , Portland was placed onto what was known as the Schedule C list , which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property , but with input on repairs from the Office of Works . With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store . The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years , and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers , with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance . A concrete pillbox , since demolished , was constructed alongside the castle early on in the war . 
 After the conflict , Portland Castle was transferred to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955 . The Ministry decided to present the interior as it might have looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th @-@ century additions and changes . The Captain 's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999 , but with the facility 's closure , this part of the fort was also opened to visitors , the house being turned into a visitor facility . 
 In the 21st century the castle is operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction , receiving 22 @,@ 207 visitors in 2010 . The main castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building , and the Captain 's House as a Grade II * building . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The heart of the castle is the keep , 120 feet ( 37 m ) across , comprising a central tower with two wings on either side and a gun battery to the front , together forming an unusual , fan @-@ shaped design over @-@ looking the sea . This is surrounded by a walled courtyard , approximately 170 by 90 feet ( 52 by 27 m ) , with two gun platforms on either side of the keep . The Captain 's House occupies the western side of the courtyard , and the Governor 's Garden lies beyond the eastern wall . The castle is entered through an outer gateway on the southern side , surmounted by Charles II 's coat of arms . 
 When first built , the castle would have held three tiers of artillery , two in the front battery and a third layer in the central tower . The keep was originally protected by a moat , since filled in , with a drawbridge , of which only the slots now survive . The castle could have been protected at short @-@ range with hand guns , although the gunloops for these were of an antiquated design for the period , and a moated earthwork , 89 by 47 feet ( 27 by 14 @.@ 4 m ) , was subsequently built to the rear of the castle to provide additional protection . 
 The keep is two storeys high , built of ashlar Portland stone . Historic England considers it to form " one of the best preserved and best known examples " of the Henrician forts . In the centre of the ground floor is the octagonal great hall , now fitted with large Victorian windows , which would have originally providing living space for the garrison . Off the great hall are wings holding the gunners ' quarters and the castle 's kitchen , the latter equipped with a large , 16th @-@ century fireplace . Running around the front of the keep is the gun room . This was originally a two @-@ storey gun battery with embrasures for five guns on the ground floor and four more above on the first floor , with the southern end of the ground floor subdivided into four barrack rooms . The ground @-@ floor embrasures were designed with vents to allow the smoke from the guns to escape . Both the wooden roof that formed the first @-@ floor gun platform and the internal wooden partitions have been dismantled , however , and the chamber is now open to the air . It now houses a variety of 18th and 19th century cannons . 
 On the first floor is the upper hall and the captain 's chamber , used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle 's commander , and converted into a dining room and a bedroom in the 19th century . On the opposite side to the captain 's private chamber are two other bedrooms , possibly originally for the use of the castle 's lieutenant . 
 The current Governor 's Garden was created in 2002 by the horticulturist Christopher Bradley @-@ Hole , as part of a wider programme of work across English Heritage properties . The maritime @-@ themed garden features circular designs , echoing those in the adjacent castle , and uses local Portland stone . 
 = Mighty Jill Off = 
 Mighty Jill Off is a 2D platform independently developed freeware video game designed by Anna Anthropy , with art by James Harvey and music by Andrew Toups . It stars a submissive named Jill , who has a boot fetish and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment . Jill does this by jumping and slowly descending over obstacles . Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles , but will return to the last check point . The game serves as an homage to the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack . It had follow @-@ ups , such as Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition and Jill Off With One Hand . Jill made a cameo appearance in the 2010 video game Super Meat Boy as a playable character . 
 The game 's BDSM and lesbian themes were implemented by Anthropy , a BDSM practitioner , for the purpose of providing legitimate " dykes " in video games . She also made the game difficult , to fit in with its BDSM theme . James Harvey attempted to make this game appealing for the BDSM community . Mighty Jill Off has received praise for its BDSM themes from critics of websites such as Rock , Paper , Shotgun and Game Set Watch . It was also praised for its high level of difficulty by editors of GamesRadar and Bitmob . 1UP.com included it in its list of favourite free PC games of 2009 . 
 = = Gameplay and scenario = = 
 Mighty Jill Off incorporates several BDSM themes . It stars a submissive lesbian named Jill who has a boot fetish . She is kicked to the bottom of her Queen 's tower for acting like a " greedy slut " . Jill attempts to climb back up the tower and return to her Queen ; once there , she is given affection , constricted and gagged , and made to do it again . 
 Some of Mighty Jill Off 's gameplay is borrowed from the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute . Players control Jill in only three ways : moving , jumping , and slowly descending . In the air , players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go . Players can switch direction while they do this . There are three types of obstacles : spikes , fire , and spiders ; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close . Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly , forcing her to start at the most recent checkpoint — typically located at a change in room . There is only one level in the game , but with several rooms in it . The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower . Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room 's background colour . Jill has infinite lives , allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mighty Jill Off was designed and developed by American video game designer and critic Anna Anthropy , also known as Auntie <unk> , in 2008 . James Harvey provided the artwork for the game , while Andrew Toups created the music . Anthropy designed Mighty Jill Off to feature " dykes and perverts " to make up for " the distinct lack of real dyke characters and dyke desire in games " . She argued that while " supposed dykes " are seen in commercials , these characters are " written and drawn by men " . She said that " they don 't look like us , they don ’ t express themselves like us , they don ’ t lust like us . " Anthropy compared the challenge of players who lead Jill through the game as similar to the challenges of a top who leads the bottom through a scene . 
 = = = Art design = = = 
 While the character artwork for Mighty Jill Off was created by James Harvey , Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form . Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was BDSM @-@ themed ; he felt that it was easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese harem anime genre as an example . He added that in humorous , sexually @-@ oriented cartoons , there is a " fine line " between " cute and funny " and " repulsive " . He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it , while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM . He used European comics as a model for his art work , which he admired for the " permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons " . He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as Monkey Punch , the creator of Lupin III . 
 Harvey designed the Queen based on a loose description by Anthropy . He wanted to make her " sexy and authoritative " and to look like a " fully grown human with relatively realistic proportions " . He designed her to be an " amalgamation of every lesbian friend " he had been " secretly been attracted to " . He initially designed her with a veil , but felt that this was too superfluous and girly ; he decided to adorn her with spikes instead . He attempted to design the title screen 's background to " emphasise the drama of [ the ] situation , or to <unk> [ sic ] symbolise the characters in the scene " . However , there were some hurdles ; he originally envisioned the Queen 's tower to be a smooth , straight one , but felt that it would be too phallic , which would be meaningless symbolism given the game 's content . Anthropy and Harvey held a contest for people to contribute fan art for the game ; the five winners won hand @-@ made Mighty Jill Off activity books , which included activities such as creating make @-@ out partners for a group of " repulsive , tongue @-@ waggling oafs " , as well as writing a poem for the game 's Queen . He scanned one of the books and posted it online , allowing others to contribute and send in their drawings . The book features several BDSM @-@ related themes . 
 Harvey was split between two designs for Jill . He either wanted to depict her as a " funny little <unk> character " or a grown woman ; however , both approaches had their own pitfalls . He felt that the former could come off as too much like Japanese lolicon @-@ styled art , while the latter could make the story seem too serious . The Queen 's more realistic design made him question whether a child @-@ like Jill would be appropriate . He designed several versions of Jill with different proportions and sent them to Anthropy so she could pick her favourite . He compared two of the designs to Nintendo characters Mario and Link ; the Mario @-@ like design he called a " standard video game design " , while the Link @-@ like design he called " slightly realistic " . The Link @-@ like design was the most realistic design that he did because he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with , and could diminish the humorous elements of the game . He also intended to design her as " dumpy and <unk> " to make her more " lovable " . 
 Anthropy told Harvey that she preferred characters with more realistic proportions ; as a result , he ended up with a design that was three and a half heads tall . Due to her submissive position , he designed her to be an " innocent " who looked " eager @-@ to @-@ please " , with " benign , wide eyed facial expressions " . The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen . He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill 's feelings for the Queen ; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her " blissful display of affection " while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness . Harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from the background ; however , he felt that this made the suit look more like a " crazy wrestler costume " . He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest , but decided on using an all black design . One of the difficulties of designing the suit was to make it look shiny without resembling " gross lolicon manga porn " .

 A harder version called Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition , was released in October 2008 , 8 months after the original version . Anthropy compared it to the Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. : The Lost Levels which was noticeably more difficult than its predecessor , Super Mario Bros. She made it with the intention of reusing assets from the original game such as sprites and backgrounds but making sure that none of the challenges were recycled . She also made a follow @-@ up called Jill Off with One Hand , which features " <unk> " gameplay , a type of gameplay which requires only one button to play . It was created over the course of Buy Nothing Day and was created with the intent of making it playable on mobile phones . The protagonist Jill was featured in the 2010 platform game Super Meat Boy along with several characters from other games . 
 = = Reception and promotion = = 
 Mighty Jill Off has received generally positive reception . Retronauts ' Jess Ragan praised Anthropy for her understanding of what made Mighty Bomb Jack good . 1UP.com 's Scott Sharkey listed Mighty Jill Off as one of his favourite independently @-@ developed freeware games in 2009 . Gamasutra listed it as one of their runners @-@ up for the top five best indie games of 2008 . On two separate occasions , IndieGames ' <unk> listed Mighty Jill Off as " game picks " ; first for the original version , and second for Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition . GamesRadar 's Nathan <unk> listed the game as one of the " most ruthlessly punishing indie games " and wrote that the difficulty level may make players question whether the " pain of a million deaths is worth the pleasure awaiting " players . Bitmob 's James DeRosa called it " tough @-@ as @-@ s * * * " and gave credit to Anthropy for coining the genre " <unk> " . 
 The game has also received praise for its insight into BDSM and the dom / sub relationship . Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's Kieron Gillen called it an " interesting examination of the master / slave relationship " . Rock Paper Shotgun 's Alec Meer described it as a " wry , subversive examination of why videogame protagonists put themselves through a torturous amount of struggle to reach their objectives " . James DeRosa praised Anthropy for her implementation of elements and ideas that most games do not cover and called it a " hypersexualized , bondage @-@ themed platformer " with which Anthropy " explores the power dynamics of sexuality and disassembles essentialist male and female sex roles as portrayed in video games -- as well as the significance of difficulty and reward as a design method " . 
 = Graham Westley = 
 Graham Neil Westley ( born 4 March 1968 ) is an English former professional footballer who was most recently manager of Peterborough United . 
 Westley started his managerial career at the age of 28 , managing Kingstonian for five months , before spending a year in charge of Enfield . In 1999 , Westley became manager of Farnborough Town , guiding them to the Football Conference in 2002 . He left Farnborough the following season , to become manager of Stevenage . He took the club to within one game of promotion to the Football League , but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired . Westley then had a brief , but successful , spell with Rushden & Diamonds , as well as acting as caretaker manager at Kettering Town . He took a year out of the game , before rejoining Stevenage in May 2008 . He guided the club to FA Trophy success in 2009 , before securing promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club 's history in April 2010 , finishing the season as league champions . Westley guided the club to back @-@ to @-@ back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager , following Stevenage 's successful 2010 – 11 League Two play @-@ off campaign . At the start of 2012 , Westley left Stevenage to join Preston North End . He was sacked by the club in February 2013 . A month later , Westley rejoined Stevenage , his third spell at the club . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Westley was born in Hounslow , London and he started his footballing career as an apprentice with Queens Park Rangers . During his time at QPR , Westley represented England at U18 level . He then joined Gillingham in March 1986 . He made two league appearances for the club before joining Barnet . He made three appearances and scored one goal for them in the Football Conference during the 1987 – 88 season , making his debut for the club in a 2 – 2 draw against Macclesfield Town at Moss Rose . Westley joined Wycombe Wanderers in the latter stages of 1987 for a fee of £ 7 @,@ 500 , making a scoring debut in a 2 – 1 away victory at Telford United . He scored in Wycombe 's next two games , and was a first @-@ team regular until manager Peter <unk> left the club in January 1988 . Westley played just once under new manager Jim Kelman and left soon afterwards to sign for Kingstonian . He played 24 times for Wycombe , scoring five goals in all competitions during the club 's 1987 – 88 campaign . He later played for a number of non @-@ League clubs , including Kingstonian , Wealdstone , Farnborough Town , Harlow Town , Enfield , Aylesbury United , Harrow Borough , Tooting & Mitcham United , Molesey and Walton & Hersham – three of which he would later go on to manage . During his time at Kingstonian , he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places , which subsequently cut his playing career short after never fully recovering from the injury . On his playing career , Westley said " I felt sorry for myself too often when I should have been leading the team " . 
 = = Managerial career = = 
 = = = Early management = = = 
 While recovering from a broken leg , at the age of 28 , Westley was appointed as manager of Kingstonian in December 1996 after approaching the club about their vacant managerial post . His first two games in @-@ charge of the club both ended in 4 – 4 draws against Walton & Hersham and Harrow Borough respectively , with Westley saying " at the time , there was something raw and exciting about the team that I sent out . Although there was also something evidently missing " . His first victory in @-@ charge of the club was a 2 – 0 win over Wokingham Town in the Isthmian League Cup , before securing his first league win in the following game , a 5 – 2 win away at Aylesbury United . Kingstonian drew clear of relegation , with Westley recalling a 3 – 2 victory over champions Yeovil Town at Huish Park as a " memorable victory " . Despite securing safety for the club , he was sacked after just five months , being replaced by Geoff Chapple . He managed Kingstonian for 25 games recording nine wins , eight losses , and eight draws . 
 In September 1997 , Westley was appointed as manager of another club he had previously played for in the form of Isthmian League Premier Division outfit Enfield . He appointed Graham Pearce as his assistant , who had also previously played for , and managed , Enfield . He outlined his ambition of ensuring the club returned to the top tier in non @-@ league , despite a host of financial difficulties at the club , he stated " my ambition is to see silverware in the table , and if you can 't take the pressure , you shouldn 't take big jobs like this one " . His first game as manager of Enfield was a 2 – 0 home defeat to St Albans City . Despite securing a seventh @-@ placed finish for the club , Westley left the club after just nine months in charge . He managed the club for a total of 41 games ; winning 19 , losing 16 , and drawing 6 – with a win percentage of 46 @.@ 34 % . 
 = = = Farnborough Town = = = 
 In 1999 , Westley bought a controlling interest in Farnborough Town and appointed himself as manager . He managed the club to a 12th @-@ place finish in his first season in charge , but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup ; winning the competition in 2000 . The following season , Westley guided the club to more success , winning the Isthmian League Premier Division ; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points . Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club 's promotion to the Football Conference – something which he now states as a " huge regret " . At this point , he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian – citing the club 's " Football League rated ground " as the reasoning behind his proposed idea , although it never happened due to " fans resistance " . During the 2001 – 02 season , the club consolidated their position in the first tier of non – league football ; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th @-@ place finish in the league . The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley , reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3 – 0 victory at Southport , where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams . Westley guided the side to a 3 – 2 win over Darlington , and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal . The tie , however , was controversially moved to Highbury – because the tie stood to make around £ 600 @,@ 000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury , whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated £ 50 @,@ 000 . Westley left the club after the sell @-@ out ' home ' tie at Highbury , which they lost 5 – 1 . Shortly after his resignation , he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003 , signing a three @-@ year contract . Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders , and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club . On moving to Stevenage , Westley said " I 've enjoyed my time at Farnborough , but I feel that I need to move on now and that I need to concentrate on football management , which is where my ambitions lie " . He went on to state that Stevenage 's " long @-@ term potential " was another key factor behind the move . 
 = = = Stevenage = = = 
 When Westley took over the Hertfordshire club , Stevenage were sitting 21st in the Football Conference , and were six points adrift of safety . Unlike his position at his previous club , Westley was appointed as first @-@ team manager , with no board involvement . He set about ensuring the club were still in the highest tier in non @-@ league football , signing seven players from his previous club Farnborough , as well as his former assistant Graham Pearce and goalkeeping coach Graham Benstead . His first game in charge of the club was a 1 – 1 draw at home to Morecambe , before having to wait three games for his first win at the club – a 2 – 0 victory away at local rivals Barnet , thanks to a Dino Maamria brace . The victory sparked an eight @-@ game unbeaten run , recording six victories on the bounce to ensure the club were safe from relegation . Westley had guided the club from 21st in the table to a respectable 12th @-@ place finish by the end of the season . The 2003 – 04 season witnessed a much more consistent season under Westley 's management , but the club were unable to make the play @-@ offs and finished the campaign in 8th place , despite a positive start to the season . 
 As was the case in previous seasons , Westley made wholesale changes at the end of the season , releasing several of the players he had originally signed from Farnborough , and replacing them with a mixture of players with Football League experience – in the form of Brian <unk> , Dannie Bulman , and Matt Hocking – as well as players from lower divisions such as Jon Nurse and Craig McAllister . Westley also gave first @-@ team opportunities to players who had progressed through the club 's youth system , most notably George Boyd . The squad originally struggled to perform , losing five games in the first eight games of the club 's league campaign . However , two victories by wide margins against lowly opposition in the form of Farnborough and Northwich Victoria respectively propelled the club into a mid @-@ table position . However , this was followed by two heavy defeats at the hands of York City and Canvey Island – the latter a 4 – 1 home defeat against part @-@ time opposition . After the game , with hundreds of Stevenage fans calling for Westley to be sacked , he confronted fans in the East Terrace by saying he " would turn it around " . Westley 's side responded with four straight wins , and stayed within touching distance of the play @-@ offs for several months . An important double over Carlisle United in March 2005 , as well as crucial wins at Aldershot Town , Woking , and Crawley Town meant that Stevenage went into the final day of the season needing to beat already relegated Leigh RMI , and had to rely on Tamworth to hold Morecambe , who were currently occupying the final play @-@ off spot . Stevenage beat Leigh 2 – 0 , while Tamworth held Morecambe to a goalless draw , ultimately meaning Westley 's side had reached the play @-@ offs on the final day of the season . Westley engineered two solid displays to ensure Stevenage overcame second @-@ placed Hereford United 2 – 1 on aggregate , but lost 1 – 0 to Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium in the final . 
 The 2005 – 06 season marked Westley 's third season in charge as manager of the club , and although the club were consistent at Broadhall Way throughout the season , the side struggled for form away from home , winning just four games on the road all season . Stevenage 's poor away form was ultimately preventing the club from mounting any serious title challenge , and throughout the campaign Westley 's side would often " lose the game before it began " – in away games against Southport , Morecambe , and Burton Albion respectively , Westley 's side trailed 3 – 0 before half @-@ time . Westley had also fallen out with striker Anthony Elding , who was eventually sold to Kettering Town in January 2006 . There were also increasingly frequent question marks surrounding the discipline of the squad under Westley 's control , as Stevenage received fourteen red cards during the campaign , more than any other club in the league by some distance . A 2 – 0 defeat away to relegation @-@ threatened Forest Green Rovers on the final day of the season meant that Stevenage failed to reach the play @-@ offs , finishing 6th in the table . After failing to reach the play @-@ offs , Westley confirmed in May 2006 that he would leave the club when his contract expired in June , ending his three and a half year tenure with the Hertfordshire club . 
 = = = Rushden & Diamonds = = = 
 He was appointed manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006 , with the club sitting 22nd in the table , two points adrift of safety . Westley 's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1 – 0 victory away at Cambridge United , as he set about ensuring safety . Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage ; signing the likes of Jamie Cook , David <unk> , and Dino Maamria . Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non @-@ League Paper when he was out of work . Westley 's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league , including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time , Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge . Despite managing an upturn in the form of the club , Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2 – 2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007 . He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months , and the club were on a seven @-@ match unbeaten run at the time . In all , he managed Rushden for 13 games ; winning seven , drawing three and losing three . The reason behind Westley 's sacking is unknown , but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill . 
 = = = Kettering Town = = = 
 Shortly after leaving Rushden , Westley was appointed caretaker manager of Conference North outfit Kettering Town for the rest of the 2006 – 07 season in April 2007 . Due to the date he joined , Westley was unable to bring any new players in to bolster the squad , with just two games remaining until the end of the season . His first game in charge was a 0 – 0 draw away to Stalybridge Celtic , shortly followed by a 1 – 0 loss to Alfreton Town at Rockingham Road – this was enough to ensure Kettering finished the season in second place . He managed Kettering in the play @-@ offs , as they were beaten on penalties by Farsley Celtic in the semi @-@ final after a 1 – 1 aggregate scoreline over two legs , he left shortly after when his short @-@ term contract expired in May 2007 , managing the club for a total of four games . 
 = = = Return to Stevenage = = = 
 After almost a year without work in football , Westley returned as Stevenage manager in May 2008 – two years after he had originally left . On his return , Westley stated he had come to " finish the job he started " – referring to trying to guide the club into the Football League for the first time in its history . He said that " the moment was right " for him to come back into football and that he " had some very good times at Stevenage before " . His appointment was met with a fair bit of scepticism by Stevenage fans , but Westley promised to deliver a winning team , playing attractive football . Westley started by completely overhauling the squad in the summer transfer window and brought in no fewer than twelve players in an attempt to mount a serious Conference Premier title challenge . Among those brought in were Gary Mills and David Bridges , who Westley had managed during his short @-@ stint at Kettering . He also signed Michael Bostwick and Mark Albrighton , who he had also signed at Rushden & Diamonds . Westley also secured the signatures of Andy Drury and Eddie Odhiambo respectively , both of which were players Westley had previously earmarked . 
 Stevenage started the season poorly , losing 3 out of their first 4 games and conceding 13 goals in the process , including a 5 – 0 loss to Wrexham on the first day of the season . The club secured its first victory under Westley in late August 2008 , a 3 – 1 win away at Barrow , before winning four games on the bounce in September . However , through the first half of the club 's 2008 – 09 campaign , Westley 's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side , losing three games on the trot in November – the last of which was a 2 – 1 home defeat to Wrexham , it was to be Stevenage 's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months . Westley brought in former player , Dino Maamria as first @-@ team coach at the club . This , coupled with important signings during the campaign , such as Chris Day , Mark Roberts , and Jon Ashton , meant that Stevenage witnessed an up @-@ turn in form half way through the campaign . A 24 @-@ game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009 , as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season , ultimately meant that Westley 's men made the Conference Premier play @-@ offs , finishing in the last play @-@ off place . Despite taking a 3 – 1 lead into the second leg , Stevenage lost 4 – 3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United . Westley did , however , enjoy success in the FA Trophy when he led the side out at Wembley Stadium in front of 27 @,@ 102 as Stevenage beat York City 2 – 0 in the Final . The win was Westley 's first taste of success as manager of Stevenage . After the game , it was announced that Westley was to stay on as manager for another year . 
 The majority of the squad that performed so well in the second half of the club 's 2008 – 09 campaign were retained , with very little transfer activity in comparison to previous seasons under Westley . Steve Morison , the club 's top goalscorer for the past three seasons , moved to Millwall for a fee of £ 130 @,@ 000 , while both John Martin and Calum <unk> were released by Westley in late May 2009 . Midfielder Gary Mills was the last departure of the close season ; rejecting a contract and instead opting to join fellow Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town . Five players joined the club during the close season . Charlie Griffin was the first signing of the season , joining Stevenage from Salisbury City on a free transfer . Yemi Odubade , Chris Beardsley , and Joel Byrom signed for the club shortly after ; the latter commanding a transfer fee of £ 15 @,@ 000 . Westley had previously managed Beardsley at Rushden & Diamonds and Kettering Town . The last signing of pre @-@ season was Stacy Long ; who joined the club on a free transfer from Ebbsfleet United . No players departed the club during the season , with Tim Sills the only addition – signing for an undisclosed fee from Torquay United in January 2010 . 
 Stevenage 's league campaign got off to a typically patchy start ; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season . Following a 2 – 1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009 , the team went on a 17 @-@ game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009 , propelling the club into the top two . Unlike in previous seasons , the club were performing strongly away from home , and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town . A 4 – 1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year 's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top @-@ spot for the first time in the season . However , two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight – point lead going into March 2010 . The team responded well , winning eight games on the bounce ; including an important 1 – 0 victory over Oxford United in late March , subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table . Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town , securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2 – 0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough . The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal , and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures . Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games , winning the league by 11 points , with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division . The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history , as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career . Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final ; this time losing 2 – 1 after extra @-@ time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium . At the end of the season , Westley signed a new two @-@ year contract ; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012 . On signing the new deal , Westley said " I am grateful for all the support that we have all been given in the past two years . I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League " . In his first two seasons back at the club , from May 2008 to May 2010 , Westley has been in charge for 114 games , winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61 @.@ 40 % . 
 Similarly to the club 's successful campaign the season before , but in complete contrast to his first tenure at the club , the 2010 – 11 season saw five players joining the club , while roughly five players left the club in the close season . The club started the season inconsistently , with Westley stating the season would be a " massive learning curve " for both himself and the players . Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011 , Stevenage found themselves in 18th position , just four points above the relegation zone . However , during a congested period throughout February and March 2011 , Stevenage won nine games out of eleven , propelling the club up the league table and into the play @-@ off positions . This included winning six games on the trot , a sequence only matched by Bury . A 3 – 3 draw against Bury on the final day of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place . They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010 – 11 League Two play @-@ off semi @-@ finals , winning both legs by a 3 – 0 aggregate scoreline . They beat Torquay United 1 – 0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011 . The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back @-@ to @-@ back promotions , playing in League One for the first time in the club 's history . On securing promotion , Westley said " It 's a fantastic feeling . The players work so hard and they deserve everything they get " . During the 2010 – 11 season , Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup , where they lost to Reading 2 – 1 . In the previous round , Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3 – 1 at Broadhall Way . After the match , Westley said before the game he had told the players to " go out and win the match 5 – 0 . We established that if we did just 20 % of what it would take to win 5 – 0 then we would still win the game " . 
 At the start of the 2011 – 12 season , Westley signed a three @-@ year contract extension at Stevenage that kept him contracted to the club until 2014 . Westley acquired five players on free transfers , while also releasing five of the existing squad . Stevenage started their first ever League One campaign well , beating the 2010 – 11 League One play @-@ off semi @-@ finalists , Bournemouth , 3 – 1 at Dean Court to secure their first victory of the season on 16 August 2011 . Stevenage were exceeding expectations in the third tier of English football , sitting just outside the play @-@ off places after securing a notable 5 – 1 victory against Sheffield Wednesday Broadhall Way in September 2011 . The club also inflicted Charlton Athletic 's first league defeat of the season after a 1 – 0 win against the league leaders . The victory against Charlton was to spark a 13 @-@ game unbeaten run for Westley 's Stevenage , and a 6 – 1 away victory at Colchester United on Boxing Day 2011 meant the club were sat in sixth place , the final play @-@ off position . After managing Stevenage for three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , Westley left Stevenage in January 2012 , joining fellow League One side Preston North End . His final game as manager of Stevenage was a 1 – 0 away victory at Reading in the FA Cup Third Round . 
 = = = Preston North End = = = 
 In January 2012 , Preston North End asked for permission to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager . Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as " unwelcome " , permission was granted . After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed , Westley was announced as Preston 's new manager on 13 January . His first game in @-@ charge of the club was a 2 – 0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January . After the game , it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line @-@ up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message on the day of the match . He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in @-@ charge , securing a 1 – 0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012 . Following Preston 's 2 – 0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012 , Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match . Westley stated — " It doesn 't surprise me . When you have got people in your own camp working against you it is tough " . Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign , and finished the season in 15th place . At the end of the season , Westley criticised the club 's " mediocre " mentality , stating the squad have " not got a clue what it takes to get success " . 
 Westley subsequently went about overhauling the squad ahead of the 2012 – 13 season . In May 2012 , Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club ; 14 of which were released at the end of their contracts , while a further seven were transfer @-@ listed . Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window , including Scott Laird , John Mousinho , Joel Byrom , and Chris Beardsley , four players from Westley 's former club , Stevenage . Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas — " My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve . The plan is in place . I 'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do " . Preston started the season well , beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2 – 0 at Deepdale in the League Cup . Later on in the month , Preston went on to secure consecutive 4 – 1 home victories , beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively , as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5 – 0 a month later . However , the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four @-@ month period from October 2012 to February 2013 . A day after Preston 's 3 – 1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013 , the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked . With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone , it was revealed that " the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward " . On his time at Preston , Westley stated he had to " slash the wage bill by <unk> percent " , and as a result the " re @-@ building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it . They just want results . Short @-@ term pain is necessary sometimes . It was necessary at Preston . And the fans got restless . I get that . Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that , so owners have to be brave at difficult times . And they have to be able to understand the issues . I knew the answers to problems but I wasn 't being allowed to solve all the problems " . 
 = = = Third spell at Stevenage = = = 
 After a month out of work , Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013 , his third spell in @-@ charge at the club . On the appointment , Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace stated — " Graham was keen to come back to Stevenage and , although I met some strong candidates , without doubt I think he ’ s the best man for the job right now .

 = SR V Schools class = 
 The SR V class , more commonly known as the Schools class , is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway . The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell 's LSWR / SR King Arthur class . It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 wheel arrangement , and was the most powerful class of 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 ever produced in Europe . All 40 of the class were named after English public schools , and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi @-@ fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables . Because of the use of a ‘ ’ King Arthur ’ ’ firebox , rather than the square @-@ topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons , the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line . The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years . The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962 . Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1928 the Southern Railway was well served by large 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 express passenger locomotives , but there was an urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system . Maunsell ’ s previous attempt at developing his predecessor ’ s L class for this task had proven a disappointment , and the Drummond <unk> and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services . An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables . 
 = = Design = = 
 Maunsell ’ s original plan was to use large @-@ wheeled 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 tank engines for this purpose , but the Sevenoaks railway accident made him have second thoughts . He therefore chose a relatively short wheelbase 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 design although by this period 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 was more usual for this type of work . Authorities disagree as to whether Maunsell had in mind the restricted loading gauge of the Tonbridge to Hastings line when he designed the class , or whether this was an " unexpected bonus " when he was forced to substitute a " King Arthur " round @-@ topped firebox to his planned Belpaire design to reduce the axle load on the driving wheels to acceptable limits . In either event the class was undoubtedly Maunsell ’ s most immediately successful design , and the locomotives did some of their best work on the Hastings route . 
 = = Construction history = = 
 The basic layout of the class was influenced by the existing ‘ ’ Lord Nelson ’ ’ class 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 design , but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab 's curved profile to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate forward visibility . The short frame length of the 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line 's tight curves . To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines , Maunsell opted for a three @-@ cylinder design . In terms of tractive effort , the class was the most powerful 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 ever built in Britain , and were the only 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways . They were well liked by crews . They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s , but at the cost of high axle @-@ loading : 21 long tons ( 21 t ) . The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive . 
 Permission was granted for the first batch of fifteen locomotives in March 1928 , but this was reduced to ten when it became apparent that they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route . Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930 . Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934 . A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order , but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression . The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935 . 
 = = = Naming the locomotives = = = 
 For location details and current status of the preserved locomotives including surviving artifacts of scrapped class members , see : List of SR V " Schools " class locomotives 
 The Southern Railway continued its 1923 naming policy for express passenger locomotives with this class . As several public schools were located on the Southern Railway network , the locomotives were named after them . This was another marketing success for both railway and schools concerned , continuing in the tradition of the N15 King Arthur and Lord Nelson classes ' . 
 Where possible , the Southern sent the newly constructed locomotive to a station near the school after which it was named for its official naming ceremony , when pupils were allowed to view the cab of " their " engine . Extension of the class meant that names from " foreign " schools outside the Southern Railway catchment area were used , including Rugby and Malvern . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 The class performed well from the outset , but there were a number of minor modifications over the years . The first ten were built without smoke deflectors , but these were added from August 1931 , and the remaining thirty were fitted with them from new . Following the successful introduction of the Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes on to the Lord Nelson class , Maunsell 's successor Oliver Bulleid began to fit them to the Schools class . However no discernible improvement to draughting was experienced , and only twenty examples were so modified . 
 = = Operational use = = 
 The original ten locomotives were shared between Dover for use on the South Eastern Main Line and Eastbourne for London expresses . Several of the former later transferred to Ramsgate . By mid 1931 they began to be used on the Hastings services and as more locomotives became available later that year they also appeared on Portsmouth expresses . After the electrification of the London to Eastbourne and the London to Portsmouth routes in the late 1930s the class also began to be used from Bournemouth . Under British Railways they were also widely used on cross @-@ country trains from Brighton to Cardiff and Exeter and on the Newhaven Boat Trains . Two locomotives ( <unk> and <unk> ) were briefly supplied with Lord Nelson tenders for use on the longer runs of the Western Section . 
 = = = Achievements = = = 
 The class was frequently regarded by locomotive crews as the finest constructed by the Southern Railway up to 1930 , and could turn in highly spectacular performances for its size . The fastest recorded speed for these locomotives was 95 mph ( 153 km / h ) , achieved near Wool railway station in 1938 by 928 Stowe pulling a four coach train from Dorchester to Wareham . However , there was a drawback with such high power and relatively low weight ; when starting the locomotive from a standstill , <unk> frequently occurred , calling for skilled handling on the footplate . 
 The reception given by footplate crews was such that more of the class were constructed for other parts of the network , although the electrification of the Southern 's Eastern Section meant that they were dispersed from their original stamping grounds . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 The introduction of British Rail Class 201 diesel @-@ electric multiple units to the Hastings route after 1957 and the completion of the electrification of the South Eastern Main Line in 1961 deprived the class of much of their work . Withdrawals began in January 1961 and the whole class had disappeared from service by December 1962 .

 When built , the Schools Class were outshopped in Maunsell 's darker version of the LSWR passenger sage green livery lined in black and white , with cabside numberplates and " Southern " and the loco number on the tender in yellow . Later adaptations of the Southern Railway livery following Bulleid 's arrival as Chief Mechanical Engineer entailed Malachite Green livery , again with " Sunshine Yellow " picking out the numbers and " Southern " on the tender ( during the Second World War the locomotives were painted black with yellow lettering and numbers . ) . The smoke deflectors – a later addition – were also treated with this livery . Numbers allocated to the locomotives were 900 – 939 . 
 = = = Post @-@ 1948 ( nationalisation ) = = = 
 Initial livery after nationalisation in 1948 was modified Southern Railway malachite green and sunshine yellow with ' British Railways ' on the tender , and the Southern numbering system was temporarily retained with an " S " prefix , e.g. <unk> . Following this the locomotives were repainted British Railways mixed traffic lined black and given the power classification 5P , as only the larger passenger locos were painted green . This choice of livery proved an unpopular decision considering the locomotives ' duties , and they were subsequently outshopped in British Railways <unk> green livery with orange and black lining as they became due for overhaul . By this stage the class had been renumbered under standard British Railways procedure , from <unk> to <unk> . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 Three locomotives have been preserved : 
 925 , Cheltenham , is part of the National Railway Collection . Currently at the Mid Hants having undergone overhaul by a team from the Mid Hants Railway ( led by Chris Smith ) at Eastleigh Works . On completion , the locomotive featured at <unk> in June 2012 and then returned to the Mid Hants ( on 26 / 28 June ) where she will be based on long term loan from the NRM . She joins fellow Maunsell Southern Railway engine Lord Nelson Class No. 850 Lord Nelson . 
 926 , Repton , is owned by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway . It was completed in May 1934 and entered service on the Bournemouth route , with some time operating between Waterloo and Portsmouth before that line was electrified . It was one of the last of the class to be overhauled by British Railways in 1960 , so was considered a good choice for preservation . In December 1962 the engine was withdrawn from service , and in 1966 it was purchased and overhauled at Eastleigh , before moving to the USA . It was donated by the purchaser to Steamtown , USA in Vermont , USA . Steamtown loaned the engine to the Cape Breton Steam Railway in Canada , where it operated a regular passenger service . In 1989 it was sold again , and returned to the UK to the NYMR , where it was again overhauled and found to be in good condition . Currently undergoing overhaul . <unk> has also operated on the mainline between Whitby and Grosmont with occasional visits to Battersby . 
 928 Stowe , was built in 1934 at a cost of £ 5 @,@ 000 by the Eastleigh locomotive works of the Southern Railway . It recorded more than a million miles of passenger service operation during 28 years of Southern main line use . It was purchased from British Railways for Lord Montagu 's National Motor Museum on withdrawal in 1962 . It was moved to the East Somerset Railway in 1973 , and then to the Bluebell Railway where it was put into running order by the Maunsell Locomotive Society , entering service in 1981 . It ran for the length of its ten @-@ year boiler ticket and was withdrawn from service in 1991 . ' Stowe ' was purchased by the MLS from Lord Montagu in September 2000 , thus securing it 's future at the Bluebell . The purchase was funded in part by the sale of S15 class no . 830 , which subsequently moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it awaits restoration to working order . In 2003 the tender was completely rebuilt , with a brand new tank being built . ' Stowe ' is now undergoing a full overhaul to working order , with funds being raised through the Bluebell 's ' Keep Up The Pressure ' campaign .

 Come to the Well is the fifth studio album by American contemporary Christian band Casting Crowns , released on October 18 , 2011 through Beach Street and Reunion Records . The album , which has a predominantly pop rock and rock sound , was based on the Biblical story of the woman at the well . In writing the album , lead vocalist Mark Hall collaborated with songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman , Matthew West , and Tom Douglas . The album received mostly positive reviews from critics , many of whom praised the album 's songwriting , and received the award for Top Christian Album at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards . 
 Although it was projected to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 by music industry analysts , Come to the Well debuted at number two on the chart and number one on the Christian Albums chart with first @-@ week sales of 99 @,@ 000 units . It also debuted on the Canadian Albums Chart at number sixty @-@ nine and appeared at number eight on the New Zealand Albums Chart in 2012 following the band 's appearance at the 2012 Parachute Music Festival . The album has sold over 779 @,@ 000 copies and has received a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

 According to Casting Crowns ' lead vocalist Mark Hall , the concept for Come to the Well is the song " The Well " . Hall wrote the song based on the Biblical story of " woman at the well and the fact that she was standing there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water , but they weren 't talking about the same water " . Hall noted that , in his life , " when I come to Jesus , I 've already got my well figured out , I 've already got what I think is going to sustain me , I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work . We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells , but our wells are really holes in the ground " . Hall argued that instead of using that approach , <unk> should " start with Jesus , then we go to the world " , and said that approach is what the album is about . In writing the album , Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman , Matthew West , and Tom Douglas on several tracks ; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album 's twelve tracks , the exception being " Face Down " , which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd . 
 Come to the Well was produced by Mark A. Miller . It was recorded and mixed by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in Franklin , Tennessee . Additional vocals were recorded by Billy Lord at Eagle 's Landing Studio in McDonough , Georgia , while additional recording was conducted at Lifesong Studio in McDonough . The string tracks on the album , which were arranged by David Davidson , were recorded at Ocean Way Studio in Nashville , Tennessee by Bobby Shin . It was mastered by Andrew Mendelson at Georgetown Masters in Nashville . The album was <unk> by Shin at <unk> Studio in Nashville .

 Opening track " Courageous " , a pop rock and soft rock song , was described by Hall as an " anthem of encouragement . It ’ s one brother reminding all of God ’ s men we were meant for greatness , and that greatness is defined in contagious and courageous abandonment to Jesus " . 
 " City on the Hill " , described as " lush " and " string @-@ laden " , is a critique of denominationalism in the Christian church ; Hall described the song as an " allegory of the factions of the modern Church , the result of predominantly like @-@ minded people often dwelling upon non @-@ essentials and personal taste to go their own direction " . 
 " Jesus , Friend of Sinners " " admonishes the Christian church to show compassion " and " laments how the world knows many Christ followers more by what they are against than what they are for " . Although Hall called the song " one of the more direct songs [ Casting Crowns has ] written " , he said " it also speaks truth . And I think believers should speak truth to each other as long as we do it in love " . 
 " Already There " , described as " echoing " Clocks " -era Coldplay " , relates the concept that " God is already sitting at the end of your life looking back at it " . " The Well " , regarded by Hall as the " heart of the entire album " , highlights the " life @-@ giving love of Jesus " as opposed to " dried up empty religion " . 
 " Spirit Wind " incorporates a folk rock sound with influences from country music . The song , one of the first songs Mark Hall ever wrote , was written after Hall saw a pastor at a church in Alabama preach the story of Ezekiel and the valley of dry bones to a church that Hall described as one of the " <unk> churches " he had ever seen . The song 's verse structure goes from " Ezekiel in the first verse to the country preacher in the second verse and finally to a prayer for God to raise his Church again as a mighty army [ in the third verse ] " . 
 = = = Tracks 7 – 12 = = = 
 " Just Another Birthday " , sung by Megan Garrett , is a mid @-@ tempo ballad . The song was written to " shake up some fathers and remind them of their true priorities " and to " encourage kids out there who don ’ t have an involved dad here on Earth " . 
 " Wedding Day " features a " soaring melody " . According to Hall , the song " anticipates the thrill of reveling in the presence of God as the Bride of Christ " , a theme Hall felt is rarely addressed in modern music . " Angel " was written for Hall 's wife , Melanie , and references the first time Hall met her as well as their wedding day . 
 " My Own Worst Enemy " has a " grungy " rock sound . Hall felt the song 's sound , which he described as perhaps the heaviest song Casting Crowns have ever made , was fitting due to the song 's lyrical theme of the inner battle with sin . 
 " Face Down " is the only song on the album which was not co @-@ written by Hall , The album 's final song , " So Far to Find You " , was written by Hall and Steven Curtis Chapman about Hall 's adopted daughter , <unk> Hope .

 = Saint Paul , Minnesota = 
 Saint Paul ( / <unk> <unk> / ; abbreviated St. Paul ) is the capital and second @-@ most populous city of the U.S. state of Minnesota . As of 2015 , the city 's estimated population was 300 @,@ 851 . Saint Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County , the smallest and most densely populated county in Minnesota . The city lies mostly on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the area surrounding its point of confluence with the Minnesota River , and adjoins Minneapolis , the state 's largest city . Known as the " Twin Cities " , the two form the core of Minneapolis – Saint Paul , the 16th @-@ largest metropolitan area in the United States , with about 3 @.@ 52 million residents . 
 Founded near historic Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center , the city rose to prominence when it was named the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 . Though Minneapolis is better @-@ known nationally , Saint Paul contains the state government and other important institutions . Regionally , the city is known for the Xcel Energy Center , home of the Minnesota Wild , and for the Science Museum of Minnesota . As a business hub of the Upper Midwest , it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab . Saint Paul , along with its Twin City , Minneapolis , is known for its high literacy rate . It was the only city in the United States with a population of 250 @,@ 000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers in 2007 . 
 The settlement originally began at present @-@ day Lambert 's Landing , but was known as Pig 's Eye after Pierre " Pig 's Eye " Parrant established a popular tavern there . When Lucien Galtier , the first Catholic pastor of the region , established the Log Chapel of Saint Paul ( shortly thereafter to become the first location of the Cathedral of Saint Paul ) , he made it known that the settlement was now to be called by that name , as " Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated , this monosyllable is short , sounds good , it is understood by all Christian denominations " . 
 = = History = = 
 Burial mounds in present @-@ day Indian Mounds Park suggest that the area was originally inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about two thousand years ago . From the early 17th century until 1837 , the Mdewakanton Dakota , a tribe of the Sioux , lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe . They called the area I @-@ mni @-@ za ska dan ( " little white rock " ) for its exposed white sandstone cliffs . 
 Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 , a U.S. Army officer named Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 40 @,@ 000 ha ; 160 sq mi ) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 in order to establish a fort . The negotiated territory was located on both banks of the Mississippi River , starting from Saint Anthony Falls in present @-@ day Minneapolis , to its confluence with the Saint Croix River . Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers , which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations . The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. Government . <unk> ( Chief Little Crow V ) moved his band at <unk> across the river to the south . Fur traders , explorers , and missionaries came to the area for the fort 's protection . Many of the settlers were French @-@ Canadians who lived nearby . However , as a whiskey trade flourished , military officers banned settlers from the fort @-@ controlled lands . Pierre " Pig 's Eye " Parrant , a retired fur trader @-@ turned @-@ bootlegger who particularly irritated officials , set up his tavern , the Pig 's Eye , near present @-@ day Lambert 's Landing . By the early 1840s , the community had become important as a trading center and a destination for settlers heading west . Locals called the area Pig 's Eye ( French : L <unk> du <unk> ) or Pig 's Eye Landing after Parrant 's popular tavern . 
 In 1841 , Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French @-@ Canadians and established a chapel , named for his favorite saint , Paul the Apostle , on the bluffs above Lambert 's Landing . Galtier intended for the settlement to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of the new chapel . In 1847 , a New York educator named Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city 's first school . The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 and Saint Paul named as its capital . In 1857 , the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter . However , Joe Rolette , a territorial legislator , stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding , thus preventing the move . On May 11 , 1858 , Minnesota was admitted to the union as the thirty @-@ second state , with Saint Paul as the capital . 
 That year , more than 1 @,@ 000 steamboats were in service at Saint Paul , making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory . Natural geography was a primary reason that the city became a landing . The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley 's stone bluffs . During this period , Saint Paul was called " The Last City of the East . " Industrialist James J. Hill constructed and expanded his network of railways into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway , which were headquartered in Saint Paul . Today they are collectively part of the BNSF Railway . 
 On August 20 , 1904 , severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings , causing USD $ 1 @.@ 78 million ( $ 46 @.@ 88 million present @-@ day ) in damages to the city and ripping spans from the High Bridge . In the 1960s , during urban renewal , Saint Paul razed western neighborhoods close to downtown . The city also contended with the creation of the interstate freeway system in a fully built landscape . From 1959 to 1961 , the western Rondo neighborhood was demolished by the construction of Interstate 94 , which brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities . The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community . 
 Downtown had short skyscraper @-@ building booms beginning in the 1970s . The tallest buildings , such as Galtier Plaza ( Jackson and Sibley Towers ) , The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums , and the city 's tallest building , Wells Fargo Place ( formerly Minnesota World Trade Center ) , were constructed in the late 1980s . In the 1990s and 2000s , the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued . As of 2004 , nearly 10 % of the city 's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Thailand , and Myanmar . Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives .

 Saint Paul 's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water . The city 's defining physical characteristic , the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers , was carved into the region during the last ice age , as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built . Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys . The city is situated in east @-@ central Minnesota . 
 The Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city 's west , southwest , and southeast sides . Minneapolis , the state 's largest city , lies to the west . Falcon Heights , Lauderdale , Roseville , and Maplewood are north , with Maplewood lying to the east . The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south , as are Lilydale , Mendota , and Mendota Heights , although across the river from the city . The city 's largest lakes are Pig 's Eye Lake , which is part of the Mississippi , Lake Phalen , and Lake Como . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 56 @.@ 18 square miles ( 145 @.@ 51 km2 ) , of which 51 @.@ 98 square miles ( 134 @.@ 63 km2 ) is land and 4 @.@ 20 square miles ( 10 @.@ 88 km2 ) is water .

The average annual temperature of 47 @.@ 05 ° F ( 8 @.@ 36 ° C ) gives the Minneapolis − Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S. 
 = = Demographics = = 
 The earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds ( now Indian Mounds Park ) on the bluffs above the river . The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation . The Ojibwe would later occupy the north ( east ) bank of the Mississippi River . 
 By 1800 , French @-@ Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area . Fort Snelling and nearby Pig 's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English , Irish , and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge . These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river . The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi , named for their home in Connemara Ireland . The Irish would become prolific in politics , city governance , and public safety , much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority . In 1850 , the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory . A large group settled in Swede Hollow , which would later become home to Poles , Italians , and Mexicans . The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul 's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s .

Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul 's West Side since the 1930s , and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005 . 
 The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian , split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations . The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish , German , Scottish , and French Canadian settlers who , in time , would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants . There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus , Muslims , and Buddhists . The city has been dubbed " <unk> " due to its large Wiccan population .

 = To the Stars ( album ) = 
 To the Stars is an album by American jazz fusion group the Chick Corea Elektric Band , released on August 24 , 2004 by Stretch Records . Jazz musician Chick Corea , a longtime member of the Church of Scientology , was inspired by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard 's science fiction 1954 novel To the Stars . Hubbard 's book tells the story of an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of time dilation due to traveling at near light speed . A few days experienced by the ship 's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth . 
 Corea was influenced in particular by a scene from Hubbard 's work where one of the main characters plays the piano , and he created the album as a tone poem piece . It was the first time members of his group Chick Corea Elektric Band had gotten together since 1991 . Scientology @-@ owned Galaxy Press reissued the book at the same time as the album 's release as a form of cross @-@ marketing . Corea later produced another album , The Ultimate Adventure , also inspired by and named after a work by Hubbard . 
 The album received mostly positive reviews . Christopher Blagg of the Boston Herald commented : " Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling , " and Mike Hobart of the Financial Times described the album as " a fine programme of jazz @-@ fusion " . It reached number eight on the U.S. Top Contemporary Jazz charts in September 2004 , and garnered Corea a 2004 Grammy Award nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track " The Long Passage " . 
 = = Inspiration = = 
 Hubbard 's To the Stars depicts a future where an interstellar ship travelling at near light speed slows down time experienced for its occupants . The ship 's members are affected by Albert Einstein 's time dilation theory , and the Earth experiences hundreds of years while only a few days have passed for members of the ship . The crew have no family or friends on Earth due to the time that separates them . Of the album 's 17 tracks , 10 are directly based on characters or concepts from the book . The protagonist of the book ( scientist Alan Corday ) , the ship 's captain ( Captain Jocelyn ) , and the ship 's name ( Hound of Heaven ) are all titles of tracks on the album . The other seven tracks are " Port Views " , short musical interludes between the larger pieces . 
 Corea explains at his website how he was motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars , commenting that he was inspired by a scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano . He had read the book eight or nine times , and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard 's work the album was created as a tone poem piece . Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun ( 1975 ) , My Spanish Heart ( 1976 ) , and The Mad Hatter ( 1978 ) . The piece is Corea 's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard 's works . 
 " The attraction to me was not only the challenge of writing music portraying characters in a fiction book but the fact that I 've had such an intimate connection with L. Ron Hubbard and his work in Scientology for 40 years now . I 've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years , and once I started into the act of working with his creations , it had an extra special excitement to me , " he said in an interview with The Washington Post . " Aside from the content in his message , and the fact that he 's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics , the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing . There is a musical wavelength to what he does , " said Corea to The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune . 
 = = Production = = 
 Corea brought together the original members of Chick Corea Elektric Band for the first time since 1991 , including bassist John Patitucci , drummer Dave <unk> , saxophonist Eric Marienthal and guitarist Frank Gambale . Gambale 's electric guitar playing figures prominently in some of the tracks . In a statement in The Harvard Crimson , Corea commented that To the Stars represented a synergy of his three greatest passions : " My passion as a composer / performer , my passion for the Elektric Band as a perfect orchestra , and my passion for L. Ron Hubbard as the ideal artist . " The album is his " favorite recording " out of his almost one hundred album discography . 
 Mike Manoogian designed the cover and book design for the 2004 hardcover edition of the novel To the Stars , and the artwork is copyrighted by the L. Ron Hubbard Library . The album cover utilizes the same design as the novel . 
 The novel To the Stars was reissued by Scientology @-@ owned Galaxy Press at the same time as the album as a form of cross @-@ marketing . According to Publishers Weekly , Corea 's soundtrack to the novel was issued by Galaxy Press to give the company 's " enormous marketing muscle " the ability to " tap into the vast Hubbard fan base " . 
 Corea 's 2004 piece " The Adventures of Hippocrates " was inspired by a robot like character named " Hippocrates " from Hubbard 's science fiction series Ole Doc Methuselah . Corea would go on to compose another album in 2006 , The Ultimate Adventure , also inspired by and named after a book by Hubbard , which earned him two Grammy Awards .

 The album reached number eight on Billboard magazine 's Top Contemporary Jazz charts in September 2004 , and Corea earned a 2004 Grammy Award nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track " The Long Passage " . The album received a rating of three stars from Allmusic , three stars from The Observer , three and a half stars from The Star @-@ Ledger , and four stars from The Times . In a review of the work in The Washington Post , Geoffrey Himes writes that " Corea occasionally falls into his old bad habits of jazz @-@ rock fusion excess , substituting frenetic virtuosity for melodic content and emotional connection on tunes such as the album @-@ opening ' Check Blast ' and ' Hound of Heaven . ' " Himes highlights Corea 's compositions of the seven " Port View " interludes , and calls " Alan Corday " the best piece on the album . Mike Joyce of The Washington Post also appreciated the " flamenco @-@ tinged ballad " of the " Alan Corday " track . Christopher Blagg of the Boston Herald liked " the dense electrified samba of the joyous ' Mistress Luck - The Party ' " , and commented : " Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling . " Bob Young of the Boston Herald described the album as " music that shifts continually from bright , aggressive jazz fusion to melodic tranquility and back again " . James F. Collins gave the album a positive review in The Harvard Crimson , writing : " To The Stars is a testament to his [ Corea 's ] unflagging creativity and is a proud addition to his already expansive discography . " Mike Hobart reviewed the album for Financial Times , commenting that " once the band had delivered its first unison riff , the music 's inspirational source was irrelevant as a fine programme of jazz @-@ fusion poured out " . 
 In his review of the album , Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes : " I did like the driving , collective muscle of the band , though , very much , " but he also describes its aesthetics as " cluttered and gaudy " . For PopMatters , Associate Music Editor Justin <unk> @-@ Lake writes : " In many ways , it 's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes ; on the other hand , it 's a journey that 's too long to take . " In his review of Corea 's later work The Ultimate Adventure , Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes : " ' To the Stars ' was trite , electronic bubblegum music that sounded like a cheesy video @-@ game soundtrack . " Writing in The Times , John <unk> comments that " many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept " , concluding his review with : " If you prefer hi @-@ fi to sci @-@ fi , then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time . " John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian , writing that the album " cries out for warning stickers - ' this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology ' " , and that it " drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory " .
