 Many fossils of rabbits , rodents and pond turtles , as well as coyotes , deer and the Black bear , have been recovered as well . One of the most common animals identified from the Diamond Valley Lake site by San Bernardino County Museum scientists was the extinct American mastodon , Mammut americanum . In North American paleontology , mastodons are thought to have been solitary forest @-@ dwelling browsers . The abundance of mastodons in the fossil record from the site suggests that , during the last Ice Age , the Diamond Valley Lake site was more wooded or forested than today . Fossil remains of ponderosa pine and manzanita recovered from the site lend credence to this interpretation . Radiometric dating of fossil plants from the Diamond Valley Lake site confirms an age range of less than 13 @,@ 000 years ago to more than 60 @,@ 000 years ago for these fossils . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Diamond Valley Lake offers fishing and light boating on the lake . A recreation park , aquatic center , visitor center and the Western Science Center along with the lake marina are located on the eastern end of the lake . A viewpoint , offering views of the pumping station and I / O tower , along with most of the lake is located on the western end of the lake . To the south of the lake is the Southwestern Riverside County Multi @-@ Species Reserve , a 13 @,@ 500 @-@ acre ( 5 @,@ 500 ha ) preserve between Diamond Valley Lake and Skinner Reservoir . The reserve is home to at least 16 sensitive , endangered or threatened native California bird , animal and plant species . 
 Stocking of the lake with fish began before the reservoir was filled , with a small rearing pond being placed on the bottom of the valley . The lake has several species of freshwater fish ; largemouth bass , smallmouth bass , bluegill , crappie , rainbow trout , striped bass , channel catfish , and shad . It is considered one of the best fisheries in California . 
 Much of the area around the lake remains undeveloped and empty . Original plans included large recreation areas on both the eastern and western end of the lake complete with golf courses , campgrounds , swimming lakes , water parks and other amenities . The MWD still plans on building the additional recreation facilities , but lack of funding and lack of support from developers has prevented them from doing so . 
 = Compounds of berkelium = 
 Berkelium forms a number of chemical compounds , where it normally exists in an oxidation state of + 3 or + 4 , and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue , terbium . Like all actinides , berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids , liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state . This trivalent state is the most stable , especially in aqueous solutions , but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known . The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride @-@ strontium chloride melts . Aqueous solutions of Bk3 + ions are green in most acids . The color of the Bk4 + ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange @-@ yellow in sulfuric acid . Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature , possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide surface layer ; however , it reacts with molten metals , hydrogen , halogens , chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds . Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds . 
 = = Oxides = = 
 Two oxides of berkelium are known , with berkelium in the + 3 ( Bk2O3 ) and + 4 ( BkO2 ) oxidation states . Berkelium ( IV ) oxide is a brown solid that crystallizes in a cubic ( fluorite ) crystal structure with the space group Fm3m and the coordination numbers of Bk [ 8 ] and O [ 4 ] . The lattice parameter is 533 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 5 pm . 
 Berkelium ( III ) oxide , a yellow @-@ green solid , is formed from BkO2 by reduction with hydrogen : 
 <formula> 
 The compound has a melting point of 1920 ° C , body @-@ centered cubic crystal lattice and a lattice constant a 
 = 1088 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 5 pm . Upon heating to 1200 ° C , the cubic Bk2O3 transforms to a monoclinic structure , which further converts to a hexagonal phase at 1750 ° C ; the latter transition is reversible . Such three @-@ phase behavior is typical for the actinide <unk> . 
 A divalent oxide BkO has been reported as a brittle gray solid with a face centered cubic ( fcc ) structure and a lattice constant a = 
 496 @.@ 4 pm , but its exact chemical composition is uncertain . 
 = = Halides = = 
 In halides , berkelium assumes the oxidation states + 3 and + 4 . The + 3 state is most stable , especially in solutions , and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only known in the solid phase . The coordination of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic , with a coordination number of 9 . In the trivalent bromide , it is bicapped trigonal prismatic ( coordination 8 ) or octahedral ( coordination 6 ) , and in the iodide it is octahedral . 
 Berkelium ( IV ) fluoride ( BkF4 ) is a yellow @-@ green ionic solid which crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system ( Pearson symbol <unk> , space group C2 / c No. 15 , lattice constants a 
 = 1247 pm , b = 
 1058 pm , c 
 = 817 pm ) and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium ( IV ) fluoride . 
 Berkelium ( III ) fluoride ( <unk> ) is also a yellow @-@ green solid , but it has two crystalline structures . The most stable phase at low temperatures has an orthorhombic symmetry , isotypic with yttrium ( III ) fluoride ( Pearson symbol <unk> , space group <unk> , No. 62 , a = 
 670 pm , b 
 = 709 pm , c = 
 441 pm ) . Upon heating to 350 to 600 ° C , it transforms to a trigonal structure found in lanthanum ( III ) fluoride ( Pearson symbol <unk> , space group <unk> , No. 165 , a 
 = 697 pm , c = 
 714 pm ) . 
 Visible amounts of berkelium ( III ) chloride ( BkCl3 ) were first isolated and characterized in 1962 , and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram . It can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 ° C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 ° C and crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system isotypic with uranium ( III ) chloride ( Pearson symbol <unk> , space group P63 / m , No. 176 ) . Upon heating to just below its melting point , BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase . The hexahydrate BkCl3 · 6H2O ( berkelium trichloride hexahydrate ) has a monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a 
 = 966 pm , b = 
 654 pm and c 
 = 797 pm . Another berkelium ( III ) chloride , <unk> can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous solution containing berkelium ( III ) hydroxide , hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride . It has a face @-@ centered cubic structure where Bk ( III ) ions are surrounded by chloride ions in an octahedral configuration . 
 The ternary berkelium ( IV ) chloride Cs2BkCl6 is obtained by dissolving berkelium ( IV ) hydroxide in a chilled solution of caesium chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid . It forms orange hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 
 745 @.@ 1 pm and c 
 = 1209 @.@ 7 pm . The average radius of the <unk> − ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm . 
 Two forms of berkelium ( III ) bromide are known , a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and orthorhombic with coordination 8 ; the latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 ° C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms : the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X @-@ ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years , so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249Cf . No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3 — 249CfBr3 transformation , even though the orthorhombic bromide was previously unknown for californium . However , other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 . For example , the latter could be reduced with hydrogen <unk> , but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples , as well on the samples containing both bromides . The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0 @.@ 22 % per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties . Besides a chemical contamination , 249Cf , as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self @-@ damage of the crystal lattice due to the resulting self @-@ heating . This can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results . 
 Berkelium ( III ) iodide forms hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 
 758 @.@ 4 pm and c = <unk> pm . The known oxyhalides of berkelium include <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; they all crystallize in a tetragonal lattice .

 The <unk> of berkelium @-@ 249 are known for the elements nitrogen , phosphorus , arsenic and antimony . They are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium ( III ) hydride ( <unk> ) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperatures ( about 600 ° C ) under high vacuum in quartz ampoules . They crystallize in the cubic crystal system with the lattice constant of 495 @.@ 1 pm for <unk> , 566 @.@ 9 pm for <unk> , 582 @.@ 9 for <unk> and 619 @.@ 1 pm for <unk> . These lattice constant values are smaller than those in curium pnictides , but are comparable to those of terbium pnictides .

 Berkelium ( III ) sulfide , <unk> , has been prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon <unk> at 1130 ° C , or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with sulfur . These procedures yield brownish @-@ black crystals with a cubic symmetry and lattice constant a = 844 pm . 
 = = = Other compounds = = = 
 Berkelium ( III ) and berkelium ( IV ) hydroxides are both stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions . Berkelium ( III ) phosphate ( <unk> ) has been prepared as a solid , which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser ( 514 @.@ 5 nm line ) excitation . Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 ° C. They are non @-@ stoichiometric with the nominal formula <unk> + x ( 0 < x < 1 ) . Whereas the <unk> has a hexagonal symmetry , the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm . Several other salts of berkelium are known , including <unk> , ( <unk> ) 3 · 4H2O , BkCl3 · 6H2O , Bk2 ( SO4 ) 3 · 12H2O and Bk2 ( C2O4 ) 3 · 4H2O . Thermal decomposition at about 600 ° C in an argon atmosphere ( to avoid oxidation to <unk> ) of Bk2 ( SO4 ) 3 · 12H2O yields the body @-@ centered orthorhombic crystals of berkelium ( IV ) <unk> ( <unk> ) . This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 ° C in an inert atmosphere .

 Berkelium forms a trigonal ( η5 – C5H5 ) 3Bk complex with three cyclopentadienyl rings , which can be synthesized by reacting berkelium ( III ) chloride with the molten <unk> Be ( C5H5 ) 2 at about 70 ° C. It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry , with the lattice constants of a 
 = 1411 pm , b = 
 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2 @.@ 47 g / cm3 . The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 ° C , and sublimates without melting at about 350 ° C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks . One C5H5 ring in ( η5 – C5H5 ) 3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield [ Bk ( C5H5 ) 2Cl ] 2 . The optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of ( η5 – C5H5 ) 3Bk . 
 = Italian ironclad Roma = 
 Roma was an ironclad warship built for the Italian Regia Marina in the 1860s ; she was the lead ship of the Roma @-@ class ironclads . Armed with a main battery of five 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) and twelve 8 in ( 200 mm ) guns in a broadside arrangement , Roma was obsolescent by the time she entered service . As a result , her career was limited . In 1880 , she took part in an international naval demonstration off Ragusa to enforce the Treaty of Berlin . In November 1881 , she collided with the ironclad Principe Amedeo in a storm in Naples , but she was not damaged . Roma was reduced to a guard ship in 1890 and then to a depot ship in 1895 . In July 1896 , she was scuttled to save the ship from a fire caused by a lightning strike . She was thereafter raised and broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Roma was 79 @.@ 67 meters ( 261 ft 5 in ) long between perpendiculars ; she had a beam of 17 @.@ 33 m ( 56 ft 10 in ) and an average draft of 7 @.@ 57 m ( 24 ft 10 in ) . She displaced 5 @,@ 698 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 608 long tons ) normally and up to 6 @,@ 151 t ( 6 @,@ 054 long tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of one single @-@ expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by six coal @-@ fired , cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . Her engine produced a top speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) from 3 @,@ 670 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 740 kW ) . She could steam for 1 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 590 km ; 2 @,@ 230 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was barque @-@ rigged to supplement the steam engine . She had a crew of 549 – 551 officers and men . 
 Roma was a broadside ironclad , and she was armed with a main battery of five 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns and twelve 8 in ( 203 mm ) guns . The ship was protected by iron belt armor that was 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the waterline . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for Roma was laid down at the Cantiere della <unk> shipyard in Genoa in February 1863 . She was launched on 18 December 1865 , and fitting @-@ out work was finished by May 1869 . By the time she entered service , other navies had begun to build casemate ships , rendering Roma obsolescent almost immediately after she was completed . In addition , the Italian naval budget was drastically reduced following the defeat at Lissa in 1866 , which reflected a stark decrease in the government 's confidence in the fleet . As a result , she saw little use during her career ; indeed the budget was reduced so significantly that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870 , as part of the wars of Italian unification . Instead , the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home . 
 In 1874 – 75 , the ship 's armament was revised to eleven 10 @-@ inch guns . In November 1880 , Roma and the ironclad Palestro took part in a naval demonstration off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro . In early November 1881 , Roma was moored in Naples when a severe storm tore the ship from her anchors . The heavy winds drove her into the ironclad Principe Amedeo , but neither ship was damaged in the collision . During the annual fleet maneuvers held in 1885 , Roma served in the 2nd Division of the " Western Squadron " ; she was joined by the ironclad Affondatore and five torpedo boats . The " Western Squadron " attacked the defending " Eastern Squadron " , simulating a Franco @-@ Italian conflict , with operations conducted off Sardinia . 
 The ship had her guns replaced again in 1886 , this time with eleven 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) guns . In 1890 , Roma was removed from front @-@ line service and tasked with the defense of La Spezia . While serving as a guard ship , her armament was reduced to five 8 @-@ inch guns . The ship was stricken on 5 May 1895 and thereafter used as an ammunition depot ship based in La Spezia . The ship was accidentally set on fire by a lightning strike on 28 July 1896 ; her crew scuttled the ship to prevent her from being burned completely . Roma was refloated the following month and then broken up for scrap immediately thereafter . 
 = Tupaia miocenica = 
 Tupaia miocenica is a fossil treeshrew from the Miocene of Thailand . Known only from a single tooth , an upper first or second molar , it is among the few known fossil treeshrews . With a length of 3 @.@ 57 mm , the tooth is large for a treeshrew . At the back lingual corner ( the side of the tongue ) , the tooth shows a small cusp , the hypocone , that is separated from the protocone in front of it by a narrow valley . The condition of the hypocone distinguishes this species from various other treeshrews . In addition , the presence of a well @-@ developed but simple mesostyle ( a small cuspule ) is distinctive . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Tupaia miocenica was described in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in a report on the fossil mammals of Li Mae Long , a Miocene site in Thailand . The animal is known from a single tooth , which according to Mein and Ginsburg 's comparisons most closely resembles the living treeshrews of the genus Tupaia . The specific name , miocenica , refers to the animal 's occurrence during the Miocene . Only a few other fossil treeshrews are known , and T. miocenica is the only fossil species from Thailand . When it was described , it was the only Miocene representative of Tupaia , but a second species , Tupaia <unk> , was named from the Late Miocene of Lufeng , China , in 2012 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The single known tooth , a worn left upper molar known as T Li 175 , is large for a treeshrew , with a length of 3 @.@ 57 mm and width of 4 @.@ 79 mm . Although Mein and Ginsburg described it a second upper molar ( M2 ) , Ni and Qiu argued in 2012 that it is more likely a first upper molar ( M1 ) . It is <unk> ( with a W @-@ shaped chewing surface ) and the labial surface ( the side of the cheeks ) is concave and bears a <unk> crest . A well @-@ developed small cusp , a mesostyle , is present on the labial side . The presence of the mesostyle distinguishes the animal from <unk> , the only member of the treeshrew family <unk> . The lingual ( tongue ) side is narrow . A large cusp , the protocone , is on the front lingual corner . Two crests descend from it ; one reaches the paracone on the front labial side and another approaches the metacone to the back of the tooth . A smaller cusp , a hypocone , is on the back lingual corner . This feature distinguishes T. miocenica both from the treeshrew genera <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which lack the cusp entirely , and from <unk> and <unk> , which have a large hypocone . In T. miocenica the back and lingual sides of the hypocone are straight and form a right angle with each other . The tooth most closely resembles Tupaia species with a simple mesostyle , such as the common treeshrew ( Tupaia <unk> ) . However , this species is smaller and unlike in T. miocenica , the hypocone is not isolated from the protocone by a narrow valley . 
 = = Range and ecology = = 
 Li Mae Long , the collection site of T. miocenica , is dated to the latest Early Miocene , corresponding to the European zone MN 4 , around 18 mya . It is in the Thai province of <unk> . The fossil fauna encompasses 34 species of mammals , including the tarsier <unk> thailandicus , the slow loris ? Nycticebus linglom , and the metatherian <unk> . Mein and Ginsburg conclude that the fauna represents a tropical forest environment close to a shallow lake .

MD 55 connects the La Vale area with Midland in the upper Georges Creek Valley in northwestern Allegany County . MD 55 was paved from Clarysville to Vale Summit around 1921 and extended south to Midland in the late 1930s . The state highway was truncated at Vale Summit when MD 36 took over part of the highway for a new alignment in the early 1970s .

As MD 55 passes the Vale Summit United Methodist Church , which dates back to 1889 , the state highway curves to the north and passes by the residential settlements of <unk> and Montel . The state highway descends into Spruce Hollow and passes under Interstate 68 and US 40 ( National Freeway ) with no access before arriving in Clarysville . MD 55 intersects Clarysville Road , the original alignment of US 40 , and passes the site of the Clarysville Inn , a historic inn built in 1807 that was destroyed by a fire in 1999 , before reaching its northern terminus at US 40 Alt .

 = Ice block expedition of 1959 = 
 The ice block expedition of 1959 ( Norwegian : <unk> ) was a publicity stunt carried out by the Norwegian insulation material producer Glassvatt ( today called Glava AS ) . Responding to a challenge from the radio station Radio Luxembourg , Glassvatt decided to equip a truck to bring a three @-@ ton block of ice from Mo i Rana by the Arctic Circle , to Libreville by the Equator . There was no form of refrigeration applied , and the expedition was intended to display the efficiency of the insulating glass wool used . The truck also brought 300 kg of medicines to the hospital of Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné . 
 The expedition then was followed by a worldwide press corps , and great crowds of spectators gathered in various European cities along the route . Crossing the Sahara , where the truck repeatedly got stuck in the sand , proved both a dangerous and laborious task . Once the truck had made it through the desert , however , and reached its final destination , it was revealed that the ice block had lost no more than 11 % of its original weight . The expedition was an enormous success , judged both by the end result and by the media attention generated for the company , and has been called " the world 's greatest publicity stunt " . To mark the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009 , the company made the original documentary of the expedition available online . They also released a new interview with the expedition 's leader Sivert Klevan , who was 84 years old at the time of the interview . 
 = = Background and preparations = = 
 In the autumn of 1958 , Radio Luxembourg launched a challenge to transport three tons of ice from the Arctic Circle to the Equator . The radio station would award 100 @,@ 000 francs for each kilogram ( at the time , US $ 202 @.@ 55 per kilogram ; $ 1 @,@ 487 @.@ 19 or € 1 @,@ 120 @.@ 19 per kg in 2009 currency ) that remained at the destination ; the only condition was that no form of refrigeration should be used . Managing director Birger <unk> at the Norwegian insulation material company Glassvatt ( today Glava AS ) saw the announcement and suggested that the company take on the challenge . He estimated that by isolating the ice with glass wool ( " <unk> " in Norwegian ) made from fibreglass , the driver could make several million francs . Once Radio Luxembourg realised the potential loss , they retracted the offer . By this point , however , the planned expedition had received so much attention that Glassvatt decided to go through with it anyway . Among the other sponsors were Shell , who provided the fuel , and Scania , who provided the truck . Altogether , sponsors from eight countries financed the expedition , including Glassvatt 's French mother company , the Saint @-@ <unk> corporation . The French sponsors wanted a French truck to be used , but the Norwegians insisted on a Scandinavian one . The latter position won through , and a Scania @-@ Vabis was selected for the task . The expedition 's leader later admitted that a French truck probably would have been more suitable for driving in the desert . On 22 February 1959 , at 9 : 15 am , the expedition left Mo i Rana . 
 Responsibility for the expedition was given to Sivert Klevan , an engineer with a good instinct for public relations . The ice was to be procured from the glacier <unk> , and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice . It soon became clear that the entire three @-@ ton block could not be brought out in one go . Instead , 200 kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw , carried away on a sled , and flown by helicopter down to the town centre . There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3 @,@ 050 kg . The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container , which was insulated with wood and glass wool . The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry it all the way to the Equator , accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew . 
 = = Through Europe = = 
 The first stop for the expedition was Oslo . There it was greeted by a great ceremony at <unk> in front of the University . The truck was loaded with 300 kg of medicines , to the value of NOK 50 @,@ 000 . These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné , near the final destination of Libreville , the capital of Gabon . From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark , where more medicines were brought along . For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European cities – including Hamburg , Cologne , The Hague and Brussels – and was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere . In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice , but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country . Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience , conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister <unk> Lange from Lange 's Belgian colleague and personal friend . 
 In Paris the expedition was escorted by police through the streets , and the crew members were invited to dine with the mayor . From Paris the truck continued to Marseille . There it was lifted aboard the freighter " Sidi <unk> " , that sailed the cargo to Algiers . In Algiers a special crane had to be obtained to lift the truck – weighing a total of sixteen tons , including the ice – onto the shore . The container was drained at this point to see how much of the ice had melted . In spite of unusually hot European weather for the season , only four litres of water had been shed . 
 = = Crossing the Sahara = = 
 Crossing the Sahara was considered particularly perilous at the time because of guerilla forces hiding in the mountains . The medicines carried by the truck would have been valuable loot for these groups , and for the first part of the desert the expedition was accompanied by the French Foreign Legion . The instruction the men received was " No stops , drive for your lives , even if you get a flat tire . " The crossing passed without violent incidents , however , and greater problems were presented by the elements . There were no roads in the desert , and the truck was heavily loaded and not especially adapted to the conditions . Several times it got stuck in the desert sand ; the crew had to place steel plates underneath for traction and spend hours digging out the sand from under the wheels . This took a great toll on the men , who had a limited supply of water , in temperatures approaching 50 ° C. The crew spent most nights in oases along the way , but on occasion also slept in sleeping bags in the sand . 
 At one point the expedition met a tribe of <unk> and greeted them by offering their camels water from the container . According to the commentary in the documentary film , the camels had never tasted anything as delicious as the Norwegian glacier water . This was not entirely true ; the water was contaminated by the glass wool and tar paper , and it was barely drinkable . The expedition arrived at the Hoggar Mountains near the Tropic of Cancer after fourteen days of travelling . A measurement at that point showed a loss of 96 litres of water . Once the Sahara was traversed , after 7 @,@ 500 km ( 4 @,@ 660 mi ) of driving , 177 litres had melted away . On average 15 litres melted each day in the desert . 
 = = Arrival and aftermath = = 
 After approximately three weeks , the expedition arrived in Lambaréné and met with Albert Schweitzer . Klevan later described the meeting with Schweitzer as the greatest moment of the entire expedition . Later , the hospital received 500 kg of Norwegian <unk> ( dried and salted cod ) , a particular favourite with the hospital 's patients . The medicines were handed over , and the container was opened . Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition , there was still great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand . The block of ice turned out to be almost entirely intact . 
 The expedition arrived at its final destination of Libreville on 21 March , after twenty @-@ seven days . The block of ice was found to weigh 2 @,@ 714 kg ; it had lost only 336 kg along the way . Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take , Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10 % ; the end result was approximately 11 % . A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville . A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle , he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris . If the crew accepted , the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe . The men , however , were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer . Instead , arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight , while the crew would fly home . The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville , for whom this was a rare commodity . Klevan , always conscious of promotional opportunities , brought a portion of the ice back home with him . This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo . 
 The expedition had been an enormous success , both in accomplishing the goal it had set out to accomplish , and by generating worldwide press coverage for the company and its product . The venture was reported on as far away as India . In 1979 , Oslo Marketing Association commemorated the ice block expedition with a special event titled " The world 's greatest publicity stunt " . To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009 , Glava AS made the original documentary of the expedition available online . They also released a newly recorded interview with Sivert Klevan , who by that time was 84 years old . 
 = H. C. McNeile = 
 Herman Cyril McNeile , MC ( 28 September 1888 – 14 August 1937 ) , commonly known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper , was a British soldier and author . Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War , he started writing short stories and getting them published in the Daily Mail . As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names , he was given the pen name " Sapper " by Lord Northcliffe , the owner of the Daily Mail ; the nickname was based on that of his corps , the Royal Engineers . 
 After the war McNeile left the army and continued writing , although he changed from war stories to thrillers . In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond , whose eponymous hero became his best @-@ known creation . The character was based on McNeile himself , on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally . McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels , as well as three plays and a screenplay . 
 McNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other novels and story collections that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works , Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish . He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the inter @-@ war period before his death in 1937 from throat cancer , which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war . 
 McNeile 's stories are either directly about the war , or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it . His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories , with upper class Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it . Although he was seen at the time as " simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen " , after the Second World War his work was criticised as having fascist overtones , while also displaying the xenophobia and anti @-@ semitism apparent in some other writers of the period .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 McNeile was born in Bodmin , Cornwall . He was the son of Malcolm McNeile , a captain in the Royal Navy who at the time was governor of the naval prison at Bodmin , and Christiana Mary ( née <unk> ) . The McNeile family had ancestral roots from both Belfast and Scotland , and counted a general in the British Indian Army among their members . 
 McNeile did not like either of his given names but preferred to be called Cyril , although he was always known by his friends as Mac . After attending a prep school in Eastbourne , he was further educated at Cheltenham College . On leaving the college , he joined the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , from which he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in July 1907 . He underwent further training at the Royal School of Military Engineering before a short posting to Aldershot Garrison . He received promotion to lieutenant in June 1910 and was posted to Canterbury , serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop , until January 1914 , when he was posted to Malta . 
 In 1914 McNeile was promoted to the rank of captain . He was still in Malta when the war broke out and was ordered to France in October 1914 ; he travelled via England and married Violet Evelyn Baird on 31 October 1914 . Baird was the daughter of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Arthur Baird Douglas of the Cameron Highlanders . 
 = = = First World War service = = = 
 On 2 November 1914 McNeile travelled to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force . Few details are known about McNeile 's wartime service , as his records were destroyed by incendiary bombs during the Second World War . He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front , including 1st Field Squadron RE , 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the 33rd Division . 
 McNeile 's first known published story , Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy , was serialised on page four of the Daily Mail from 13 January 1915 . As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names except during their half @-@ pay sabbaticals , many would write under a pseudonym ; Lord Northcliffe , the owner of the Daily Mail , gave McNeile the pen name " Sapper " , as the Royal Engineers were commonly known as the Sappers . McNeile later confided that he had started writing through " sheer boredom " . Some of his stories appeared on page four of the Daily Mail over the following months . Northcliffe was impressed by his writing and attempted , but failed , to have him released from the army to work as a war correspondent . By the end of 1915 , he had written two collections of short stories , The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy , R.E. , both of which were published by Hodder & Stoughton . Although many of the stories had already appeared in the Daily Mail , between 1916 and 1918 Sergeant Michael Cassidy , R.E. sold 135 @,@ 000 copies and The Lieutenant and Others sold 139 @,@ 000 copies . By the end of the war he had published three more collections , Men , Women , and Guns ( 1916 ) , No Man 's Land ( 1917 ) and The Human Touch ( 1918 ) . In 1916 he wrote a series of articles titled The Making of an Officer , which appeared under the initials C. N. , in five issues of The Times between 8 and 14 June 1916 . The articles were aimed at young and new officers to explain their duties to them ; these were collected together and published by Hodder & Stoughton later in 1916 . 
 During his time with the Royal Engineers , McNeile saw action at the First and Second Battles of Ypres — he was gassed at the second battle — and the Battle of the Somme . In 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross and was mentioned in dispatches ; in November that year he was gazetted to acting major . From 1 April to 5 October 1918 , he commanded a battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and was promoted to acting lieutenant @-@ colonel ; the scholar Lawrence Treadwell observes that " for an engineer to command an infantry regiment was ... a rarity " . 18th Battalion , Middlesex Regiment under McNeile saw action for the remainder of his command , and were involved in fighting during the Hundred Days Offensive in the St. Quentin @-@ Cambrai sector in September 1918 ; during the year , he was again mentioned in dispatches . On 2 October 1918 he broke his ankle and was briefly hospitalised , which forced him to relinquish his command of the regiment on 4 October . He was on convalescent leave when the war ended in November 1918 . During the course of the war , he had spent a total of 32 months in France , and had probably been gassed more than once . His literary output from 1915 to 1918 accounted for more than 80 collected and uncollected stories . His brother — also in the Royal Engineers — had been killed earlier in the war . 
 = = = Post @-@ war years = = = 
 McNeile had a quiet life after the war ; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that " as in the novels of fellow best @-@ selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie , it is the hero who lives the exciting life " . Although he was an " unremittingly hearty man " , he suffered from delicate health following the war . He had a loud voice and a louder laugh , and " liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship " ; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as " not everybody 's cup of tea " , and commented that " he was loud in every possible way — in his voice , in his laugh , in his clothes , in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself , in his whole approach to life " . McNeile and his wife had two sons . 
 On 13 June 1919 McNeile retired onto the reserve officer list and was confirmed in the rank of major . The same year he also published a short @-@ story collection , Mufti , in which he introduced a type of character as " the Breed " , a class of Englishman who was patriotic , loyal and " physically and morally intrepid " . Although well received by the critics , the book failed commercially and , by the end of 1922 , had only sold 16 @,@ 700 copies from its first print run of 20 @,@ 000 ; the unsold copies were pulped and the novel went out of print later that year . 
 In 1920 McNeile published Bull @-@ Dog Drummond , whose eponymous hero — a member of " the Breed " — became his most famous creation . He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine , but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel , which was a thriller . Captain Hugh " Bulldog " Drummond DSO , MC was described in the novel 's sub @-@ title as " a demobilised officer who found peace dull " after service during the First World War with the fictional <unk> Regiment . Drummond went on to appear in ten full @-@ length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie . The character was an amalgam of Fairlie , himself , and his idea of an English gentleman . Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes , Sexton Blake , Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel . Drummond was characterised as large , very strong , physically unattractive and an " apparently brainless hunk of a man " , who was also a gentleman with a private income ; he could also be construed as " a brutalized ex @-@ officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [ sic ] the war " . The character was later described by Cecil Day @-@ Lewis as an " unspeakable public school bully " . Drummond 's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson , a master criminal with no national allegiance , who is often accompanied by his wife , Irma . Irma is described by Jonathon Green as " the slinky epitome of a twenties ' vamp ' " , and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark , sexy and from an oriental background , " a true femme fatale " . After Carl Peterson 's death in The Final Count , Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife — whom he had met in Bull @-@ Dog Drummond — with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase . Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile 's books , and in a further five by Fairlie . 
 McNeile adapted Bulldog Drummond for the stage . It was shown at Wyndham 's Theatre during the 1921 – 22 season , with Gerald du Maurier playing the title role ; it ran for 428 performances . The play also ran in New York during the same season , with A. E. Matthews as Drummond . Later in 1922 McNeile resigned his reserve commission with the rank of lieutenant @-@ colonel , and moved as a tax exile to <unk> , Montreux , Switzerland , with his wife ; the Swiss countryside was later described in a number of his stories . 
 The following year McNeile introduced the character of Jim Maitland , a " footloose sahib of the period " . Maitland was the protagonist of the 1923 novel Jim Maitland ; he later appeared in a second novel in 1931 , The Island of Terror . Around the time McNeile killed off the Carl Peterson character in The Final Count ( 1926 ) , he also introduced the character Ronald Standish , who first appeared in " The Saving Clause " ( 1927 ) and " Tiny Carteret " ( 1930 ) before becoming the protagonist in two collections of short stories , Ronald Standish ( 1933 ) and Ask for Ronald Standish ( 1936 ) . The character also appeared in the final three Drummond novels , Knock @-@ Out ( 1933 ) , Bull @-@ Dog Drummond at Bay ( 1935 ) and Challenge ( 1937 ) . Standish was a sportsman who played cricket for England and was a part @-@ time consultant with the War Office . 
 In 1929 McNeile edited a volume of short stories from O. Henry , The Best of O. Henry ; the stories had served as models for him when he had started as a writer . The same year , the film Bulldog Drummond was released , starring Ronald Colman in the title role . Colman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony . The film earned $ 750 @,@ 000 at the box office , and McNeile received an estimated £ 5 @,@ 000 for the rights to his novel . The same year he wrote his second play — The Way Out — which was staged at the Comedy Theatre in January 1930 . About a year later he and his wife returned to England , and settled near Pulborough , West Sussex . 
 In 1935 McNeile , Fairlie , Sidney Gilliat and <unk> Orton collaborated on the screenplay Bulldog Jack , a " comedy thriller " with Jack Hulbert and Fay Wray , which was produced by Gaumont British . 
 = = = Death and legacy = = = 
 In 1937 McNeile was working with Fairlie on the play Bulldog Drummond Hits Out when he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer . He came to an agreement with Fairlie for the play to continue after his death and for Fairlie to continue writing the Drummond stories . McNeile died on 14 August 1937 at his home in West Chiltington , West Sussex . Although most sources identify throat cancer as the cause of death , Treadwell also suggests that it may have been lung cancer . It was " traceable to his war service " , and attributed to a gas attack . His funeral , with full military honours , was conducted at Woking crematorium . At his death his estate was valued at over £ 26 @,@ 000 . 
 Bulldog Drummond Hits Out was finished by Fairlie and had a short tour of Brighton , Birmingham , Manchester and Edinburgh , before opening in London at the Savoy Theatre on 21 December 1937 . The story was later turned into a novel by Fairlie , with the title Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor . Fairlie continued to write Drummond novels , seven in total . 
 Drummond , McNeile 's chief literary legacy , became a model for other literary heroes created in the 1940s and ' 50s . W. E. Johns used McNeile 's work as a model for his character Biggles , while Ian Fleming admitted that James Bond was " Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below " . Sydney <unk> 's popular character " Tiger " Standish was also modelled on Drummond . 
 = = Writing = = 
 McNeile 's works fall into two distinct phases . Those works published between 1915 and 1918 are his war stories , and relate directly to his experiences during the First World War , while the later works are largely thrillers . His war stories were marketed by the Daily Mail and Hodder & Stoughton as a soldier 's eyewitness accounts . When he started writing thrillers , Hodder & Stoughton advertised McNeile as a " light and entertaining " writer , and began publishing his works in the " Yellow Jacket " series . 
 = = = Style and technique = = = 
 McNeile 's early works , the war stories published before 1919 , are either " plot @-@ driven adventure narrative [ s ] " , such as the short stories " The Song of the Bayonet " and " Private Meyrick , Company Idiot " , or " atmospheric vignette [ s ] " , such as " The Land of Topsy Turvy " and " The Human Touch " . McNeile would write about 1 @,@ 000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed ; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re @-@ writes until he completed his work . The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having " little aesthetic merit , being stylised , clichéd and often repetitive " ; Richard Usborne agreed , adding that the female characters were " cardboard " and that McNeile was " wonderfully forgetful " about characters dead in one book and alive in the next . In the Bulldog Drummond stories , Watson identifies the central character as " a melodramatic creation , workable only within a setting of melodrama " . The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique , credible or well @-@ rounded , his books " make no claim to literary excellence " , and are instead , " good , solid thrillers " . Usborne agrees , and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told . Meyer classifies the non @-@ war stories as middlebrow , with " sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England " . His early novels , particularly Bull @-@ Dog Drummond and The Black Gang , were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories . The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile 's lack of experience and self @-@ confidence , noting that in his later novels , McNeile " mastered the tricks of his trade " . 
 DelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers , such as " filthy , murdering Boche " , and " stinking , cowardly Bolshevik " . She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy , comparing them to animals and vermin . Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word " devil " — and variations — when discussing antagonists . 
 = = = Major themes = = = 
 = = = = First World War = = = = 
 The major theme running throughout McNeile 's works is the First World War . Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war , while his post @-@ war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories , as " both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake " . His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti @-@ sentimental , realistic depictions of the trenches , and as a " celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles " . McNeile 's view , as expressed through his writing , was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals , even if that purpose was later wasted : a " valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered " . The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in The Making of an Officer , his series of articles in The Times , in which he wrote about " the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to ' inspire ' subalterns " , a theme he returned to in his war stories — particularly The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy , <unk> — and then afterwards in his fictional stories , notably the Bulldog Drummond works . 
 McNeile 's fictional work — particularly his Drummond series of books — shows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it ; Jaillant comments that Drummond 's war @-@ time experience " has shaped his social identity , his skills , and even his physical appearance " . The Drummond character has been " brutalized by war " , which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others . 
 = = = = England = = = = 
 McNeile provided Drummond with a " flamboyantly aggressive patriotism " towards England , which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality . Hans Bertens argued that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes , of which Drummond was a member . Drummond 's nickname — Bulldog — is symbolic of England , and he and his English gentlemen friends — " the Breed " — fight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England 's stability . McNeile 's thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters ; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains . 
 = = = = Sport = = = = 
 Running throughout McNeile 's books is the metaphor of warfare as sport . His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif : in Sergeant Michael Cassidy , R.E. , he writes , " To bag a man with a gun is one thing ; there is sport — there is an element of one against one , like when the quality goes big game shooting . But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all , even if they are Germans " . The motif was continued into the Drummond novels . McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports , or of boxing , poker or hunting . The titles of his books also use sporting imagery : The Third Round , The Final Count , Knock @-@ Out and Challenge . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 McNeile 's war story collections sold well ; nearly 50 @,@ 000 copies of his first book , Sergeant Michael Cassidy , R.E. , were purchased in its first year , and nearly 58 @,@ 000 copies the following year . His thrillers were also popular , with Bulldog Drummond selling 396 @,@ 302 copies between 1920 and 1939 , exceeding the 100 @,@ 000 @-@ copies benchmark for " best @-@ sellers " . At his peak in the 1920s , he was the highest paid short story writer in the world , and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £ 10 @,@ 000 a year ; the Daily Mirror estimated that during his writing career he had earned £ 85 @,@ 000 . 
 McNeile 's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war , with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter . Reviewing Men , Women , and Guns for The Times Literary Supplement , Francis Henry Gribble wrote that " Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories ... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value , his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination . " The reviewer of Sergeant Michael Cassidy , R.E. for The Atlanta Constitution reminded its readers that McNeile " has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army . " Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers , with the concurrent re @-@ positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton , the reviewers also treated him differently , and presented him as " a writer of thrillers , without any pretension to literary seriousness " . When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times , the critic observed that " if you like a good knock @-@ down @-@ and @-@ drag @-@ out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page , you can 't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond " ; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay , the reviewer considered that " as a piece of fictional melodrama , the book is first rate " . In the British market , The Times Literary Supplement also characterised him as a mass @-@ market thriller writer , which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works . 
 = = = = Controversy = = = = 
 From the 1950s on , McNeile 's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War , and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were " carrying the Führer @-@ principle " . DelFattore agrees , and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel — The Black Gang ( 1922 ) — is when the fascist element was introduced . Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War , while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories , McNeile was seen at the time as " simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen " . 
 Throughout the Drummond stories , much of the language used by McNeile relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be " intensely conservative by modern standards " ; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers , such as Agatha Christie , " exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti @-@ semitism of the period , McNeile 's go far beyond the ' polite ' norms " . J. D. Bourn considers his language to be " rather distasteful " , while the academic Michael Denning observed that " Drummond is a bundle of <unk> , hating Jews , Germans , and most other foreigners " .

 M @-@ 76 is a former state trunkline highway designation in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . The highway 's designation was decommissioned when the last section of it was converted to freeway as a part of the present @-@ day Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) . At that time , M @-@ 76 extended from US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) near Standish northwesterly to I @-@ 75 south of Grayling . Two sections of the route followed freeways with a two @-@ lane highway in between to connect them . The former routing of M @-@ 76 through West Branch before that city was bypassed was initially redesignated Business M @-@ 76 ( Bus . M @-@ 76 ) . The highway itself ran through mixed fields and forests bypassing several other towns in the region . 
 First designated by 1919 , M @-@ 76 initially terminated at Roscommon . It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s . A second , disconnected , segment was added to the highway in the 1930s . By the early 1940s , both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska – Grayling were added to M @-@ 72 . M @-@ 76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s . When the last segment was completed , the number was removed from the highway , and the freeway was added to I @-@ 75 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 At the time the M @-@ 76 designation was decommissioned in 1973 , most of the overall highway had been converted to freeway . It started southwest of Standish at an interchange with US 23 in southern Arenac County . The freeway ran northward through fields to a junction with M @-@ 61 where it turned northwesterly . M @-@ 76 passed to the southwest of Sterling and over a tributary of the Tittabawassee River as the freeway approaches Alger through a forested area . In Ogemaw County , the trunkline ran south and west of Greenwood and continued to the West Branch area . There , M @-@ 76 met the southeastern end of its business loop that ran north into downtown . The freeway bypassed the town to the southwest , passed over M @-@ 30 without an interchange and then met the northwestern end of the business loop . While M @-@ 76 was still an active highway designation , this second business loop junction marked the end of the freeway in the area . M @-@ 76 turned west , merging onto M @-@ 55 to run concurrently along a two @-@ lane highway . 
 M @-@ 55 / M @-@ 76 ran west into Roscommon County along West Branch Road . The two highways separated at a junction with St. Helen Road where M @-@ 76 turned due north toward St. Helen . South of town , the highway met county road F @-@ 97 at a junction with Artesia Beach Road . The two roads ran concurrently into town along the east end of Lake St. Helen . Near the airport in town , M @-@ 76 turned back northwesterly along Washington Street , parting from F @-@ 97 in the process . The highway ran along the northeastern shore of Lake St. Helen and near Mud Lake as it continued toward Roscommon . As it entered that town , the trunkline passed the Roscommon Conservation Airport and followed Elm Street on a northwest track through the middle of the village . M @-@ 18 joined M @-@ 76 in the center of town , and the two turned parallel to the Roscommon – Crawford county line on Federal Highway . Northeast of Higgins Lake , the highway transitioned to a freeway ; that freeway ran northwest into Crawford County . M @-@ 18 / M @-@ 76 terminated at a junction south of Grayling with US 27 . This partial interchange marked the point where I @-@ 75 resumed its course north through the state . Traffic could not directly access southbound US 27 from northbound M @-@ 76 and northbound US 27 could not access southbound M @-@ 76 .

 On July 1 , 1919 , the initial routing of M @-@ 76 connected Standish with Roscommon via a circuitous path through Sterling , Alger , West Branch , and St. Helen . By 1927 , M @-@ 76 was extended north to Grayling and west to Kalkaska . Before the construction of its later routing along the present @-@ day Lake State Railway between St. Helen and Roscommon , the route of M @-@ 76 followed present @-@ day Saint Helen Road ( present @-@ day F @-@ 97 ) , then Au Sable , Keno , and Silsby roads ; at the Crawford @-@ Roscommon county line , it then followed present @-@ day M @-@ 18 westerly into Roscommon . A short non @-@ contiguous segment of M @-@ 76 opened near Empire , extending eastward to County Road 669 in 1934 . In late 1940 or early 1941 , M @-@ 76 was truncated to Roscommon ; all of M @-@ 76 from Grayling to Kalkaska and the segment near Empire was redesignated as M @-@ 72 . 
 Beginning in 1958 , I @-@ 75 in Michigan was constructed in several discontinuous segments . M @-@ 76 was to become one of the portions incorporated into the route of I @-@ 75 . Although other portions of I @-@ 75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments , the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M @-@ 76 and the entire stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I @-@ 75 . This was done while a temporary connecting To I @-@ 75 designation between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US 10 and US 127 . 
 Starting in 1968 through the early 1970s , M @-@ 76 was rebuilt to Interstate standards in stages . The first freeway segment completed was a 17 @-@ mile ( 27 km ) stretch in Arenac County from US 23 just southwest of Standish to Alger . In 1970 , two more segments of the M @-@ 76 freeway were completed : from Alger to just south of West Branch and about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of freeway from the southern end of a completed segment of I @-@ 75 south of Grayling to just west of Roscommon . In 1971 , both the northern and southern sections of the M @-@ 76 freeway were extended : on the south , around the west side of West Branch to M @-@ 55 , or from present @-@ day exits 212 to 215 ; and on the north , on the west side of Roscommon , from present @-@ day exits 244 to 239 . In 1973 , the final 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) segment of M @-@ 76 freeway was completed . However , the entire M @-@ 76 designation was decommissioned and that segment of freeway opened as I @-@ 75 . This was the final segment of I @-@ 75 to be completed in the State of Michigan . 
 As segments of the freeway were completed , the former portions of M @-@ 76 were turned over to local control , except for portions near Roscommon and West Branch , which became parts of Business Loop I @-@ 75 designations . There are several places where these old portions are referred to as " Old 76 " . The route from southeast of West Branch to the Ogemaw County line was designated as county road F @-@ 9 , and a portion through the community of St. Helen is part of F @-@ 97 . The segment of old M @-@ 55 / M @-@ 76 is an unsigned state highway .

 Business M @-@ 76 ( Bus . M @-@ 76 ) was a business loop running through West Branch that is now called Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) . The highway used a portion of the former M @-@ 76 and the current M @-@ 55 . The southernmost portion from the Cook Road interchange at I @-@ 75 to OLD M @-@ 76 ( Alger Road ) was built as a new roadway in 1970 . This section was built when the I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 76 freeway was completed as far north as Cook Road . This new roadway allowed M @-@ 76 to connect to its former alignment south of West Branch in 1970 . The next year , the I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 76 freeway was completed to the current interchange with M @-@ 55 west of town . The former routing of M @-@ 76 along Cook Road , Alger Road and M @-@ 55 was redesignated as Bus . M @-@ 76 . When the last section of I @-@ 75 was completed in 1973 , connecting the end of the freeway at M @-@ 55 with the other end at M @-@ 18 near Roscommon , M @-@ 76 was completely decommissioned , and Bus .

Although he owed his rise to high state offices to the patronage of John VI Kantakouzenos ( r . 1347 – 1354 ) , he became , together with Patriarch John XIV Kalekas , one of the leaders of the faction supporting Emperor John V in the civil war of 1341 – 1347 against his one @-@ time benefactor . Apokaukos died when he was lynched by political prisoners during an inspection of a new prison .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Alexios was of humble origin , and was born in the late 13th century somewhere in Bithynia . He nevertheless studied under the scholar Theodore <unk> , and became a tax official . By 1320 he was director of the salt pans , from which he later advanced to the position of domestikos of the themes of the West . He rose in the bureaucratic hierarchy until , in 1321 , he was appointed the imperial <unk> ( chamberlain ) . His position made him useful to John Kantakouzenos , who included him in a conspiracy , together with Syrgiannes Palaiologos and the prōtostratōr Theodore Synadenos , which aimed to depose the aging Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in favour of his grandson Andronikos III . Under the threat of war , the Emperor surrendered Thrace and some districts in Macedonia to the rule of his grandson . When Andronikos III became sole emperor in 1328 , his close friend Kantakouzenos became his chief minister , and Alexios was awarded with the positions that Kantakouzenos himself had formerly held : head of the imperial secretariat ( <unk> ) and in charge of the state 's finances . These positions allowed him to amass a considerable personal fortune , which he used to construct a personal refuge , a fortified tower @-@ house at the site of Epibatai near Selymbria , at the coast of the Sea of Marmara . In early 1341 , shortly before Andronikos 's death , he was rewarded with the high office of megas doux , giving him the high command over the Byzantine navy . He re @-@ equipped the fleet , paying from his own pocket 100 @,@ 000 hyperpyra . 
 = = = Civil war = = = 
 Upon Andronikos 's death , two factions emerged at court : the supporters of Kantakouzenos , chiefly provincial magnates from Macedonia and Thrace , and those opposed to him , led mainly by the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas , who obtained the support of Andronikos 's widow , Anna of Savoy . Kantakouzenos did not claim the throne for himself , but demanded the regency , based on his close association with the deceased emperor , and with the support of the capital 's troops secured it . His position , however , was weakened by the adherence of Apokaukos to the Patriarch 's camp ; Kantakouzenos , in his own account , relates that Apokaukos had urged him to seize the throne in hopes of his own advancement , and when he refused , the powerful chancellor switched over to his opponents ' camp . As soon as Kantakouzenos left Constantinople in July 1341 to campaign against the Empire 's enemies who were assaulting it , Apokaukos made his first moves . Although as commander of the fleet it was his duty to guard the Dardanelles against any attempt by Turks to cross into Europe , he deliberately allowed this to happen in order to cause disruption in Thrace . Apokaukos also tried to kidnap the young John V , but failed and was forced to flee to his house at Epibatai . However , when Kantakouzenos returned victorious to the capital , instead of depriving Apokaukos of his offices , and against the counsel of his friends , he pardoned his protégé . Apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to Kantakouzenos , who allowed him to resume his offices and return to Constantinople , while Kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign . 
 Once back in the city , however , the Patriarch and Apokaukos seized power . Kantakouzenos 's family and friends were imprisoned ( Kantakouzenos 's mother Theodora would eventually die in prison ) , the Patriarch was declared regent , while Anna named Apokaukos as urban prefect ( <unk> ) of Constantinople . 
 Kantakouzenos responded by having himself declared emperor at Didymoteicho in October 1341 , while his opponents followed with the coronation of John V in November . The two coronations finalized the split , and ushered in a civil war that would embroil the Byzantine Empire and all of its neighbours until 1347 with Kantakouzenos 's victory . In its course , it would devastate the remaining imperial possessions , and create a deep rift in Byzantine society : the aristocracy and the propertied classes generally supported Kantakouzenos , while the lower and middle classes , primarily urban , as well as the merchants and sailors , supported Apokaukos and the regency . This gave the dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones : during the war , the excessive wealth and perceived indifference of Kantakouzenos and the aristocracy towards the common people became a standard fixture of Apokaukos 's propaganda . In addition , the conflict acquired religious significance as well : the <unk> controversy divided the pious Byzantines , and , despite some important exceptions , the supporters of Hesychasm also supported Kantakouzenos . 
 A few days after Kantakouzenos 's coronation , the inhabitants of Adrianople rebelled against the aristocracy and declared themselves for the regency , with Apokaukos sending his younger son Manuel to become the city 's governor . In a similar development in 1342 , Thessalonica , the Empire 's second @-@ largest city , was seized by a group known as the " Zealots " . Their anti @-@ aristocratic beliefs made them enemies of " Kantakouzenism " , and earned them the support of the regency . Apokaukos himself arrived with a fleet of 70 ships to aid them , and appointed his elder son John Apokaukos as the city 's governor , although the latter 's authority would remain only nominal . 
 In the first years of the war , the tide was in favour of the regency , until , in the summer of 1342 , Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia . However , from 1343 onwards , with the aid of his friend , Umur Beg of Aydin , Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation . With the initial support of Stefan Dušan , Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia , and despite his failure to take Thessalonica , his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace . Gradually , Apokaukos 's supporters abandoned him , including his son Manuel , who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp . 
 In early 1345 , Apokaukos and Kalekas rejected offers of reconciliation conveyed by two Franciscan monks . Trying to bolster his waning power , Apokaukos began a series of proscriptions in the capital , and even ordered a new prison constructed for political prisoners . On 11 June 1345 , Apokaukos suddenly decided to inspect the new prison , without being escorted by his bodyguard . The prisoners immediately rose up and lynched him , and his head was severed and stuck on a pole . The prisoners believed that by getting rid of the hated Apokaukos , they would be rewarded by the Empress Anna . She , however , was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister , that she gave Apokaukos 's supporters , who were joined by the Gasmouloi , the fleet 's marines , free rein to avenge their leader 's death . As a result , all prisoners , some 200 in total , were massacred , even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery . Although the death of Apokaukos did not bring about the immediate collapse of the regency , it removed the main instigator of the civil war and one of its chief protagonists , and resulted in dissension and defections in the regency 's camp . As such , it marked the beginning of the war 's end , which would come with Kantakouzenos 's entry into Constantinople on 3 February 1347 . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Alexios Apokaukos had two brothers , John and Nikephoros , of whom very little is known . Alexios himself married twice . His first wife was the daughter of a priest of the Hagia Sophia called <unk> , and the second , whom he married sometime around 1341 , the cousin of the megas <unk> Georgios <unk> . His first marriage produced three children and his second two : 
 John Apokaukos , megas <unk> and governor of Thessalonica , killed there in 1345 . 
 Manuel Apokaukos , governor of Adrianople , defected to Kantakouzenos in 1344 . 
 Unnamed daughter , who married first the prōtostratōr Andronikos Palaiologos . After he drowned in 1344 , she remarried the <unk> John Asan . 
 Unnamed daughter , married ( in 1341 ) the son of Patriarch John Kalekas . 
 Unnamed daughter , married ( in 1341 ) the son of one of Empress Anna 's Latin maids . 
 One of his sons married a daughter of John Vatatzes . 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 As a self @-@ made " new man " , Apokaukos was mistrusted by the scions of the aristocratic families who dominated the imperial government . The only accounts of the period of the civil war , Kantakouzenos 's memoirs and the history of Nikephoros Gregoras , with their pro @-@ aristocracy bias , paint a very negative picture of the man , which has been adopted virtually unaltered by most modern historians as well . In a dissenting view , the historian Eva de Vries @-@ Van der Velden believes that the image of Apokaukos as the ungrateful protégé of Kantakouzenos and an inveterate schemer who was responsible for the outbreak of the civil war is inaccurate , and largely the result of distorting propaganda by Kantakouzenos and Gregoras . However , she acknowledges Apokaukos as Kantakouzenos 's " most redoubtable adversary " during the war , and the dictatorial nature of his regime after 1343 . According to the historian Angeliki Laiou , Apokaukos can also be seen as the exponent of a radical change in the nature and direction of the Byzantine state : in place of the old , agricultural empire , run by a land @-@ based aristocracy , he seems to have favoured a commercial , maritime and likely westward @-@ looking state , in emulation of the Italian maritime republics . 
 = Unbreakable ( film ) = 
 Unbreakable is a 2000 American superhero thriller film written , produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan , and stars Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson . The film tells the story of Philadelphia security guard David Dunn , who slowly discovers that he possesses superhuman powers . 
 Shyamalan organized the narrative of Unbreakable to parallel a comic book 's traditional three @-@ part story structure . After settling on the origin story , Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative script with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price . Filming for Unbreakable began in April 2000 and was completed by July . 
 Unbreakable received generally positive reviews , praising its aesthetics , the acting performances and particularly the musical score by James Newton Howard . The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following . Many regard it as one of Shyamalan 's best films , and Time listed the film as one of the top ten superhero movies of all time . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Philadelphia in 1961 , Elijah Price ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta , a rare disease that renders sufferers ' bones extremely fragile and prone to fracture . As revealed later in flashbacks , Elijah — who grows up to become a comic @-@ book art dealer — develops a theory , based on the comics he has read during his many hospital stays , that if he represents extreme human frailty , there must be someone " unbreakable " at the opposite extreme . 
 Years later , another Philadelphia man , security guard David Dunn ( Bruce Willis ) , is also searching for meaning in his life . He had given up a promising football career during his collegiate days to marry Audrey ( Robin Wright ) after they were involved in an auto accident . Now , however , their marriage is dissolving , to the distress of their young son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark ) . 
 As he returns home from a job interview in New York City , David 's train crashes , killing the other 131 passengers , while he is the only survivor , sustaining no injuries . At the memorial for the crash 's victims , he finds a card on his car 's windshield , inviting him to Elijah 's store . Elijah proposes to David that he is the kind of person after whom comic @-@ book superheroes are modeled , and repeatedly pursues the issue with David and Audrey , trying to learn if David had ever been ill or injured during childhood . Although Elijah unsettles him , David begins to test himself . While lifting weights with Joseph , he bench presses 350 pounds , well above what he had thought he could do . Joseph begins to idolize his father and believes he is a superhero , although David still maintains he is " an ordinary man . " 
 David challenges Elijah with an incident from his childhood when he almost drowned . Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness ; he contends David 's might be water . While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived , David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career , remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car in order to save Audrey . David used the accident as an excuse to quit football , because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport . 
 Under Elijah 's influence , David develops what he thought was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him . At Elijah 's suggestion , David stands in the middle of a crowd in Philadelphia 's 30th Street Station . As various people bump into him , he senses the crimes they perpetrated , such as theft and rape , and finds one he can act on : a sadistic janitor who invaded a family home , killed the parents , and is holding the children captive . 
 David follows the janitor to the victims ' house and frees the children , but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool . David nearly drowns ( since he cannot swim ) , but the children rescue him . He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured . That night , he and Audrey reconcile . The following morning , he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act , featuring a sketch of David in his rain poncho , to his son , who recognizes the hero as his father . 
 David attends an exhibition at Elijah 's comic book art gallery and meets Elijah 's mother ( <unk> Woodard ) , who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength versus those who use their intelligence . Elijah brings David to the back room of his studio , extends his hand , and asks David to shake it . Upon doing so , David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters , including David 's recent train accident , causing hundreds of deaths . David is horrified , but Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find him . Calling himself " Mr. Glass " ( a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up ) , he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David 's hero . 
 Screen captions reveal that David reported Elijah 's actions to the police , and that Elijah was convicted of murder and terrorism and committed to an institution for the criminally insane .

 When M. Night Shyamalan conceived the idea for Unbreakable , the outline had a comic book 's traditional three @-@ part structure ( the superhero 's " birth " , his struggles against general evil @-@ doers , and the hero 's ultimate battle against the " archenemy " ) . Finding the birth section most interesting , he decided to write Unbreakable as an origin story . During the filming of The Sixth Sense , Shyamalan had already approached Bruce Willis for the lead role of David Dunn . With Willis and Samuel L. Jackson specifically in mind for the two leading characters , Shyamalan began to write Unbreakable as a spec script during post @-@ production on The Sixth Sense . 
 With the financial and critical success of The Sixth Sense in August 1999 , Shyamalan gave Walt Disney Studios a first look deal for Unbreakable . In return , Disney purchased Shyamalan 's screenplay at a " spec script record " for $ 5 million . He was also given another $ 5 million to direct . Disney decided to release Unbreakable under their Touchstone banner , and also helped Shyamalan establish his own production company , Blinding Edge Pictures . Julianne Moore dropped out of portraying Audrey , David 's wife , in favor of her role as Clarice Starling in Hannibal . Robin Wright Penn was cast in her place . Principal photography began on April 25 , 2000 and ended that July . The majority of filming took place in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , the film 's setting . 
 Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several camera angles to simulate the look of a comic book panel . Various visual narrative motifs were also applied . Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass . As a newborn , he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors , and as a young child , he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen . When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn 's car , he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery . Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing . Using purple as Mr. Glass ' color to David Dunn 's green was also Jackson 's idea . Mr. Glass ' wig was modeled after Afro @-@ American statesman Frederick Douglass . As he does in his other films , Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance . He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium . More than 15 minutes of footage was deleted during post @-@ production of Unbreakable . These scenes are available on the DVD release . 
 Willis and Jackson had previously worked together on Die Hard with a Vengeance , Pulp Fiction and Loaded Weapon 1 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Film score composer James Newton Howard was approached by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense . " He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me " , Howard said . " I 've never had a director do that for me . " Shyamalan wanted a " singularity " tone for the music . " He wanted something that was very different , very distinctive , that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it , " Howard explained . Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score , and minimized the number of instruments ( strings , trumpets and piano ) , with limited orchestrations . Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London . " You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles , and it would have been great , but there is something about the sound of that church studio , " Howard remarked . " It 's definitely more misterioso . " 
 = = Comic book references = = 
 Filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith felt Unbreakable was briefly similar to a comic book titled Mage : The Hero Discovered . Written and illustrated by Matt Wagner , Mage follows a wizard who convinces an Average Joe to try to find out if he is a superhero . Both Unbreakable and Mage are set in Philadelphia . Elvis Mitchell from The New York Times mentioned the visual similarities between David Dunn on patrol in his poncho and the DC Comics character known as The Spectre . 
 As in comic books , the main characters have their identified color schemes and aliases . David 's are green and " Security " or " Hero " , while Elijah 's are purple and " Mr. Glass " . The colors show up in their clothes , the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses , Elijah 's note to David , and various personal items . The people whose bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single bright color ( red , orange ) , to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical of the rest of the movie ( but not of most comic books ) . Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways , as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books .

 Unbreakable received mostly positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 68 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 161 reviews with an average score of 6 @.@ 2 out of 10 . The consensus states " With a weaker ending , Unbreakable is not as a good as The Sixth Sense . However , it is a quietly suspenseful film that intrigues and engages , taking the audience through unpredictable twists and turns along the way . " The film also has a score of 62 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 critics indicating Generally favorable reviews . 
 Roger Ebert largely enjoyed the film , but was disappointed with the ending . Ebert believed that Willis ' " subtle acting " was positively different from the actor 's usual work in " brainless action movies " . Richard Corliss of Time magazine reviewed that Unbreakable continued Shyamalan 's writing / direction of " balancing sophistication and horror in all of his movies " . Desson Thomson from The Washington Post wrote that " just as he did in The Sixth Sense , writer @-@ director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth , an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses . In this case , it 's the mythological world and , in these modern times , the secret design to that labyrinth , the key to the path , is contained in comic books . " 
 Kenneth Turan , writing in the Los Angeles Times , gave a negative review , arguing that Unbreakable had no originality . " Whether it means to or not , the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable , " Turan reasoned . " If The Sixth Sense hadn 't been as big a success as it was , this story might have been assigned to oblivion , or at least to rewrite . " Todd McCarthy of Variety mostly criticized Shyamalan 's writing and the performances given by the actors . He did praise Dylan Tichenor 's editing and James Newton Howard 's music composition . 
 Shyamalan admitted he was disappointed by the reaction Unbreakable received from the public and critics . Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures ' marketing campaign . He wanted to promote Unbreakable as a comic book movie , but Touchstone insisted on portraying it as a psychological thriller , similar to The Sixth Sense . 
 In 2009 , Oscar @-@ winning filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Unbreakable , and included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992 , the year he became a director . Tarantino praised the film as a " brilliant retelling of the Superman mythology " , and said it contains what he considers to be Bruce Willis ' best performance . He also criticized the way the film was marketed upon release , stating he felt that it would have been far more effective if the film 's advertising simply posed the question of " what if Superman was here on earth , and didn 't know he was Superman ? " In 2011 , Time ranked the film at # 4 in its list of top ten superhero movies of all time , describing it as one of the best superhero origin stories and as a " relatively quiet , subtle and realistic look at the pressures that come with being a superhero .

 After the film 's release , rumors of possible sequels began circulating in different interviews and in film fansites . In 2000 , Bruce Willis was quoted as hoping for an Unbreakable trilogy . In December 2000 , Shyamalan denied rumors he wrote Unbreakable as the first installment of a trilogy , saying he was not even thinking about it . In August 2001 , Shyamalan stated that , because of successful DVD sales , he had approached Touchstone Pictures about an Unbreakable sequel , an idea Shyamalan said the studio originally turned down because of the film 's poor box office performance . In a September 2008 article , Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made , but that it mostly died with the poor box office . Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non @-@ committal . In February 2010 , Willis said that Shyamalan was " still thinking about doing the fight movie between me and Sam that we were going to do " , and stated that as long as Jackson was able to participate he would be " up for it " . In September 2010 , Shyamalan revealed that the second planned villain from the first film was moved to the planned sequel , but that character has now been used for an upcoming film that he will write and produce .

It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London , England . Cowell originally came up with the idea to base a song around the Christian poem " Footprints " , and asked Kreuger and Magnusson whether they could write something dealing with this subject . They accepted the idea for co @-@ writing and had scheduled session in Page 's home in Malibu , California , succeeding to finish the full song for one day . Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea . In an interview with HitQuarters , Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife , but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead . When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis , she agreed that it could be " really quite interesting " . Regarding the song , Lewis commented : " Originally it was a poem ; it 's very inspirational so we put it into a song . I think it is very moving , with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song " ; and added that the poem " [ is ] about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help .

 = Polar coordinate system = 
 In mathematics , the polar coordinate system is a two @-@ dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction . 
 The reference point ( analogous to the origin of a Cartesian system ) is called the pole , and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis . The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius , and the angle is called the angular coordinate , polar angle , or azimuth . 
 = = History = = 
 The concepts of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of the first millennium BC . The Greek astronomer and astrologer Hipparchus ( 190 – 120 BC ) created a table of chord functions giving the length of the chord for each angle , and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions . In On Spirals , Archimedes describes the Archimedean spiral , a function whose radius depends on the angle . The Greek work , however , did not extend to a full coordinate system . 
 From the 8th century AD onward , astronomers developed methods for approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca ( qibla ) — and its distance — from any location on the Earth . From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately . The calculation is essentially the conversion of the equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca ( i.e. its longitude and latitude ) to its polar coordinates ( i.e. its qibla and distance ) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth 's poles , and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point . 
 There are various accounts of the introduction of polar coordinates as part of a formal coordinate system . The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge 's Origin of Polar Coordinates . Grégoire de Saint @-@ Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid @-@ seventeenth century . Saint @-@ Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647 , while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653 . Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral . Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs . 
 In Method of Fluxions ( written 1671 , published 1736 ) , Sir Isaac Newton examined the transformations between polar coordinates , which he referred to as the " Seventh Manner ; For Spirals " , and nine other coordinate systems . In the journal Acta <unk> ( 1691 ) , Jacob Bernoulli used a system with a point on a line , called the pole and polar axis respectively . Coordinates were specified by the distance from the pole and the angle from the polar axis . Bernoulli 's work extended to finding the radius of curvature of curves expressed in these coordinates . 
 The actual term polar coordinates has been attributed to Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th @-@ century Italian writers . The term appeared in English in George Peacock 's 1816 translation of Lacroix 's Differential and Integral Calculus . Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of polar coordinates in three dimensions , and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them . 
 = = Conventions = = 
 The radial coordinate is often denoted by r or ρ , and the angular coordinate by ϕ , θ , or t . The angular coordinate is specified as ϕ by ISO standard 31 @-@ 11 . 
 Angles in polar notation are generally expressed in either degrees or radians ( 2π rad being equal to 360 ° ) . Degrees are traditionally used in navigation , surveying , and many applied disciplines , while radians are more common in mathematics and mathematical physics . 
 In many contexts , a positive angular coordinate means that the angle ϕ is measured counterclockwise from the axis . 
 In mathematical literature , the polar axis is often drawn horizontal and pointing to the right . 
 = = = Uniqueness of polar coordinates = = = 
 Adding any number of full turns ( 360 ° ) to the angular coordinate does not change the corresponding direction . Also , a negative radial coordinate is best interpreted as the corresponding positive distance measured in the opposite direction . Therefore , the same point can be expressed with an infinite number of different polar coordinates ( r , ϕ ± n × 360 ° ) or ( − r , ϕ ± ( 2n + 1 ) 180 ° ) , where n is any integer . Moreover , the pole itself can be expressed as ( 0 , ϕ ) for any angle ϕ . 
 Where a unique representation is needed for any point , it is usual to limit r to non @-@ negative numbers ( r ≥ 0 ) and ϕ to the interval [ 0 , 360 ° ) or ( − 180 ° , 180 ° ] ( in radians , [ 0 , 2π ) or ( − π , π ] ) . One must also choose a unique azimuth for the pole , e.g. , ϕ = 0 . 
 = = Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates = = 
 The polar coordinates r and ϕ can be converted to the Cartesian coordinates x and y by using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 The Cartesian coordinates x and y can be converted to polar coordinates r and ϕ with r ≥ 0 and ϕ in the interval ( − π , π ] by :

 <formula> 
 The value of ϕ above is the principal value of the complex number function <unk> applied to x + iy . An angle in the range [ 0 , 2π ) may be obtained by adding 2π to the value in case it is negative . 
 = = Polar equation of a curve = = 
 The equation defining an algebraic curve expressed in polar coordinates is known as a polar equation . In many cases , such an equation can simply be specified by defining r as a function of ϕ . The resulting curve then consists of points of the form ( r ( ϕ ) , ϕ ) and can be regarded as the graph of the polar function r . 
 Different forms of symmetry can be deduced from the equation of a polar function r . If r ( − ϕ ) 
 = r ( ϕ ) the curve will be symmetrical about the horizontal ( 0 ° / 180 ° ) ray , if r ( π − ϕ ) = 
 r ( ϕ ) it will be symmetric about the vertical ( 90 ° / 270 ° ) ray , and if r ( ϕ − α ) = r ( ϕ ) it will be rotationally symmetric by α clockwise and counterclockwise about the pole . 
 Because of the circular nature of the polar coordinate system , many curves can be described by a rather simple polar equation , whereas their Cartesian form is much more intricate . Among the best known of these curves are the polar rose , Archimedean spiral , lemniscate , <unk> , and cardioid . 
 For the circle , line , and polar rose below , it is understood that there are no restrictions on the domain and range of the curve . 
 = = = Circle = = = 
 The general equation for a circle with a center at ( r0 , <formula> ) and radius a is 
 <formula> 
 This can be simplified in various ways , to conform to more specific cases , such as the equation 
 <formula> 
 for a circle with a center at the pole and radius a . 
 When r0 = a , or when the origin lies on the circle , the equation becomes 
 <formula> . 
 In the general case , the equation can be solved for r , giving 
 <formula> , 
 the solution with a minus sign in front of the square root gives the same curve .

 ɣ perpendicularly at the point ( r0 , ɣ ) has the equation 
 <formula> 
 Otherwise stated ( r0 , ɣ ) is the point in which the tangent intersects the imaginary circle of radius r0 . 
 = = = Polar rose = = = 
 A polar rose is a famous mathematical curve that looks like a petaled flower , and that can be expressed as a simple polar equation , 
 <formula> 
 for any constant <unk> ( including 0 ) . If k is an integer , these equations will produce a k @-@ petaled rose if k is odd , or a 2k @-@ petaled rose if k is even . If k is rational but not an integer , a rose @-@ like shape may form but with overlapping petals . Note that these equations never define a rose with 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , etc. petals . The variable a represents the length of the petals of the rose . 
 = = = Archimedean spiral = = = 
 The Archimedean spiral is a famous spiral that was discovered by Archimedes , which can also be expressed as a simple polar equation . It is represented by the equation 
 <formula> 
 Changing the parameter a will turn the spiral , while b controls the distance between the arms , which for a given spiral is always constant . The Archimedean spiral has two arms , one for ϕ > 0 and one for ϕ < 0 . The two arms are smoothly connected at the pole . Taking the mirror image of one arm across the 90 ° / 270 ° line will yield the other arm . This curve is notable as one of the first curves , after the conic sections , to be described in a mathematical treatise , and as being a prime example of a curve that is best defined by a polar equation . 
 = = = <unk> sections = = = 
 A conic section with one focus on the pole and the other somewhere on the 0 ° ray ( so that the conic 's major axis lies along the polar axis ) is given by : 
 <formula> 
 where e is the eccentricity and <formula> is the semi @-@ latus rectum ( the perpendicular distance at a focus from the major axis to the curve ) . If e > 1 , this equation defines a hyperbola ; if e

 = = Complex numbers = = 
 Every complex number can be represented as a point in the complex plane , and can therefore be expressed by specifying either the point 's Cartesian coordinates ( called rectangular or Cartesian form ) or the point 's polar coordinates ( called polar form ) . The complex number z can be represented in rectangular form as 
 <formula> 
 where i is the imaginary unit , or can alternatively be written in polar form ( via the conversion formulae given above ) as 
 <formula> 
 and from there as 
 <formula> 
 where e is Euler 's number , which are equivalent as shown by Euler 's formula . ( Note that this formula , like all those involving exponentials of angles , assumes that the angle ϕ is expressed in radians . ) To convert between the rectangular and polar forms of a complex number , the conversion formulae given above can be used . 
 For the operations of multiplication , division , and exponentiation of complex numbers , it is generally much simpler to work with complex numbers expressed in polar form rather than rectangular form . From the laws of exponentiation :

 Using the inverse coordinates transformation , an analogous reciprocal relationship can be derived between the derivatives . Given a function u ( r , ϕ ) , it follows that

 = = = Integral calculus ( arc length ) = = = 
 The arc length ( length of a line segment ) defined by a polar function is found by the integration over the curve r ( ϕ ) . Let L denote this length along the curve starting from points A through to point B , where these points correspond to ϕ 
 = a and ϕ = 
 b such that 0 < b − a < 2π . The length of L is given by the following integral 
 <formula> 
 = = = Integral calculus ( area ) = = = 
 Let R denote the region enclosed by a curve r ( ϕ ) and the rays ϕ 
 = a and ϕ = 
 b , where 0 < b − a ≤ 2π . Then , the area of R is 
 <formula> 
 This result can be found as follows . First , the interval [ a , b ] is divided into n subintervals , where n is an arbitrary positive integer . Thus Δϕ , the length of each subinterval , is equal to b − a ( the total length of the interval ) , divided by n , the number of subintervals . For each subinterval i = 1 , 2 , … , n , let ϕi be the midpoint of the subinterval , and construct a sector with the center at the pole , radius r ( ϕi ) , central angle Δϕ and arc length r ( ϕi ) Δϕ . The area of each constructed sector is therefore equal to 
 <formula> 
 Hence , the total area of all of the sectors is 
 <formula> 
 As the number of subintervals n is increased , the approximation of the area continues to improve . In the limit as n → ∞ , the sum becomes the Riemann sum for the above integral . 
 A mechanical device that computes area integrals is the <unk> , which measures the area of plane figures by tracing them out : this replicates integration in polar coordinates by adding a joint so that the 2 @-@ element linkage effects Green 's theorem , converting the quadratic polar integral to a linear integral . 
 = = = = Generalization = = = = 
 Using Cartesian coordinates , an infinitesimal area element can be calculated as dA 
 = dx dy . The substitution rule for multiple integrals states that , when using other coordinates , the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate conversion formula has to be considered : 
 <formula> 
 Hence , an area element in polar coordinates can be written as 
 <formula> 
 Now , a function , that is given in polar coordinates , can be integrated as follows : 
 <formula> 
 Here , R is the same region as above , namely , the region enclosed by a curve r ( ϕ ) and the rays ϕ = 
 a and ϕ = b . 
 The formula for the area of R mentioned above is retrieved by taking f identically equal to 1 . A more surprising application of this result yields the Gaussian integral 
 <formula> 
 = = = Vector calculus = = = 
 Vector calculus can also be applied to polar coordinates . For a planar motion , let <formula> be the position vector ( r cos ( ϕ ) , r sin ( ϕ ) ) , with r and ϕ depending on time t . 
 We define the unit vectors 
 <formula> 
 in the direction of r and

 Then

 <formula> 
 = = = = Centrifugal and Coriolis terms = = = = 
 The term <formula> is sometimes referred to as the centrifugal term , and the term <formula> as the Coriolis term . For example , see Shankar . Although these equations bear some resemblance in form to the centrifugal and Coriolis effects found in rotating reference frames , nonetheless these are not the same things . For example , the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces appear only in non @-@ inertial frames of reference . In contrast , these terms , that appear when acceleration is expressed in polar coordinates , are a mathematical consequence of differentiation ; these terms appear wherever polar coordinates are used . In particular , these terms appear even when polar coordinates are used in inertial frames of reference , where the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces never appear . 
 = = = = = Co @-@ rotating frame = = = = = 
 For a particle in planar motion , one approach to attaching physical significance to these terms is based on the concept of an instantaneous co @-@ rotating frame of reference . To define a co @-@ rotating frame , first an origin is selected from which the distance r ( t ) to the particle is defined . An axis of rotation is set up that is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particle , and passing through this origin . Then , at the selected moment t , the rate of rotation of the co @-@ rotating frame Ω is made to match the rate of rotation of the particle about this axis , dϕ / dt . Next , the terms in the acceleration in the inertial frame are related to those in the co @-@ rotating frame . Let the location of the particle in the inertial frame be ( r ( t ) , ϕ ( t ) ) , and in the co @-@ rotating frame be ( r ( t ) , ϕ ′ ( t ) ) . Because the co @-@ rotating frame rotates at the same rate as the particle , dϕ ′ / dt 
 = 0 . The fictitious centrifugal force in the co @-@ rotating frame is <unk> , radially outward . The velocity of the particle in the co @-@ rotating frame also is radially outward , because dϕ ′ / dt = 
 0 . The fictitious Coriolis force therefore has a value − 2m ( dr / dt ) Ω , pointed in the direction of increasing ϕ only . Thus , using these forces in Newton 's second law we find : 
 <formula> 
 where over dots represent time differentiations , and F is the net real force ( as opposed to the fictitious forces ) . In terms of components , this vector equation becomes : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 which can be compared to the equations for the inertial frame : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 This comparison , plus the recognition that by the definition of the co @-@ rotating frame at time t it has a rate of rotation Ω = dϕ / dt , shows that we can interpret the terms in the acceleration ( multiplied by the mass of the particle ) as found in the inertial frame as the negative of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces that would be seen in the instantaneous , non @-@ inertial co @-@ rotating frame . 
 For general motion of a particle ( as opposed to simple circular motion ) , the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in a particle 's frame of reference commonly are referred to the instantaneous osculating circle of its motion , not to a fixed center of polar coordinates . For more detail , see centripetal force . 
 = = Connection to spherical and cylindrical coordinates = = 
 The polar coordinate system is extended into three dimensions with two different coordinate systems , the cylindrical and spherical coordinate system . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Polar coordinates are two @-@ dimensional and thus they can be used only where point positions lie on a single two @-@ dimensional plane . They are most appropriate in any context where the phenomenon being considered is inherently tied to direction and length from a center point . For instance , the examples above show how elementary polar equations suffice to define curves — such as the Archimedean spiral — whose equation in the Cartesian coordinate system would be much more intricate . Moreover , many physical systems — such as those concerned with bodies moving around a central point or with phenomena originating from a central point — are simpler and more intuitive to model using polar coordinates . The initial motivation for the introduction of the polar system was the study of circular and orbital motion . 
 = = = Position and navigation = = = 
 Polar coordinates are used often in navigation as the destination or direction of travel can be given as an angle and distance from the object being considered . For instance , aircraft use a slightly modified version of the polar coordinates for navigation . In this system , the one generally used for any sort of navigation , the 0 ° ray is generally called heading 360 , and the angles continue in a clockwise direction , rather than counterclockwise , as in the mathematical system . Heading 360 corresponds to magnetic north , while headings 90 , 180 , and 270 correspond to magnetic east , south , and west , respectively . Thus , an aircraft traveling 5 nautical miles due east will be traveling 5 units at heading 90 ( read zero @-@ niner @-@ zero by air traffic control ) . 
 = = = Modeling = = = 
 Systems displaying radial symmetry provide natural settings for the polar coordinate system , with the central point acting as the pole . A prime example of this usage is the groundwater flow equation when applied to radially symmetric wells . Systems with a radial force are also good candidates for the use of the polar coordinate system . These systems include gravitational fields , which obey the inverse @-@ square law , as well as systems with point sources , such as radio antennas . 
 <unk> asymmetric systems may also be modeled with polar coordinates . For example , a microphone 's pickup pattern illustrates its proportional response to an incoming sound from a given direction , and these patterns can be represented as polar curves . The curve for a standard cardioid microphone , the most common unidirectional microphone , can be represented as r = 0 @.@ 5 + <unk> ( ϕ ) at its target design frequency . The pattern shifts toward <unk> at lower frequencies . 
 = Tasmanian numbfish = 
 The Tasmanian numbfish ( Narcine <unk> ) is a species of electric ray in the family <unk> . Endemic to southeastern Australia , this common ray inhabits shallow continental shelf waters in the southern portion of its range and deeper continental slope waters in the northern portion of its range . It prefers sand and mud habitats . This species can be identified by its spade @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc with concave anterior margins , long tail with well @-@ developed skin folds along either side , and plain dark brown dorsal colouration . Its maximum known length is 47 cm ( 19 in ) . 
 Bottom @-@ dwelling and sedentary , the Tasmanian numbfish feeds mainly on polychaete worms and crustaceans . As in all <unk> , it can produce a moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators . This species gives live birth , with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk ; the litter size ranges from one to eight . The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries . However , its population does not appear to be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Scottish naturalist John Richardson described the Tasmanian numbfish in an 1841 contribution to Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London . Classifying the new species in the genus Narcine , he gave it the specific epithet <unk> as the holotype , a female 36 cm ( 14 in ) long , was collected from Port Arthur , Tasmania . Richardson noted that the ray was known locally as " ground shark " . Other common names for this species include electric ray , electric torpedo , little numbfish , and numbfish . In a 2012 phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA , Narcine was found to be polyphyletic , with the Tasmanian numbfish belonging to a different lineage than the giant electric ray ( N. <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Reaching a length of at least 47 cm ( 19 in ) , the Tasmanian numbfish has a trowel @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc with a short , blunt snout and concave leading margins . The medium @-@ sized eyes are followed by smaller , nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims . A pair of large electric organs are located on either side of the head . There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three @-@ lobed posterior margin . The narrow , highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove . The teeth are small and diamond @-@ shaped with pointed tips ; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands , which remain exposed when the mouth is closed . There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc . 
 The triangular pelvic fins are much longer than wide ; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips . The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides . There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape , with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins . The tail terminates in a low caudal fin ; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular , especially in adult males , while the lower lobe is rounded . The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles . The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above , becoming lighter on the fins . The underside is white , sometimes with a few dark blotches . Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back , along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Tasmanian numbfish is common off southeastern Australia ; its range extends from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to the Esperance Plains in Western Australia , and encompasses all of Tasmania . Around Tasmania , it can be found from inshore waters to a depth of 100 m ( 330 ft ) on the continental shelf . In more northerly waters , it inhabits the upper continental slope at depths of 200 – 640 m ( 660 – 2 @,@ 100 ft ) . This bottom @-@ dwelling species favours a sandy or muddy substrate and is sometimes encountered in the vicinity of rocky reefs . Mature rays of both sexes appear to live apart from juveniles . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The Tasmanian numbfish is a fairly inactive species that spends long periods of time buried motionless in sediment . It feeds primarily on polychaete worms ( particularly those of the family <unk> ) and crustaceans ( including amphipods , decapods , and <unk> ) . Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions . Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions , while adults consume mostly polychaetes . This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age , as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans . Like other members of its family , the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock . Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) . The tapeworm Anthobothrium <unk> is a parasite of this species . 
 Reproduction in the Tasmanian numbfish is viviparous , with the developing embryos nourished to term via their yolk sacs . Females bear litters of one to eight pups ( average eight ) ; newborns measure 9 – 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long . Males and females attain reproductive maturity at lengths of 21 – 26 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 – 10 @.@ 2 in ) and 20 – 26 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 – 10 @.@ 2 in ) respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The Tasmanian numbfish is frequently caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia 's South East Trawl Fishery , which operate throughout its range . It is discarded after capture with an unknown , but probably high , rate of survival . Since this species does not appear to be threatened by human activity , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it under Least Concern .

 The La Galissonnière class ironclads were a group of wooden @-@ hulled , armored corvettes built for the French Navy during the 1870s , meant as a heavier armed and faster version of the Alma @-@ class ironclad . While all three ships were begun before the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 , the construction of the last two ships was delayed for years . The navy took advantage of the extended construction time of the latter ships to upgrade their armament . La Galissonnière bombarded Sfax in 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . She and her half @-@ sister Triomphante participated in a number of battles during the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . Their sister Victorieuse had a much quieter career . All three ships were decommissioned in the 1890s . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The La Galissonnière @-@ class ironclads were designed as faster , more heavily armed versions of the Alma @-@ class ironclads by Henri Dupuy de Lôme . They used the same central battery layout as their predecessors , although the battery was lengthened 4 meters ( 13 ft 1 in ) to provide enough room to work the larger 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . A two @-@ propeller layout was adopted in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the ship 's draft . The two later ships were designed by Sabattier who reduced the number of screws from two to one to improve their sailing qualities , added an 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) bow chaser under the forecastle and increased the caliber of the secondary armament .

 All three ships mounted four of their six 240 @-@ millimeter Modèle 1870 guns in the central battery on the battery deck . The other two 240 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , sponsoned out over the sides of the ship . In La Galissonnière the sponsons were positioned abaft the funnel , but the two later ships had theirs just forward of the funnel . La Galissonnière 's secondary armament of four 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns was also mounted on the upper deck . They were replaced by six 100 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns in 1880 . 
 The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millmeter gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 The ship received four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns in 1878 . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . La Galissonnière also received several towed Harvey torpedoes . 
 While Victorieuse and <unk> were on the stocks , their armament was reinforced by an additional 194 @-@ millimeter chase gun and the secondary armament was increased to six 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns . They also received the Hotchkiss guns and Harvey torpedoes as per La Galissonnière before completion .

 La Galissonnière 's initial commissions were in the Pacific and in the Caribbean , but she was assigned to the Levant Squadron ( French : Division Navale du Levant ) when she bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . In early 1882 La Galissonnière was the flagship of the Levant Squadron under Rear Admiral Alfred Conrad . Both La Galissonnière and Triomphante were assigned to the Far East Squadron in 1884 , under the command of Vice Admiral Amédée Courbet , and participated in several actions during the Sino @-@ French War of 1884 – 85 . Both ships fought in the Battle of Fuzhou , destroying a small Chinese fleet and coastal defenses defending the Min River . They supplied landing parties during the Battle of Tamsui in October 1884 , but they were forced to retreat by Chinese troops , although suffering few casualties ( 11 killed and 4 wounded between the two ships ) . Nothing is known of any further participation by La Galissonnière in the war , but Triomphante helped to capture the <unk> Islands in March 1885 during the Pescadores Campaign . 
 Victorieuse was placed into reserve after she finished her sea trials in 1876 . She had two commissions as flagship of the Pacific and China Squadrons and was relieved as the flagship of the latter by La Galissonnière in April 1884 . She became flagship of the Levant Squadron after she arrived in France , but was in bad shape and soon placed in reserve at Cherbourg . Victorieuse was on summer maneuvers off the Iberian coast in July 1893 . The ship was initially condemned in May 1897 , but this was reversed so she could convoy torpedo boats to Bizerte . That plan was later cancelled and Victorieuse was paid off in 1899 , becoming guardship of the outer harbor at Brest until finally condemned the following year . 
 = Rajiv Gandhi International Airport = 
 Rajiv Gandhi International Airport ( IATA : HYD , ICAO : <unk> ) is an international airport that serves Hyderabad , the largest city in the Indian state of Telangana . It is located in Shamshabad , about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of Hyderabad . The airport is operated by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd , a public – private venture . It was opened in March 2008 to replace Begumpet Airport as the primary commercial airport for Hyderabad . It is named after Rajiv Gandhi , former Prime Minister of India . 
 The airport has one passenger terminal , a cargo terminal and two runways . There are also aviation training facilities , a fuel farm , a solar power plant and two MRO facilities . As of 2015 , RGIA is the fifth busiest airport by passenger traffic in India , serving 11 @.@ 9 million passengers . The airport serves as a hub for Air India Regional , Blue Dart Aviation , SpiceJet , Lufthansa Cargo and <unk> , and as a focus city for IndiGo . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Planning ( 1997 – 2004 ) = = = 
 The idea to construct a new airport for Hyderabad was first conceived around 1997 by the N. Chandrababu Naidu administration . The existing commercial airport , Begumpet Airport , was unable to handle rising passenger traffic . The State Government initially considered converting <unk> Air Force Station to civilian use ; however , the Air Force refused . When the State proposed the construction of a new airport for the Air Force , the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport . By October 1998 , the State had narrowed down to three possible locations for the new airport : <unk> , <unk> and Shamshabad . Due to its convenient location near two highways ( NH 44 and NH 765 ) and a railway line , Shamshabad was selected in December 1998 . 
 In November 2000 , the State Government and the Airports Authority of India ( AAI ) signed a memorandum of understanding on the airport project , establishing it as a public – private partnership . The State and AAI together would hold a 26 % stake in the project , while the remaining 74 % would be allotted to private companies . Through a bidding process , a consortium consisting of GMR Group and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad ( <unk> ) was chosen as the holder of the 74 % stake . In December 2002 , Hyderabad International Airport Ltd ( <unk> ) , later renamed GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited ( GHIAL ) , was created as a special purpose entity , into which the State , AAI and GMR – <unk> placed their stakes . 
 In September 2003 , the members of GHIAL signed a shareholders ' agreement , as well as an agreement for state subsidy of over ₹ 400 crore ( US $ 59 million ) . A concession agreement between GHIAL and the Central Government was signed in December 2004 , stipulating that no airport within a 150 @-@ kilometre ( 93 mi ) radius of RGIA could be operated . Thus , the closure of Begumpet Airport was required . 
 = = = Construction and opening ( 2005 – 08 ) = = = 
 Construction began on 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the foundation stone . Two days prior , the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad . The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) . At Begumpet Airport , the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao ; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport . However , the new airport has only one terminal . 
 Roughly three years after the foundation stone laying ceremony , the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests . The Telugu Desam Party repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal . In addition , on 12 and 13 March , 20 @,@ 000 AAI employees had conducted a strike against the closure of Begumpet Airport , as well as that of HAL Airport in Bangalore , fearing they would lose their jobs . 
 RGIA was originally scheduled to open to commercial operations on 16 March 2008 ; however , the date was delayed due to protests from some airlines over the high ground handling rates at the airport . Once the rates were reduced , the launch date was set for 23 March . Although Lufthansa Flight 752 from Frankfurt was scheduled to be the first flight to land at RGIA , two SpiceJet flights landed earlier . However , the Lufthansa flight still received the planned ceremonial welcome upon its 12 : 25 am arrival .

 In September 2011 , SpiceJet launched its regional hub at RGIA , using its new Bombardier Q400 aircraft . The airline , which chose Hyderabad due to its central location in the country , flies to several Tier @-@ II and Tier @-@ III cities from the airport . Regional airline <unk> too opened a hub at RGIA upon commencing operations in July 2015 . 
 In November 2014 , the Ministry of Civil Aviation resolved that the domestic terminal of RGIA would be named after N. T. Rama Rao , resulting in protests from members of the Rajya Sabha . Airport officials remained unsure as to how the naming would occur .

 Runway 09R / 27L : 3 @,@ 707 by 45 metres ( 12 @,@ 162 ft × 148 ft ) . 
 Runway 09R / 27L , the original and primary runway , is long enough to be able to receive the Airbus A380 , the world 's largest passenger aircraft . Originally a taxiway , runway <unk> / 27R was inaugurated in February 2012 . Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 . It is mainly used when runway 09R / 27L is undergoing maintenance , and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often . North of these runways are the three parking aprons : the cargo , passenger terminal and MRO aprons . The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal .

 = Hurricane Kate ( 2003 ) = 
 Hurricane Kate was the second @-@ longest tropical cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and third major hurricane of the season , Kate developed from a tropical wave in the central tropical Atlantic on September 25 . Its unusual track included four major changes in direction . The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward . Kate strengthened to a hurricane , turned sharply westward while moving around a mid @-@ level low , and intensified to a 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) major hurricane on October 4 . Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone , weakened , and became extratropical after passing to the east of Newfoundland . The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia . 
 The storm had minimal effects on land , limited to moderately strong winds and heavy rainfall over Newfoundland . Kate threatened Atlantic Canada just one week after Hurricane Juan caused severe damage in Nova Scotia . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 21 , a tropical wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began moving slowly westward from the west coast of Africa , passing near the Cape Verde islands on September 23 . Though the wave was disorganized , a low @-@ level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of Cape Verde . Steady organization ensued , including the development of convection into curved bands around the system . Though it lacked a well @-@ defined center , the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920 mi ( 1 @,@ 480 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Cape Verde Islands . 
 The depression moved northwestward due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge . Despite early predictions of steady strengthening to reach 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) within 48 hours , the depression remained weak due to strong south @-@ southwesterly wind shear . The shear remained strong , and though the National Hurricane Center forecast the system to remain a depression through September 30 , the depression unexpectedly strengthened to Tropical Storm Kate on September 27 , coinciding with an increase in deep convection near the center . Kate turned to the north and northeast , and despite 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) of shear over the storm Kate continued to strengthen . A banding eye developed early on September 29 , and later that day it intensified into a hurricane while located 655 mi ( 1 @,@ 055 km ) southwest of the Azores . 
 Hurricane Kate maintained hurricane status for twelve hours before decelerating to the north and weakening to a tropical storm . The storm then turned sharply west @-@ southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid @-@ level circulation . Passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing vertical shear , Kate regained hurricane status on October 1 . Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south , the hurricane continued west @-@ southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30 ° N , and presented a well @-@ defined eye on October 2 . On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status , and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) while located 650 mi ( 1 @,@ 050 km ) east of Bermuda . 
 Shortly after peaking , the western portion of the central dense overcast , or the area of high , thick clouds around the eye , began to deteriorate , and Hurricane Kate started to weaken . On October 5 , the storm dropped below major hurricane status . Kate turned sharply northward due to it moving around the western periphery of a powerful anticyclone , and consequently slowed its forward motion . It slowly weakened as it turned to the north @-@ northeast , with an eye occasionally re @-@ appearing on satellite images . On October 7 , however , Kate weakened to a tropical storm while moving over cooler waters . It accelerated to the northeast , and after passing about 260 mi ( 420 km ) east of Newfoundland , Kate became extratropical as cold air clouds entrained the center . The system remained a powerful system , and later on October 8 the extratropical remnant of Kate retained winds of up to 75 mph ( 140 km / h ) while passing south of Greenland . The storm turned to the east , passed a short distance south of Iceland , and merged with another extratropical storm near Scandinavia on October 10 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Just a week after Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia , the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take appropriate actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate , including high winds and potentially up to 3 in ( 80 mm ) of rain . Such actions include securing loose objects , cleaning debris from storm drains , and owning appropriate hurricane supplies ( such as a charged cell phone and batteries in the event of power outages ) . A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John 's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm . The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland , while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane @-@ force wind warning . Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front , the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland . Offshore , waves were expected to reach 33 feet ( 10 m ) , while marine wind warnings were issued as well . 
 From September 28 to October 7 , 33 ships reported winds of over 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) in relation to Kate , though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical . The highest wind reported was 59 mph ( 95 km / h ) , while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989 mbar . The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 3 – 4 foot ( 1 m ) waves along the coast of North Carolina and New England . The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses , though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) at Cape Race , Newfoundland . The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula , reaching heights of 9 – 13 feet ( 3 – 4 m ) . The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall , with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4 inches ( 100 mm ) . St. John 's reported 1 @.@ 8 inches ( 45 mm ) on October 6 , a record for the date . Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks , the ground easily absorbed the water , resulting in a lack of flooding . The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) in northern Scotland . Overall , there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate . 
 = Ely and Littleport riots of 1816 = 
 The Ely and Littleport riots of 1816 , also known as the Ely riots or Littleport riots , occurred between 22 and 24 May 1816 in Littleport , Cambridgeshire . The riots were caused by high unemployment and rising grain costs , much like the general unrest which spread throughout England following the Napoleonic Wars . 
 The Littleport riot broke out when a group of residents met at The Globe Inn . Fuelled by alcohol , they left the inn and began intimidating wealthier Littleport residents , demanding money and destroying property . The riot spread to Ely where magistrates attempted to calm the protests by ordering poor relief and fixing a minimum wage ; see printed bill ( reproduced at right ) . The following day , encouraged by Lord Liverpool 's government , a militia of the citizens of Ely , led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and backed by the 1st The Royal Dragoons , rounded up the rioters . In the ensuing altercation at The George and Dragon in Littleport , a trooper was injured , one rioter was killed , and at least one went on the run . 
 Edward Christian , brother of Fletcher Christian , had been appointed Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely . As the Chief Justice , Christian was entitled to try the rioters alone . The government , in this case via the Home Secretary , Lord Sidmouth , nevertheless appointed a Special Commission , consisting of Justice Abbott and Justice Burrough . The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816 . 23 men and one woman were condemned , of which five were subsequently hanged . General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport may have been a factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824 and subsequently the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1815 , the government increased taxation on imported wheat and grain to help pay for the costs of the Napoleonic Wars ( 1803 – 1815 ) . Poor laws , such as the Speenhamland system , were designed to help alleviate financial distress of the poorer communities , but such systems helped to keep wages artificially low as the farmers knew labourers ' wages would be supplemented by the system . Basic commodities , like cereals and bread , became heavily over @-@ priced , creating widespread social unrest . The worst hit were the families of the men returning from the Battle of Waterloo ( 1815 ) who arrived home at a time when unemployment was already high . One reply to a questionnaire circulated by the Board of Agriculture in February , March , and April 1816 reported that " the state of the labouring poor is very deplorable , and arises entirely from the want of employment , which they are willing to seek , but the farmer cannot afford to furnish . " 
 In early 1816 , a quarter ( 28 pounds ) of wheat cost 52 shillings ( £ 179 ) , rising through 76 shillings ( £ 262 ) in May to 103 shillings ( £ 356 ) in December . Average wages for the period remained static at 8 – 9 shillings ( £ 28 – £ 31 ) , per week . In 1815 , a pound of bread was quoted at over 4 shillings ( £ 14 ) and predicted to rise to over 5 shillings ( £ 17 ) .

 There was rioting in the first months of 1816 in West Suffolk , Norfolk and Cambridgeshire . On 16 May riots broke out in Bury St Edmunds ( known locally as Bury ) and Brandon in West Suffolk and also in <unk> , Feltwell and Norwich in Norfolk . 
 On the morning of 20 May , a meeting was held in <unk> , Norfolk . The group , including a Thomas Sindall , marched through Denver to Downham Market to meet with the magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house . Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport . He was killed by troopers at Littleport — see below . The mob of 1 @,@ 500 , mainly men but some women , besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas : to have work and two @-@ shillings ( £ 7 ) per day . The magistrates acceded to these demands , but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell , who arrived at 5 pm . Backed by the troops , the Riot Act was then read in the market place by Reverend Dering , causing further tussles , which subsided after arrests started to be made . 
 At the Norfolk and Norwich Assizes in August , nine men and six women were sentenced to death . Thirteen of those sentences were commuted , and two of the Downham rioters , Daniel Harwood and Thomas <unk> , were hanged on the afternoon of 31 August 1816 . 
 = = = Littleport = = = 
 Littleport is a large village in Cambridgeshire with a population in 1811 of 1 @,@ 847 . It is just under 11 miles ( 18 km ) south @-@ south @-@ west of Downham Market and just over 4 miles ( 6 km ) north @-@ north @-@ east of Ely . 
 On 22 May 1816 , a group of 56 residents met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs . Fuelled by alcohol , the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin . He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners . One man went to get a horn from Burgess , the <unk> , and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn , gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group , and the riot commenced . 
 The rioters began at <unk> 's shop , where stones were thrown through the windows , and then they invaded Mr Clarke 's property and threw his belongings into the street . Next , at Josiah Dewey 's place , the Reverend John Vachell and his wife arrived to try to calm the rioters . Vachell had been vicar of St George 's since 1795 and was also a magistrate ; he was an unpopular man , as he dealt harshly with even minor offences . He read or tried to read the Riot Act without effect , as the crowd " told him to go home . " 
 The rioters next visited the premises of disabled 90 @-@ year @-@ old Mr Sindall , throwing his furniture into the street ; his housekeeper , Mrs Hutt , was intimidated by a rioter wielding a butcher 's cleaver . After stopping at the place of Mr Little , " a nice old gentleman , " who gave the mob £ 2 ( £ 138 ) , they continued to Robert <unk> 's and demolished his furniture . Next they broke into the house of Rebecca Waddelow looking for Harry Martin , her grandson . He had seen them coming and escaped out the back . Rebecca Cutlack was visiting at the time , and they robbed her and removed property worth between £ 100 and £ 200 ( £ 6 @,@ 903 – £ 13 @,@ 807 ) . 
 At about 11 pm , the rioters arrived at the house of the Reverend John Vachell , who , after threatening to shoot anyone who entered his house , was disarmed when three men rushed him . He fled on foot with his wife and two daughters towards Ely . After Vachell had left , the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware . Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act . He received over £ 708 ( £ 48 @,@ 875 ) , an award which was challenged in the press , as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it . The rioters then stopped a post @-@ chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham . They robbed Evans of 14 shillings ( £ 48 ) before allowing them both to proceed . On reaching Ely , Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell , which collected him and his family walking towards Ely . 
 = = = Ely = = = 
 Ely , Cambridgeshire , is a city with an 1811 population of 4 @,@ 249 people . The city is nearly 15 miles ( 24 km ) north @-@ north @-@ east of Cambridge and 67 miles ( 108 km ) north @-@ north @-@ east of London . When Vachell arrived in Ely , he alerted fellow clergymen and magistrates Reverend William Metcalfe and Reverend Henry Law who dispatched Thomas Archer , as a messenger , to Bury , 26 miles ( 42 km ) to the east . 
 The rioters in Littleton had in the interim stolen a wagon and horses from Henry Tansley and equipped it with fowling guns front and back . Most of the Littleton mob , armed with guns and pitch @-@ forks , then began the march to Ely , arriving three @-@ quarters of a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) north of the city between 5 am and 6 am on 23 May . The Reverend William Metcalfe met them , read the Riot Act , and asked what the mob required . On being told that they wanted " the price of a stone of flour per day " and that " our children are starving , give us a living wage , " the Reverend agreed but stated that he would have to converse with the other magistrates . He asked everyone to return to Littleport , but they marched on . Metcalfe implored them to go to the market place and many did go there , where they were joined by Ely citizens . Recognising the needs of the rioters , the Ely magistrates , the Reverends William Metcalfe , Peploe Ward and Henry Law drafted a response , offering poor families two @-@ shillings per head per week and ordering farmers to pay two @-@ shillings ( £ 7 ) per day wages . On hearing the proclamation , the mob cheered . The magistrates then " gave the men some beer , told them not to get drunk and tried to persuade them to go home " . Some took the advice , whilst others continued the rampage , intimidating shopkeepers , millers and bankers and stealing from some . However , most of the rioters , marching with their wagons and guns , left the city for Littleport before the arrival of the military from Bury . 
 Meanwhile , the magistrates delegated Henry Law to go to London to discuss the matter with Lord Sidmouth , the Home Secretary . On the way , Law stopped at the barracks of the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry and requested they go to Ely . Law was unable to convince Sidmouth of the seriousness of the situation , and Sidmouth asked Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley to return with Law and report on the matter . 
 = = Restoring order = = 
 A detachment of 18 men of the 1st The Royal Dragoons , commanded by Captain Methuen , arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in the late afternoon . They marched through the streets as a show of force , remaining all night . The following afternoon , 24 May , the troops marched on Littleport , led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon , a Bow Street constable . They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law , and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely . 
 Before arrival at the Ely Road , a small detachment of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east . The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street . The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near the west end of Station Road . The militia were called to the front when the rioters would not come out after being ordered to by Bate Dudley . Thomas South , shooting from a window , hit trooper Wallace in the forearm . The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street , surrounded by the troopers . Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful . Sindall ran away and when he did not stop after being called on to do so by Porter , he was shot through the back of the head . Thomas Sindall was killed ; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport . The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters . Those captured were taken to Ely gaol and the rest of the rioters were rounded up . 
 The home secretary , Lord Sidmouth , had dispatched three troops of cavalry ( 100 men ) , two six – pounder cannons and three companies of the 69th ( South Lincolnshire ) Regiment of Foot under Major General Byng to help capture the leading rioters . 
 Two rioters were hidden in Lakenheath by a labourer who eventually betrayed them for £ 5 each ( £ 345 ) . One rioter , William <unk> , a bricklayer , escaped and was eventually pardoned a few years later . He returned to Littleport after seven years and then went to America . The rioting spread to nearby areas such as Little Downham , Cambridgeshire , although such areas were not as badly affected . It took until 10 June before the areas were finally cleared of trouble and all of the rioters had been captured .

 The assizes for the 82 persons , 73 of whom were in prison and nine on bail , lasted from Monday 17 June 1816 through to the following Saturday . 
 = = = Special Commission = = = 
 Since 970 AD , and until 1837 the Bishop of Ely retained exclusive jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters , and was also keeper of the records ( Custos rotulorum ) . As part of this right , the Bishop appointed a Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely ; Edward Christian had held the post since 1800 . In these special assizes , the crown , via Lord Sidmouth , created a Special Commission . Sidmouth appointed two judges , Mr Justice Abbott and Mr Justice Burrough to preside over it . Christian , nevertheless , felt he should attend and indeed was in attendance throughout . After the trial Christian said , " It was suggested to me in London , ... that it would be more conducive to the great object of the Commission , ... if I declined my rotation of duty , and left the trial of all the prisoners to them [ the appointed commissioners ] . " 
 = = = Monday = = = 
 Shortly after 10 am , the three judges went to the courthouse , in the market place at that time , and the Special Commission was read . The judges then breakfasted at the bishop 's palace , after which a service was held in the cathedral and attended by 50 of the principal inhabitants of Ely . The sermon , preached by Henry Bate Dudley , was " that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient " . 
 After the service , around 1 pm , the court reconvened ; the Grand Jury was sworn in , and Mr W. Dunn Gardner elected the foreman . Mr Gurney , Mr Bolland and Mr Richardson , were counsel for the crown , led by Mr William Hobhouse , treasury solicitor . For the defence , Mr Hunt was counsel for Jefferson , <unk> , Harley , <unk> , Cooper , Freeman and Jessop ; Mr Hart was counsel for John Easey , Joseph Easey , Benton , Layton , Atkin , Hobbs and another . 
 Mr Justice Abbott addressed the court : 
 Gentlemen of the Grand Jury , — You have been called together at this unusual period , and with the present solemnities , in consequence of some very daring acts of outrage committed by various misguided individuals in this town and its immediate neighbourhood , which must still be fresh in your recollection . In contemplating the nature of these atrocities , it is impossible to consider without commendation , the conductors of those prompt and efficacious measures by which , after it had domineered for several days together , the spirit of tumult and devastation was finally subdued . 
 He then went on to direct the jury at length , commenting at one point that these disturbances " seem to have been the necessity of an advance in the wages of husbandry ; but the circumstances of some among the offenders do not correspond with the supposition of such an object " . He was probably referring to John Dennis , licensed victualler of Littleport . He outlined the three capital offences that would be presented , namely burglary , robbery from the person and stealing in a dwelling house . He defined burglary as breaking into a house at night with intent , robbery from the person as extortion by violence or threat thereof , and stealing in a dwelling house as an actual act of stealing , not just the threat . He reminded the jury that when offences are carried out by a mob , it is the whole mob that is guilty , not just the person doing the deed . He closed : 
 It is of the highest importance to the peace and safety , not only of this isle , but of the surrounding country , that all who are present on this solemn inquiry , and all who read the account of its proceedings ( and there are few parts of the kingdom in which it will not be read ) may be convinced by the awful lesson which may here be taught , that whatever wild or chimerical notions may prevail of the power of an armed multitude , the law is too strong for its assailants ; and that , however triumphant or destructive their sway for a few days , those who defy the law , will ultimately be compelled to submit either to its justice or its mercy . 
 The court adjourned until the following day . 
 = = = Tuesday = = = 
 On Tuesday 18 June the court opened at 9 am ; 12 defendants were charged with breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money . After hearing evidence , the judges held a discussion . Mr Justice Abbott informed the jury that a mistake had been made in the indictment , directing the jury to acquit . All 12 defendants were pronounced not guilty . 
 Seven defendants were then indicted for breaking into the house of Josiah Dewey in Littleport , stealing money and property and assaulting Dewey . Mr Gurney addressed the jury . Three witnesses testified . The jury recorded a verdict of guilty against Chevall , Easey , Jessop , South and Benton ; Dann and Torrington were acquitted . The court adjourned at 5 pm . 
 = = = Wednesday = = = 
 On Wednesday 19 June the court opened at 9 am ; the indictment on three of the defendants was read for forcibly entering the house of Robert <unk> in Littleport and stealing personal property . Mr Gurney addressed the jury , who later pronounced all defendants guilty . 
 Five defendants were then indicted for forcing their way in the house of Rev. John Vachell in Littleport , threatening him and stealing £ 2 . Mr Gurney addressed the jury . Two witnesses testified . A verdict of guilty was returned against Harley and Newell whilst Warner and <unk> were acquitted . 
 Five defendants were then indicted for stealing £ 50 from the house of Robert Edwards in Ely . Mr Gurney addressed the jury at length describing the events occurring in the town of Ely on the morning of the 23 May 1816 . Eight witnesses were called . The jury returned guilty verdicts against Dennis , Jefferson , and Rutter . Hopkin and Cammell were given not guilty verdicts . 
 = = = Thursday = = = 
 On Thursday morning 20 June two defendants were indicted for stealing silverware from the home of Rev. J. Vachell in Littleport and one was charged with receiving the stolen goods . Four witnesses called were Elizabeth Carter following which Mr Justice Burrough summed up . Lavender was pronounced guilty of the theft and Beamiss and Butcher received not guilty verdicts . 
 John <unk> was next , also indicted for stealing spoons at the vicarage . As the evidence was contradictory , <unk> was acquitted by the jury . 
 Next at the bar was William Beamiss indicted for highway robbery of Hugh Robert Evans , of Ely . Two witness were called . Mr Justice Abbott summed up and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the prisoner Beamiss . 
 Then nine defendants were charged with threatening W. Cooper of Ely and stealing from him . Mr Gurney addressed the jury , explaining the circumstances of the disturbances carried out by the mob in Ely . Nine witnesses were called . Mr Justice Abbott spoke to the jury for a long time . The jury retired for fifteen minutes . On returning , it pronounced as guilty Dennis , Jessop , Atkin , Layton , Hobbs , <unk> , Cooper , and Jefferson . It acquitted Freeman . 
 Six defendants were then charged with stealing from George Stevens in Ely . Three witness were examined following which Dennis , Layton , Atkin , and Cammell were all pronounced guilty by the jury . Capital convictions against Aaron Chevall and William Beamiss , for robbing Henry Tansley of two £ 1 notes , were also returned by the jury . The court adjourned at 6 pm . 
 = = = Friday = = = 
 On Friday morning 21 June , seven prisoners were brought to the bar on a similar charge as on Tuesday ( breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money ) . The prisoners all pleaded not guilty . Mr Gurney addressed the jury explaining that these were the same persons indicted on Tuesday for the same offence . He explained to the jury that the earlier indictment incorrectly described the house to be the property of Rebecca Waddelow , leading to the prisoners ' acquittal . He also explained that in the original indictment , other persons had been charged , but as these other persons had since been convicted of capital offences , they had been removed from the indictment . The witness were all brought forward again and made their statements . They said much the same as previously , though this took much of the day . In summing up , Mr Abbott went on a length closing with " the duty which it belonged to them [ the jury ] to execute – confident that , from experience which the court had now of them , their verdict would be such as good sense would dictate , and the public justice of the country require " . It took the jury five minutes to find Walker , Butcher and Crow guilty and Nicholas , Wilson and Jefferson not guilty . 
 Brought to the bar next was Henry Benson , a farmer who was out on bail , charged with inciting to riot . Benson was held in surety for £ 400 plus two other sureties for £ 200 each . He was to appear for trial at the next assizes . Richard Cooper the elder and Richard Cooper the younger were also bound over to the next assizes . Father and son , William Beamiss the elder and the younger , were then brought in and charged with assaulting and stealing from Robert <unk> the younger , of Littleport , in the Isle of Ely . Mr Gurney addressed the jury . Mr Burrough summed up and the jury gave their guilty verdict to both prisoners shortly after . 
 Next , between 20 and 30 prisoners were brought to the bar and " indicted for having committed various felonies and misdemeanour 's at Littleport on 22 , 23 , and 24 of May last " . A few were put to the next assizes and the remainder chose to be tried immediately . Mr Gurney addressed the jury explaining that his Majesty 's government was keen not to put to the jury more cases than was necessary . If the prisoners now at the bar offered a small surety and remained on good behaviour , there would be no more said . Mr Abbott spoke to the prisoners at length , finally demanding that each of them offer surety of £ 50 and find two more sureties each of £ 10 or one more each of £ 20 . Mr Abbott then thanked the jury for their services . The court adjourned .

 Saturday 
 On Saturday 22 June 1816 six men were acquitted ; 10 were discharged ; 36 were bailed ; 23 men and one woman were condemned of whom 18 men and the woman , Sarah Hobbs , had their sentences commuted . Of the 19 persons commuted , nine were sentenced to penal transportation . Seven of those nine sailed on the convict ship Sir William Bensley , which departed for New South Wales on 9 October 1816 , captained by Lew E Williams . Records exist for the following known to have sailed : James Newell , Richard Jessop , John Jefferson , Joseph Easey , Aaron <unk> , all of Littleport and all transported for life ; Richard Rutter of Littleport for 14 years ; John Easey of Littleport for seven years . Two others were also sentenced to transportation for seven years , Mark Benton and John Walker , both of Littleport . 10 , including Sarah Hobbs , were committed to Ely gaol for 12 months ; five were from Littleport and five , including Sarah Hobbs were from Ely . 
 The five condemned without commutation were all from Littleport . They were William Beamiss ( 42 ) the elder , shoemaker , for stealing from the persons of Henry Tansley and Robert <unk> , both of Littleport ; George Crow ( 23 ) , labourer , for stealing in the dwelling @-@ house of Rebecca Waddelow and Henry Martin , both of Littleport ; John Dennis ( 32 ) , a publican , for stealing from the persons of William Cooper , Robert Edwards , and George Stevens , all of Ely ; Isaac Harley junior ( 33 ) , labourer , for stealing from the person of the Reverend John Vachell , of Littleport ; and Thomas South the younger ( 22 ) , labourer , for stealing in the dwelling @-@ house of Josiah Dewey and Robert <unk> , both of Littleport . 
 = = = Execution = = = 
 On Friday 28 June 1816 at 9 am , the condemned men , William Beamiss , George Crow , John Dennis , Isaac Harley and Thomas South , were driven from the gaol at Ely market place in a black @-@ draped cart and two horses costing five @-@ pound five @-@ shillings ( £ 362 ) accompanied by the bishop 's gaol chaplain , John Griffin , in a hired chaise and pair costing 13 shillings ( £ 45 ) . In submitting his expenses on 29 June , chief bailiff F. Bagge noted " We have no power of pressing a cart for the purpose , and ' tis a difficult matter to get one , people feel 's so much upon the occasion " . 
 The men arrived at the gallows at Parnell pits around 11 am , and were hanged after praying with the crowd for some time . Griffin was unofficially given the ropes , which cost one @-@ pound five @-@ shillings ( £ 86 ) , after hanging , which he kept ; he left a collection to his housekeeper , who sold them as a cure for sore throats . Following the hanging , the bodies were placed in coffins and displayed in a cottage in Gaol Street , where many people came to visit . They were buried the next day in St Mary 's Church , Ely , with the vicar 's blessing . As a warning to others , a stone plaque ( pictured ) was installed on the west side of St Mary 's Church ; it concludes , " May their awful Fate be a warning to others " . 
 In 1816 , there were a total of 83 people executed in England : 80 men , including the five Littleport rioters , and three women . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 A few days after the execution , the ten condemned prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months ' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk <unk> , moored at Woolwich on the River Thames . Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to , at this time , Australia . Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners ' sentences . Despite , or because of , media attention — newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not — the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol ; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes . 
 On 3 April 1816 , lieutenant @-@ colonel William Sorell was appointed lieutenant @-@ governor of Van Diemen 's Land , now Tasmania . He sailed on the Sir William Bensley , the same ship transporting the rioters sentenced to penal transportation . Leaving England on 9 October 1816 , the ship arrived in New South Wales 152 days later on 10 March 1817 . Soon after , Sorrel sailed to Hobart arriving on 8 April 1817 , where he distinguished himself as the third lieutenant @-@ governor . 
 The Reverend John Vachell stayed on as vicar of St George 's Littleport in title until 1830 ; he appointed a curate , George Britton Jermyn from 1817 . Some of the St George 's church registers were destroyed during the riots . The remaining registers start from 1754 ( marriages ) , 1756 ( burials ) , and 1783 ( baptism ) . General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport may have been a factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824 . Due in part to some difficulties in enforcing the law and to continued public unease , the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 was created leading to the first modern police force . 
 = Æthelwold ætheling = 
 Æthelwold or Æthelwald ( died 902 or 903 ) was the younger of two known sons of Æthelred I , King of Wessex from 865 to 871 . Because Æthelwold ætheling and his brother were still infants when their father the king died while fighting a Danish Viking invasion , the throne passed to the king 's younger brother ( and Æthelwold 's uncle ) Alfred the Great , who carried on the war against the Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878 . 
 After Alfred 's death in 899 , Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred 's son , Edward the Elder . As senior ætheling ( prince of the royal dynasty eligible for kingship ) , Æthelwold had a strong claim to the throne . He attempted to raise an army to support his claim , but was unable to get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking @-@ controlled Northumbria , where he was accepted as king . In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex , where he was also accepted as king . 
 The following year Æthelwold persuaded the East Anglian Danes to attack Edward 's territory in Wessex and Mercia . Edward retaliated with a raid on East Anglia , and when he withdrew the men of Kent lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at the Battle of the Holme . The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses , including the death of Æthelwold , which ended the challenge to Edward 's rule . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the eighth century , Mercia was the most powerful kingdom in southern England , but in the early ninth Wessex became dominant . In the 820s King Egbert of Wessex conquered south @-@ east England ( Kent , Surrey , Sussex and Essex ) . His reign saw the beginning of Viking attacks , but Egbert and his son Æthelwulf , who succeeded in 839 , were able to resist them . Æthelwulf died in 858 , and he was followed by four sons in succession . King Æthelbald died in 860 , and King Æthelberht in 865 ; Æthelwold 's father , Æthelred , then succeeded to the throne . In the same year the Viking Great Heathen Army invaded England . Within five years they had conquered Northumbria and East Anglia , and forced Mercia to buy them off . In late 870 the Vikings invaded Wessex , and in early 871 they fought armies under Æthelred and Alfred in four battles in quick succession , the last two of which Wessex lost . Æthelred died shortly after Easter that year , leaving young sons . <unk> was not established in this period , and it was believed that kings should be adults , so he was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred . 
 By 878 the Vikings had seized eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex , and Alfred was reduced to being a fugitive in the Somerset marshes , but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington . This was followed by a period of peace , and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a treaty with Guthrum , king of the East Anglian Vikings , setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the one hand , and the Danelaw on the other . A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Very little is known of Æthelwold 's immediate family . Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871 , so his sons must have been young children when he died . Æthelred 's wife was probably the <unk> who witnessed a charter in 868 . Æthelwold and his older brother Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred 's will in the 880s . Æthelhelm is not heard of again , and he probably died soon afterwards . The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred 's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s . 
 After King Æthelred 's death in 871 , his sons ' supporters complained about Alfred keeping property that should have belonged to his nephews . Alfred justified his conduct in a preamble to his will , which probably dates to the 880s , One of Alfred 's biographers , Richard Abels , describes the text as " rather tendentious " , and another , Alfred Smyth , as " ambiguous and vague – and deliberately so " . Patrick Wormald views the will as " one of the seminal documents of pre @-@ Conquest history , and like many such not easily understood . " 
 The dispute concerned property bequeathed in the will of Alfred 's father , Æthelwulf . This does not survive , but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will . Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons , Æthelbald , Æthelred and Alfred , stipulating that all of it was to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest . When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865 , Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them . Æthelred refused , offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death , together with any further property he acquired , and Alfred agreed . The Viking invasion of Wessex , and the need to provide for their children , led to a revision of the terms . Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871 , the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers , but he would give his brother 's children any lands which he had received separately from his father , and any he had acquired later . 
 In the preamble to his will , Alfred stated : 
 When we now heard many disputes about the inheritance , I brought King Æthelwulf 's will to our assembly at <unk> , and it was read before all the councillors of the West Saxons . When it had been read , I urged them all for love of me – and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against any one of them because they declared what was right – that none of them would hesitate , either for love or fear of me , to expound the common law , lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully , the older or the younger . And then they all pronounced what was right , and said that they could not conceive any <unk> title , nor could they find one in the will . " Now everything has come into your possession , and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger , whichever you prefer . " 
 Historians have taken differing views of Æthelwulf 's will . The editors of Alfred 's will , Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge , suggest that Æthelwulf 's other surviving son , Æthelberht , was excluded from the arrangement because he was provided for separately in the eastern kingdom ( the recently conquered south @-@ east England ) , where he acted as king in 855 and 856 ; it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there . The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of Æthelwulf 's property . The transmission of folkland was governed by customary law , and another portion was reserved for the holder of the office of king . Keynes and Lapidge argue that Æthelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact , and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king , so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers . This plan was abandoned when Æthelbald died in 860 and the kingdom was reunited under Æthelberht , and Æthelred 's confirmation of the arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised Alfred as heir apparent . 
 Ann Williams comments : " Æthelred virtually <unk> his children in favour of Alfred 's in the event of his own previous death , at least in respect of the lion 's share of the inheritance and therefore the kingship . This is in fact exactly what happened , and Æthelred 's sons were not pleased at the outcome . " In his Life of Alfred , written in 893 , Asser states three times that Alfred was Æthelred 's <unk> ( heir apparent ) , an emphasis that in Ryan Lavelle 's view " reflects sensitivity on the subject of Alfred 's succession " . 
 Smyth argues , however , that it is unlikely that Æthelwulf intended to divide his kingdom , or that the kingship of Wessex should be inherited by the surviving brother ; the joint property was probably provision for his youngest sons at a time when they appeared very unlikely to succeed to the kingship , with Æthelbald included as a residual beneficiary in case both of them died young . D. P. Kirby argues that it cannot be assumed that the disputed lands represented the greater part of the royal estates ; he believes that Æthelwulf did intend to divide his kingdom , but also that it is unlikely he intended the surviving son to inherit the kingship : " Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife . With three older brothers , Alfred 's chances of reaching adulthood would , one feels , have been minimal . " 
 In his own will , Alfred left the bulk of his property to Edward , while Æthelhelm was left eight estates , and Æthelwold only three ( at Godalming and Guildford in Surrey , and Steyning in Sussex ) , all in the less important eastern part of the kingdom . The largest of these was Steyning , Æthelwulf 's original burial place ; in Patrick Wormald 's view , Alfred may have moved the body to Winchester because he was required to give the estate to Æthelwold under his agreement with Æthelred , and he did not want his nephew to have the prestige of owning his grandfather 's grave . Keynes and Lapidge comment : " If only to judge from the relatively small number of estates he received , Æthelwold in particular would have had cause to be aggrieved by this allocation of property , and his resentment is shown by his rebellion against Edward soon after Alfred 's death . " Smyth argues that the meeting of the king 's council , the witan , was bound to support him : 
 Alfred , by [ <unk> ] in full control of Wessex and at the height of his power , was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son , Edward , to the exclusion of his brother Æthelred 's heirs . That kingship was never in Alfred 's gift , but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward , the stronger he made that son 's position in any future contest for the kingship . We must , therefore , treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution , if not scepticism . The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little . As king , Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns , who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property . It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at all . That it did , suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex . 
 In Abels ' view , Æthelred 's sons attempted to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed so as to strengthen their position in the inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died , and the <unk> assembly was Alfred 's riposte . 
 Alfred also assisted his own son by promoting men who could be relied on to support him , and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough . In the view of Barbara Yorke , the compilation of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , which magnified Alfred 's achievements , may have been partly intended to strengthen the case for the succession of his own descendants . However , Yorke also argues that Æthelwold 's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred 's will . His mother had witnessed a charter as regina , whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen , and Æthelwold 's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward . Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling , and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis ( son of a king ) , but lists Æthelwold above Edward , implying that he ranked above him .

 After Alfred 's death in 899 , Æthelwold made a bid for the throne . Janet Nelson comments that " in the eyes of many Englishmen as well as Scandinavians this ætheling had claims stronger than Edward 's own . " According to the ' A ' version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , Æthelwold abducted a nun from her convent without the permission of King Edward and against the command of the bishop . Her identity is not known , but it must have been intended to strengthen his claim , and in the view of the historian Pauline Stafford , the Chronicle 's account is biased in favour of Edward and may have been intended to <unk> a politically important marriage . Æthelwold took her to the royal manors of Twynham ( now Christchurch ) and then Wimborne Minster , symbolically important as his father 's burial place , and declared that " he would live or die there " . Lavelle sees Wimborne as strategically significant , close to Roman roads to Dorchester and Salisbury , and at a crossing point of the rivers Allen and Stour ; it was the most southern point for control of access to western Wessex and Æthelwold may have intended a division of the kingdom . 
 However , when Edward 's army approached and camped at Badbury Rings , an Iron Age hill fort four miles west of Wimborne , Æthelwold was unable to gain sufficient support to meet them in battle . Leaving behind his consort , he fled to the Danes of Northumbria , who accepted him as king . Northumbrian coins were issued at this time in the name of a king called ' <unk> ' , who is thought to have been Æthelwold . Norse sagas record traditions of a Danish king Knútr , who briefly ruled Northumbria around 900 . He is said to have been at first been repulsed by an English king called <unk> north of Cleveland , but then to have defeated him at Scarborough . In 1987 , Smyth suggested that <unk> may have been Æthelwold , but in 1995 Smyth put forward the alternative idea that the Northumbrian Danes may have accepted Æthelwold 's claim to be king of the West Saxons rather than taking him as their own king . 
 Æthelwold 's reign in Northumbria was short , in David Rollason 's view because Æthelwold saw it only as a base for gaining power in Wessex . In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex , where Rollason states that he was accepted as king by the local Vikings . However , David Dumville points out that in the next year Æthelwold persuaded the Danes in East Anglia to wage war against Edward , and Dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate Viking army in Essex . In his view Æthelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of the kingdom of Wessex in order to strengthen his claim to the throne , and he succeeded in gaining the submission of the English rulers of Essex . 
 The East Anglian Danes joined Æthelwold in a raid on Mercia , reaching as far as the fortified burh at Cricklade on the border with Wessex . He then crossed the Thames into Wessex itself to raid <unk> . Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia , but he withdrew without engaging Æthelwold in battle . The men of Kent lingered , although according to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle Edward sent seven messengers to recall them . The Danes caught up with the men of Kent to fight the Battle of the Holme . Its location is unknown but may be Holme in Cambridgeshire . The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses . Æthelwold was among the leaders on the Danish side who were killed , together with Eohric , the Viking King of East Anglia , two holds ( Danish noblemen ) , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , son of the ætheling <unk> , who was probably a kinsmen of the former king of Mercia , Burgred . Kentish losses included their two ealdormen , <unk> and Sigehelm , and an Abbot Cenwulf . 
 The achievement of the Kentish contingent put Edward 's failure to engage the Danes with his whole army in a poor light . In Cyril Hart 's view : " Undoubtedly there were recriminations , which appear to have continued to threaten Edward 's authority for some considerable period , especially in Kent ; witness the Wessex chronicler 's anxiety to find excuses for Edward 's failure to support the Kentish contingent . " Edward was later to marry Sigehelm 's daughter , Eadgifu , and Hart thinks that this may have been designed to placate his Kentish subjects . 
 The various texts of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle give different versions of the revolt . Hart states : " The oldest and more authoritative is preserved in the ' B ' text of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle ( supported in its essentials by the Latin East Anglian Chronicle ) ; the official version in the ' A ' text is clearly a late revision , intended to justify King Edward 's position and to reinforce his authority . " ' B ' describes Æthelwold as an ætheling , indicating the legitimacy of his claim for the kingship , a description omitted in ' A ' . ' A ' says that he took possession of Wimborne and <unk> without the permission of the king and his councillors ' , ' B ' against their will . ' B ' says that Æthelwold " rode away by night " from Wimborne ; ' A ' reads " stole away " . According to ' B ' , the Northumbrian Danes accepted Æthelwold as their king , and gave allegiance to him , but this is omitted in ' A ' . However , none of the texts describe him as an ætheling after his flight to Northumbria , showing that his actions were no longer thought to have a claim to legitimacy . In the view of Scott Thompson Smith , the dispute was over property as well as kingship , and the Chronicle presents Edward as the successful protector of family property against outside interests .

 According to the historian Martin Ryan : 
 What is striking about Æthelwold 's " rebellion " is the level and range of support he was able to draw on : he could call on allies from Wessex , Northumbria , East Anglia and , probably , Mercia and Essex . For a time Æthelwold had a claim to be the most powerful ruler in England . Edward 's apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded . 
 In the view of James Campbell , the bias in the sources has led historians to see Æthelwold 's rebellion as a " somewhat odd episode " , but he had a justifiable claim to the kingship , and he was nearly successful ; if he had not been killed at the Holme , he might have united England with much less warfare than ultimately proved to be necessary . " Had it not been for the chances of battle and war Æthelwold might very well have been regarded as one of the greatest figures in our island 's story " . Lavelle argues that " it is important to acknowledge the audacity of Æthelwold 's actions " and that he " well deserves to be ranked amongst the ' Nearly Men ' of early Medieval Europe " . The twelfth @-@ century Annals of St Neots called him " king of the pagans " . 
 It is not known whether he had any descendants , but the chronicler Æthelweard was a great @-@ great @-@ grandson of King Æthelred , and this may have been through Æthelwold . Shashi Jayakumar suggests the rivalry between King Eadwig and his younger brother Edgar in the 950s dates back to the conflict which resulted in the Battle of the Holme . Eadwig 's wife , Ælfgifu , was probably Æthelweard 's sister , and one of Eadwig 's supporters , Byrhtnoth , may have been descended from the Mercian royal family through the ætheling <unk> , whose son <unk> died fighting on Æthelwold 's side at the Holme . Opponents of Eadwig included his grandmother , Eadgifu , and Eadwig confiscated her property . In Jayakumar 's view : " The emergence of Ælfgifu , descendant of the ætheling Æthelwold , did not just threaten Edgar 's position , it represented a <unk> to a line and lineage with royal claims of its own ... The ancestors of Byrhtnoth and Æthelweard had in all likelihood fought together with Æthelwold on the Danish side at the Battle of the Holme , the opposite side to that which Eadgifu 's father Sigehelm had fought for . " The marriage between Eadwig and Ælfgifu was dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity , and Edgar succeeded to the throne when Eadwig died without leaving children . In the view of Nick Higham , Æthelweard shows a " lack of empathy " for Edward in his chronicle , which Higham attributes to Edward 's victory over Æthelweard 's ancestor . Æthelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century , showing that Æthelred 's descendants held on to land and power in the century after his death . Æthelweard 's grandson , Æthelnoth , was an eleventh @-@ century Archbishop of Canterbury .
