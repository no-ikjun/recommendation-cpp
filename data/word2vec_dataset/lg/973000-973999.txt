 The Nanosuit allows players to identify the threat level , and the weapons held by enemies . Players can tag enemies and items by enabling visor , and can spot enemies using Nano @-@ Vision , which detects the heat of both enemies and allies . Levels are more open @-@ ended than in Crysis 2 . Players are given more freedom , and can choose a gameplay style based on direct confrontation , or a more discreet and stealthy approach , in order to deal with enemies and to complete their objectives . There is no definite way to beat the game 's seven levels . Instead , players can take different alternate routes to reach their objectives . Players can fight against enemies utilizing a wide array of gadgets and weapons , and by using the abilities processed by the Nanosuit . They can utilize an invisibility cloak to evade enemies , prevent themselves from being detected , or to perform silent takedowns . New weapons are introduced in Crysis 3 , such as a compound bow . Players can use the bow while using the cloak . When using other firearms , the cloak is disrupted and can no longer function until it cools down . Arrows can be collected by players after use . Players can hack into enemies ' weapons , one of the game 's new features . In addition , players can hack security codes , weapon boxes , Ceph technology , mines , lasers , and sentry turrets , which can all be used to fight against enemies . Players can also upgrade and customize their weapons and <unk> . They can change the attachment and ammo types for their weapons . For instance , players can change between explosive arrows and electric arrows for their bow . The Nanosuit can be upgraded by collecting different modules scattered across the world . These upgrades can increase the suit 's properties , and strengthen or unlock new abilities for players as they progress through the game . 
 Gameplay remains similar when playing the multiplayer mode . Unlike the single @-@ player campaign , when players sprint or boost their armor in the multiplayer mode , it does not take any energy from the nanosuit . There are 8 different modes , each with 12 available maps . In each mode , special weapons with scarce ammo can be found on a map which can be picked up by players . Players can also activate a new Nanosuit ability called Rip and Throw , in which they interact with environmental objects to create obstacles for hostile players and tactical advantages for themselves . A refined kill streak system is introduced in Crysis 3 , allowing players to gain rewards by killing hostile players simultaneously while collecting their dog tag . In addition to traditional multiplayer modes , a new multiplayer mode , the Hunter mode , is featured in the game . It is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode which pits two teams of players , playing as either hunters , or troopers from CELL , against each other . The two classes are equipped with completely different weapons , and defeated troopers respawn as hunters and have to defeat their former teammates . The PC version of the game can accommodate up to 16 players , while the console versions can only support 12 players .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Players take on the role of Prophet as he returns to New York in 2047 , 24 years after the events of Crysis 2 . He discovers the city has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation . The New York City Liberty Dome is a veritable urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees , dense swamplands , and raging rivers . Within the Liberty Dome , seven distinct and treacherous environments are known as the Seven Wonders . Prophet is said to be on a " revenge mission " after uncovering the truth behind CELL 's motives for building the quarantined Nanodome . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 After the events of Crysis 2 , Psycho and Prophet travel the world looking for the Alpha Ceph , the ultimate Ceph leader . Prophet and Psycho finally trace the Alpha Ceph in Russia and imprison it . However , shortly afterwards CELL Corporation , now attempting global domination of land and technology , disables Prophet in Siberia and captures all the Nanosuit soldiers , skinning them of their suits to recover the Ceph genetics stored in them . CELL transfers Prophet to a facility to skin him . Locked in a storage device , Prophet is transported by CELL to New York , encased within a giant " Nanodome " . He is saved by a resistance force , led by Claire Fontanelli , as Prophet is the only Nanosuit holder who can stop CELL . Psycho explains to Prophet that during his absence , CELL used Ceph technology to generate unlimited energy , and gained a monopoly over the world 's power supply . Those who could not pay for energy were turned into slaves . The source of CELL 's power generation for the entire world , called System X , is located in now abandoned New York . The resistance group wants System X destroyed to free the world from CELL . 
 After Psycho and Prophet disable System X 's core , it turns out that it is a system protocol designed to contain the Alpha Ceph . However , the secondary defense protocol was initiated , causing the power facility to self @-@ destruct . The Alpha Ceph , free from containment , opens a wormhole to the Ceph homeland . They plan to send a force to invade Earth through the wormhole . With the Alpha Ceph no longer dormant , the Ceph coordinator reactivates , and a coordinated Ceph attack ensues . Prophet decides to kill the Alpha Ceph and end the alien threat . 
 After unlocking his potential ability by removing some neural blocks in his suit , Prophet learns that CELL plans to use Archangel , a satellite @-@ based energy distribution device that can draw power from the world 's power grid , as a directed energy weapon to destroy the Alpha Ceph . Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth . They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire . Prophet , Psycho , and Fontanelli board the VTOL and engage in a massive air battle with Ceph ships , eventually crashing . Fontanelli dies in the process . Psycho , saddened by her death , laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit . Encouraged to keep fighting , Psycho , now going by his real name , Michael , finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph . 
 Michael and Prophet head towards the Alpha Ceph , but are bogged down by the Ceph Master Mind . Prophet finds his way through the Ceph Army hordes and kills the Alpha Ceph which in turn kills all other Ceph troopers in the area . However , they do not have enough time to destroy the Ceph wormhole structure and the beam powering the wormhole pulls Prophet into space . Now in orbit around Earth , Prophet sees a massive Ceph warship coming through the wormhole . Recalling Archangel 's power , Prophet hacks into the satellite and uses it to destroy the warship . The explosion collapses the wormhole and Prophet is pushed back to Earth . He lands in the water near the <unk> Islands where the events of Crysis took place 27 years earlier . 
 When Prophet wakes the next morning , he is in an abandoned hut in <unk> , the same area Nomad initially encountered during the events of Crysis . As the neural blocks are removed from the Nanosuit , the suit 's outer layer is changed to reform Prophet 's former physical body , resurrecting him . He walks out onto the beach and relinquishes his past by throwing his tags into the water . He then decides to use his actual name " Laurence Barnes " from then on . 
 = = Development = = 
 Crysis 3 's development began in February 2011 , two months before the release of Crysis 2 . The game 's development was handled by Crytek Frankfurt ; its multiplayer was handled by Crytek UK . Its development budget was significantly smaller than that of Crysis 2 , as resources and manpower were relocated to develop Homefront 2 and Ryse : Son of Rome . As a result , only about 100 people worked on the game during its 23 months development . The game 's budget was about $ 66 million . 
 Crysis 2 was criticised for abandoning the island setting of the original Crysis . The studio decided to recreate New York City and set the game in a post @-@ apocalyptic environment . To do this , the company introduced a concept called " Nanodome " , a dome set up by CELL to isolate New York City , which had fallen to ruins over the years . Plants have grown significantly , leading to an environment that is a mix between an urban environment and the jungle setting of the past two games . The decision was made to create this environment as the team wanted to stay away from typical urban war field shown in other games of the same genre . Instead of having a rainforest in the abandoned wasteland , the Nanodome is used to fix the shape of the forest , and Crytek hoped that it would define the atmosphere and the narrative of the game . 
 The game 's main protagonist is Prophet , a nanosuit holder who had previously appeared in Crysis and Crysis 2 . He returns in Crysis 3 as Crytek considered him as the most complex character who has the longest heritage in the series . When designing him , the team took inspiration from the protagonist of District 9 . Psycho from the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead returns as Prophet 's companion . The game revolves around Prophet attempting to redeem himself by taking revenge after finding his former squad members are dead . The story explores the themes of redemption and revenge as well as the relationship between humans and technology . Mike Read , the game 's producer , summed up the game calling it " human " . Unlike Crysis 2 's protagonist Alcatraz who does not speak throughout the game , Prophet is voiced in Crysis 3 in an effort to deliver more emotional connection . The company made use of performance capture to record actor 's performance , body movements and facial expressions . According to Read , this helps the company to create a more affecting and emotional story . This was not done in the previous games due to technological limitations . 
 Unlike the original Crysis , which gives players more freedom to explore , Crysis 2 was criticized for being too linear . As a result , in developing the game 's campaign , Crytek attempted to integrate the two major aspects of the previous installments , the freedom given in the original Crysis and the linearity of Crysis 2 . Despite not being as open as the first half of Crysis , maps are significantly larger in this game than in previous installments . Several linear segments were preserved . Crytek referred to the game 's map as " action bubbles " , which do not necessarily fix players in a small place but allows them to move around freely . <unk> was preserved as developers considered having such segments present could help players to experience " epic " moments and " massive Michael Bay " moments . Crytek hoped that by opening up levels they could give players a sense of control , allowing them to plan and execute strategy . The game 's seven levels were developed simultaneously , and the focus phrases of gameplay , art and optimization of a level was about one to two weeks . 
 Another theme featured in the game is " hunt " and , as a result , many weapons were built around the concept . The studio wanted to stay away from typical weapon design and did not want a weapon to simply differentiate between Crysis 3 and Crysis 2 . The team aimed to use weapons to create narrative . The game features a compound bow which is reminiscent of a weapon that a hunter often uses . The game 's gameplay is built based on three pillars , access , adapt , and attack . Players are often tasked to do detect , spot , and to learn their enemies ' behaviors and patterns before attacking . With the bow , players are encouraged to play the game stealthily , extending the game 's combat . A new feature called " hacking " was developed . According to Crytek , hacking plays a huge role throughout the game . The game 's combat was also made more fast @-@ paced than that of its predecessors . 
 One of the major goals in developing Crysis 3 was to " push graphics " , as the company considered that they can effectively assist and drive gameplay and create immersion for the player . The game is powered by CryEngine 3 , Crytek 's proprietary engine . It utilizes some of the newest features of CryEngine 3 , such as volumetric fog shadows , improved dynamic vegetation , dynamic caustics , improved area lighting and diffuse shadows . After Crysis 2 received some criticism from PC gamers because of the design sacrifices made due to the limitations of the older console hardware , Crytek responded that the PC version of Crysis 3 will figuratively " melt down PCs " due to its high system requirements . The PC version of the game required a DirectX 11 compatible video card and operating system . Similar to Crysis 2 , the game is a multi @-@ platform title , and Crytek considered the development of the game 's console version a huge obstacle they had to " rip the engine to pieces " so as to get the game running on console . 
 The multiplayer portion of the game was created by Crytek UK . It was designed to improve the efficiency of the Nanosuit in an online environment . In an effort to create memorable maps , the team designed routes that can only be discovered after a player 's first playthrough . Crytek UK hoped that this approach would help players to become more immersed in the game 's universe . The Hunter mode , introduced in this game , originated from a TimeSplitters 's Gladiator mode . The decision to make sprint energy separated from the nanosuit energy was due to the development team 's desire to create larger levels , and help players to navigate the map in a faster way . 
 The game 's music was composed by Borislav Slavov , who had previously led the soundtrack development of Crysis 2 . New music was composed for the game , while some other themes from the past installments were rearranged . The theme of the game 's music is changed so as to fit the game 's post @-@ apocalyptic setting . The game 's music is dynamic and is designed to reflect players ' gameplay style . As a result , when players use a radical approach to complete missions , more exciting background music will be played . In contrast , when players are playing stealthily , the background music will be relatively calmer and quieter . 
 = = Marketing and release = = 
 In November 2010 , Nathan Camarillo , an executive producer from Crytek , revealed that the Crysis series could potentially be a very long @-@ running franchise , as the company considered the series ' universe easy for players to get into and become invested in . He added : " As the franchise grows down the line , there 's no reason it can 't be as big [ as Call of Duty ] " . The story elements of the game had already been planned in January 2011 . Despite that , Cevat Yerli , Crytek 's CEO , claimed that if Crysis 2 was not a successful title , Crytek would not develop its sequel . In March 2012 , Crytek teased an " absolutely fantastic " project and announced that a full reveal of the game would be held in April 2012 . The game was accidentally revealed by EA on its web store on 11 April 2012 . It was removed immediately from the store but the title was later officially announced on 16 April 2012 . Filmmaker Albert Hughes was commissioned to produce The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3 , a series of six short stylized videos , each of which features a different aspect of the game . 
 A PC @-@ only closed alpha version of the multiplayer was released to selected Origin users on 31 October 2012 . The test began on 2 November and ended on 9 November 2012 . A public multiplayer beta containing two maps ( " Museum " and " Airport " ) and two game modes ( " Crash Site " and " Hunter " ) was available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console platforms , as well as for the PC through Origin . The beta was made available on 29 January 2013 and ended on 12 February 2013 . Crytek and EA announced that 3 million people participated in the beta . 
 Crysis 3 was released worldwide on 19 February 2013 in the US and 21 February 2013 in the UK for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . The Wii U version was cancelled after relations between Nintendo and EA became troubled . The Hunter Edition , which features exclusive in @-@ game items , and early access to the compound bow in the multiplayer portion of the game , was released alongside the game . Players who had pre @-@ ordered the game could also get the original Crysis for free . On 4 March 2015 , the game was made available for Android via Nvidia Shield . The Crysis Trilogy bundle was released on 20 February 2014 consisting of the original , the Deluxe Edition of Crysis , along with other games in the series . 
 On 30 May 2013 , Electronic Arts announced The Lost Island downloadable content ( DLC ) . The multiplayer @-@ only DLC includes two weapons , four maps , and two competitive multiplayer modes called " Frenzy " and " Possession " . The downloadable content was released worldwide on 4 July 2013 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 .

 Crysis 3 has received generally positive reviews from critics . Aggregating review websites Metacritic rated the Xbox 360 version 76 / 100 , the PlayStation 3 version 77 / 100 and the PC version 76 / 100 . 
 The visuals and graphics of the game were widely praised by reviewers . Christian Donlan of Eurogamer praised the game 's stable frame rate . Furthermore , he considered the game 's environmental design " artful " . Matthew Rorie of GameSpy thought that the game was visually stunning . He applauded the team at Crytek for creating an environment that is " both inhospitable and <unk> beautiful " . Matt Bertz of Game Informer praised the visuals powered by CryEngine , and considered the game one of the best @-@ looking games ever created . He especially praised its realistic environments , water effects , and character facial animation . Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also praised the mix of the decayed urban environment and the rainforest , saying that it made the game striking to look at . 
 The game 's design was praised by various reviewers . Donlan considered the game 's support of stealth a welcoming addition , despite calling the game 's last level a forgettable experience . Rorie praised the game 's map design ; he opined that the opened @-@ up levels encourage exploration . Bertz considered the game 's world had successfully captured a balance between the settings of its predecessors , and that the larger levels allowed players to deploy strategy before performing attacks . He added that some of the best missions were featured in the later stages of the game . Tristan Ogilvie of IGN thought that the control was almost perfect , despite criticizing the clumsy control of several segments which require players to control vehicles . VanOrd criticized the game for being too easy for players to play . 
 The game 's online multiplayer received positive reviews from critics . Josh Harmon of Electronic Gaming Monthly thought that the game 's multiplayer was better than the campaign , and that it made the overall experience more enjoyable . Donlan praised the Hunter mode ; he believed that it had delivered a tense experience . Bertz echoed similar thoughts , but felt that the mode 's appeal was not as good as typical modes like Domination . As well , he criticized the multiplayer 's respawn system and terrain @-@ design . Lorenzo Veloria of GamesRadar thought that some of the game modes were unique and entertaining , despite noting some technical issues . Michael Rougeau of Complex criticized the Hunter mode , calling it " unbalanced " . He furthered criticized the game for lacking a co @-@ operative multiplayer mode . David Hinkle of Joystiq also noted some design errors in the Hunter mode . 
 The story was not so well received by critics compared to the game 's other aspects . Harmon thought that several emotional segments of the game failed to deliver , as well as criticizing the forgettable storyline and plot twists . Despite that , he praised the game 's finale and considered that it brought a proper closure to the Crysis trilogy . In contrast , Donlan commented that it was not quite the conclusion the series deserved . Rorie thought that the story was more mature than its predecessors , despite having a relatively weak start and short length of about six hours . Bertz opined that the story was the most cohesive of the titles in the series . Veloria , however , criticized the game 's narrative ; she added that it was uninspiring due to the lack of character development and interesting dialogue . In contrast , Ogilvie thought that the game 's dialogue and voice @-@ acting were excellent , citing the game 's <unk> characters that its predecessors failed to achieve . He considered the game 's storytelling a massive improvement for the series . 
 Many reviewers considered Crysis 3 was an evolution of the series instead of a groundbreaking revolution . Rorie criticized the game for being unambitious , and that despite the game 's overall refinements , it had not strayed far enough from its predecessors . He concluded that Crysis 3 did not achieve the revolution brought by the original Crysis . Veloria thought that the title failed to bring any new element to the genre , but the overall experience delivered by the game was still satisfying . Evan Lahti of PC Gamer commented that the game did not surprise players , and that the title presented a feeling of Crysis 2 : Episode 2 instead of a proper sequel .

 During its debut release week and the next , Crysis 3 was the best @-@ selling retail game in the UK closely followed by Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance . It sold 205 @,@ 000 copies in 12 days in North America during its debut month . The title , along with Dead Space 3 , another EA title that was released in the same month , failed to meet the company 's sales expectations . Cevat Yerli , Crytek 's CEO , was also disappointed by the sales of Crysis 3 . Nevertheless , he considered Crysis 3 the best game the studio had produced so far . 
 = = Future = = 
 With Crysis 3 being the end of the Crysis trilogy , Crytek teased that the series would have a " radical future " . Yerli confirmed that the next installment would not be called Crysis 4 , as he considered such a title " misleading " . On 12 June 2012 , it was revealed that Crytek would focus only on free @-@ to @-@ play titles following the release of Crysis 3 . 
 = 2008 Philadelphia Phillies season = 
 The Philadelphia Phillies ' 2008 season was the 126th in the history of the franchise . The team finished with a regular season record of 92 – 70 , first in the National League East . In the post @-@ season , the Phillies won the World Series ; this was the first major sports championship for Philadelphia since the 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals . During the season , they were managed by Charlie Manuel . 
 The Phillies opened the season by posting their first winning April since 2003 . They also scored 60 runs over 5 games in late May in a sweep over the Colorado Rockies and accrued a 14 – 4 record over 18 games entering the month of June . The Phillies ' performance declined in late June , but they improved after the All @-@ Star break , going 9 – 6 immediately following the midseason hiatus . Closer Brad Lidge earned eight saves in those games , and did not blow a save throughout the season and the postseason . Philadelphia traded sweeps with the Los Angeles Dodgers in August and went 13 – 3 in their last 16 games , taking advantage of a late swoon by the New York Mets for the second year in a row to capture the division crown . The team won its position in the playoffs after its second consecutive East Division title . The Phillies also posted the best road record in the National League , at 44 – 37 . 
 Philadelphia defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Division Series ( NLDS ) , 3 – 1 , and the Dodgers in the National League Championship Series ( NLCS ) , 4 – 1 , to win the National League Pennant and advance to the World Series .. In the World Series , the Phillies defeated the Tampa Bay Rays , 4 – 1 , to win their first championship in 28 years , ending the Curse of Billy Penn . Phillies starting pitcher Cole Hamels was named the most valuable player of the NLCS and the World Series . 
 Statistical leaders in batting for the 2008 team included center fielder Shane Victorino ( batting average , .293 ) , first baseman Ryan Howard ( home runs , 48 ; runs batted in , 146 ) , and second baseman Chase Utley ( runs scored , 113 ) . For their accomplishments , Howard won the Josh Gibson Award for the National League , and Utley won his third consecutive Silver Slugger Award . Pitching leaders included left @-@ handed starting pitcher Hamels ( innings pitched , <unk> ⁄ 3 ) , left @-@ hander starter Jamie Moyer ( wins , 16 ) , and right @-@ handed relief pitcher Lidge ( saves , 41 ) . Lidge won the DHL Delivery Man of the Year and the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year awards for his performance during the season . Victorino and shortstop Jimmy Rollins also won Gold Glove awards for their play in the field .

 On October 29 , 2007 , Charlie Manuel signed an extension to manage the Phillies for two more years . All of the coaches from the 2007 division championship season were also retained . However , Davey Lopes underwent treatment for cancer and had to be replaced on an interim basis in the early part of the season . The Phillies re @-@ signed left @-@ handed relief pitcher J. C. Romero to a new two @-@ year contract after a dominating 2007 , in which he struck out 42 batters in 56 1 ⁄ 3 innings pitched while posting a 1 @.@ 92 earned run average . Outfielder Michael Bourn and right @-@ handed pitcher Geoff Geary were traded to Houston for closer Brad Lidge and infielder Eric Bruntlett on November 7 , 2007 . Outfielder Chris Roberson was traded to Baltimore for cash in January 2008 , while third baseman Pedro Feliz , outfielder Geoff Jenkins , and outfielder So Taguchi arrived as free agents ; Feliz was signed on January 31 , while Jenkins and Taguchi signed the month before .

 On February 16 , 2008 , Mets center fielder Carlos Beltrán made a statement regarding the upcoming season .

I have no doubt in that . We 've got what it takes . To Jimmy Rollins : We are the team to beat . " Beltran 's statement echoed Rollins ' 2007 assertion that the Phillies were " the team to beat in the NL East — finally " . Inasmuch as Beltran had imitated Rollins ' 2007 preseason prediction , Rollins arrived in camp for Spring training and responded : 
 " There isn 't a team in the National League that 's better than us . The pressure 's back on them if you ask me . They were on paper the best team in the division last year and they were supposed to win , and they didn 't . One , there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn 't happen , and two , has anyone ever heard of plagiarism ? That was pretty good , especially coming from him . He 's a quiet guy , so it was probably shocking when he said it . Not shocking in a bad way , like ' Wow , I can 't believe he said that .

 = = = = March / April = = = = 
 The Phillies opened the season against the Washington Nationals at home on March 31 . They failed to win any of their first three series , losing two of three against the Nationals and New York Mets , with a four @-@ game split against the Cincinnati Reds between those series . The Phillies won their next two series against the Chicago Cubs and the Houston Astros . After dropping a second series to the Mets , the Phillies finished the month with 15 wins and 12 losses . They did not achieve a three @-@ game sweep against any team in the opening month , nor were they swept . By winning at least one game in each series , the Phillies were able to achieve their first winning April in several seasons , and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance in 1993 . 
 With a batting average of .360 and his Major League Baseball @-@ leading 11 home runs , Chase Utley paced the team 's offense , followed closely by a resurgent Pat Burrell and his 25 runs batted in . Though team speed was hampered by the loss of Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins to the disabled list , the latter for the first time in his career , the Phillies still pushed forward to a 15 – 13 record , including their Opening Day loss to Washington . The pitching rotation was led by ace Cole Hamels , who led the team in wins ( 3 ) , earned run average ( ERA ) ( 2 @.@ 70 ) , and innings pitched ( 43 1 ⁄ 3 ) . Reliever J. C. Romero and new closer Brad Lidge both went the entire month without sacrificing a single run , over 12 1 ⁄ 3 and 11 innings respectively . 
 = = = = May = = = = 
 The Phillies did not achieve their first three @-@ game series sweep until almost the end of May , taking two from the San Francisco Giants , the Arizona Diamondbacks ( splitting the series 2 – 2 ) , the Atlanta Braves , and the Nationals , and dropping two to the Giants , the Toronto Blue Jays , and the Astros . However , the Phillies ' first sweep was achieved in dramatic fashion , as the offense broke out for 60 runs in five games , including a 20 – 5 win over the Colorado Rockies . 
 Though several fill @-@ in players , including Brad Harman and T. J. Bohn , substituted during Victorino 's and Rollins ' absence , none was more valuable to the team during May than Jayson Werth . Expected to be primarily a platoon player coming into the season , Werth showed positive form . While Utley slowed down , Werth had a game with three home runs and stole four bases in the month . However , as Rollins and Victorino returned , Werth was lost to the disabled list . Ryan Howard broke out of his early @-@ season slump , batting .245 in May , nearly an 80 @-@ point increase from his average in April , and hitting ten home runs . Hometown pitcher Jamie Moyer also became the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history to defeat all 30 teams in the league on May 26 in a 20 – 5 Phillies win over Colorado . 
 = = = = June = = = = 
 June was a tale of two halves for the Phillies , as they started June with a strong combination of offense and pitching . From May 26 to June 13 , the team posted a 14 – 4 record , starting their run with a 15 – 6 win over the Astros and ended with a 20 – 2 win over the Cardinals , as their record reached a first @-@ half high of 13 games over .500 at 41 – 28 . However , the offense took a downturn as the Phillies pitchers began to sacrifice more runs in the latter part of the month . The Phillies went 3 – 11 over the remainder of June , as the pitchers allowed an average of 4 @.@ 79 runs per game , compared to the offense 's 3 @.@ 36 runs scored per game . This was punctuated by a season @-@ high six @-@ game losing streak . The poor records coincided with the Phillies ' stretch of interleague play for 2008 , as they were swept by the Angels , and lost their series with the Red Sox , A 's , and Rangers , in addition to dropping two NL series against the Cardinals and Marlins . While Hamels and Kyle Kendrick each managed to post a 3 – 1 record in the rotation , the other starters ( Moyer , Adam Eaton , and Brett Myers ) were not so lucky . Myers ' poor performance received arguably the most scrutiny , based on management 's decision to move him back to the rotation from the bullpen after the 2007 season . Myers would eventually accept an option to Triple @-@ A to work on his mechanical issues and confidence . 
 = = = = July = = = = 
 July began with the announcement that Chase Utley and Brad Lidge would represent the team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game ; Utley garnered the most votes of all National League players . Pat Burrell was also selected as a " Final Vote " candidate , but lost out on the opportunity for his first All @-@ Star appearance to Milwaukee outfielder Corey Hart . The Phillies went 8 – 5 in July before the All @-@ Star break , compiling a four @-@ game win streak , a four @-@ game losing streak , and winning four of their last five . The team posted a sweep of the Braves , a series loss to the Mets , and series wins over the Cardinals and the Diamondbacks . 
 In a move to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race , the Phillies traded three minor league players , including second baseman Adrian Cardenas , pitcher Josh <unk> , and outfielder Matthew Spencer to the Oakland Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17 . The move would prove necessary , as Blanton 's start was the only game of their next series against the Mets that the Phillies would win ; bullpen pitchers earned the victory ( Chad Durbin ) or suffered the loss ( Ryan Madson and Romero ) in each game of the series . The Phillies managed to go 7 – 5 after the All @-@ Star break within their own division , dropping series to the Marlins and Mets , but besting the Braves and sweeping the Nationals . Brad Lidge posted a save in six straight Phillies wins , and the team ended the month on a five @-@ game winning streak , with a final record of 15 – 10 . 
 = = = = August = = = = 
 The Phillies opened August by taking two of three from the Cardinals , though they followed that by dropping a series to the Marlins . On August 7 , the Phillies acquired left @-@ handed reliever Scott Eyre from the Cubs . After taking two of three from the Pittsburgh Pirates , the Phillies went west for their first trip to Dodger Stadium , dropping three consecutive games to the Los Angeles Dodgers . The first game saw the team sacrifice a 7 @-@ run lead that they could not overcome , and the second two of the series were both blown by the bullpen . The Dodgers ' sweep in Los Angeles was completed as the Phillies dropped the last game of the series , leaving them out of first place in the division . However , the Phillies struck back , taking two of three from both the Padres and the Nationals , and completing a revenge sweep of the Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park . The following evening , the Phillies saw starter Jamie Moyer give up seven runs over the first three innings of their game against the Mets . However , the offense made up that deficit by scoring the tying run in the ninth ; catcher Chris Coste capped the comeback by going four @-@ for @-@ four coming off of the bench and driving in the winning run with a bases @-@ loaded single to deep center in the bottom of the 13th inning . They ended up splitting the short series with the Mets and the next four @-@ game series against the Cubs to close out the " dog days " of summer .

 With a nearly @-@ full slate of division rivals in the final month , the Phillies opened by dropping series to the Nationals and Marlins , with a 2 – 1 series win over division leaders New York between the two losses . However , they pushed back into contention on the back of strong pitching , sweeping the Brewers over a four @-@ game set while allowing only eight runs . Brett Myers ' return to the rotation in late July bolstered the strength of the Phillies ' starters toward the end of the season ; he boasted a 7 – 2 record and a 1 @.@ 80 ERA from his return until September 15 . Taking their winning ways south to Atlanta , the Phillies completed a series sweep of the Braves ; the Phillies also swept the Braves at Turner Field for the season and handed the Braves franchise its first nine @-@ game home losing streak against a single team since 1909 .

 Following their four @-@ game sweep of Milwaukee in the beginning of September , the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1 , defeating the Brewers in Game 1 . Cole Hamels was the victor , earning his first career playoff win . Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work . Chase Utley batted in two runs , while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game . In Game 2 , Shane Victorino 's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed , as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs . The Phillies ' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth . In a reversal of fortune , the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3 , and it proved to be enough to win the game . Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally in the top of the ninth inning , keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4 . However , the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series , 3 – 1 . Jimmy Rollins , Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs , and Burrell contributed a three @-@ run homer as well .

 Facing off against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS for the fourth time in history , Derek Lowe stifled the Phillies ' offense for the first five innings of Game 1 ; however , the Phillies came from behind to score three runs in the sixth on home runs by Utley and Burrell . Hamels followed his stellar NLDS performance with a seven @-@ inning , two @-@ run outing , and Brad Lidge earned his 44th consecutive save in 2008 . Manny Ramírez ' home run could not overcome the Phillies ' potent offense in Game 2 , who scored four runs in both the second and third innings to win the game , 8 – 5 . Starting pitcher Brett Myers was 3 for 3 at the plate , driving in three runs to help his own cause . He was supported by two @-@ hit performances from Victorino and Greg Dobbs , who started at third base . Tensions escalated the following night in the third inning . After a <unk> and a throw @-@ behind by the Phillies in the previous game and no retaliation from the Dodgers , Los Angeles starter Hiroki Kuroda threw a fastball up and in to Shane Victorino , narrowly missing his head . Victorino gestured angrily , warning Kuroda to throw at other parts of his body , but not his head . This soon escalated to clearing the benches , and the Dodgers rode their momentum to the end of the game , defeating the Phillies 7 – 2 after posting five runs in the first inning . The Phillies staged another comeback in the following game . Down 5 – 3 in the eighth inning , two home runs by Shane Victorino and pinch @-@ hitter Matt Stairs plated four runs and put the Dodgers in a hole out of which they could not climb ; the Phillies won the game 7 – 5 . In the first decisions of the series for either bullpen , right @-@ handed reliever Ryan Madson got the win for Philadelphia , while Cory Wade suffered the loss for Los Angeles . Dodgers fans were hoping for a comeback in game five ; however , Jimmy Rollins started the contest with a leadoff homer off of Chad Billingsley , who was forced out of the game in the third inning because of a pair of Phillies runs . Philadelphia added two runs on a trio of Rafael Furcal errors in the fifth . Ramírez did bring the Dodger Stadium crowd to life with a solo homer in the bottom of the sixth , but the Dodgers never threatened after that . The Phillies won the series in five games ; winning pitcher Cole Hamels was named the series Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) . Thus , the Phillies advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1993 .

 The Phillies ' offensive woes seemed in the distant past as the lineup broke out in a big way during Game 4 . Led by Ryan Howard 's 3 @-@ for @-@ 4 , 2 home run performance , and home runs by Jayson Werth and starting pitcher Joe Blanton , the Phillies pushed 10 runs across the plate . Blanton became the first World Series pitcher to hit a home run in 34 years , in addition to a strong performance on the mound , pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs on four hits . Roster addition Eric Hinske hit a home run for the Rays , as did left fielder Carl Crawford , his second of the series . 
 = = = = Game 5 = = = = 
 Philadelphia scored in the first inning for the third consecutive game , taking a 2 – 0 lead when Shane Victorino and Pedro Feliz batted in Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell respectively . Tampa Bay cut the lead in half in the fourth inning ; Carlos Peña doubled and was batted in on Evan Longoria 's single , both players ' first hits of the Series . The Rays then tied the game in the sixth inning when B. J. Upton scored from second base on a Peña single . The game was suspended after the top of the sixth inning due to rain , making it the first game in World Series history to not be played through to completion or declared a tie . 
 After the game was suspended , home plate umpire Tim Tschida told reporters that he and his crew ordered the players off the field because the wind and rain threatened to make the game " comical " . Chase Utley agreed , saying that by the middle of the sixth inning , " the infield was basically underwater . " Rain continued to fall in Philadelphia on Tuesday , further postponing the game to Wednesday . 
 Under normal conditions , games are considered to be official games after five innings , or four and a half if the home team is leading at that point . However , both Rays and Phillies management knew before the first pitch that Commissioner Bud Selig , who is responsible for the scheduling of post @-@ season games , would not allow a team to clinch the Series by winning a rain @-@ shortened game . Thus , the game resumed on October 29 in the middle of the sixth inning at Citizens Bank Park , with the Phillies batting in the bottom of the sixth inning . Pinch hitter Geoff Jenkins led off with a double and was bunted to third by Rollins . Batting third , Jayson Werth batted in Jenkins to give the Phillies the lead , 3 – 2 . Rocco <unk> re @-@ tied the game at three runs with a solo home run in the top of the seventh inning , but Jason Bartlett was thrown out at home to end the inning on a fake throw @-@ over by Utley , who could not get the ball to first in time to catch the speedy Akinori Iwamura . In the bottom of the seventh , Pat Burrell led off with a double ; Eric Bruntlett entered as a pinch runner and scored on a hit by Pedro Feliz to put the Phillies up by a run again . Brad Lidge gave up a single and a stolen base but struck out Eric Hinske for the final out , sealing the Phillies ' first World Series championship since the 1980 World Series , and the city 's first major sports championship in 25 years . 
 = = = Breaking the curse = = = 
 The alleged curse of Billy Penn was sometimes used to explain the failure of professional sports teams based in Philadelphia to win championships . In March 1987 , One Liberty Place , a 945 @-@ foot ( 288 m ) tall skyscraper , opened three blocks from the 548 ft ( 167 m ) high statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia City Hall . For many decades , a gentlemen 's agreement stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no building in the city that would rise above this statue . The supposed curse had gained such prominence in Philadelphia that a documentary film entitled The Curse of William Penn was produced about it . 
 The curse ended on October 29 , 2008 when the Phillies won the World Series , a year and four months after a statuette of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam put in place during the June 2007 topping @-@ off of the Comcast Center , then the tallest building in the city .

 Keechaka Vadham ( English : The Extermination of Keechaka ) alternatively spelt as Keechaka <unk> , is an Indian silent film produced , directed , filmed and edited by R. Nataraja Mudaliar . The film is based on an episode from the Hindu epic Mahabharata focusing on the characters Kichaka and Draupadi ; it stars Raju Mudaliar as Keechaka and Jeevarathnam as Draupadi , the female lead . 
 Keechaka Vadham was the first silent film made in South India . The film was shot in five weeks at Nataraja Mudaliar 's studio , India Film Company . Despite being a silent film , the cast members were from Tamil Nadu , hence it was also considered the first Tamil film . Keechaka Vadham received critical acclaim upon its release and went on to become a commercially successful venture . The film 's success prompted Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of similar historical films . Because no print of the film is known to survive , this makes it a lost film .

 <unk> , a wealthy landowner based in Thanjavur , had owned a Williamson 35mm camera and a printer purchased in England . R. Nataraja Mudaliar , then an automobile dealer in Madras , had taken the entire equipment from him at a price of less than ₹ 2 @,@ 000 , thereby making his debut in the film industry . Nataraja Mudaliar developed a passion for moving pictures after watching the films of Dadasaheb Phalke . At the time cinematographers from Britain were filming a documentary on Lord Curzon , then the Governor @-@ General and Viceroy of India . Nataraja Mudaliar got introduced to Stewart Smith , one of the cinematographers who worked in the documentary , and learned about the basics of photography in film @-@ making through him . This eventually led to Nataraja Mudaliar establishing his production house , India Film Company . He brought together some of his business associates , allowing them to invest in the production house , and established South India 's first film studio on Miller 's Road , Purasawalkam , Madras . 
 Nataraja Mudaliar sought the advice of his friend , <unk> <unk> Mudaliar , one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance of Tamil Theatre , who suggested that he should <unk> the story of the Mahabharata characters Draupadi and Kichaka . Some of Nataraja Mudaliar 's relatives objected to it as they felt that it was not a proper story for his debut venture . But Nataraja Mudaliar decided to proceed and launched his maiden film titled Keechaka Vadham , which was based on an episode from the Mahabharatha . The episode follows the attempts made by Keechaka , one of the generals of King Virata , to woo and marry Draupadi before she reports about it to Bhima , who kills him . Nataraja Mudaliar was not a writer , so he had to take assistance from his close friend C. <unk> , a lawyer by profession . Besides writing the screenplay , <unk> agreed to coach artistes on sets . Nataraja Mudaliar engaged stage actors Raja Mudaliar and Jeevarathnam to play the roles of Keechaka and Draupadi respectively . The total budget of the film was ₹ 35 @,@ 000 , which was then considered high . 
 According to film historian S. Muthiah , filming began in 1917 , and was shot in a span of five weeks . The entire film was shot at the India Film Company . The film 's intertitles were written in English , Tamil and Hindi . The Tamil intertitles were written by <unk> <unk> Mudaliar while the Hindi intertitles were written by Mahatma Gandhi 's son Devdas Gandhi . Nataraja Mudaliar also handled the film 's production , cinematography and editing . Despite being a silent film , the cast was filled with Tamil people , hence it was considered the first Tamil film . The final length of the film was 6 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) .

 Keechaka Vadham was the first silent film made in South India . According to film historian Randor Guy , Nataraja Mudaliar established a film laboratory of his own in Bangalore to process the film negatives as there was no film laboratory in Madras . Nataraja Mudaliar believed that Bangalore 's colder climate " would be kind to his exposed film stock " . He processed the film negatives there each weekend and return on Monday morning to resume the film 's shooting . 
 According to Muthiah , Keechaka Vadham was released in January 1918 at the Elphinstone Theatre . He states that the film netted ₹ 50 @,@ 000 after being screened throughout India and in Burma , Ceylon , the Federated Malay States and Singapore resulting in a yield of ₹ 15 @,@ 000 , a " tidy profit in those days . " According to writer Firoze Rangoonwalla , a reviewer from The Mail rated the film 's success highly by commenting " It has been prepared with great care and is drawing full houses " . With the film 's critical and commercial success , Nataraja Mudaliar had " created history " . No print of it is known to survive , so it is considered a lost film . 
 The success of the film incited Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of historical films such as Draupadi <unk> ( 1918 ) , Lava Kusa ( 1919 ) , Shiv Leela ( 1919 ) , Rukmini Satyabhama ( 1922 ) and Mahi Ravana ( 1923 ) . In 1923 , the death of his son that occurred in a fire accident which also burnt up his entire studio led Nataraja Mudaliar to retire from filmmaking and close up shop . Nataraja Mudaliar is widely recognised as the father of Tamil cinema and his films helped in laying the foundation for the South Indian cinema industry . Nataraja Mudaliar 's work inspired <unk> <unk> , son of <unk> <unk> Naidu , later revered as the father of Telugu cinema , and J. C. Daniel , who was later revered as the father of Malayalam cinema .

 = USS Nebraska ( BB @-@ 14 ) = 
 USS Nebraska ( BB @-@ 14 ) was a Virginia @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy , the second of five members of the class , and the first ship to carry her name . She was built by the Moran Brothers shipyard in Seattle , Washington , with her keel laying in July 1902 and her launching in October 1904 . Slipping into the water eleven minutes ahead of schedule , her quick thinking sponsor , Mary Nain Mickey , the daughter of Nebraska state governor John H. Mickey , still managed to christen her before she slipped out of reach . The completed ship was commissioned into the US Navy in July 1907 . The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns , and she was capable of a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Nebraska joined the Great White Fleet after it reached the west coast of the United States in 1908 and continued with it during its circumnavigation of the globe . From 1909 to 1914 , the ship conducted normal training and ceremonial duties with the Atlantic Fleet . She was deployed twice to Mexico during the Mexican Revolution , in mid @-@ 1914 and mid @-@ 1916 , before being decommissioned briefly in 1916 . She was reactivated shortly before the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , and was thereafter used as a training ship and later as a convoy escort . After the war , she transported American soldiers back from France , and in 1919 she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet , though she remained in service for less than a year , being decommissioned in July 1920 . The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty mandated her disposal , which was effected in November 1923 , when she was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Nebraska was 441 feet 3 inches ( 134 @.@ 49 m ) long overall and had a beam of 76 ft 3 in ( 23 @.@ 24 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 9 in ( 7 @.@ 24 m ) . She displaced 14 @,@ 948 long tons ( 15 @,@ 188 t ) as designed and up to 16 @,@ 094 long tons ( 16 @,@ 352 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 19 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) and twelve coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch / 40 Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) / 45 guns and twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 guns . The 8 @-@ inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets ; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets , with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel . The 6 @-@ inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried twelve 3 @-@ inch / 50 guns , mounted in casemates along the side of the hull , and twelve 3 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Nebraska carried four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . 
 Nebraska 's main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 6 in ( 152 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets ( and the secondary turrets on top of them ) had 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had the 10 in ( 254 mm ) of armor plating . The conning tower had 9 in ( 229 mm ) thick sides .

 The keel for Nebraska was laid down at the Moran Brother 's Shipyard in Seattle , Washington on 4 July 1902 . She was launched on 7 October 1904 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1907 , the last member of the class to enter service . Her first commander was Captain Reginald F. Nicholson . After entering service , she conducted shakedown cruises and had minor alterations made . In May 1908 , she steamed to San Francisco , arriving on the 6th . There , she joined the Great White Fleet , which had departed Hampton Roads , Virginia , the previous year on the first leg of its global cruise . Nebraska replaced the battleship USS Alabama ( BB @-@ 8 ) , and the fleet departed San Francisco on 7 July . 
 The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific , with a visit to Hawaii on the way . Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne , Sydney , and Auckland . After leaving Australia , the fleet turned north for the Philippines , stopping in Manila , before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama . Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November . The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean ; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said , Egypt . The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar , where an international fleet of British , Russian , French , and Dutch warships greeted the Americans . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 , having traveled 46 @,@ 729 nautical miles ( 86 @,@ 542 km ; 53 @,@ 775 mi ) . There , they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 After the conclusion of the ceremonies , Nebraska remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet . In late 1909 she took part in the Hudson @-@ Fulton Celebration in New York . The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany , Britain , France , Italy , and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson 's discovery of the Hudson River . In 1912 , Nebraska took part in a ceremony for the centennial anniversary of Louisiana 's entrance into the United States . The ship was deployed to Mexico twice to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution , the first from 1 May to 21 June 1914 , and the second from 1 June to 13 October 1916 . For these actions , the ship was awarded the Mexican Service Medal . The ship was briefly decommissioned in 1916 , but returned to service on 3 April 1917 .

 Three days after Nebraska was recommissioned , the United States declared war on Germany over the latter 's unrestricted submarine warfare campaign , thereby joining World War I. The ship was assigned to the 3rd Division , Battleship Force of the Atlantic Fleet , and on 13 April , she joined the rest of the fleet for battle training in the Chesapeake Bay . She remained on the eastern coast of the United States and was tasked with training guard crews for transport ships . On 15 April 1918 , she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance . On 16 May , Nebraska embarked the remains of the recently deceased Uruguayan ambassador , Carlos <unk> , at Hampton Roads . She departed that day with the armored cruiser Pittsburgh — the flagship of the Pacific Fleet — and arrived in Montevideo , Uruguay on 10 June . The commander of the Pacific Fleet came aboard Nebraska for the transfer ceremonies . The two ships left Montevideo on 15 June and reached Hampton Roads on 26 July . 
 Starting in September , Nebraska began to be employed as an escort for convoys to Europe . On the 17th , she departed New York with convoy HX 49 , a group of eighteen ships ; the rest of the escort included the destroyer Dent and the armed merchant cruiser ( AMC ) Rochester , and the British AMC HMS <unk> . At a rendezvous point in the eastern Atlantic , she handed the convoy off to other escorts that would take the ships to France . Nebraska arrived back in Hampton Roads on 3 October . She escorted another two convoys before the war ended in November 1918 . In December , she was equipped to carry American soldiers back from France . She made four such trips to Brest , France , and carried some 4 @,@ 540 men back to the United States . The first trip began on 30 December ; she reached Brest on 11 January 1919 and after embarking a contingent of soldiers , departed for Newport News , Virginia , where they arrived on 28 January . The fourth trip concluded on 21 June 1919 , also in Newport News .

 Lorraine " Rainie " Cross is a fictional character from the BBC One soap opera EastEnders , played by Tanya Franks . Introduced as the drug @-@ addicted sister of Tanya Branning ( Jo Joyner ) , Franks has had three separate guest stints in 2007 ( two episodes ) , 2008 ( four episodes ) and 2010 ( seven episodes ) and between 12 April and 8 December 2011 . Rainie returned on 16 June 2014 , when she was revealed as Ian Beale 's ( Adam Woodyatt ) mystery phone contact , having been with Ian on Good Friday , the night of Lucy Beale 's murder . 
 Described as " the slightly broken sister who 's one step away from a vodka bottle " , Rainie 's storylines have often centred on her addictions to drugs and alcohol . During her seven episode guest stint in 2010 , Rainie was involved in a highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell ( Steve McFadden ) . It was branded " inappropriate " and " horrid " by the Daily Record . EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy ( who plays Sonia Fowler ) also criticised the storyline , saying she was " shocked " , but Franks defended the storyline , though she herself was not surprised that viewers had complained . 
 In January 2015 , it was confirmed that Rainie would return for the conclusion of the Lucy Beale murder storyline .

 The character originally appeared for two episodes on 2 and 3 August 2007 , and then returned for four episodes between 7 and 11 January 2008 . Franks was asked to return again later in 2008 but could not make it , so Franks thought Rainie would not be seen again . She returned for the longer stint in 2010 , starting on 3 August . Franks did not expect to be asked to return in 2010 , and said the call came as a surprise . She said it was " ideal " because it fitted in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time . She commented that Rainie would be " unlikely to return without stirring up a bit of trouble " . Rainie returned again on 12 April 2011 as a regular character , for Tanya 's wedding to Greg Jessop , along with Tanya and Rainie 's mother Cora , where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters . 
 In April 2011 it was reported by The Sun that Rainie would have a one @-@ night stand with Jack Branning on 6 May 2011 after he discovers his son is dead and she comforts him . In May 2011 , it was announced that Cora would return to the series , and executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said he was " keen to establish the Cross women — Rainie completes the mix as the slightly broken sister who 's one step away from a vodka bottle . " Rainie has been described as " troublesome " and " troubled " . On her official BBC character profile she is described as sly , manipulative and ruthless , and that she " spells trouble with a capital T ! " . It finishes saying , " But behind the wild partying , Rainie is a lost soul with a soft , vulnerable side that yearns to get her life back on track and impress her older sister Tanya . "

 Rainie 's relationship with Phil Mitchell ( McFadden ) was first explored during her stint in 2010 . Rainie and Phil were to be involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine . Discussing her return in 2010 , she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together . Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya 's ex @-@ husband Max , and moving in with Phil that , " it gets quite dark and dirty , really . Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other . He offers her something that she wants , and that is a place to be , while she has something that he wants , and that 's drugs — so it 's a match at that time . " Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research , and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic . She wanted the drugs storyline to help people , saying , " If there are people who have a drugs problem , or an addiction problem of any kind really , they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them , or someone that they know . Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that , and perhaps look into getting some help . The organisation that we worked with , DrugScope , gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions . I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this . " She also stated that if EastEnders " has saved one life by putting this story out it 's been worth it . The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life . Some of it is going to be light entertainment , some isn 't . "

 Rainie 's relationship with Tanya has always been fractured , though Rainie tries to resolve the tension with Tanya during her return in 2011 . When Rainie was first announced on 13 July 2007 , it was said Rainie was said to " [ drag ] up a past which Tanya would rather forget " . Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay and forgive her and then going back on the promise , which leads Rainie to be kicked out . When Franks returned in 2010 she said " she was disappointed not to be working with Joyner this time . " On her return to for Tanya 's wedding , a spokesperson said , “ Tanya soon softens towards Rainie and her mother but will the harmony last between all three women or will past problems cause the women to Cross swords once again ? ” . Franks has commented that she is excited about exploring the family dynamic between the Cross ladies in upcoming storylines and her future in EastEnders . Joyner said that Tanya would forgive Rainie for her past actions . In an interview with Digital Spy , Kirkwood said that he was ' delighted ' at the expansion of Tanya 's family and that " The new characters are excellent additions to a cast that 's already very strong . " 
 = = = 2014 return = = = 
 Tanya Franks returned to the role of Rainie Cross for a stint on 16 June 2014 . Her return was kept a secret by the cast and crew of EastEnders , and followed the surprise returns of Laurie Brett , Nicholas Bailey and Emma Barton as Jane Beale , Anthony Trueman and Honey Mitchell respectively . All of these returns were under new executive producer Dominic Treadwell @-@ Collins . 
 Rainie was reintroduced as part of the ' Who Killed Lucy Beale ? ' storyline , a story that began in April 2014 when Lucy Beale ( Hetti Bywater ) was murdered , and climaxed as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations of EastEnders in February 2015 . Lucy 's father Ian Beale 's ( Adam Woodyatt ) alibi was revealed as fake soon after Lucy 's death , and on 16 June 2014 it was revealed that he was seeing Rainie , who had become a prostitute to fund her drug addiction , on the night Lucy died . Rainie then began blackmailing Ian for more money in return for keeping his actions secret from the police and his fiance Denise Fox ( Diane Parish ) . 
 Her appearances became more regular from July 2014 onwards , with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian 's actions to Denise 's protective father figure , Patrick Trueman ( Rudolph Walker ) . In August 2014 , Ian 's friend Mick Carter , played by Danny Dyer , pulled over behind Ian and Rainie when he spotted them talking . Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick , believing him to be a customer of her prostitute services . The police then pulled up behind Mick , and arrested him for soliciting . When Ian explained Rainie 's blackmail , Mick agreed to cover for him , to ensure the safety of his fake alibi . As a result of this , Rainie was reconciled with her mother , Cora Cross ( Ann Mitchell ) , as Cora supported Mick 's wife Linda Carter ( Kellie Bright ) in court before bumping into her daughter . Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora , and pretends the allegations against Mick are true . 
 The storyline also saw Franks film scenes alongside Steve McFadden , who plays Phil Mitchell , for the first time since their controversial drugs storyline in 2010 . Ian told Phil about Rainie 's blackmail , and Phil took Rainie to the allotments to ' deal with her ' . He later told Ian that she would not be a ' problem ' any longer , leaving Ian fearful of what lengths Phil had gone to . Phil was later revealed to have set Rainie up in a flat , but when his fiance Sharon Rickman ( Letitia Dean ) discovered what he was doing she ordered him to let Rainie go as she was not his problem . As a result , he abandoned Rainie on Cora 's doorstep , where Rainie promises to get clean with Cora 's help . Ian 's actions were revealed when Rainie , depressed after a confrontation with Mick Carter and his family , told Denise about their night together . Cora and Rainie have a heart to heart , but when Cora heads out for a short time , she returns and find Rainie gone along with her purse .

 Franks said that after her stint in 2008 , many people recognised her in the street and asked if she would return . Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate . The BBC responded by saying " EastEnders in no way — and at no point — <unk> or condones the use of drugs , and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs . [ ... ] We took care to signal the nature of the episode 's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings , and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue . In addition to this , our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue . [ ... ] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities , including <unk> and DrugScope , throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively . " The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes , including one who said , " I was shocked at the content of the episode . The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired , entirely inappropriate . Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline . Please , BBC , no more of these horrid storylines . " Other viewers said , " They look like they 're having a good time . They 're in danger of making it look appealing . " Finally , " It was a bit much . I 've found EastEnders distressing over the last month . " The Daily Record described the scenes as ' disturbing ' . 
 EastEnders star , Natalie Cassidy also criticised the scenes , saying , " You can 't swear or show two people making love before the watershed , yet you can show people smoking class A drugs ? I was really shocked . " Franks was not surprised that people complained , but defended the storyline , saying that " the good that comes from storylines like this far outweighs whatever concerns people might have " .

 Holstein is a station on the Sognsvann Line ( line 6 ) of the Oslo Metro in Norway . The station is located between Kringsjå and Østhorn stations .

 The Sognsvann Line opened on 10 October 1930 . It was built by Akersbanerne , and ran from Majorstuen to Sognsvann station . The line was double @-@ tracked from Majorstuen to Korsvoll , and single @-@ tracked from there to Sognsvann . In 1939 , the section Korsvoll – Sognsvann was upgraded to double tracks , and the station Korsvoll had its name changed to Østhorn . Two years later , Holstein was opened , although the accurate date of opening remains undisclosed . 
 In 1990 , it was decided to upgrade the Sognsvann Line to metro standard , which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms , installation of third rail power supply and a new signaling system . Many residents feared that Holstein station would be closed together with Frøen , but only the latter was closed . The upgrade started three years later , when Tåsen station was moved 150 metres ( 490 ft ) further north , and Nordberg Station was closed . Holstein was closed for traffic during the construction period . <unk> were built at both Holstein and Nordberg stations , and new ticket machines were installed at Holstein Station .

 The majority of the first part takes place in flashbacks while a team of ill equipped soldiers and scientists arrive at the Destiny . Eli Wallace ( David Blue ) solves a mathematical equation in an online computer game , planted there by Stargate Command . For his achievement , Dr. Nicholas Rush ( Robert Carlyle ) and General Jack O 'Neill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) recruit Wallace to the Icarus program , which is attempting to dial a nine @-@ chevron address with the Stargate . Wallace 's solution is the key to controlling the power levels for the Gate . He is taken aboard the Hammond , an Earth Daedalus @-@ class starship , to be taken to the planet where Icarus is set up . During the journey , he meets Chloe Armstrong ( Elyse Levesque ) , daughter of Senator Alan Armstrong ( Christopher McDonald ) . 
 At the top @-@ secret Icarus Base , the group is introduced to Colonel Everett Young ( Louis Ferreira ) , Colonel David Telford ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) , and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott ( Brian J. Smith ) . Wallace 's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock . During dinner , three Ha <unk> vessels , believed to be under the control of the Lucian Alliance , attack the planet . An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter ( Amanda Tapping ) and a squadron of F @-@ 302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy . Rush , desperate to see his project succeed , enlists Wallace 's aid in figuring out what went wrong . Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong , and that they should use the symbol for Earth . Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth , arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate , and tests the theory , which succeeds . With the planet 's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape , the remaining survivors in the base ( roughly 80 people ) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination . The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated , destroying the three Ha <unk> vessels . The Hammond survives , but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command .

 The unlikely expedition team ends up on the Destiny , an Ancient starship located billions of light @-@ years from Earth . The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down . Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command , taking control of Bill Lee ( Bill Dow ) . When he returns , Rush claims that O 'Neill put him in charge of the expedition , though the others are not quick to believe him . Meanwhile , the ship , having suffered millennia of wear and tear , has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles , which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle . Senator Armstrong learns of this and , already badly injured , sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time . However , the main life support is not so easily fixed . The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair , and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone . The Destiny , apparently aware of the problem , drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers . Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer . A 12 @-@ hour countdown begins , at the end of which the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically . 
 = = = Part 3 = = = 
 On the desert planet , the search begins for a suitable source of lime to filter the air on Destiny . The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite , but not enough to be useful , so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed , which should have heavy deposits of lime . The group splits into two : Rush , Scott and Ronald Greer ( Jamil Walker Smith ) form one group , while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction . After several failed tests , those in Wallace 's group give up on the search , instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected . When Wallace informs the others , Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching . They make it back in time to stop Franklin ( Mark Burgess ) , the member carrying the dialing remote , but the other two make it through . Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses , believing that the ship locked them out for a reason , and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns . 
 On the ship , Chloe and Young use the communication stones to contact Earth , allowing Chloe to inform her mother of her situation and Senator Armstrong 's death . Young , meanwhile , is encouraged by O 'Neill to repair the ship ; in spite of his protests that their expedition is not cut out for it , O 'Neill insists that no one really is ready for their kind of work . 
 In his search for the lime , Scott discovers a strange , swirling cloud of dust that absorbs moisture . He follows it until he collapses in front of a lake bed . He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth . Meanwhile , the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water , waking him . Realizing what he 's found , Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate . Greer , having set out to look for him , finds him along the way and helps carry the lime . Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown . The team returns with the lime successfully , which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers . In the end , a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young , and that the best way to deal with the grief is to keep moving forward . As everyone starts to breathe easier , a Nakai fighter detaches itself from the Destiny .

In all three cases the film ranks lowest in the series . Joseph Dilworth Jr. of Pop Culture Zoo praised the premiere of Stargate Universe , stating that it " feels less like a weekly TV series and much more like the beginning of a twenty part long form story , " and is also described as a cross between Star Trek : Voyager , Battlestar Galactica and Firefly , though the series seems to be a spiritual successor to Battlestar . Dilworth also praised the cast , stating it as " one of the finest ensemble casts I 've seen in a long time . " Curt Wagner of Chicago Now rated the episode 4 stars out of four , stating that it shares the optimism of Star Trek : Voyager , and the grimness of Battlestar Galactica , as well as playing homage to its franchise forbears SG @-@ 1 and Atlantis , but looks and feels new . IGN reviewer Ramsey Isler gave the episode 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 , starting his review with " Yes , it 's another Stargate show . But this might become the best of them all . " Further saying the premiere had its " own unique tone . " 
 Being one of the few Stargate franchise releases that were well received by major media publishers , Mike Hale from The New York Times was generally positive towards the pilot episodes , saying the Stargate franchise was " catching up " with the long @-@ running Star Trek franchise . Hale also agreed with Syfy 's promotion of it being an " edgier " Stargate . The Boston Globe reviewer Joanna Weiss also reacted positively towards the pilot episodes , saying it felt like " early Lost " , while the story arc followed the patterns of " Battlestar Galactica " . Mark Wilson from About.com gave the episode four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of 5 , saying Universe accomplishes what Stargate Atlantis was not able to , and said it was " exceptionally well made " compared to other shows . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette both praised the show , calling it " intriguing " , for not abandoning its premise as Star Trek : Voyager did and criticized it by pointing out that the characters spend " far too much time wandering a desert planet " in " Air ( Part 3 ) " . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette summarized their review by saying that , " [ g ] iven time , Stargate Universe may become worth watching if it develops its characters and continues to mine its premise for stories . " David Hinckley , a reviewer from The New York Daily News gave the episodes four @-@ out @-@ of @-@ five stars , saying that " Eli 's not the only one playing a high @-@ stakes game here . " 
 Among reviewers who were negative towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune . The reviewer wrote that the " gloomy , underwhelming Universe seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous " Stargate " shows had , notably camaraderie and a sense of adventure , without adding much in the way of narrative suspense or complexity . " The only characters she felt were " worth following " were Eli Wallace ( David Blue ) and Nicholas Rush ( Robert Carlyle ) . Vince Horiuchi from The Salt Lake Tribune started the review with " Syfy Channel -- is one of the worst displays of the genre on television , " and attacked the television series , " Battlestar Galactica " . Having no interest in the previous Stargate series ' including the feature film , while not overall positive to the series , he said the cast and characters were a " little more likable and interesting . " Reviewer Laura <unk> from Variety magazine concluded her review with " Sure , <unk> is grittier , darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions . But so far , it 's also a lot less fun . " While negative towards the show , she called Robert Carlyle an " excellent " actor . The Hollywood Reporter noted a lack of " intelligent " and " surprising stories " and was overall negative towards Stargate Universe , and even more so on the previous Stargate franchise releases .

 = 189th Infantry Brigade ( United States ) = 
 The 189th Infantry Brigade is an Infantry brigade of the United States Army based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , Washington . It is a training brigade subordinate to First Army . 
 Originally organized as a part of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I , the brigade never saw combat in that conflict . Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century , the brigade in name was reorganized into a different unit for fighting during World War II . Seeing numerous moves , activations and <unk> , the brigade has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence . Reactivated again in 2006 , the brigade is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their supporting elements for deployment to the War in Afghanistan .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The 189th Infantry Brigade was first constituted and activated on 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves , and assigned to the 95th Division . The brigade was organized in 1922 at Muskogee , Oklahoma . However , it would never be mobilized for World War I , and thus never received participation credit for the action . It would stay active as a reserve brigade for the interwar period , but it would never be used . 
 On 23 March 1925 the formation was reorganized as the 189th Brigade . On 24 August 1936 the formation was reorganized again as the 189th Infantry Brigade . In 1940 , the brigade 's headquarters was changed to McAlester , Oklahoma . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 The formation saw great changes in preparation for mobilization to fight during World War II . On 13 February 1942 the brigade structure was downsized greatly and converted into a reconnaissance element . It was combined with assets from the 190th Infantry Brigade to form the 95th Reconnaissance Troop which was subsequently assigned to the 95th Division once again . The troop was ordered into active military service on 15 July 1942 and reorganized at Camp Swift , Texas , as the 95th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop , an element of the 95th Division . The division itself was also in the process of being reorganized into the 95th Infantry Division . 
 On 1 August 1943 , the group was reorganized , given vehicles , and redesignated as the 95th Reconnaissance Troop , Mechanized . It was then deployed with the 95th Infantry Division to England on 17 August 1944 was subsequently deployed to northern France . The troop fought with the Division through northern France , and eventually northern Germany capturing town after town until the end of the war . Retrieved 5 December 2008 . The formation received four campaign streamers for its participation , the only four it was to earn . 
 After the end of World War II , the troop returned home and began the process of demobilization . It inactivated on 8 October 1945 at Camp Shelby , Mississippi . 
 On 26 December 1947 , the inactive formation was redesignated as the 95th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop . It was then activated on 9 January 1948 at Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . On 17 December 1948 , the brigade headquarters was moved to Stillwater , Oklahoma . On 30 June 1949 , the troop was again reorganized as the 95th Reconnaissance Company . This allowed it to take on a larger structure and control more personnel . The formation was inactivated on 15 September 1951 at Stillwater , Oklahoma . 
 It was again activated 1 March 1952 at Jonesboro , Arkansas . The company had its location changed to Wewoka , Oklahoma on 1 June 1955 . The Company would be inactivated for their last time four years later on 1 April 1959 when it was disbanded in Wewoka . 
 The 95th Reconnaissance Company would never see action again . Its elements would return to their designations before World War II . On 21 January 1963 , the main elements of the company were reconstituted as the 189th Infantry Brigade . It was then allotted to the Active duty force . Though inactive , if the brigade was ever activated again it would be formed as a part of the active duty force as a separate brigade . The 190th Infantry Brigade would not be reactivated , either . Its assets would be designated as 3rd Brigade , 24th Infantry Division , having never been reorganized after its redesignation in 1942 . 
 On 24 October 1997 , the brigade was activated at Fort Bragg , North Carolina as a training brigade . With a population of nearly 50 @,@ 000 soldiers and numerous other tenant units , the fort had a large contingent of soldiers necessitating multiple brigades for training . However , after two years of service on the Fort , it was inactivated on 16 October 1999 at the base . The elements of the brigade were subsequently merged with the 4th Brigade , 78th Division ( Training Support ) , another training brigade on base responsible for exercises . 
 = = = Reactivation = = = 
 The 189th Infantry Brigade was activated once again on 1 December 2006 at Fort Bragg . This was done by reflagging the 4th Brigade , 78th Division back to the 189th Infantry Brigade . The reflagging was just one part of the overall streamlining of the First Army from five training support Divisions commanding 16 divisional brigades to two larger regions commanding 16 separate brigades . The process was also designed to make identification of the brigades easier . It was assigned to Division East of the First Army . Division East contains eight training brigades with responsibilities for the entire region east of the Mississippi River . 
 The brigade was organized as a training brigade preparing Army Reserve and Army National Guard units for deployment . The brigade prepares other units for mobilization and provides training , assistance , and support to them during pre @-@ deployment exercises , and evaluates performance and progress of these units as they are deploying . Since its reactivation , the brigade has specialized in training provincial reconstruction teams ( PRTs ) deploying to Afghanistan . In early 2007 , the 189th Infantry Brigade , along with the 158th Infantry Brigade , cooperated to train the first 12 PRTs at once at Fort Bragg for three @-@ month training exercises . PRT personnel were trained in a wide range of scenarios , ranging from hospital repairs to childbirth scenarios and language labs . Afterwards , they conducted a conference on the training , in which it was decided that cultural awareness and language training needed to be stressed for future PRTs . It was during this training that the brigade finally received its distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia on 25 May 2008 . In early 2008 , the Brigade began training another group of 12 PRTs . Several months later , the Brigades began training the next 12 PRTs for a 270 @-@ day deployment to Afghanistan . 
 In 2011 , the 189th Infantry Brigade transferred from the authority of Division East , First Army , to Division West , First Army , and uncased its colors at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord on 7 September . 
 The brigade has worked closely with the Civilian Response Corps to standardize and institutionalize the training for the PRTs . All members of the PRTs are required to assemble for the training , which lasts approximately six weeks . These PRTs include members of the Army , Navy , Air Force , and civilian military contractors , as well as members of the UN Assistance Mission Agency ( sic : United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ? ) , and numerous other groups . It has also been responsible for training security forces that guard the PRTs , including elements of the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team . Soldiers of the brigade have also trained on Avid Technology , part of a modernization of Army public affairs . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The brigade contains four subordinate battalions in a separate company attached to its Headquarters and Headquarters Company . The brigade is , in turn , subordinate to Division West of First Army . Like all of the formations in First Army , the brigade is not a combat unit , but instead trains other units preparing for deployment . 
 The Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the brigade is located at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , and acts as the command element for the formation , overseeing all subordinate battalions which are also located at JBLM . These battalions include the 1st Battalion , 310th Regiment , 1st Battalion , 311th Regiment , 2nd Battalion , 311th Regiment , and 1st Battalion , 313th Regiment . Additionally , a direct reporting unit , A Company , 189th Infantry Brigade , provides all the services of a regular brigade 's special troops battalion .

 = Sisters at Heart = 
 " Sisters at Heart " is the thirteenth episode of the seventh season , and 213th episode overall , of the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) fantasy television sitcom Bewitched . This Christmas episode aired on ABC on December 24 , 1970 , and again the following December . 
 The narrative follows Lisa Wilson ( Venetta Rogers ) , an African @-@ American girl , as she visits her friend Tabitha Stephens ( Erin Murphy ) , a white girl . Meanwhile , Tabitha 's father Darrin Stephens ( Dick Sargent ) , who works at an advertising agency , fails to land a million @-@ dollar account with toy company owner Mr. Brockway ( Parley Baer ) because Mr. Brockway is racist and incorrectly believes Darrin to be married to Lisa 's mother Dorothy ( Janee Michelle ) . In an attempt to convince Mr. Brockway to overcome his bigotry , Darrin 's wife Samantha ( Elizabeth Montgomery ) , who is a witch , casts a spell on Mr. Brockway so he sees everyone , including himself , as having black skin . 
 The story of " Sisters at Heart " was written by 22 African @-@ American students from a tenth grade English class at Jefferson High School after Montgomery and her husband William Asher , the director of the episode , had the students visit the set of Bewitched . Most students at the school were unable to read , write , or comprehend at a high school level , with 44 % reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that . Sargent said that the students , " who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives , loved Bewitched , and with just a little approval and motivation , came alive on the set . " Montgomery considered " Sisters at Heart " her favorite episode of the series , and said that it " was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived in the image of innocence and filled with truth . " The episode received the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1971 . Montgomery 's biographer Herbie Pilato wrote that " no episode of the series more clearly represented [ the ] cry against prejudice " than " Sisters at Heart " . Critic Walter Metz praised Asher 's choice of camera angles , but denounced the episode 's liberalism as excessively sentimental and simplistic .

 Keith Wilson ( Don Marshall ) , his wife Dorothy ( Janee Michelle ) , their daughter Lisa ( Venetta Rogers ) , and Keith 's boss , Larry Tate ( David White ) , visit the home of the Stephens family , with whom Lisa is to spend a few days while Keith is away on a business trip for Larry . The Wilsons are African @-@ American and all of the other characters are white , including the Stephens family : Darrin ( Dick Sargent ) , his wife Samantha ( Elizabeth Montgomery ) , their daughter Tabitha ( Erin Murphy ) , and their son Adam ( David Lawrence ) . Tabitha is glad to be able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters . Darrin is another of Larry 's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate . Darrin is trying to land a million @-@ dollar account from Mr. Brockway ( Parley Baer ) , who owns a toy company . Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets . When Mr. Brockway arrives , Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs , so Lisa answers the door . When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha 's sister , Mr. Brockway leaves , saying he has seen enough . 
 Samantha takes the children to the park , where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors . When they arrive home , Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha 's skin has black spots and Lisa 's skin has white spots . Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches . When Samantha finds the two girls polka @-@ dotted , she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell , which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do . Eventually , Samantha realizes that Tabitha 's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa will continue to be sisters . Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won 't prevent them from being sisters , and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa 's parents arrive to pick up Lisa . 
 Larry tells Darrin that Mr. Brockway has insisted that Darrin be removed from the account . Darrin and Samantha host a Christmas party which Larry , Keith , and Dorothy attend . When Mr. Brockway arrives , he sees Darrin and Dorothy standing next to each other and assumes they are married to each other . When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake , and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha , Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account . After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African @-@ American woman , Larry rejects Mr. Brockway 's offer . Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account . Through witchcraft , Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room , including himself , as having black skin . On Christmas Day , while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens , Mr. Brockway arrives , apologizes for his previous actions , and repents of his racism . Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner , and he accepts .

 In 1969 , Marcella Saunders , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old teacher at Jefferson High School in Los Angeles , found that her ninth @-@ grade students were unable to read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook . She thought that , because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories , she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them by way of a television series . She found that her students liked Bewitched , Room 222 , and Julia , so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea . Only Bewitched responded . Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher , Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read , write , or comprehend at a high school level , with 44 % reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that ; less than 1 % were reading at a ninth grade level . Saunders added that Bewitched was the students ' favorite television series . 
 Out of concern for the students in Saunders ' English class , Montgomery and Asher invited Saunders ' class of 22 African @-@ American students to visit the set of Bewitched . Because many of these teenagers , now in the tenth grade , did not have the financial means to make their way to Hollywood , Montgomery and Asher paid for all 22 to be transported there and back by chartered bus . The students were impressed by the visit and later collaborated to write a teleplay for a Bewitched episode under Saunders ' supervision . The teleplay was called " Sisters at Heart . " At Christmas in 1969 , they presented Montgomery and Asher with the teleplay , gift @-@ wrapped . Montgomery and Asher were impressed with the quality of the script . Montgomery later said , " We 've had bad scripts submitted by professional writers that weren 't as well written or creative . " 
 Asher told Barbara Avedon about the students ' script , saying that it only needed a little reworking , and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite . Avedon , who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched , accepted his request . Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience , " I was horrified . Locker doors were hanging off their hinges . There wasn 't a blade of grass in sight . " Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half @-@ hour episode . She promised the students that no changes would be made to the script unless they approved . It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode , which she suggested because the script " was so imbued with the spirit . " She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal . 
 All 22 students attended a production and rehearsal meeting for the episode . The government of California gave Jefferson High School a grant to support a program to allow the students to be part of the filming and post @-@ production of the episode . Film production company Screen Gems joined Montgomery and Asher in making donations to the program as well . The students donated the money they received for writing the episode to a foundation to keep the program going . Two more trips were organized , bringing a total of fifty Jefferson High School students to the set of Bewitched . Asher sent copies of thirty scripts of other Bewitched episodes to the school for use in classrooms . Saunders found the program a great success , saying " kids who could never write before were now writing three pages . Kids who could not read were now doubling up on scripts and fighting over who would be able to play the leads . " Asher also expressed pleasure with the program 's success , and recommended that other white businesspeople invite minority groups into their lives . Sargent considered Saunders the main reason for the success of the program , saying , " She was interested in innovative forms of teaching . These kids , who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives , loved Bewitched , and with just a little approval and motivation , came alive on the set . " 
 Asher produced and directed the episode . A high school student who was granted the role of assistant director at one point screamed " Quiet on the set ! " , a memory that Sargent later recalled fondly . For the scene in which Samantha casts a spell that makes Mr. Brockway see everyone as having black skin , the white actors , including Sargent and White , appeared in blackface . The name of Mr. Brockway 's toy company is never mentioned . Samantha 's statement at the end of the episode , " We 're having integrated turkey : white meat and dark " , was repeated in Spike Lee 's 1986 film She 's Gotta Have It . The final shot of the episode , which zooms out from the scene of Samantha and Darrin kissing to reveal the French doors at the back of their house as " Silent Night " plays in the background , is the only shot in any episode of Bewitched to depict the interior of the house from the perspective of the backyard . " Sisters at Heart " is the only episode of the series in which Lisa appears . Seven years before acting together in " Sisters at Heart " , Montgomery and Baer appeared together in an episode of the CBS television series Rawhide called " Incident at El Crucero " , which aired when the pilot episode of Bewitched was in pre @-@ production . In 1970 , Montgomery appeared on The Merv Griffin Show to promote " Sisters at Heart " , thereby making one of the only three talk show appearances of her career . After Griffin left the network , CBS wiped all episodes of The Merv Griffin Show produced between 1969 and 1972 , but a copy of the episode featuring Montgomery 's promotion of " Sisters at Heart " was later discovered when it became known that relevant kinescopes and master tapes had survived . 
 Endorsed by meat production company Oscar Mayer , " Sisters at Heart " is a half @-@ hour , color episode that aired on December 24 , 1970 , as the 213th episode of Bewitched to be aired . As an introduction and conclusion to the episode , Montgomery briefly spoke to the camera about the episode , saying that it " was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived in the image of innocence and filled with truth . " ABC aired the episode only once more , in December 1971 . Unlike many of the other episodes in the season , it was neither a remake of an episode from a previous season nor part of the Salem , Massachusetts , story arc that was filmed in the area where the 17th @-@ century Salem witch trials took place . Don Marshall , who made a guest appearance in " Sisters at Heart " as Keith Wilson , was known for his role in Land of the Giants , while Janee Michelle , who portrayed Dorothy Wilson in " Sisters at Heart " , later became best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain . " Sisters at Heart " was Montgomery 's favorite episode of the series . Reflecting on the episode in 1989 , she said , " Yeah , this is what I want Bewitched to be all about . " Sony Pictures Home Entertainment eventually released the episode on a VHS collection called A Bewitched Christmas 2 . On June 16 , 2005 , the episode was screened in Salem as the first entry in " The Art and Politics of Elizabeth Montgomery " , a film @-@ watching and discussion group that met at First Church in Salem .

 " Sisters at Heart " received the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1971 . Montgomery 's biographer Herbie Pilato wrote that the theme of overcoming prejudice is central to Bewitched because of the prominence of the marriage between a witch and a mortal , and that " no episode of the series more clearly represented this cry against prejudice than the holiday story , ' Sisters at Heart . ' " A reviewer from the Australian newspaper the Daily Liberal wrote that " Sisters at Heart " is " very thoughtful " and argued that it is the sole episode of the series that is not simply a " lightweight offering " reflective of " the United States ' post @-@ war society of new consumerism and advertising . " When the seventh season of Bewitched was released on DVD in 2009 , DVD Talk reviewer Paul Mavis wrote that " Sisters at Heart " has a more overt message than any other episode of the season . He praised the actors ' performances in the episode and wrote that , because of the episode 's obvious @-@ yet @-@ effective critique of racism , " what 's highly ironic about Sisters at Heart today is that it would most likely be dubbed politically incorrect and ' insensitive ' by some because the cast wear blackface at one point . " 
 Hal Erickson of AllMovie called the episode " refreshingly free of the patronization which usually attended ' racially sensitive ' TV episodes of the period . " In his book about Bewitched , critic Walter Metz writes that " Sisters at Heart " exemplifies the liberalism endorsed by the series , which he argues is excessively sentimental and simplistic . He praises Asher for his " skillful understanding of film aesthetics " , calling particular attention to Asher 's choice of camera angles in the scene in which Mr. Brockway first meets Lisa . Metz argues that the Stephens ' foyer is an important location in the series , and that this importance is exemplified in the episode both by the scene of Mr. Brockway 's first encounter with Lisa as well as in the epilogue when Mr. Brockway revisits the house and apologizes for his prior racism . Metz criticizes Mr. Brockway 's " magically found soft @-@ heartedness " as a " paternalistic approach to liberal racial tolerance [ that ] implies that only white patriarchs have the cultural authority to declare that racism is wrong . " Metz further argues that the episode problematically figures Samantha as the protector and provider for black people , a role that he says Samantha also fills in " Samantha at the Keyboard " , another Bewitched episode . 
 = Zebras ( Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ) = 
 " Zebras " is the twenty @-@ second episode and season finale of the tenth season of the police procedural television series Law & Order : Special Victims Unit , and the show 's 224th episode overall . It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) in the United States on June 2 , 2009 . In the episode , an open @-@ and @-@ shut case against a mentally disturbed murderer , played by Nick Stahl , is blown when a forensics technician makes a technical error . As Elliot and Olivia investigate additional murders believed to be the work of the same killer , they uncover a plot within their own department . 
 The episode was written by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly , and directed by Peter Leto . It was the final appearance of Mike Doyle , who had played forensics technician Ryan O 'Halloran since 2003 and appeared on the show more than 50 times ; the character was killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey ( Noel Fisher ) as part of a surprise twist conceived by executive producer and showrunner Neal Baer . " Zebras " also included guest appearances by Kelly Bishop , Judith Light and Carol Kane as Gwen Munch , the conspiracy theorist ex @-@ wife of Detective John Munch ; Kane had previously played the same role opposite actor Richard Belzer in a 1997 episode of Homicide : Life on the Street .

 = = Plot = = 
 A father and daughter rollerblading in Central Park stumble across the body of a woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush . Munch ( Richard Belzer ) and Fin ( Ice @-@ T ) learn Peter Harrison ( Nick Stahl ) , who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman , left work early with a cut thumb around the time of the murder . Stabler ( Christopher Meloni ) and Benson ( Mariska Hargitay ) question Harrison , who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police . During an interrogation , Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney , Julia Zimmer ( Kelly Bishop ) , stops the questioning . Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison 's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O 'Halloran ( Mike Doyle ) confirms the DNA matches the victim , resulting in an open @-@ and @-@ shut case against Harrison . However , Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey ( Noel Fisher ) in the evidence paperwork . Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake , Judge Elizabeth Donnelly ( Judith Light ) is forced to set Harrison free , and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey . 
 Shortly afterward , another woman is found murdered at Coney Island in a similar manner ; Stuckey finds a soda can with a bloody fingerprint on it , later confirmed to be Harrison 's . The police learn Harrison disclosed his hiding place to a friend on a conspiracy theorist website ; Munch recognizes the friend as his ex @-@ wife Gwen ( Carol Kane ) , whom he convinces to reveal Harrison 's location . After Harrison evades capture , Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer , who said she has been taking care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child . An unstable Harrison visits Zimmer , who calls Stabler and Benson to arrest him . As they are about to return to the precinct , Zimmer gets locked into her car and a poisonous gas is released into the air ; Stabler breaks her car window , but is unable to save her in time . 
 Later , Judge Donnelly is nearly killed when she sits on a needle filled with potassium chloride at her home ; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital . O 'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer as he or she was rigging Zimmer 's car , and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison . As the DNA is later being processed , however , O 'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab . Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind . Stuckey then answers Elliot 's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone . He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him . Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison , and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him . Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey , but she convinces Stuckey that she , too , hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey . While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him , Stabler kicks him from behind , allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler . When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble , Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi , which she knows that he hates .

 " Zebras " was written by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly , and directed by Peter Leto . The surprise twist in the episode , in which forensics technician Ryan O 'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey , was conceived by Neal Baer , the series executive producer and showrunner . Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story " just came to [ him ] one day " and thought that " this may be a really interesting way to bring [ the ] cast together and deal with this story point " . In particular , Baer said he wanted to kill a long @-@ recurring character so the show could " explore characters ' reactions to a death in an interesting way " . Mike Doyle , the actor who played O 'Halloran , was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call a few weeks before the episode was filmed in May 2009 . Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because , in his words , " I think everybody knew that somebody was going , so they weren 't shocked . " During a May 2009 interview , Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending : " One of our own is murdered . " 
 " Zebras " was the final episode for Doyle , who had been a recurring character since 2003 and had made more than 50 appearances on the show . The episode also marked the seventh on @-@ screen death for the actor , who had been killed in several films and television episodes , including on the HBO series Oz . Christopher Meloni , who also appeared on Oz , comforted Doyle about his character 's death by saying , " At least you 're not getting gang @-@ raped " , a reference to Doyle 's death scene from that show . The climax scene of " Zebras " , in which Dale Stuckey threatens Elliot Stabler as Olivia Benson tries to talk him down , was filmed on May 7 , 2009 , in a warehouse in North Bergen , New Jersey . A crew member shouted " dead man walking ! " to Doyle as he arrived on the set . The knife protruding from Doyle was staged by strapping to his chest a metal plate with a center slot holding the retractable blade of the fake knife .

 = The Winter 's Tale ( 1910 film ) = 
 The Winter 's Tale is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The plot is an adaptation of The Winter 's Tale by William Shakespeare and requires fore @-@ knowledge of the plot in order to understand the condensed one reel work . The film focuses on the conflict arising from two Kings , one of Bohemia and one of Sicilia , during a meeting . Queen Hermione enrages her jealous husband , Leontes , by entertaining Polixenes . Leontes decides to kill him with poison , but the plan is foiled by the courtier tasked with the assassination . For this , Leontes imprisons his wife . Hermione gives birth to a daughter and Leontes orders the baby to die out in the wilderness . Hermione is then brought before the court and apparently dies after interrogation . Fifteen years pass and Polixenes confronts and then secretly follows his son , appearing as he declares his intention to marry a shepherdess . The two lovers seek protection with Leontes , the King of Sicilia . Mourning and repentant for his past actions , Leontes learns the shepherdess is his daughter and blesses the marriage of the lovers . The royal party goes to see a statue of the late queen Hermoine and is revealed to be alive . The cast includes Anna Rosemond , Frank H. Crane and Martin Faust , but the directorial and production credits for the film are unknown . The production was a success for the Thanhouser Company and the film was met with positive reception following its May 27 , 1910 release . The film survives in the Library of Congress , but it is missing the final scene of the production . The surviving print suffers from significant deterioration . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film is an adaptation of The Winter 's Tale by William Shakespeare , the shortened single reel adaption of the play . The film opens with the meeting of the kings of Bohemia and Sicilia . Hermione , the queen of Sicilia , entertains Polixenes , king of Bohemia . This arouses jealousy in Leontes , the king of Sicilia . Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task . The courtier slips the poison into the cup , but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot . Polixenes and the courtier depart safely , but this enrages the Leontes , who has his wife imprisoned . In prison , Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband , Hoping to quell his anger . This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die . Hermione is then brought before a tribunal , swoons , and is pronounced dead by Paulina . 
 In a departure from the play , the film shows Hermoine 's revival and departure to Paulina 's house to dwell in seclusion . The infant princess is raised up by a shepherd of Bohemia . After a time lapse of 15 years , Polixenes confronts his son over his wanderings . He refuses to answer and the king follows him in secret . The prince , disguised as a shepherd , woos the young shepherdess and announces his intention to marry her . The king arrives and forbids it , but a faithful courtier advises them to seek protection of the king of Sicilia . Leontes has long mourned and come to regret his past actions . There , the identity that the shepherdess as his daughter is revealed and the marriage is approved . The royal party is invited to Paulina 's house to view a statue of the late queen Hermoine . At the party , Hermoine disguised as a statue , extend her hand and surprises the grieving Leontes , who then rejoices .

 The adaptation of the scenario is credited to Lloyd F. Lonergan and Gertrude Thanhouser . While the director of the film is not known , two directors are possible . Barry O 'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy , who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures , including its first two @-@ reeler , Romeo and Juliet . Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little , a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time , moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910 . Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . 
 The Thanhouser adaption notably foregoes the famous Shakespearean stage directions : Exit , pursued by a <unk> and allows Antigonus a peaceful exit . Another difference in the production is that following the collapse and reported death of Hermione . In the play , the audience is aligns with Leontes ' view and gives no reason to doubt Hermione 's death , but the Thanhouser adaptation shows the mechanism and conspiracy formed by showing Hermione 's revival and departure . Instead of using the Shakespeare character of Time to frame the passage of time , the role is performed by an inter @-@ title . The final scene is missing from the surviving print . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The one reel drama , approximately 1000 feet long , was released on May 27 , 1910 . The surviving fragment in the Library of Congress is 12 minutes 35 seconds long , but it does not include the final scene with the disguised Queen of Sicilia . The surviving fragment has suffered significant damage due to deterioration . The film was re @-@ released by the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation with a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher . 
 The film was positively reviewed by the contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim . The Moving Picture News stated that this was the first Shakespeare adaptation by an Independent producer and said , " We were asked to inspect and criticize this film , and there was nothing for us to do but give our full approval and applause , which we do right heartily . " The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare 's work , resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story . Another review in the The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow @-@ up to the first review , commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying " Few , indeed , will be the releases of the month to surpass this , and few , indeed , are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory . " 
 A modern review was given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan . Buchanan recognizes that the film 's acting was commended for its action and highlights the acting of the fool , placed prominently in the foreground , and says that it seems as if he has been imported from King Lear . This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions . Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to <unk> follow the subject . Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable . 
 = Equine nutrition = 
 Equine nutrition is the feeding of horses , ponies , mules , donkeys , and other equines . Correct and balanced nutrition is a critical component of proper horse care . 
 Horses are non @-@ ruminant herbivores of a type known as a " hindgut fermenter . " Horses have only one stomach , as do humans . However , unlike humans , they also have to utilize plant fiber ( largely cellulose ) that comes from grass and hay . Ruminants like cattle are foregut fermenters , and digest fiber in plant matter by use of a multi @-@ chambered stomach , whereas horses use microbial fermentation in a part of the digestive system known as the cecum ( or caecum ) to break down the cellulose . 
 In practical terms , horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day , as they do in nature when grazing on pasture . Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day , it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed , how often , and in what quantities . 
 The digestive system of the horse is somewhat delicate . Horses are unable to regurgitate food , except from the esophagus . Thus , if they overeat or eat something poisonous , vomiting is not an option . They also have a long , complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes in feed . Because of these factors , they are very susceptible to colic , which is a leading cause of death in horses . Therefore , horses require clean , high @-@ quality feed , provided at regular intervals , and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets . Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins . For this reason , they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings . Fermented silage or " <unk> " is fed to horses in some places ; however , contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic . 
 = = The digestive system = = 
 Horses and other members of the genus Equus are adapted by evolutionary biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long . In the wild , horses ate prairie grasses in semi @-@ arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition . Therefore , their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day . 
 = = = Chewing and swallowing = = = 
 Digestion begins in the mouth . First , the animal selects pieces of forage and picks up finer foods , such as grain , with sensitive , prehensile , lips . The front teeth of the horse , called incisors , nip off forage , and food is ground up for swallowing by the premolars and molars . 
 The esophagus carries food to the stomach . The esophagus enters the stomach at an acute angle , creating a one @-@ way valve , with a powerful sphincter mechanism at the gastroesophageal junction , which is why horses cannot vomit . The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from choke . ( see Illnesses related to improper feeding below ) 
 = = = The stomach and small intestine = = = 
 Horses have a small stomach for their size , which limits the amount of feed that can be taken in at one time . The average sized horse has a stomach with a capacity of only 4 US gallons ( 15 l ) , and works best when it contains about 2 US gallons ( 7 @.@ 6 l ) . One reason continuous foraging or several small feedings per day are better than one or two large meals is because the stomach begins to empty when it is two @-@ thirds full , whether the food in the stomach is processed or not . 
 The small intestine is 50 to 70 feet ( 15 to 21 m ) long and holds 10 US gallons ( 38 l ) to 12 US gallons ( 45 l ) . This is the major digestive organ where 50 to 70 percent of all nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream . Bile from the liver acts here , combined with enzymes from the pancreas and small intestine itself . Equids do not have a gall bladder , so bile flows constantly , an adaptation to a slow but steady supply of food , and another reason for providing fodder to horses in several small feedings . 
 = = = The cecum and large intestine = = = 
 The cecum is the first section of the large intestine . It is also known as the " water gut " or " hind gut . " It is a blind @-@ ended pouch , about 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) long that holds 7 US gallons ( 26 l ) to 8 US gallons ( 30 l ) . The small intestine opens into the cecum , and the cellulose plant fiber in the food is fermented by microbes for approximately seven hours . The fermented material leaves the cecum through another orifice and passes to the large colon . The microbes in the cecum produce vitamin K , B @-@ complex vitamins , proteins , and fatty acids . The reason horses must have their diets changed slowly is so the microbes in the cecum are able to modify and adapt to the different chemical structure of new feedstuffs . Too abrupt a change in diet can cause colic , because new materials are not properly digested . 
 The large colon , small colon , and rectum make up the remainder of the large intestine . The large colon is 10 to 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) long and holds up to 20 US gallons ( 76 l ) of semi @-@ liquid matter . Its main purpose is to absorb carbohydrates which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum . Due to its many twists and turns , it is a common place for a type of horse colic called an impaction . The small colon is also 10 to 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) long , holds about 5 US gallons ( 19 l ) , is the area where the majority of water is absorbed , and where fecal balls are formed . The rectum is about one foot long , and acts as a holding chamber for waste , which is then expelled from the body via the anus . 
 = = Nutrients = = 
 Like all animals , equines require five main classes of nutrients to survive : water , energy ( primarily in the form of fats and carbohydrates ) , proteins , vitamins , and minerals . 
 = = = Water = = = 
 Water makes up between 62 @-@ 68 % of a horse 's body weight and is essential for life . Horses can only live a few days without water , becoming dangerously dehydrated if they lose 8 @-@ 10 % of their natural body water . Therefore , it is critically important for horses to have access to a fresh , clean , and adequate supply of water . 
 An average 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) horse drinks 10 US gallons ( 38 l ) to 12 US gallons ( 45 l ) of water per day , more in hot weather , when eating dry forage such as hay , or when consuming high levels of salt , potassium , and magnesium . Horses drink less water in cool weather or when on lush pasture , which has a higher water content . When under hard work , or if a mare is lactating , water requirements may be as much as four times greater than normal . Though they need a great deal of water , horses spend very little time drinking ; usually 1 – 8 minutes a day , spread out in 2 @-@ 8 episodes . 
 Water plays an important part in digestion . The forages and grains horses eat are mixed with saliva in the mouth to make a moist bolus that can be easily swallowed . Therefore , horses produce up to 10 US gallons ( 38 l ) or 85 lb. of saliva per day . 
 = = = Energy nutrients and protein = = = 
 Nutritional sources of energy are fat and carbohydrates . Protein is a critical building block for muscles and other tissues . Horses that are heavily exercised , growing , pregnant or lactating need increased energy and protein in their diet . However , if a horse has too much energy in its diet and not enough exercise , it can become too high @-@ spirited and difficult to handle . 
 Fat exists in low levels in plants and can be added to increase the energy density of the diet . Fat has 9 <unk> ( 38 MJ ) per kilogram of energy , which is 2 @.@ 25 times that of any carbohydrate source . Because equids have no gall bladder to store large quantities of bile , which flows continuously from the liver directly into the small intestine , fat , though a necessary nutrient , is difficult for them to digest and utilize in large quantities . However , they are able to digest a greater amount of fat than can cattle . Horses benefit from up to 8 % fat in their diets , but more does not always provide a visible benefit . Horses can only have 15 @-@ 20 % fat in their diet without the risk of developing diarrhea . 
 Carbohydrates , the main energy source in most rations , are usually fed in the form of hay , grass , and grain . Soluble carbohydrates such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed . Insoluble carbohydrates , such as fiber ( cellulose ) , are not digested by the horse 's own enzymes , but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources , volatile fatty acids . 
 Soluble carbohydrates are found in nearly every feed source ; corn has the highest amount , then barley and oats . Forages normally have only 6 @-@ 8 % soluble carbohydrate , but under certain conditions can have up to 30 % . Sudden ingestion of large amounts of starch or high sugar feeds can cause at the least an indigestion colic , and at the worst potentially fatal colitis or laminitis . 
 Protein is used in all parts of the body , especially muscle , blood , hormones , hooves , and hair cells . The main building blocks of protein are amino acids . Alfalfa and other legumes in hay are good sources of protein that can be easily added to the diet . Most adult horses only require 8 @-@ 10 % protein in their diet ; however , higher protein is important for lactating mares and young growing foals . 
 = = = Vitamins and minerals = = = 
 Horses that are not subjected to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh , green , leafy forages . Sometimes a vitamin supplement is needed when feeding low @-@ quality hay , if a horse is under stress ( illness , traveling , showing , racing , and so on ) , or not eating well . Grain has a different balance of nutrients than forage , and so requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals . 
 Minerals are required for maintenance and function of the skeleton , nerves , and muscles . These include calcium , phosphorus , sodium , potassium , and chloride , and are commonly found in most good @-@ quality feeds . Horses also need trace minerals such as magnesium , selenium , copper , zinc , and iodine . Normally , if adult animals at maintenance levels are consuming fresh hay or are on pasture , they will receive adequate amounts of minerals in their diet , with the exception of sodium chloride ( salt ) , which needs to be provided , preferably free choice . Some pastures are deficient in certain trace minerals , including selenium , zinc , and copper , and in such situations , health problems , including deficiency diseases , may occur if horses ' trace mineral intake is not properly supplemented . 
 Calcium and phosphorus are needed in a specific ratio of between 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 . Adult horses can tolerate up to a 5 : 1 ratio , foals no more than 3 : 1 . A total ration with a higher ratio of phosphorus than calcium is to be avoided . Over time , imbalance will ultimately lead to a number of possible bone @-@ related problems such as osteoporosis . 
 Foals and young growing horses through their first three to four years have special nutritional needs and require feeds that are balanced with a proper calcium : phosphorus ratio and other trace minerals . A number of skeletal problems may occur in young animals with an unbalanced diet . Hard work increases the need for minerals ; sweating depletes sodium , potassium , and chloride from the horse ’ s system . Therefore , supplementation with electrolytes may be required for horses in intense training , especially in hot weather . 
 = = Types of feed = = 
 Equids can consume approximately 2 @-@ 2 @.@ 5 % of their body weight in dry feed each day . Therefore , a 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) adult horse could eat up to 25 lb ( 11 kg ) of food . Foals less than six months of age eat 2 @-@ 4 % of their weight each day . 
 Solid feeds are placed into three categories : forages ( such as hay and grass ) , concentrates ( including grain or pelleted rations ) , and supplements ( such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets ) . Equine nutritionists recommend that 50 % or more of the animal 's diet by weight should be forages . If a horse is working hard and requires more energy , the use of grain is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing . However , forage amount should never go below 1 % of the horse 's body weight per day . 
 = = = Forages = = = 
 Forages , also known as " roughage , " are plant materials classified as legumes or grasses , found in pastures or in hay . Often , pastures and hayfields will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes . Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses , fertilization , management , and environmental conditions . Grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients . Some commonly used grasses include timothy , brome , fescue , coastal Bermuda , orchard grass , and Kentucky bluegrass . Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is beet pulp , a byproduct left over from the processing of sugar beets , which is high in energy as well as fiber . 
 <unk> such as clover or alfalfa are usually higher in protein , calcium , and energy than grasses . However , they require warm weather and good soil to produce the best nutrients . <unk> hays are generally higher in protein than the grass hays . They are also higher in minerals , particularly calcium , but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus . Because they are high in protein , they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work , but the calcium : phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities . 
 Hay is a dried mixture of grasses and legumes . It is cut in the field and then dried and baled for storage . Hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on , before the seed heads are fully mature and before the stems of the plants become tough and thick . Hay that is very green can be a good indicator of the amount of nutrients in the hay ; however , color is not the sole indicator of quality — smell and texture are also important . Hay can be analyzed by many laboratories and that is the most reliable way to tell the nutritional values it contains . 
 Hay , particularly alfalfa , is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes . Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store . It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages . However , these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to choke on them . On the other hand , hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry , and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with tooth problems such as dental disease , tooth loss due to age , or structural anomalies . 
 <unk> , also known as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in airtight plastic bags , a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe , but is not often seen in the United States . Because <unk> is a type of silage , hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic , as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage . Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale . If a rodent dies inside the plastic , the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale . 
 Sometimes , straw or chaff is fed to animals . However , this is roughage with little nutritional value other than providing fiber . It is sometimes used as a filler ; it can slow down horses who eat their grain too fast , or it can provide additional fiber when the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds . Straw is more often used as a bedding in stalls to absorb wastes . 
 = = = Concentrates = = = 
 = = = = Grains = = = = 
 Whole or crushed grains are the most common form of concentrated feed , sometimes referred to generically as " oats " or " corn " even if those grains are not present , also sometimes called straights in the UK . 
 Oats are the most popular grain for horses . Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains . They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system . They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains . 
 Corn ( USA ) , or maize ( British English ) , is the second most palatable grain . It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber . Because of these characteristics , it is easy to over @-@ feed corn , causing obesity , so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself . <unk> caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses . 
 Barley is also fed to horses , but needs to be processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility . It is frequently fed in combination with oats and corn , a mix informally referred to by the acronym " COB " ( for Corn , Oats and Barley ) . 
 Wheat is generally not used as a concentrate . However , wheat bran is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition , usually moistened and in the form of a bran mash . Wheat bran is high in phosphorus , so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca : P ratio of a ration . Once touted for a laxative effect , this use of bran is now considered unnecessary , as horses , unlike humans , obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources . 
 = = = = Mixes and <unk> = = = = 
 Many feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete <unk> feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality . Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form , others retain the grains in their original form . In many cases molasses is used as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability . Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called " sweet feed " in the United States and " coarse mix " in the United Kingdom . <unk> or extruded feeds ( sometimes referred to as " nuts " in the UK ) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed . Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain . However , pellets are also more expensive , and even " complete " rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage . 
 = = = = Supplements = = = = 
 The average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need supplements ; however , horses subjected to stress due to age , intensive athletic work , or reproduction may need additional nutrition . Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse 's diet , along with vitamin and mineral supplements . There are hundreds , if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market , many tailored to horses with specialized needs . 
 <unk> meal is a common protein supplement , and averages about 44 % crude protein . The protein in soybean meal is high @-@ quality , with the proper ratio of dietary essential amino acids for equids . <unk> meal , Linseed meal , and peanut meal are also used , but are not as common . 
 = = Feeding practices = = 
 Most horses only need quality forage , water , and a salt or mineral block . Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary . But , when grain or other concentrates are fed , quantities must be carefully monitored . To do so , horse feed is measured by weight , not volume . For example , 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 45 kg ) of oats has a different volume than 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 45 kg ) of corn . When continuous access to feed is not possible , it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones . However , even two daily feedings is preferable to only one . To gauge the amount to feed , a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse 's weight . The tape measures the circumference of the horse 's barrel , just behind the withers and elbows , and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight . 
 Actual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse , the age of the horse , the climate , and the work to which the animal is put . In addition , genetic factors play a role . Some animals are naturally easy keepers ( good doers ) , which means that they can thrive on small amounts of food and are prone to obesity and other health problems if overfed . Others are hard keepers ( poor doers ) , meaning that they are prone to be thin and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight . 
 Veterinarians are usually a good source for recommendations on appropriate types and amounts of feed for a specific horse . Animal nutritionists are also trained in how to develop equine rations and make recommendations . There are also numerous books written on the topic . Feed manufacturers usually offer very specific guidelines for how to select and properly feed products from their company , and in the United States , the local office of the Cooperative Extension Service can provide educational materials and expert recommendations . 
 = = = Feeding forages = = = 
 Equids always require forage . When possible , nutritionists recommend it be available at all times , at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to obesity . It is safe to feed a ration that is 100 % forage ( along with water and supplemental salt ) , and any feed ration should be at least 50 % forage . Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay , though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant . 
 When beet pulp is fed , a ration of 2 lb ( 0 @.@ 91 kg ) to 5 lb ( 2 @.@ 3 kg ) is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable , and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems . It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water . Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay , but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly . It is available in both pelleted and shredded form , pellets must be soaked significantly longer than shredded beet pulp . 
 Some pelleted rations are designed to be a " complete " feed that contains both hay and grain , meeting all the horse 's nutritional needs . However , even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided , a minimum of a half @-@ pound of forage for every 100 lb ( 45 kg ) of horse , in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse 's urge to graze . 
 When horses graze under natural conditions , they may spend up to 18 hours per day doing so . However , on modern irrigated pastures , they may have their nutritional needs for forage met in as little as three hours per day , depending on the quality of grass available . 
 Recent studies address the level of various non @-@ structural carbohydrates ( NSC ) , such as fructan , in forages . Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to laminitis or equine polysaccharide storage myopathy ( <unk> ) . NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage , but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels . 
 = = = Feeding concentrates = = = 
 Concentrates , when fed , are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1 % of a horse 's body weight per day , and preferably in two or more feedings . If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates , such as that of a race horse , bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible ; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic . <unk> ulcers are linked to a too @-@ high concentration of grain in the diet , particularly noticed in modern racehorses , where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90 % of all race horses . 
 In general , the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0 @-@ 10 % grain for mature idle horses ; between 20 @-@ 70 % for horses at work , depending on age , intensity of activity , and energy requirements . Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout . Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance . Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems , it may also trigger serious health problems that include Equine <unk> Rhabdomyolysis , or " tying up , " in horses prone to the condition . Another possible risk are various forms of horse colic . A relatively uncommon , but usually fatal concern is colitis @-@ X , which may be triggered by excess protein and lack of forage in the diet that allows for the multiplication of <unk> organisms , and is exacerbated by stress . 
 = = = Access to water = = = 
 Horses normally require free access to all the fresh , clean water they want , and to avoid dehydration , should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time . However , water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout . As long as a hot horse continues to work , it can drink its fill at periodic intervals , provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources . But when the workout is over , a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30 – 90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time . However , dehydration is also a concern , so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process . A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked . Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout , which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period . 
 Even a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction colic . Additionally , dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva , thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed . Thus , it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration ; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work , or in cold weather due to horses ' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment . To encourage drinking , owners may add electrolytes to the feed , additives to make the water especially palatable ( such as apple juice ) , or , when it is cold , to warm the water so that it is not at a near @-@ freezing temperature . 
 = = = Special feeding issues for Ponies = = = 
 Ponies and miniature horses are usually easy keepers and need less feed than full @-@ sized horses . This is not only because they are smaller , but also , because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses , they use feed more efficiently . Ponies easily become obese from overfeeding and are at high risk for colic and , especially , laminitis . Fresh grass is a particular danger to ponies ; they can develop laminitis in as little as one hour of grazing on lush pasture . 
 Incorrect feeding is also as much a concern as simple overfeeding . Ponies and miniatures need a diet relatively low in sugars and starches and calories , but higher in fibers . Miniature horses in particular need fewer calories pound for pound than a regular horse , and are more prone to <unk> than regular horses , and are also at higher risk of developing equine metabolic syndrome . 
 It is important to track the weight of a pony carefully , by use of a weight tape . Forages may be fed based on weight , at a rate of about 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 45 kg ) of forage for every 100 lb ( 45 kg ) . Forage , along with water and a salt and mineral block , is all most ponies require . If a hard @-@ working pony needs concentrates , a ratio of no more than 30 % concentrates to 70 % forage is recommended . Concentrates designed for horses , with added vitamins and minerals , will often provide insufficient nutrients at the small serving sizes needed for ponies . Therefore , if a pony requires concentrates , feed and supplements designed specially for ponies should be used . In the UK , extruded pellets designed for ponies are sometimes called " pony nuts . " . 
 = = = Special feeding issues for mules and donkeys = = = 
 Like ponies , mules and donkeys are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses . Mules need less protein than horses and do best on grass hay with a vitamin and mineral supplement . If mules are fed concentrates , they only need about half of what a horse requires . Like horses , mules require fresh , clean water , but are less likely to over @-@ drink when hot . 
 Donkeys , like mules , need less protein and more fiber than horses . Although the donkey ’ s gastrointestinal tract has no marked differences in structure to that of the horse , donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony . They only need to eat 1 @.@ 5 % of their body weight per day in dry matter . It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient <unk> , but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses , or possibly an increased gut retention time . 
 Donkeys do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods , as is natural for them in an arid climate . They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought . If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture , they require hay or a similar dried forage , with no more than a 1 : 4 ratio of legumes to grass . They also require salt and mineral supplements , and access to clean , fresh water . Like ponies and mules , in a lush climate , donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis . 
 = = = Treats = = = 
 Many people like to feed horses special treats such as carrots , sugar cubes , peppermint candies , or specially manufactured horse " cookies . " Horses do not need treats , and due to the risk of colic or choke , many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats . There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats , particularly a tendency to bite if hand @-@ fed , and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice . 
 However , if treats are allowed , carrots and compressed hay pellets are common , nutritious , and generally not harmful . Apples are also acceptable , though it is best if they are first cut into slices . Horse " cookies " are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses . They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities . However , many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed . This includes bread products , meat products , candy , and carbonated or alcoholic beverages . 
 It was once a common practice to give horses a weekly bran mash of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients . It is still done regularly in some places . While a warm , soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy , and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect , it is not nutritionally necessary . An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water , a mash may help provide extra hydration , and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather , but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans , and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary . There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus , unbalancing the diet , and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic . 
 = = Feed storage = = 
 All hay and concentrated feeds must be kept dry and free of mold , rodent feces , and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses . Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly . Due to fire hazards , hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp , rather than inside a horse barn itself , but should be kept under some kind of cover . Concentrates take up less storage space , are less of a fire hazard , and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed . A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical . Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis . ( see Illnesses related to improper feeding below ) 
 It is also important to never give a horse feed that was contaminated by the remains of a dead animal . This is a potential source of botulism . This is not an uncommon situation . For example , mice and birds can get into poorly stored grain and be trapped ; hay bales sometimes accidentally contain snakes , mice , or other small animals that were caught in the baling machinery during the harvesting process . 
 = = Feeding behavior = = 
 Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals . They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule ; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine . When horses are in a herd , their behavior is hierarchical ; the higher @-@ ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first . Low @-@ status animals , who eat last , may not get enough food , and if there is little available feed , higher @-@ ranking horses may keep lower @-@ ranking ones from eating at all . Therefore , unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals , it is important to either feed horses separately , or spread feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat . In some situations where horses are kept together , they may still be placed into separate herds , depending on nutritional needs ; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly . Horses may also eat in undesirable ways , such as bolting their feed , or eating too fast . This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances . 
 = = Dental issues = = 
 Horses ' teeth continually erupt throughout their life , are worn down as they eat , and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing . For this reason , horses need a dental examination at least once a year , and particular care must be paid to the dental needs of older horses . The process of grinding off uneven wear patterns on a horse 's teeth is called floating and can be performed by a veterinarian or a specialist in equine dentistry . 
 = = Illnesses related to improper feeding = = 
 Colic , choke , and laminitis can be life @-@ threatening when a horse is severely affected , and veterinary care is necessary to properly treat these conditions . Other conditions , while not life @-@ threatening , may have serious implications for the long @-@ term health and soundness of a horse . 
 = = = Colic = = = 
 Horse colic itself is not a disease , but rather a description of symptoms connected to abdominal pain . It can occur due to any number of digestive upsets , from mild bloating due to excess intestinal gas to life @-@ threatening <unk> . Colic is most often caused by a change in diet , either a planned change that takes place too quickly , or an accidental change , such as a horse getting out of its barn or paddock and ingesting unfamiliar plants . But colic has many other possible triggers including insufficient water , an irregular feeding schedule , stress , and illness . Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances , anything upsetting to the horse must travel all the way through the digestive system to be expelled . 
 = = = Choke = = = 
 Choke is not as common as colic , but is nonetheless commonly considered a veterinary emergency . The most common cause of choke is horses not chewing their food thoroughly , usually because of eating their food too quickly , especially if they do not have sufficient access to water , but also sometimes due to dental problems that make chewing painful . It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus , and immediate treatment is often required . Unlike choking in humans , choke in horses does not cut off respiration . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Horses are also susceptible to laminitis , a disease of the lamina of the hoof . <unk> has many causes , but the most common is related to a sugar and starch overload from a horse overeating certain types of food , particularly too much pasture grass high in fructan in early spring and late fall , or by consuming excessive quantities of grain . 
 = = = Growth disorders = = = 
 Young horses that are overfed or are fed a diet with an improper calcium : phosphorus ratio over time may develop a number of growth and orthopedic disorders , including osteochondrosis ( OCD ) , angular limb deformities ( ALD ) , and several conditions grouped under the popular term " contracted tendons . " If not properly treated , damage can be permanent . However , they can be treated if caught in time , given proper veterinary care , and any improper feeding practices are corrected . Young horses being fed for rapid growth in order to be shown or sold as yearlings are at particularly high risk . Adult horses with an improper diet may also develop a range of metabolic problems . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Moldy or dusty hay fed to horses is the most common cause of Recurrent airway obstruction , also known as COPD or " heaves . " This is a chronic condition of horses involving an allergic bronchitis characterized by wheezing , coughing , and labored breathing . 
 = = = " Tying up " = = = 
 Equine <unk> Rhabdomyolysis , also known as " tying up " or <unk> , is a condition to which only some horses are susceptible and most cases are linked to a genetic mutation . In horses prone to the condition , it usually occurs when a day of rest on full grain ration is followed by work the next day . This pattern of clinical signs led to the archaic nickname , " Monday morning sickness . " The condition may also be related to electrolyte imbalance . Proper diet management may help minimize the risk of an attack . 
 = Pinkerton ( album ) = 
 Pinkerton is the second studio album by the American rock band Weezer , released on September 24 , 1996 on DGC Records . After abandoning plans for a rock opera titled Songs from the Black Hole , Weezer recorded Pinkerton between songwriter Rivers Cuomo 's terms at Harvard University , where he wrote much of the album . 
 To better capture their live sound , Weezer produced Pinkerton themselves , creating a darker , more abrasive album than their 1994 self @-@ titled debut . Cuomo 's lyrics express disillusionment with the rock lifestyle ; the album is named after the character BF Pinkerton from Giacomo Puccini 's 1904 opera Madama Butterfly , whom Cuomo described as an " asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star " . Like the opera , the album contains references to Japanese culture . 
 Pinkerton debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 and fell short of sales expectations after the success of Weezer 's debut . It initially received mixed reviews , but went on to achieve cult status and wide acclaim years later ; the 2010 " Deluxe Edition " reissue holds a perfect score on aggregate review website Metacritic . The album produced three singles : " El Scorcho " , " The Good Life " and " Pink Triangle " . It is the last Weezer album to feature bassist Matt Sharp . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1994 , after the multi @-@ platinum success of Weezer 's self @-@ titled debut album , Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays . In his home state of Connecticut , songwriter Rivers Cuomo began preparing material for Weezer 's next album using an 8 @-@ track recorder . His original concept was a science fiction rock opera titled Songs from the Black Hole that expressed his mixed feelings about success . Weezer developed Songs from the Black Hole through intermittent recording sessions throughout 1995 . 
 In March , Cuomo , who was born with one leg shorter than the other , had extensive leg surgery to lengthen his right leg , followed by painful physiotherapy sessions . This affected his songwriting , as he would spend long periods hospitalized , unable to walk without the use of a cane , and under the influence of painkillers . In the same period , Cuomo applied to study classical composition at Harvard University with an application letter describing his disillusionment with the rock lifestyle , writing : 
 Fans ask me all the time what it is like to be a rock star . I can tell that they are dreaming , as I dreamed , when I was a kid , of someday ruling the world with a rock band . I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock @-@ star @-@ to @-@ be [ ... ] you will get lonely . You will meet two hundred people every night , but each conversation will generally last approximately thirty seconds , and consist of you trying to convince them that no , you do not want their underwear . Then you will be alone again , in your motel room . Or you will be on your bus , in your little space , trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city , whichever city it is . This is the life of a rock star . 
 Cuomo felt frustrated by the " limitations of rock " . Every night after performing with Weezer , he would listen to Giacomo Puccini 's 1904 opera Madama Butterfly ; the " depth of emotion and sadness and tragedy " inspired him to go further with his music . By May 1996 , Cuomo 's songwriting had become " darker , more visceral and exposed , less playful " , and the Songs from the Black Hole concept was abandoned . Weezer 's second album would instead feature songs written while Cuomo was at Harvard , chronicling his loneliness and frustration , or what Cuomo referred to as his " dark side " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 In 1995 , a few days before Cuomo left to study at Harvard University , Weezer gathered for two weeks of recording at New York City 's Electric Lady Studios where they had recorded their debut , and tracked the songs " Why Bother ? " , " Getchoo " , " No Other One " and " Tired of Sex " . Weezer hoped to explore " deeper , darker , more experimental stuff " which would better resemble the band 's live sound ; to this end , they decided against hiring a producer , feeling that " the best way for us to sound like ourselves is to record on our own . " To give the album a live , " raw " feel , Cuomo , guitarist Brian Bell and bassist Matt Sharp recorded their vocals in tandem around three microphones rather than overdubbing them separately . 
 While Cuomo was at Harvard , other Weezer members worked on side projects . Sharp promoted the debut album by his band The Rentals . Bell and drummer Patrick Wilson worked on material for their bands the Space Twins and the Special Goodness , respectively . In January 1996 , during Cuomo 's winter break , Weezer regrouped for a two @-@ week recording session at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys , California to complete the songs they had worked on the previous August . After recording new songs " El Scorcho " and " Pink Triangle " , Weezer separated again while Cuomo returned to Harvard . 
 During Cuomo 's 1996 spring break , Weezer regrouped at Sound City Studios and recorded three new songs , " The Good Life " , " Across the Sea " and " Falling for You " , before Cuomo returned to Harvard for his university finals . The band put the finishing touches on the album in the summer of 1996 in Los Angeles . Two additional tracks , " I Swear It 's True " and " Getting Up and Leaving " , were abandoned prior to the mixing process . 
 = = Writing and composition = = 
 Pinkerton features a darker , more abrasive sound than Weezer 's debut . Writing from a more direct and personal perspective , Cuomo wrote of his dysfunctional relationships , sexual frustration , and struggles with identity . The album charts his " cycle between ' lame @-@ o and <unk> ' . " At just under thirty @-@ five minutes , Pinkerton is , according to Cuomo , " short by design . " 
 The album 's first song , " Tired of Sex " , written before the release of the Blue Album , has Cuomo describing meaningless sex encounters with groupies , reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him . " Across the Sea " was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan : " When I got the letter , I fell in love with her . It was such a great letter . I was very lonely at the time , but at the same time I was very depressed that I would never meet her . " Second single " The Good Life " chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner . Cuomo , who felt isolated at Harvard , wrote the song after " becoming frustrated with that hermit 's life I was leading , the ascetic life . And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect , ideal woman . And so I wrote the song . And I started to turn around and come back the other way . " Lead single " El Scorcho " addresses Cuomo 's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard ; he explained that the song " is more about me , because at that point I hadn 't even talked to the girl , I didn 't really know much about her . " The album 's final single , " Pink Triangle " , describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married , but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Pinkerton is named after the character BF Pinkerton from Madama Butterfly , who marries a Japanese woman named Butterfly . Calling him an " asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star " , Cuomo felt the character was " the perfect symbol for the part of myself that I am trying to come to terms with on this album . " Other titles considered included Playboy and Diving into the Wreck ( after a poem by Adrienne Rich ) . 
 Like Madama Butterfly , Pinkerton views Japanese culture from the perspective of an outsider who considers Japan fragile and sensual ; the album infuses the Japanese allusions with its narrator 's romantic disappointments and sexual frustration . Cuomo wrote that Pinkerton " is really the clash of East vs West . My <unk> , zen , kyokushin , self @-@ denial , self @-@ abnegation , no @-@ emotion , cool @-@ faced side versus my Italian @-@ American heavy metal side . " He stated that " the ten songs are sequenced in the order in which I wrote them ( with two minor exceptions ) . So as a whole , the album kind of tells the story of my struggle with my inner Pinkerton . " 
 = = = Artwork = = = 
 The artwork on the album 's cover is <unk> <unk> no yuki ( " Night snow at <unk> " ) , print number 16 in Japanese ukiyo @-@ e artist Hiroshige 's popular 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō series . Lyrics from Madama Butterfly are printed on the Pinkerton CD in their original Italian : " Everywhere in the world , the roving Yankee takes his pleasure and his profit , indifferent to all risks . He drops anchor at random ... " 
 Behind the album 's CD tray is a map with the title " Isola della <unk> e <unk> di cane " ( Italian for " Island of the Butterfly and Peninsula of Dog " ) ; on the map are a ship named USS Pinkerton and " Mykel and Carli Island " , an allusion to Weezer 's fan club founders . The map includes the names of some of Cuomo 's influences , including Howard Stern , Yngwie Malmsteen , Brian Wilson , Lou Barlow , Joe Matt , Camille Paglia and Ace Frehley . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 Geffen A & R rep Todd Sullivan described Pinkerton as a " very brave record , " but worried : " What sort of light does this put the band in ? It could have been interpreted as them being a disposable pop band . " The label was pleased with the record and felt that " no one 's going to be disappointed " . 
 Weezer turned down a video treatment for lead single " El Scorcho " proposed by Spike Jonze , who had previously helped raise the band 's status with his videos for " Undone – The Sweater Song " and " Buddy Holly " . Cuomo explained : " I really don 't want the songs to come across untainted this time around ... I really want to communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way . I 'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song , or exaggerate certain aspects . " The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles , surrounded by light fixtures flashing in time to the music . Mark Romanek , the video 's director , quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo , leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself . The video debuted on MTV 's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay . 
 A day before Pinkerton was to be released on September 24 , 1996 , a restraining order was obtained against the band and Geffen by Encino , California @-@ based security firm Pinkerton 's Inc . The company sued Weezer and Geffen for alleged federal trademark infringement , claiming they were trying to capitalize on the company 's reputation . Under the terms of the restraining order , which had Pinkerton 's Inc seeking two million dollars in damages , Weezer would be kept from " selling , distributing , or advertising an album with the name Pinkerton . " Geffen spokesman Dennis Dennehy defended the title , arguing that " to Weezer , Pinkerton is a character in Puccini 's opera Madama Butterfly ... It was not meant to be aimed at any sort of corporate entity . " Cuomo wrote a six @-@ page paper defending his choice of the title , explaining " why I chose it , and how it works for the album , and how it 's essential . " The case was thrown out of court after the judge determined that " the hardship of not issuing the Pinkerton disc would be greater for Geffen than any hardship Pinkerton 's Inc or its shareholders might incur from consumers who mistakenly presume the company has anything to do with the album . " 
 As it became apparent that Pinkerton was not meeting expected sales figures , Weezer felt pressure to make another music video more to the liking of MTV . The music video for " The Good Life " , directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris , stars Mary Lynn Rajskub as a pizza delivery girl and uses simultaneous camera angles appearing on screen as a fractured full image . Geffen rush @-@ released the video to try to save the commercially failing album , but was not successful . 
 In October 1996 , the band toured the Far East with concert appearances in Australia , New Zealand and Japan . Afterwards , the band flew home to Los Angeles , where Patrick Wilson and Matt Sharp made a promotional appearance on the nationally syndicated radio show Modern Rock Live in an attempt to improve the album 's standing on the US album charts . A few days later , on November 1 , Weezer launched its tour of North America at the Ventura Theatre in Ventura , California . On November 6 , Weezer performed an acoustic set at <unk> High School in Seattle due to a contest won by a student . A few of the songs performed at the acoustic set were released in 1997 on the Good Life EP . Weezer continued to tour until Christmas 1996 .

 In July 2009 , Karl Koch , the webmaster for Weezer 's website , revealed that Weezer was preparing a " deluxe edition " of Pinkerton . On November 20 , 2010 , the reissue debuted at number six on the Billboard Catalog Albums chart . 
 On December 12 , 2011 , Cuomo released the third album of his demos , Alone III : The Pinkerton Years . It comprises demos recorded between 1993 and 1996 , when Cuomo was studying at Harvard and writing material for Pinkerton and the abandoned Songs from the Black Hole project . The album was included with a book , The Pinkerton Diaries , which collects Cuomo 's writings from the era .

 Pinkerton peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard charts , falling far short of sales of its multi @-@ platinum predecessor , The Blue Album . Initial reviews were mixed . Jeff <unk> of Entertainment Weekly criticized Weezer 's choice to self @-@ produce the album and dismissed it as " a collection of get @-@ down party anthems for <unk> " . Writing for Rolling Stone , Rob O 'Connor called the songwriting " juvenile " and described the song " Tired of Sex " as " aimless " . Rolling Stone readers voted the album the third worst of 1996 . 
 Melody Maker praised Pinkerton 's music , but advised the listener " to ignore the lyrics entirely . " NME praised the album , writing that " by the time the affecting acoustic lament ' Butterfly ' wafts in like Big Star at a wildlife protection meeting , Pinkerton starts feeling like a truly moving album . " Pitchfork awarded the album 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , writing that " Pinkerton might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys ' debut , but if given a chance , it might surprise even some anti @-@ Weezer folk . " 
 Cuomo was embarrassed by the album 's mixed reception and the confessional nature of its songs . In August 1997 , he wrote : " This has been a tough year . It 's not just that the world has said Pinkerton isn 't worth a shit , but that the Blue album wasn 't either . It was a fluke . It was the [ " Buddy Holly " ] video . I 'm a shitty songwriter . " In 2001 , he told Entertainment Weekly : " It 's a hideous record ... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front of hundreds of thousands of people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won 't go away . It 's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it , and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself . "

 Despite its mixed initial reception , Pinkerton has had enduring sales ; by August 2009 , it had sold 852 @,@ 000 copies in the United States and was certified gold . In later years it garnered critical acclaim and cult status through internet word @-@ of @-@ mouth , and eventually came to be considered among Weezer 's best work by fans and critics . 
 In 2002 , Rolling Stone readers voted Pinkerton the 16th greatest album of all time . In 2004 , Rolling Stone gave the album a new review , awarding it five stars out of five and adding it to the " Rolling Stone Hall of Fame " . In 2005 , Spin named it number 61 in its list of the 100 best albums from 1985 to 2005 . In 2003 , Pitchfork placed Pinkerton at # 53 on their " Top 100 Albums of the 1990s " list , and also gave it a perfect rating . In 2007 , Drowned in Sound praised it as " the ultimate break @-@ up album , the best unrequited love album and the greatest collection of confused emotions captured in the universe ... EVER ! " Guitar World ranked it # 76 on its list of the " Top 100 Guitar Albums of All @-@ Time " . New Zealand 's The Movement placed it # 12 on its list of " The 101 Best Albums of the 90s " and Pure Pop of Mexico ranked it # 21 on its list of " The 50 Best Albums of the 90s . " It received perfect scores from both AllMusic and Tiny Mix Tapes , the latter calling it " one of the best albums of the 20th century . " The 2010 " Deluxe Edition " reissue holds a perfect 100 out of 100 score ( indicating " universal acclaim " ) on aggregate review website Metacritic . 
 By 2008 , Cuomo had reconsidered the album , saying : " Pinkerton 's great . It 's super @-@ deep , brave , and authentic . Listening to it , I can tell that I was really going for it when I wrote and recorded a lot of those songs . " In 2010 , Brian Bell told The Aquarian Weekly : " Pinkerton has definitely taken on a life of its own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist , you just have to do what you believe in at the time , whether it ’ s accepted or not . You just have to keep going with it . " In 2015 , following the Pinkerton reissue and the " Memories " tour , in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety , Cuomo said : 
 The experience of learning those songs again , singing them every night , working on them with the guys , and then being in a relatively small venue with 1 @,@ 000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable , seeing them air @-@ drum all the fills — it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we 'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans , for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years . 
 Pinkerton has been influential on acts including Manchester Orchestra , Yellowcard , Saves the Day , Taking Back Sunday , The <unk> , Thursday , the Used , The <unk> , Dashboard Confessional , The Promise Ring , The Long Goodbye , and Rye Coalition .

 Chamois Niortais Football Club ( often referred to as simply Les Chamois ) is a French association football club based in the commune of Niort , in the Deux @-@ Sèvres department of western France . It was founded in 1925 by Charles Boinot , the son of the owner of a local chamois leather factory . The club 's badge shows a chamois goat standing on a football . The club 's home stadium is the Stade René Gaillard in Niort , which has a capacity of 10 @,@ 898 although in the last 20 years attendances have generally averaged below 5 @,@ 000 per match due to the club 's relatively small fan base . Chamois Niortais has traditionally played in an entirely blue home strip , although away strips regularly differ . 
 For the first 20 years of the club 's existence they played in local leagues around the Centre @-@ Ouest region . In 1945 , after the Second World War , the side joined the Championnat de France amateur . They achieved promotion to Division 3 in 1970 and stayed in the division for the following eight seasons . Between 1980 and 1984 , the team played in Division 4 before winning promotion back to Division 3 . The club gained professional status for the first time the following year when they were promoted to Division 2 . After another promotion in 1987 , they played in Division 1 for the only time in the 1987 – 88 season , but were relegated after one season . 
 Chamois Niortais were relegated to the Championnat National in 2008 , and relegated again a season later , thereby losing their professional status . After finishing as runners @-@ up in the Championnat National , the team were promoted back to Ligue 2 for the 2012 – 13 season .

 After the First World War , local chamois leather factory owner , <unk> Boinot , established the first sports club in Niort , Amicale Club Niortais . Soon after , the football section of the club was founded and named Étoile <unk> <unk> . In 1923 , many players were conscripted into the French army . In 1925 , a number of the players returned to the town and Boinot 's son , Charles , set up the first proper association football team in the town , which he named Chamois Niortais Football Club . 
 For the first season , the presidency of the club was entrusted to Jean <unk> , a chemical engineer at the Boinot factory . Georges <unk> , also a worker in the factory , was appointed as the club 's first secretary . The original team played in a fully white strip , and competed in the regional championship of the Ligue de Charentes . In 1929 , the Swiss footballer <unk> was named as the club 's first manager and the first committee was elected . Throughout the 1930s the club continued to grow in size , enlisting more players and members , despite the team performing relatively poorly in the league . 
 For the 1932 – 33 season , Chamois Niortais joined the DH Centre @-@ Ouest , the highest level of regional football in France , and finished eighth in their first season . The side achieved consecutive sixth- and seventh @-@ place finishes in the next two seasons , before being relegated to the Promotion d 'Honneur in 1936 . The team played in the division for three seasons , until they gained promotion back to the DH Centre @-@ Ouest at the end of the 1938 – 39 campaign . In 1939 , Joseph Boinot was appointed president of the club . The following year the club pulled off a major coup with the signing of Czechoslovakia international Ferdinand Faczinek , who played for the club for one season before transferring to FC Sète at the end of the 1940 – 41 campaign , after which the Second World War halted competitive football for two years in France . In 1943 , the club were one of the founder members of the Championnat de France amateur ( CFA ) , the highest level of amateur football in France . 
 = = = After the Second World War = = = 
 Chamois Niortais were soon relegated from the CFA and returned to the DH Centre @-@ Ouest in 1945 . Led by Faczinek , who had returned to the club as player @-@ manager in 1943 , the side won the DH Centre @-@ Ouest for three consecutive seasons . Despite this success , Faczinek left the club in 1948 and was replaced by former France international Maurice <unk> . The team re @-@ joined the CFA for the 1948 – 49 season and played in the division for the following five campaigns , achieving a second @-@ place finish in 1951 , when they finished behind Stade <unk> by five points . In 1953 , the side finished bottom of the division and were relegated back to the DH Centre @-@ Ouest . Following the relegation , manager Nicolas <unk> was sacked and replaced by Georges <unk> , who had previously coached AJ Auxerre . The side remained in the DH Centre @-@ Ouest until 1960 when , under the guidance of Nordine Ben Ali , they won the league title by a single point ahead of Poitiers FC to return to the CFA . 
 The side struggled in their first season back in the third tier , achieving a tenth @-@ placed finish . After being runners @-@ up in the division for two consecutive seasons in 1961 – 62 and 1962 – 63 , the team secured a number of mid @-@ table league finishes under Kazimir Hnatow . After Hnatow left Chamois Niortais in 1966 , the club 's fortunes on the pitch began to diminish and they were eventually relegated at the end of the 1968 – 69 campaign after ending the season with just 12 points from 26 matches . Upon the restructuring of the league system , the team joined the newly formed Division 3 in 1970 . They played there for the following eight years , but never finished higher than fourth in the division . In 1978 , the club finished last and were again relegated to the fourth level , but were immediately promoted back to Division 3 after finishing as runners @-@ up in 1979 . However , they again finished bottom of the division and in 1980 returned to Division 4 , where they played for the next four seasons . In April 1984 , Patrick Parizon was appointed as manager and the following month , the side secured a third @-@ placed finish to gain promotion back to Division 3 . In 1984 – 85 , the team lost only three matches in the entire campaign as they finished comfortably top of the division . A 2 – 1 victory over Montauban on 18 May 1985 confirmed their promotion to Division 2 for the first time in the history of Chamois Niortais . 
 = = = Professional status = = = 
 Thanks to the promotion , Chamois Niortais became a professional club for the 1985 – 86 season . The season began well for the side , as they achieved a 1 – 0 win against USL Dunkerque on 16 July 1985 . They went on to accomplish a respectable fifth @-@ placed finish in their first season with a total of 37 points . The next campaign saw unprecedented success for the team , as they racked up a 17 @-@ match unbeaten run on the way to the league championship . Their title triumph was confirmed with a 2 – 0 victory over US Orléans at the Stade René Gaillard on 23 May 1987 . 
 The following season turned out to be the club 's only season to date in the top tier of French football . The season began with a 1 – 1 draw with RC Lens and the side 's first victory came against Montpellier HSC on 1 August 1987 . The team also managed a win in their first ever televised match , defeating AS Saint @-@ Étienne 2 – 1 on 18 August 1987 . After a promising start , the team languished around the bottom of the division for the majority of the campaign , and were eventually relegated back to Division 2 on 10 June 1988 , after being beaten 3 – 0 by SM Caen , finishing just one point behind RC Lens . 
 The relegation saw the end of Patrick Parizon 's reign as head coach as he was replaced by Victor <unk> . <unk> remained manager for the following three seasons , until the side were relegated to Division 3 at the end of the 1990 – 91 campaign . The team returned to the second tier after just one season as they comfortably won Division 3 . The next 13 consecutive seasons saw a number of mid @-@ table finishes in Ligue 2 , until a poor 2004 – 05 campaign , in which the team lost 21 of their 38 league matches . Philippe <unk> was appointed as the new manager in 2005 , and he successfully escaped from the Championnat National at the first attempt , securing the title with a 2 – 0 victory over Sporting Toulon Var on 13 May 2006 . Niort found the following two seasons difficult in Ligue 2 , finishing 16th in the 2006 – 07 season and then suffering relegation in 2007 – 08 after conceding an injury time goal to US Boulogne . 
 = = = To regional football and back again = = = 
 Denis <unk> was hired as the club 's new manager in August 2008 , and despite hopes of a swift return to Ligue 2 , the team performed poorly throughout the 2008 – 09 campaign . The side failed to win a league match during the first three months of the season , and that form continued into 2009 . They went into their final match of the season , away at Pacy Vallée @-@ d 'Eure , requiring three points to avoid successive relegations . However , the side could only procure a 0 – 0 draw and were relegated to the Championnat de France amateur for the first time since 1970 . The relegation saw the end of Chamois Niortais 's era as a professional club , as they were forced to become a semi @-@ professional outfit due to the <unk> rules . In June 2009 , Pascal Gastien was appointed as manager for his third spell in charge of the club , handed the task of achieving promotion back to the Championnat National at the first attempt . The club won the CFA Group C that season , and was subsequently promoted back to the National division for the following campaign . Niort secured their third @-@ tier status with an 11th @-@ place finish in the 2010 – 11 season . The following season , the team finished as runners @-@ up in the Championnat National behind Nîmes Olympique to return to Ligue 2 for the 2012 – 13 campaign and regain their professional status . 
 = = Colours and badge = = 
 The badge of Chamois Niortais features a chamois goat standing on a football , and the background of the crest is royal blue , which has featured in the club 's home colours since its founding . When the club was founded in 1925 , Chamois Niortais adopted a white strip . Since then , however , the club has usually played in a home strip of royal blue jersey , shorts and socks . In the 2007 – 08 season the team played in a gold and black kit for the first time , to commemorate 20 years since the club competed in Division 1 . 
 For the following season , the home kit reverted to the usual all @-@ blue strip and the jersey currently has a white sash across it . The away kit for the current season is the reverse of the home strip , and consists of a white jersey with blue sash , white shorts and white socks . For the 2009 – 10 season , the club 's kits are produced by Italian sportswear company , <unk> , and the main shirt sponsor is <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 When Chamois Niortais were founded , the club had no fixed home ground and played friendly matches at various venues in and around Niort . In 1926 , when the team joined the Ligue du Charentes , the club adopted the small Stade de Genève as their first home . They continued to play at the Stade de Genève for the majority of the following 50 years until , in the early 1970s , it was announced that the side would move into a new stadium . On 3 August 1974 , the Stade Venise Verte was opened , with the inaugural game being an exhibition match between Chamois Niortais and Dynamo Kyiv . Some time later , the stadium was renamed the Stade René Gaillard in honour of René Gaillard , the former mayor of Niort . 
 At present , the stadium has four stands : the Tribune d 'Honneur , the Tribune <unk> , the Tribune Populaire Nord , and the Tribune Populaire Sud . The four stands currently have a combined capacity of 10 @,@ 898 , with 1 @,@ 324 of these being standing places . The stadium is typical of many continental European grounds , with an athletics track between the pitch and the stands . Next to the stadium there is a small annexed ground where the club 's reserve and youth teams play their matches . The first televised match at the ground took place on 18 August 1987 , when AS Saint @-@ Étienne were beaten 2 – 1 . The record attendance at the stadium was set on 24 October 1987 , when 16 @,@ 715 people saw Chamois Niortais defeat Olympique de Marseille by two goals to one in a Division 1 encounter . 
 = = Supporters = = 
 Chamois Niortais have always had a relatively small fan base , with very few fans from outside of the area around Niort . The club has one main supporters ' organisation , named " <unk> 79 " . The name is taken from " uni " , the French for united , " <unk> " , the Latin word meaning chamois . The 79 symbolises the department number of Deux @-@ Sèvres . The organisation has no history of violence or extremism , and works closely with the football club to try to improve the atmosphere at home matches . 
 To date , the highest ever average attendance in a season was 10 @,@ 142 during the club 's Division 1 campaign of 1987 – 88 . Since then , the average attendance has usually been under 5 @,@ 000 spectators .

 " Thanksgiving Orphans " is the ninth episode of the fifth season of the American television sitcom , Cheers , co @-@ written by Cheri <unk> and Bill <unk> and directed by James Burrows . It originally aired on November 27 , 1986 , on NBC . The characters do not have families or friends to spend time with , and some of their plans backfire . They gather for a Thanksgiving feast , which degenerates into a food fight . Burrows filmed the food @-@ fight scene ( which was only partially choreographed ) twice . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Thanksgiving , Sam ( Ted Danson ) is with his fiancée Wendy . Frasier ( Kelsey Grammer ) is lonely , and wants some company . Cliff 's mother volunteers to feed the homeless , but Cliff ( John Ratzenberger ) — who has done that during the past year — is unwilling . Norm ( George Wendt ) does not want to go to his mother @-@ in @-@ law 's overheated house , which lacks beer and a television . Woody ( Woody Harrelson ) is still in Indiana , away from his family . Carla 's children are with Nick , her ex @-@ husband . At Diane 's insistence , Carla ( Rhea Perlman ) invites the gang for a Thanksgiving <unk> . However , Diane ( Shelley Long ) has been invited to her American literature professor 's annual Thanksgiving party where she hopes to meet William Styron . 
 The scene in Carla 's new house ( first seen in the 1986 episode , " House of Horrors with Formal Dining and Used Brick " ) begins with Woody , Cliff , and Frasier watching television . Norm arrives with an uncooked turkey and puts it in Carla 's oven while he explains that Vera went to her mother 's house . Sam arrives with dessert , but without Wendy ; she and her sister , who arrived from out of town , did not want to go to Carla 's . Diane then arrives , dressed as a pilgrim . At the professor 's party she discovered that she had been invited to be domestic help , and left in tears . The gang , including a reluctant Carla , decides to allow her to stay for dinner . 
 They continue watching television for a while until Diane turns it off and forces them to have dinner . In the dining room , when they are eager to eat , Diane tells them to suspend their eating until the turkey is ready . As suppertime comes and goes , the turkey is still very undercooked and the trimmings have gone cold . Carla and Norm start blaming each other for the turkey 's slow cooking . Norm throws some of Carla 's peas at her and then she throws carrots back at him . Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier , who throws gravy skin back at Cliff but misses and accidentally hits Woody . The whole gang are poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and loudly tells them to stop . When she is close to scolding them , Sam throws cranberry sauce at her , so the food fight resumes . By the time the food fight ends , the turkey is finally cooked . The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can . Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing the cranberry sauce at her . The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters . Vera tells Norm to fetch Norm 's own coat , i.e. take her home , and Norm remorsefully agrees .

 Cheri <unk> and Bill Steinkellner wrote the episode and it was directed by James Burrows . Burrows shot the food fight scene twice , with the scene <unk> after the point where the character Sam Malone throws cranberry sauce at Diane Chambers ' face . The extended takes resulted in a strong food odor around the set . In one of the food fight takes , the floor was covered with a " plastic tarp " in order to prevent vital materials from being broken while the cast was slipping on the floor during the scene . However , the attempt was ineffective . After the episode aired , the production crew received a few angry letters disapproving of the food fight scene " at a time when world hunger was a political cause du jour . " According to Burrows , the food not used for the scene was donated to charity . 
 Bernadette Birkett , whose husband George Wendt portrays Norm Peterson , appears in the episode as Norm 's wife Vera , though Birkett is not credited for the role and Vera 's face is never visible to the audience because she is struck by a pumpkin pie thrown by Diane . Birkett had previously appeared in a 1984 episode , " Fairy Tales Can Come True " , as Sharon O 'Hare , who dressed as Tinker Bell on Halloween .

 The episode aired on NBC on Thanksgiving Day , November 27 , 1986 . For the week ending November 30 , it had the sixth highest Nielsen rating at 21 @.@ 7 , with a 38 share . Leigh <unk> of The Huffington Post included the food fight sequence in a list of the 10 Most Awkward Thanksgiving Scenes of All Time from movies and television . TV Guide ranked it number seven on its 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list . IGN called it the fourth best Cheers episode , highlighting the witty dialogue and the bonding between characters . 
 An A.V. Club retrospective group review praised the episode , especially for the food fight . The reviewers also highlighted the effective short reference by the characters to a past colleague , the late Coach Ernie Pantusso , and the setting of much of the episode at Carla 's house rather than the bar . Molly Eichel , one of the reviewers , was especially interested in moments other than the food fight , such as the " childishness " ( also described as " devolution " ) of the characters , Diane 's <unk> toward the gang , and Eichel 's " favorite part " , Vera 's long @-@ awaited appearance , even though her face was covered with pumpkin pie .

 = Harmondsworth Great Barn = 
 Harmondsworth Great Barn ( also known as Manor Farm Barn ) is a medieval barn on the former Manor Farm in the village of Harmondsworth , in the London Borough of Hillingdon , England ( previously part of the historic county of Middlesex ) . It is north @-@ west of fields and the A4 next to Heathrow Airport . Built in the early 15th century by Winchester College , it is the largest timber @-@ framed building in England and is regarded as an outstanding example of medieval carpentry . It was described by the English poet John Betjeman as the " Cathedral of Middlesex " . A similar though smaller barn is part of the Manor Farm complex in Ruislip . 
 The barn was briefly in royal ownership but passed into the hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s . It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex . After the company went bankrupt in 2006 , the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded . The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year . English Heritage stepped in , using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner 's consent , and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012 . It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The barn measures 58 @.@ 55 metres ( 192 @.@ 1 ft ) long , 11 @.@ 3 metres ( 37 ft ) wide , and 11 @.@ 9 metres ( 39 ft ) high , with twelve bays , running in a north – south direction . It occupies a footprint of about 661 square metres ( 7 @,@ 110 sq ft ) and has an internal volume of about 4 @,@ 890 cubic metres ( 173 @,@ 000 cu ft ) . There are three doors on the east side to permit the entry of wagons . The exterior of the barn is <unk> , with a hipped tiled roof . It was originally a much larger structure , with two wings , but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now @-@ demolished hamlet of Heathrow , on the site of the modern airport . The vast majority of the surviving structure is original ; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers , including the external weatherboarding , have survived from the original building . It has been described by English Heritage as " a supreme example of late @-@ medieval craftsmanship – a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe . " 
 It is an outstanding example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber @-@ framed building in England . Barns of this type were based on a longitudinal frame , with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates . Because such barns tend to be both long and high , they experience high structural loads from the wind . They therefore have numerous internal braces , acting in much the same way as buttresses , to strengthen the structure . This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance , with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof . The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time , and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved . 
 The barn 's main posts are made of oak . Each is about 14 inches ( 36 cm ) square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone , a common building material in medieval London . The posts were cut into shape using axes , adzes and saws , the marks from which can still be seen in some instances . The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals , called assembly marks , on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined . Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two . They were all placed upside down , relative to the original direction of the tree . This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top ; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof . Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right , they may have made some mistakes along the way , as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and <unk> that were never used . Alternatively , the timbers may have been reused from another construction . 
 The rows of arcade posts support tie beams , with curved braces to strengthen the frame . The collar beam , which supports the opposing principal rafters , is supported by the crown post . Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are <unk> into the principal rafters , with additional support from curved wind braces . Some aspects of this design are unusual , both in the way that they are executed and in terms of their early date . A number of features in the barn 's carpentry are described by English Heritage as " experimental , precocious and regionally unusual , " which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it . 
 The use of aisles enabled the barn 's architects to increase its width and by doing so , provided the maximum space for threshing floors . The longer the barn was , the more threshing floors could be provided . English barns went through an evolution in the number of threshing floors ; the earliest had just one central floor , a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain . Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three threshing floors , allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time . 
 The boards on the exterior of the barn are made from a mixture of oak , elm and softwoods such as pine and fir . Some are of modern or relatively modern origins ; those on the south end of the barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire . Each side of the barn 's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76 @,@ 000 tiles , which were originally held in place by oak pegs . Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay . 
 The floor of the barn was originally made of hard @-@ packed flint gravel held together with iron panning , excavated from a local gravel deposit , which was used as a more readily available alternative to stone . In subsequent years it was repaired with brick , tile and , ultimately , cement , obscuring the original appearance of the floor . An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of the west side of the barn . 
 The design of the barn has provided inspiration to a number of architects in the 19th and 20th centuries who were involved with the Gothic Revival movement . Sir George Gilbert Scott visited the barn in 1850 and sketched it , using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch , New Zealand . The library of Mansfield College , Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to the barn . Bedales School 's library , completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson , may also have had its origins in the barn 's design . 
 = = History = = 
 The manor of Harmondsworth was owned before the Norman Conquest by King Harold Godwinson , but was seized by William the Conqueror after Harold 's death at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Three years later , William granted it to William FitzOsbern , one of his close confidants . It was subsequently transferred to the Abbey of Rouen . In 1391 , it was acquired from the abbot and prior by William of Wykeham , the Bishop of Winchester . He gave it to Winchester College , which he had founded in 1382 , as part of his endowment of that establishment . Its revenues went towards supporting the college . 
 There was already a " Great Barn " on the site , and as early as 1110 a manor record shows that men who were not wanted for ploughing were required to " thresh in the Great Barn until sunset " . A granary was recorded in a survey conducted in 1293 – 4 and a further survey of 1324 recorded the existence of a monastic grange in addition to the granary . The wheat barn at Harmondsworth was damaged in a storm in 1398 and records from Winchester College show that two carpenters were sent to make repairs , for which a large quantity of tiles , nails and other roofing materials was purchased . By this time , however , the existing barn was evidently becoming inadequate . The college 's records indicate that in 1426 – 7 it commissioned two men , William <unk> ( or <unk> ) and John atte Oke , to obtain timbers from Kingston upon Thames to use for a new barn at Harmondsworth . This date matches an early fifteenth @-@ century origin for the Great Barn 's timbers , which has been established through dendrochronology . The architect is not known , but it is possible that William Wyse may have been involved . He was the main carpenter for New College , Oxford and the master carpenter at Windsor Castle in 1430 , and worked on repairing the aisles at the church of St Mary 's in Harmondsworth , practically next door to the manor . Carpenters from Ickenham and Uxbridge were also involved and a <unk> appears to have been employed by the college at the same time . Once completed , the barn would have been used to thresh and store grain from the manor farm . 
 In 1544 , the manor was taken by King Henry VIII to add to his hunting estate around Hampton Court but he does not appear to have used it , and shortly afterwards he granted it to the Paget family . It remained in their hands until 1869 . During the first half of the 20th century the manor was owned by the Ashby family . The last Ashby to farm there died in 1948 and the farm was sold in 1950 to Peter Purser , who died in the late 1970s . It was already a Scheduled Monument and was given Grade I listed building status in March 1950 when new heritage protection legislation was brought into force . The barn continued to be used for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s . It had a couple of narrow escapes during the 20th century ; during the Second World War a German V @-@ 1 flying bomb flattened a nearby barn , but only managed to dislodge a few roof tiles on the Great Barn . The barn 's southern bay was seriously damaged by fire in 1972 but it was subsequently restored . The building was greatly admired by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman , who dubbed it " the cathedral of Middlesex " . It underwent a detailed eighteen @-@ month survey in the late 1980s by the craftsman Peter McCurdy ( who later went on to rebuild Shakespeare 's Globe theatre ) , supported by the Museum of London . 
 = = Neglect and rescue = = 
 The barn and the surrounding Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John <unk> Group , a builder / property developer which aimed to restore the barn to serve as a showcase for the company . The farm underwent major changes , with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L @-@ shaped office building constructed facing the barn . Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn , following an initial renovation carried out in 1989 . However , in 2006 , the company went into receivership . The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver 's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through . 
 The receiver offered the barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £ 1 , but both refused the offer . Instead , a Gibraltar @-@ based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn . The company had no other assets and it was reported that it was seeking to speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport . Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished , although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway . The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn , which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one @-@ day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September . 
 The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ( SPAB ) raised the alarm in a 2009 edition of its magazine , Cornerstone , in which the deteriorating condition of the barn was highlighted as the magazine 's cover story . The magazine reported that on a recent visit " more than a dozen gaps in the tiled roof were seen , some large . The site appeared to lack fire @-@ fighting equipment or alarms , and could be easily accessed . Plants have taken root in the stone @-@ and @-@ brick plinth , and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands . " English Heritage issued a statement saying : " The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage ( and the local authority ) for some years despite our offers of help , support , advice and grants . It should be noted that the Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not , according to plans we have seen , propose its demolition or removal . However , this still leaves question marks over the barn ’ s future and in particular , the issues of viability and setting . " 
 Following the publication of the Cornerstone article , English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase of the barn . It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009 , without the owners ' consent , under an Urgent Works Notice . The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works , declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building . This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily , overriding the owners ' objections . 
 The repairs mainly involved fixing holes in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water , as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides . The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £ 30 @,@ 000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012 . In January 2012 , a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £ 20 @,@ 000 . By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a liability for the company . 
 Simon Thurley , the Chief Executive of English Heritage , called the barn " one of the greatest medieval buildings in Britain , built by the same skilled carpenters who worked on our magnificent medieval cathedrals . Its rescue is at the heart of what English Heritage does . " The local Member of Parliament , John McDonnell , praised the hard work of local people and English Heritage staff and said that he was " now overjoyed that we have secured this wonderful building for future generations . " The SPAB also welcomed the decision , calling the barn one of the " symbols of the dominance of the rural economy in the past , and the immense investment in craftsmanship and materials that agriculture deserved . "

 The barn is managed by volunteers from the Friends of the Great Barn at Harmondsworth , a local preservation group , acting on behalf of the owners , English Heritage . It is open to the public for free on the second and fourth Sunday of each month between April and October . 
 = Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act = 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) , commonly called the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) or , colloquially , Obamacare , is a United States federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23 , 2010 . Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment , it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 . Under the act , hospitals and primary physicians would transform their practices financially , technologically , and clinically to drive better health outcomes , lower costs , and improve their methods of distribution and accessibility . 
 The ACA was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance , lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage , and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government . It introduced mechanisms like mandates , subsidies , and insurance exchanges . The law requires insurance companies to cover all applicants within new minimum standards and offer the same rates regardless of pre @-@ existing conditions or sex . In 2011 , the Congressional Budget Office projected that the ACA would lower both future deficits and Medicare spending . 
 On June 28 , 2012 , the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA 's individual mandate as an exercise of Congress 's taxing power in the case National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius . However , the Court held that states cannot be forced to participate in the ACA 's Medicaid expansion under penalty of losing their current Medicaid funding . Since the ruling , the law and its implementation have continued to face challenges in Congress and federal courts , and from some state governments , conservative advocacy groups , labor unions , and small business organizations . On June 25 , 2015 , in the case King v. Burwell , the Supreme Court affirmed that the law 's federal subsidies to help individuals pay for health insurance are available in all states , not just in those that have set up state exchanges . 
 In March 2015 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the average number of uninsured during the period from January to September 2014 was 11 @.@ 4 million fewer than the average in 2010 . In April 2016 , Gallup reported that the percentage of adults who were uninsured dropped from 18 % in the third quarter of 2013 to 11 % in the first quarter of 2016 . 
 = = Overview of provisions = = 
 The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) or Obamacare , includes numerous provisions that took effect between 2010 and 2020 . Policies issued before 2010 are exempted by a grandfather clause from many of the changes to insurance standards , but they were affected by other provisions . Significant reforms , most of which took effect on January 1 , 2014 , include : 
 Guaranteed issue prohibits insurers from denying coverage to individuals due to pre @-@ existing conditions , and a partial community rating requires insurers to offer the same premium price to all applicants of the same age and geographical location without regard to gender or most pre @-@ existing conditions ( excluding tobacco use ) . 
 Minimum standards for health insurance policies are established . 
 An individual mandate requires all individuals not covered by an employer sponsored health plan , Medicaid , Medicare or other public insurance programs ( such as <unk> ) to secure an approved private @-@ insurance policy or pay a penalty , unless the applicable individual has a financial hardship or is a member of a recognized religious sect exempted by the Internal Revenue Service . The law includes subsidies to help people with low incomes comply with the mandate . 
 Health insurance exchanges operate as a new avenue by which individuals and small businesses in every state can compare policies and buy insurance ( with a government subsidy if eligible ) . For plans starting in 2017 , the proposed enrollment period is November 1 , 2016 – January 31 , 2017 .
