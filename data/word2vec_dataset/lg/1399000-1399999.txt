 = = Cultivation = = 
 Hippeastrum cultivars and species can be grown inside in pots or outside in warmer climates ( Hardiness 7B @-@ 11 ) . Many will bloom year after year provided they are given a dormant period in a cool , dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two @-@ month period is up . 
 The bulb is tender and should not be exposed to frost , but is otherwise easy to grow with large rewards for small efforts , especially those that bloom inside during the winter months . Note too , that Hippeastrum can also be grown in the ground in temperate areas . Bulbs are usually sold in fall for early winter bloom . Bare @-@ root bulbs do best planted in a pot only slightly larger than the circumference of the bulb in well @-@ drained , organic mix ( such as sterilized potting soil plus coir fiber , or equal amounts of peat moss , sand and humus ) , with one third of the bulb visible above the surface of the soil and two thirds buried . 
 After planting , sprouting requires a warm place ( about 20 ° C ) . Bulbs need light watering until the leaves and buds emerge , and need to be situated in a well @-@ lit , cool place and watered as needed to maintain moderate soil moisture . Overwatering will cause bulb and root rot . Plants may be fed with common fertilizers that contain iron and magnesium . Blooming takes place about two months after planting . The plant 's leaves should continue to grow after the flowers have faded . <unk> outdoors in four or five hours of direct sunlight , plus fertilizing lightly as the season progresses , will help develop buds for the next year . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Hippeastrum bulbs can be induced to <unk> yearly by mimicking the conditions in its natural environment ( cool dry winters ) . When foliage starts to yellow , dormancy can be induced by withholding water and placing the plant in a cool 4 – 13 ° C ( 39 – 55 ° F ) dark place for six to ten weeks or until buds start to show . Even when plants are thriving outdoors in temperate climates , dormancy can be induced by withholding watering and fertilising in the northern hemisphere autumn , and bringing indoors to a cool environment prior to the first frost . Leaves will usually wither during this period and a flower stem begin to emerge after eight to ten weeks . 
 Bulbs can then be brought back into light , inspected for pests or rot , and <unk> in fresh soil after cutting foliage to about 10 cm above the bulb . Subsequent care is as for new bulbs , as described above . Best results are obtained by transplanting every three to four years .

 Cultivars of Hippeastrum are popular indoor ornamental plants prized for their large brightly colored flowers ( including red , pink , salmon , orange and white ) . As such they have a very important place in the floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or potted plants . Although the market is dominated by the Netherlands , and South Africa . Other areas of production include Israel , Japan and the United States ( Florida ) . Brazil also produces 17 million Hippeastrum bulbs annually . 
 Hippeastrum has yielded at least 64 <unk> alkaloids , which include anti @-@ parasitic ( e.g. <unk> ) and <unk> activity due to their high alkaloid content . One alkaloid isolated from Hippeastrum vittatum ( <unk> ) has demonstrated antidepressant , anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties . Hippeastrum puniceum may also have therapeutic properties as it has been used in folk medicine to treat swellings and wounds .

 A stylized flower of a Hippeastrum cultivar ( under its common name of amaryllis ) is used internationally as a symbol for organizations associated with Huntington 's disease , a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system . The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant . The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington 's disease . The leaves represent the protection , purpose , growth and development of the Huntington 's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment .

 = Cortinarius iodes = 
 Cortinarius iodes , commonly known as the spotted cort or the viscid violet cort , is a species of agaric fungus in the family Cortinariaceae . The fruit bodies have small , slimy , purple caps up to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter that develop yellowish spots and streaks in maturity . The gill color changes from violet to rusty or grayish brown as the mushroom matures . The species range includes the eastern North America , Central America , northern South America , and northern Asia , where it grows on the ground in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous trees . Although edible , the mushroom is not recommended for consumption . Cortinarius <unk> , one of several potential lookalike species , can be distinguished from C. iodes by its bitter @-@ tasting cap cuticle . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853 . The type collection was made by American botanist Henry William Ravenel in South Carolina . Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius <unk> , described by Charles Horton Peck 1914 , to be the same species as C. iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both . According to the nomenclatural databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum , however , Cortinarius iodes does not have any synonyms . If they are indeed the same species , the name C. iodes has priority . C. iodes is classified in the subgenus <unk> , along with other Cortinarius species that have a slimy cap and stem . 
 The specific epithet iodes means " violet @-@ like " . It is commonly known as the " spotted cort " or the " viscid violet cort " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is initially bell @-@ shaped before becoming broadly convex and then flat in maturity ( sometimes retaining a broad umbo ) , and attains a diameter of 2 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The cap surface is slimy ( in wet weather ) and smooth , and has a lilac or purplish color . The flesh is white , firm , and thin . The color fades in maturity , and the cap develops irregular yellowish spots , or becomes yellowish in the center . Gills are attached to the stem and packed together closely . They are lilac to violet when young , but become rusty brown to grayish cinnamon when the spores mature . The stem measures 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and is nearly equal in width throughout other than a somewhat bulbous base . It is solid ( i.e. , not hollow ) , slimy , smooth , and has violet or purplish colors that are usually lighter than the cap ; sometimes , the stem base is more or less white . The cobweb @-@ like , pale violet partial veil leaves a zone of thin , purple or rusty fibers on the upper stem . The mushroom has no distinctive taste or odor . Although edible , it is not recommended for consumption . 
 Cortinarius iodes produces a rusty @-@ brown spore print . Spores are elliptical , with a finely roughened surface , measuring 8 – 10 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , club @-@ shaped , and measure 28 – 39 @.@ 5 by 9 @.@ 3 – 14 μm . Both <unk> and pleurocystidia are absent from the hymenium ; the gill edge is populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents , basidioles . The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3 – 8 μm @-@ wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110 – 125 μm thick ; this layer is less distinct or thinner in old or poorly preserved specimens . Clamp connections are present in hyphae throughout the fruit body . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Cortinarius iodes is a fairly distinctive species and its combination of characteristics make it readily identifiable . Several other Cortinarius species have evolved a slimy coating that probably help protects the fruit bodies from predation by insects and other invertebrates . Other field techniques can be used to help identify dry fruit bodies that have lost their slime coat : by checking for leaf and twig debris adhering to the surface , or , by kissing the cap and stem to exploit the lips ' enhanced sensitivity to stickiness . C. <unk> is virtually identical in appearance to C. iodes , but can be distinguished from the latter by its bitter @-@ tasting cap cuticle and smaller , narrower spores measuring 7 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 3 by 4 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 4 μm . The " violet cort " ( Cortinarius violaceus ) has a dry , scaly , dark purple cap and stem . The " pungent cort " ( Cortinarius <unk> ) has a dry , light purple cap and stem and a bad odor . Two other widespread Cortinarius species with violet coloring and a slimy cap , C. <unk> and C. <unk> , can be distinguished from C. iodes by the absence of yellowish spotting . A North American species C. oregonensis has a paler lilac cap with a central region that is yellowish or brownish , and smaller spores that measure 7 – 8 by 4 – 5 μm . A non @-@ Cortinarius lookalike , Inocybe <unk> , has a dry , silky cap that features a prominent umbo . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Cortinarius iodes forms mycorrhizal associations with deciduous trees , particularly oaks . The fruit bodies of Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow singly , but more often scattered or in groups under hardwood trees , in humus and litterfall . Typical habitats include bog edges , swampy areas , and hummocks . Fruiting usually occurs from July to November . In North America , it is common in eastern regions , and rare in the Pacific Northwest . Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America . It also occurs in northern Asia . 
 = Veronica Mars = 
 Veronica Mars is an American teen noir mystery drama television series created by screenwriter Rob Thomas . The series is set in the fictional town of Neptune , California , and stars Kristen Bell as the eponymous character . The series premiered on September 22 , 2004 , during television network UPN 's final two years , and ended on May 22 , 2007 , after a season on UPN 's successor , The CW , airing for three seasons total . Veronica Mars was produced by Warner Bros. Television , Silver Pictures Television , Stu Segall Productions , and Rob Thomas Productions .

In each episode , Veronica solves a different stand @-@ alone case while working to solve a more complex mystery . The first two seasons of the series each had a season @-@ long mystery arc , introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale . The third season took a different format , focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last the course of several episodes . 
 Thomas initially wrote Veronica Mars as a young adult novel , which featured a male protagonist ; he changed the gender because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and original . Filming began in March 2004 , and the series premiered in September to 2 @.@ 49 million American viewers . The critically acclaimed first season 's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2 @.@ 5 million viewers per episode in the United States .

During the series ' run , it was nominated for two Satellite Awards , four Saturn Awards , five Teen Choice Awards and was featured on AFI 's TV Programs of the Year for 2005 . 
 Following the cancellation of the series , Thomas wrote a feature film script continuing the series . Warner Bros. opted not to fund the project at the time . On March 13 , 2013 , Bell and Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $ 2 million goal in less than eleven hours . They accumulated over $ 5 @.@ 7 million via Kickstarter . The film was released on March 14 , 2014 .

Partway through the season , Weevil becomes convinced of Logan 's innocence and they team up to find the real killer . This season shows Veronica 's life returning to much the way it had been before Lilly 's death : having broken up with Logan during the summer , she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the ' <unk> . However , her private @-@ eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd . ' <unk> Dick Casablancas and Cassidy " Beaver " Casablancas deal with a gold @-@ digging stepmother , Kendall Casablancas , with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud .

 In the third and final season , Veronica , Logan , Wallace , Cindy " Mac " Mackenzie and Dick are freshmen at Neptune 's Hearst College . Two new regular main characters are introduced : Stosh " Piz " Piznarski and Parker Lee , who are the respective roommates of Wallace and Mac . The first mystery is established when Parker becomes a victim of the Hearst serial rapist , a storyline begun in the second season . Feeling guilty for not helping her , and remembering her past rape , Veronica sets herself the task of catching the rapist . The next mystery , the murder of the College 's Dean , commences in the same episode the rapist is caught .

 = = Cast and characters = = 
 The first season had seven regular characters . Kristen Bell portrayed the title character Veronica Mars , a high school junior and skilled private detective . Teddy Dunn played Duncan Kane , Veronica 's ex @-@ boyfriend and Lilly 's brother . Jason Dohring played Logan Echolls , the " bad @-@ boy " 09er , the son of an A @-@ list actor . Percy Daggs III portrayed Wallace Fennel , Veronica 's best friend and frequent partner in solving mysteries . Francis Capra portrayed Eli " Weevil " Navarro , the leader of the PCH Biker gang and Veronica 's friend . Enrico Colantoni played Veronica 's father Keith Mars , a private investigator and former Balboa County Sheriff . Sydney Tamiia Poitier played Mallory Dent , Veronica 's journalism teacher at Neptune High . Although she was given series regular billing , Poitier appeared in only four episodes , but was given credit for seven . Poitier 's removal from the series was rumored to be due to budget issues . 
 Thomas , who said he " conceive [ d ] the show as a one @-@ year mystery " , decided that he needed to introduce and eliminate several characters to be able to create an " equally fascinating mystery " for the series ' second season . Thomas felt that he could not bring back the Kanes and the Echolls and " have them all involved in a new mystery " ; he needed " new blood " . The second season saw the introduction of Tessa Thompson as Jackie Cook , a romantic interest of Wallace and daughter of a famous baseball player . Previous recurring characters Dick Casablancas and Cassidy " Beaver " Casablancas were upgraded to series regulars . Dick , played by Ryan Hansen , was an 09er friend of Logan , a womanizer and former high @-@ school bully turned frat boy . Kyle Gallner portrayed " Beaver " , Dick 's introverted younger brother . Dunn , who portrayed Duncan Kane , left the series midway through the season , although was credited as a main cast member for the remainder of the season . Thomas explained that the Logan @-@ Veronica @-@ Duncan love triangle had run its course , and to keep the series fresh , there would need to be " other guys in her life " . He attributed Dunn 's removal to fan interest dominating the Logan @-@ Veronica relationship , saying " it became clear that one suitor won out " . 
 The third season introduced two new series regulars , Parker Lee and Stosh " Piz " Piznarski . Julie Gonzalo portrayed Parker , Mac 's extroverted roommate at Hearst College and " everything that Mac is not " . Piz , played by Chris Lowell , was Wallace 's roommate at Hearst College and a music lover with his own campus radio show . Piz was named after the director of the pilot , Mark Piznarski . The character 's role was to have another male friend for Veronica who was middle @-@ class , and not upper @-@ class . Thomas used the radio show as a narrative device to capture the mood of the university . Cindy " Mac " Mackenzie and Don Lamb , recurring characters in the first two seasons , were upgraded to series regulars . Mac , portrayed by Tina Majorino , was a computer expert befriended by Veronica . Lamb , portrayed by Michael Muhney , was the Balboa County Sheriff who won the office from Keith in the recall election .

 Rob Thomas originally wrote Veronica Mars as a young adult novel for publishing company Simon & Schuster . Prior to his first television job on Dawson 's Creek , Thomas sold two novel ideas . One of these was provisionally titled Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel , which formed the basis for the series . The novel had many elements similar to Veronica Mars , though the protagonist was male . Thomas 's father was a vice @-@ principal at Westlake High School near Austin , Texas , and the main character attended a " thinly disguised version " of the school . As Thomas had begun writing for film and television , he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years . Writing a novel could take months for Thomas , whereas a television script only took several weeks . Knowing that television scripts paid more , Thomas wrote the television version of the teen detective project as a spec script before it became a novel . Since no studio or network had asked him to write it , and he would not get paid unless it sold , Thomas said that " it was never a very pressing project for me " . Tinkering with it from time to time , Thomas wrote project notes a year before he actually started writing the television script . Most of his original ideas made it into the script , but some changed drastically . Thomas wanted to use flashbacks , and he had to shorten the timeline so that the murder could happen in a recent time . Thomas changed the gender of the protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Kristen Bell was chosen to play Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role . Bell felt that it was " just luck " that Rob Thomas saw that " I have some sass to me , and that 's exactly what he wanted " . Bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider 's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned . Jason Dohring , who played Logan Echolls , originally auditioned for the role of Duncan Kane . Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan , but ended up portraying Duncan Kane . Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan " was a little dark " , and he was told by the producers that it was " not really right " . The producers asked Dohring to read for the role of Logan . Dohring acted one scene from the pilot , in which he shattered the headlights of a car with a crowbar . During the final auditions , Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network . When reading with Bell , Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her , and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel . At the time of Dohring 's audition for Logan , the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot . 
 Percy Daggs III auditioned for the role of Wallace Fennel two times before being cast , and he had to go through three tests with the studio and network executives . During his first audition , Daggs read four scenes from the pilot . Just before his studio test , Daggs read with Bell and had " a great conversation " . He said that she " made me feel comfortable about auditioning " and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing Wallace as the season went on . Thomas described Amanda Seyfried , who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane , as " the biggest surprise of the year " . When casting a series regular , he was able to see all the best actors in town , mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular . When casting Lilly Kane , who would only appear from time @-@ to @-@ time as " the dead girl " , Thomas did not receive the same level of actors . Thomas said that he had " never had a more cut and dry audition " than he did with Seyfried . He said that she was " about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw , she was just spectacular " . He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned . 
 = = = Writing and format = = = 
 The episodes of the series have a distinct structure : Veronica investigates a different " case of the week " while continually trying to solve a larger mystery which spans several episodes or a whole season . The first two seasons of Veronica Mars have a season @-@ long mystery arc , which is introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the finale . The third season takes on a different format , focusing on two smaller mystery arcs that last the course of nine and six episodes respectively . The final five episodes of the season feature stand @-@ alone mysteries . During the first season , Thomas was unsure if the success of the series was attributed to the " case of the week " each episode , or the overarching story . He realized that fans were cool with the " case of the week " , but came back for the ongoing mystery . Thomas felt that Bell had been overworked in the first season , and the mystery involving Logan and Weevil in the second season was an attempt to give her some time off . He said that the mystery arcs of the second season had " way too many suspects , way too many red herrings " , and that the third season needed a change . 
 The third season was initially planned to include three separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non @-@ overlapping story arcs . Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format , and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season . Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble , Thomas started laying " subtle " motives for the second mystery during the first one , so that fans would have " a theory on whodunit " when it occurred . The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes . Originally , the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season . This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes . The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six , and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc . After an eight @-@ week hiatus for the series was announced , the final mystery was changed to five stand @-@ alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers . The final mystery was originally going to be " unlike any of the others we 've done before " . Previously , " nice characters " like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going to believe them as a suspect . For the third mystery , Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved , " key players [ with ] really interesting stuff to do " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The original pilot filmed was darker in tone than the one aired . Thomas intended to take the script to FX , HBO or Showtime , but gave UPN " credit " as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices . There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim ; UPN eventually consented . In the aired version of the pilot , Lilly Kane was found by the pool in the same spot where she was murdered . However , Thomas stated that Lilly 's body was originally going to be found in the ocean , and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly 's body being dumped . When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN , the network felt that it was " too dark and creepy " for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter 's body to protect his son , and the idea was changed . 
 Many of the series ' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego , California . Producer Paul Kurta said that most of the scenes taking place in Neptune were filmed in Oceanside , California . Kurta liked that it was " a seaside town that still feels like middle @-@ class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven . " It was estimated that the series spent $ 44 million a year shooting each season in San Diego , which made more than half of the revenue generated by film production in the area in 2006 . 
 The setting of Neptune High , which was featured in the first two seasons , was also located in Oceanside . The school , Oceanside High School , was paid $ 7 @,@ 750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras . The series ' third season setting of Hearst College was mostly filmed on the campuses of San Diego State University , University of San Diego , and the University of California , San Diego . Filming locations were chosen by the director and by production designer Alfred Sole . Sole reportedly " really liked the look and feel of the school " , and San Diego State University invited the series with " open arms " . Taping at the university led to financial and employment benefits for the university and its students . Alumni worked as crewmembers while students worked as actors ; half of the third season extras were students from the university 's film department . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 " We Used to Be Friends " by The Dandy Warhols was used as the series ' theme song . Composer Josh Kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of a 1980s song for the theme . However , Rob Thomas was " pretty much set on finding a song " , and " We Used to Be Friends " was chosen right from the beginning . This theme was considered by TV critic Samantha Holloway to be one of " the five most recognizable , sing @-@ along @-@ able , memorable and best theme songs " . In the third season , the theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect the more noir @-@ influenced opening credits . 
 Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes . For the pilot , Thomas wanted " a really atmospheric , kind of modern noir type of vibe " , and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7 . Kramon used " traditional sounds " for the series , but also processed and filtered them . Among the instruments used were piano , vibraphone and guitar . When using an acoustic piano , Kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano . Live bass and percussion was also used , as Kramon did not like to program them . The main instrument used was guitar , but Kramon felt that piano was " by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows , especially when you 're doing everything yourself . " 
 A week before choosing the sounds for the episodes , the crew had a " spotting session " , where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured . Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured , but composed and created the whole score . Since there was little orchestral music , and Kramon could play guitar , piano , bass and drums , he played the whole score without hiring a musician . Veronica Mars : Original Television Soundtrack , a song compilation from the series ' first and second seasons , was released by Nettwerk Records on September 27 , 2005 . Thomas revealed that the primary goal for the soundtrack was to " get more publicity , which will in turn hopefully get more viewers for the show " .

 In January 2007 , Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual ratings improvement of Veronica Mars , the series would be put on hiatus after the February sweeps to air a new reality series , Pussycat Dolls Present . When the hiatus ended , the series returned for the last five episodes of the season . At the 2007 CW Upfront , Ostroff announced that Veronica Mars was not part of the new primetime lineup and was " not coming back " . Thomas created a trailer that took place four years after the third season finale , with the working title " Veronica in the FBI " , and released it on the third season DVD . When asked if the FBI concept could happen , Ostroff said that the series was probably completely gone " in any form " . Ostroff also said that Kristen Bell and Rob Thomas might collaborate on another project for the CW network . In June 2007 , TV Guide writer Michael Ausiello confirmed that the cancellation of Veronica Mars was official . 
 = = = Potential film progress = = = 
 Thomas stated that he was interested in writing a feature film based on the series , in the interest of providing closure to the story lines and character arcs . In September 2008 , Michael Ausiello , writing for Entertainment Weekly , reported that Thomas had met with Bell to discuss the plot , which would likely involve Veronica solving crime in college rather than as an FBI agent . Thomas felt that the " FBI scenario was more of a ' What if ... ? ' " , aimed at getting a fourth season , and that he " would want to bring back our key players , and it would be tough to believe that the FBI stationed Veronica in Neptune . " Ausiello later reported that Enrico Colantoni would be involved in the project . Colantoni said that he was fully aware of the talks taking place , adding , " cult shows have translated well into the film arena . Nothing 's official , but they 're talking about it . " In addition to the feature @-@ film possibility , Thomas had a meeting with DC Comics to talk about a Veronica Mars comic book series . 
 In September 2008 , Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that " I thought I had the idea broken , but I 've hit a wall in the final act that I haven 't quite figured out " . Thomas explained that he had been very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down , both of which he created . In January 2009 , TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas ' first priority after Cupid . Thomas noted that as well as writing the script , someone would need to pay for the film , but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green @-@ light the film . In June 2009 , Bell said " I don 't think it will ever happen , and here 's why : [ Series creator ] Rob Thomas and I had a <unk> , and we were both 100 percent on board . We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [ there ] to make a Veronica Mars movie , and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with . " At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour , Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn 't be happening , " I would write it if anyone would finance it . If anyone 's interested in making that movie I am available , Kristen 's [ Bell ] available . I would love to do it . I think the closest we came was Joel [ Silver ] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn 't bite . It has sort of gone away . " In April 2010 , Thomas insisted , " it 's not dead . I continue to want to do it [ ... ] We 're still looking into it . " In June 2010 , Silver was less optimistic about the film happening ; " we analyzed all these areas about it . I talked to the home video people , because a movie like that would be driven by video . The [ season DVDs ] didn 't do that well ... So they didn 't feel there was a need or an audience . "

 On March 13 , 2013 , Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell launched a Kickstarter fundraiser in an attempt to get the film made , with the help of fans to reach the goal of $ 2 million . The campaign offered various incentives to those who donated more than $ 10 . Thomas and Bell stated that they approached Warner Bros. with the idea and they approved and will be distributing the finished title . Bell , Thomas , Enrico Colantoni , Ryan Hansen , and Jason Dohring appeared in a video promoting the campaign that was shot in February 2012 . The goal was met within 10 hours of the start of the campaign . The project broke several Kickstarter records , including being the largest successful film project on Kickstarter . The Kickstarter campaign ended on April 13 , with 91 @,@ 585 donors raising $ 5 @,@ 702 @,@ 153 . Production began in June 2013 , with a projected early 2014 release . In December 2013 , Thomas announced that the release date would be March 14 , 2014 , a year and a day after the start of the Kickstarter project . 
 On April 5 , Thomas had completed the first draft of the script .

 Although not a ratings success , the series was a critical success from its first season . Robert Abele of LA Weekly said " in this smart , engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime @-@ solving high school outcast , the hard @-@ boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist 's mouth in a way that stabs any potential <unk> in the heart with an ice pick . " In her review , Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that " on Veronica Mars , wholesome is out ; gritty reality is in . The show never soft @-@ pedals the timeless , fundamental truth that high school is hell . " Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that the series was " a character study masquerading as a high @-@ school drama " . Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as " a sharp teen noir in the making . <unk> with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica 's lost innocence , this series pulses with promise . " Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that " intrigue , drama , and humor , Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised . Few TV series aim so high ; even fewer succeed so well . " James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television . He praised Bell as " a captivating star " , and said that the series " uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience : that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are . " Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the series an update to the " classic California film noir " . She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN , and that the title character was potentially " this season 's most interesting character creation " . McFadden described the series as " Alias in its attitude , Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class @-@ consciousness . " Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first season finale for being " just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that , week after week , keeps you asking questions . " 
 Veronica Mars was also positively received by other writers . Joss Whedon , who made a guest appearance in the second season episode " Rat Saw God " , said that it was the " Best . Show . Ever . Seriously , I 've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn 't making , and maybe even more than those [ ... ] These guys know what they 're doing on a level that intimidates me . It 's the Harry Potter of shows . " Kevin Smith , who guest starred in the episode " Driver Ed " , said that Veronica Mars was " hands @-@ down , the best show on television right now , and proof that TV can be far better than cinema . " Stephen King described the series as " Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe , and the result is pure nitro . Why is Veronica Mars so good ? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it , but I can 't take my eyes off the damn thing . " Ed Brubaker called it " the best mystery show ever made in America . " 
 Despite being a critical success throughout its run , criticisms began to emerge of the series in its third season . Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as " disappointing " , mainly because the episodes offered nothing new : " most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest . " Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone , with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons . He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change , robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an " increasingly extraneous character . " Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes , the series ended with " three very strong episodes , with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be , and what a strong character she is . " Goldman concluded that although the third season " was very choppy " , it still had " plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character . " The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive " creatively " , from " the <unk> version of its theme song to stalled storylines . " The reviewer felt that " the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling as time went on and were too drawn out . " Fox News Channel 's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had " gone from punky to — dare we say — preppy " in the third season . Byrne further explained that " with her quick , bright wit and sharp eye for life 's darker moments [ Veronica ] has left high school and is going to college , <unk> her dark threads and spiked tresses for something a little more stylish . " 
 The series , described as a " critical darling " , appeared on a number of fall television best lists . In 2005 , the series was featured on AFI 's TV Programs of the Year , and on the lists of MSN TV , The Village Voice , the Chicago Tribune , People Weekly and the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette . It was named the second best series by Ain 't It Cool News , fourth best returning series by Time , fifth best series by Newsday , PopMatters and San Jose Mercury @-@ News , and sixth best by Entertainment Weekly and USA Today . In 2006 , the series was ranked number one on the lists of Ain 't It Cool News and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , and was ranked number six by Metacritic . In 2007 , the series ranked number 18 on TV Guide 's list of the " Top Cult Shows Ever " . In 2008 , AOL TV ranked Veronica Mars the 10th Best School Show of All Time . The same year , British film magazine Empire ranked it number 48 in their list of the " 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time " . The magazine said that " smart storylines and witty riffs on pop culture pepper the scripts , while Kristen Bell lent ballsy charm to the title role and ensured that every episode of the show 's three seasons was television gold . Its untimely cancellation was a slap in the face that still smarts to this day . " Empire named " Not Pictured " the best episode of the series . In 2010 , Kristin dos Santos of E ! ranked Veronica Mars number 8 on her list , " Top 20 TV Series of the Past 20 Years " . The A.V. Club named it the 15th best TV series of the 2000s ( decade ) . 
 In 2012 , Entertainment Weekly listed the show at # 13 in the " 25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years " , with the comments , " It 's not easy telling the story of a girl 's mission to solve her best friend 's murder - while also investigating her own rape - but creator Rob Thomas ' tough assignment was made easier by putting the tirelessly smart and snarky Veronica Mars on the case .

 = Adar oilfield = 
 The Adar oilfield , also known as the Adar Yale , Adar <unk> or <unk> field , is an oilfield situated in the Melut Basin in South Sudan estimated to contain about 276 million barrels ( 43 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil . The Chevron Corporation discovered the Adar Yale field in 1981 , shortly before the start of the Second Sudanese Civil War ( 1983 – 2005 ) . Soon after Chevron had suspended operations in 1984 , Sudanese government troops began attacking civilian settlements in the area , burning the houses and driving the people away , and in the late 1990s , Nuer militias from Nasir helped the army in clearing away the people to make way for the roads and infrastructure of the oilfield . 
 President Omar al @-@ Bashir inaugurated the site in March 1997 , and it initially produced just 5 @,@ 000 barrels ( 790 m3 ) a day . Production from this oilfield , which lies close to the borders with Sudan and Ethiopia , has the potential to bring significant economic benefits to the region . However , until recently the focus has been on clearing the population away from the oilfield rather than on a longer term strategy for developing the region . China has provided a large investment in the Adar oilfield and others in South Sudan and Sudan and has made plans to make extensive further investments . 
 = = Background and location = = 
 Adar is an area southeast of Melut , which lies on the White Nile in Upper Nile state , and to the west of Ethiopia . The Khor Adar , which drains the Machar Marshes , flows through the region in a northwest direction to the Nile , which it reaches just above Melut . The Khor Machar swamps lie in a triangle north of the Sobat River and east of the White Nile . When flooded during the wet season , they extend for 6 @,@ 500 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 500 sq mi ) . The swamps and marshes are fed by local rainfall and by many small torrents from the Ethiopian foothills , which extend for 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) along the eastern border , and by spill water from channels of the Sobat . 
 Discharge from the marshes along the Adar river is low except in years with exceptionally heavy rainfall . Most of the water is lost through evaporation before reaching the Nile . It has been proposed to build a canal from Machar via Adar to the White Nile to increase the volume of water flowing to Northern Sudan and Egypt , which apparently could be done without major environmental impact , but political instability has prevented the project from starting . 
 The Chevron Corporation discovered the Adar Yale field in 1981 , shortly before the start of the Second Sudanese Civil War ( 1983 – 2005 ) . Four exploratory wells had flow rates that exceeded 1 @,@ 500 barrels ( 240 m3 ) a day . The oil is held in the <unk> Formation sandstone from the Paleogene age . The field has an area of about 20 square kilometres ( 7 @.@ 7 sq mi ) but the average pay zone is only 2 @.@ 9 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 sq mi ) . Initially the field was estimated to hold 168 million barrels ( 26 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 ) , but Seismic data acquired in 2000 pushed that up to 276 million barrels ( 43 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 m3 ) . Also , three small oil pools were discovered south of Adar @-@ Yale with another 129 million barrels ( 20 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 m3 ) . Chevron started to pull out of Sudan in 1984 when three of its employees were killed , finally selling all of its Sudanese interests in 1992 . 
 = = Development and production = = 
 Chevron suspended operations in 1984 , and their concession was later divided into smaller units . In 1992 Gulf Petroleum Corporation @-@ Sudan ( GPC ) was awarded the Melut Basin - Blocks 3 and 7 . GPC was owned 60 % by Qatar ’ s Gulf Petroleum Corporation , 20 % by <unk> and 20 % by a company owned by the National Islamic Front ( NIF ) financier Mohamed Abdullah Jar al @-@ Nabi . The GPC consortium was reported to have invested US $ 12m in developing the Adar Yale field . In October 1996 GPC began to drill and reopen Chevron 's wells and to build an all @-@ weather road connecting Adar Yale to the garrison town of Melut . 
 President Omar al @-@ Bashir inaugurated the Adar Yale site in March 1997 . At first , production was just 5 @,@ 000 barrels ( 790 m3 ) a day , taken by truck to Melut and then by barge down the Nile to Khartoum for export . Although export volumes were tiny compared to the field 's potential , it was the first Sudanese crude to be exported and therefore had symbolic significance . In March 2000 Fosters Resources , a Canadian company , signed an agreement with the government of Sudan to develop the concession that covered most of the Melut Basin , including the Adar <unk> field , in partnership with a consortium of Arab and Sudanese companies . Fosters was forced to withdraw in May 2000 when its financial backing collapsed due to pressure from human rights groups . The U.S. government had been highly critical of Canadian involvement in Sudan oil development and in February 2000 the U.S. Treasury announced that American persons were forbidden to do business with the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company ( <unk> ) and <unk> . 
 Petrodar was incorporated in October 2001 owned 41 % by China National Petroleum Company ( CNPC ) and 40 % by Petronas of Malaysia . Petrodar implemented major upgrades to the oil development infrastructure , including 31 @,@ 000 @-@ barrel ( 4 @,@ 900 m3 ) / day production facilities at the Adar Yale field , now largely cleared of its original inhabitants . In November 2005 <unk> brought the Petrodar pipeline into operation , linking Blocks 3 and 7 ( Adar Yale and <unk> fields ) to Port Sudan on the Red Sea . The pipeline has throughput of 150 @,@ 000 barrels ( 24 @,@ 000 m3 ) per day , and maximum capacity of 500 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 79 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . By January 2007 combined output from Blocks 3 and 7 was 165 @,@ 000 with potential to reach a peak of 200 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 32 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) by late 2007 . By 2009 , the two blocks were producing close to 240 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 38 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) of Dar blend . Because this blend of crude oil is heavy and highly acidic , it fetches lower prices than benchmark <unk> such as Brent or Minas . 
 = = People = = 
 Adar is predominantly inhabited by the Dinka people , who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle . Many of the Dinka use riverine pastures along the east bank of the White Nile , but in dry seasons can usually find alternative pasturage along the Khor Adal and Khor Wol and on the edges of the marshes . The country is well suited to cultivation of crops watered by rain . 
 Soon after Chevron had closed operations , government troops began attacking civilian settlements in the area , burning the houses and driving the people away . This resulted in many deaths . In the late 1990s , Nuer militias from Nasir helped the army in clearing away the people to make way for the roads and infrastructure of the oilfield . Aid workers were also targeted in attacks , with NGO compounds , farm supply distribution centers and primary health care centers vandalized and destroyed . 
 One estimate is that 12 @,@ 000 people were forced to move in 1999 @-@ 2000 while the all @-@ weather road was being built between Melut , <unk> and Adar . Another source said church leaders reported that government militias burned 48 villages and displaced 55 @,@ 000 people in the Adar area in 2000 . According to International Relief and Development agency ( IRD ) director Derek Hammond , the areas around Adar contained " Fields of destroyed crops with no evidence of any type of food , a handful of local people scratching around in a swamp for something to eat " .

 In July 1996 the Government of Sudan attacked Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) positions at <unk> <unk> , west of the Nile . Their goal was to secure passage for barge shipments of oil from the Adar @-@ 1 field . In November 1996 , SPLA leader John <unk> gave warning that his forces would attack the Adar Yale oil field . In June 1998 the SPLA captured the town of Ulu , close to the Adar Yale field , and in March 1999 the SPLA 13th battalion defeated a government brigade at the town . With this victory , the Adar Yale oilfield was within range of the SPLA 's artillery . 
 In April 2001 a Russian @-@ made Antonov airplane broke in two after it skidded off the runway at <unk> , apparently due to a sandstorm . The crash killed Sudan 's deputy defense minister , Colonel Ibrahim Shamsul @-@ Din , and 13 other high @-@ ranking officers who had been touring the southern military area . 16 people survived the crash . A spokesman for the SPLA denied responsibility for the accident , saying they did not have forces in the area . 
 The Sudanese Civil War officially ended in January 2005 , and the Juba Declaration of 8 January 2006 laid out the basis for unifying rival military forces in South Sudan . Gordon Kong <unk> , Deputy Commander of the South Sudan Defense Forces ( SSDF ) , which had been supported by the Government of Sudan , resisted the merger . His core faction , the " Nasir Peace Force " was based in the village of <unk> , just north of Nasir , with 75 @-@ 80 fighters as of August 2006 and perhaps 300 reserve forces in the area . His position on the border with Sudan to the north and near to the functioning Adar Yale oilfield was sensitive . In July 2006 , four busloads of SSDF recruits arrived in the area from Khartoum . In August 2006 there were reported to be 300 @-@ 400 active SSDF militiamen in the Adar area . 
 China has provided a large investment in the Adar oilfield and others in South Sudan , as well as in oilfields in Sudan , and in the pipeline to Port Sudan . China established a consulate in Juba in September 2008 and upgraded it to an embassy in November 2010 . China has made plans to make significant investments in South Sudan . A pipeline to the Kenyan port of Lamu is being discussed which could provide an alternative route if Sudan chooses to close the northern pipeline . It is in China 's interest to resolve security problems , and as a major investor and customer of both countries China may have the leverage to achieve this goal .

 Tokyo Mew Mew ( 東京ミュウミュウ , Tōkyō Myū Myū ) is a Japanese shōjo manga series written by Reiko Yoshida and illustrated by Mia Ikumi . It was originally serialized in Nakayoshi from September 2000 to February 2003 , and later published in seven tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from February 2001 to April 2003 . It focuses on five girls infused with the DNA of endangered animals which gives them special powers and allows them to transform into " Mew Mews . " Led by Ichigo <unk> , the girls protect the earth from aliens who wish to " reclaim " it . 
 The series was adapted into a 52 episode anime series by Studio Pierrot and Nippon Animation . It debuted in Japan on April 6 , 2002 , on both TV Aichi and TV Tokyo ; the final episode aired on March 29 , 2003 . A two @-@ volume sequel to the manga , Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode , was serialized in Nakayoshi from April 2003 to February 2004 . The sequel introduces a new Mew Mew , Berry Shirayuki ( meaning " White Snow Berry " ) , who becomes the temporary leader of the Mew Mews , while Ichigo ( meaning " Strawberry " ) is on a trip to England . Two video games were also created for the series : a puzzle adventure game for the Game Boy Advance system and a role @-@ playing video game for the PlayStation . 
 Tokyopop originally licensed the manga series for English @-@ language publication in North America and released the complete original series as well as the sequel , with Kodansha Comics USA planning to re @-@ publish the series with a new translation in September 2011 . 4Kids Entertainment licensed the anime series for North American broadcast under the name Mew Mew Power . Heavily edited and dubbed , 23 episodes of Mew Mew Power aired on the 4Kids TV channel in the United States and 26 episodes aired on YTV in Canada . 4Kids Entertainment was unable to license the remaining 26 episodes of the series , thus were unable to complete its broadcast . They have never released the series to home video . 
 Well received by English @-@ language readers , several volumes of the manga series appeared in the Top 50 sales lists for graphic novels in their respective months of release . Critics praised the manga as a cute and entertaining series with free @-@ flowing style and character designs . A la mode received praise as a good continuation of the series , but was also criticized for offering nothing new . The anime adaptation received high ratings while airing in Japan , resulting in numerous marketing tie @-@ ins . Despite criticism for extensive editing that removed most of the Japanese elements , the Mew Mew Power dub became the highest rated 4Kids show during its broadcast . It was licensed for regional release in several other countries instead of the original Japanese series .

 At the start of the series , a young girl named Ichigo <unk> attends an endangered species exhibit with her " crush " and future boyfriend , Masaya Aoyama . After an earthquake , Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light . A cat appears before Ichigo , then merges with her . The next day , she begins acting like a cat . After meeting <unk> Shirogane and <unk> Akasaka , Ichigo learns that she was infused with the DNA of the Iriomote cat . Ryou and <unk> explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo , a powerful heroic cat girl . She is ordered to defeat Chimera Animas — alien parasites which infect animals and turn them into monsters . Ryou and <unk> instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibit — the remaining Mew Mews . Mint Aizawa , a spoiled , wealthy ballerina who is infused with the genes of the blue lorikeet ; Lettuce Midorikawa , a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs the genes of the finless porpoise ; a hyper and yet young girl named Pudding Fong who receives the genes of the golden lion tamarin ; and Zakuro Fujiwara , a professional model infused with the genes of the gray wolf . 
 The five Mew Mews battle the Chimera Animas and their alien controllers Kisshu , Pai and Taruto . Kisshu falls in love with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love despite the fact that he is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews . Pai ( Pie ) and Taruto ( Tart ) later join Kisshu ( Kish ) in trying to destroy the Mew Mews . 
 As the fighting intensifies , the Mew Mews are tasked with finding " Mew Aqua " , a material created from pure water that contains immense power for combating the alien attacks . During a battle with Kisshu ( Kish ) at an aquarium , Ichigo is in danger of losing when the mysterious Blue Knight appears and rescues her . He returns periodically throughout the series , protecting Ichigo from various dangers . It is later revealed that the Blue Knight is in fact Masaya . Shortly after this discovery , Masaya collapses and transforms again . This time , he transforms into Deep Blue , the alien leader who wants to destroy humanity . After explaining to Ichigo that Masaya was a false form for temporary use , Deep Blue attacks the Mew Mews . Masaya 's personality briefly reappears and he uses a nearby Mew Aqua drop to destroy Deep Blue , killing himself in the process . Crying over his body , Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life , losing her own in the process . Masaya kisses her , changing her back to a human and revives her . Ryou gives Pai the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens ' world , after which Kisshu ( Kish ) , Pai ( Pie ) and Taruto ( Tart ) say their goodbyes and return to their own world .

 Mia Ikumi spent a year designing the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before the release of the first volume in February 2001 . The story she originally presented to her editors , Tokyo Black Cat Girl , featured a heroine named Hime <unk> . An intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat @-@ girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Bugs . After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes , Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character . She had reservations about the changes , as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series . 
 As Tokyo Mew Mew became a viable project , Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida to be the series ' scenario writer and story supervisor . Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume 's plot , created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue , and presented it to Ikumi . Ikumi added her own ideas and changes , creating the manuscript 's first draft , which was taken to the publishers for final review and approval . This differs from most manga series , in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval . 
 After the first volume 's release , a two @-@ day Tokyo Mew Mew festival was held during the Golden Week holiday — a week @-@ long span in late April and early May during which four public holidays occur — to promote the series . Events included a Tokyo Mew Mew art gallery and the release of new merchandise . Ikumi , the series ' artist , created a special poster for the event , featuring all twelve characters . She also cosplayed as characters from the series , as Mint Aizawa on one day and Lettuce Midorikawa on the other .

 The Tokyo Mew Mew manga series was well received by English @-@ speaking audiences . In March and April 2003 , the first volume sold an estimated 1 @,@ 597 and 1 @,@ 746 copies respectively . This put the volume at the low end of the top 50 sales for each month . By 2004 , with most of the series released , it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop . It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime / Manga , based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and comic book shops . Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly ; however , both were among the top 100 best @-@ selling graphic novels in March and May 2004 . The first volume of Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best @-@ selling graphic novels of May 2005 , with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series . On the Nielsen <unk> charts , the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot .

 Tokyo Mew Mew was generally well received by reviewers , who described it as cute and entertaining . Though AnimeFringe 's Patrick King notes that it is not a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points , he lauded it as engrossing " brain candy " and an " endearing action @-@ romance " that has no " delusions of grandeur " . Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode . Ikumi 's " free flowing " style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series . Criticism of Ikumi 's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers . Patrick King of Animefringe stated : " one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi 's ultra @-@ cute artwork . Big eyes , cat ears , fuzzy tails , and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that 's hard to resist . " According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network , " Mia Ikumi 's artwork is perfectly suited to the story , and it 's not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material . Like many budding manga artist , Ikumi 's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits , and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds . " Conversely , in writing for Manga : The Complete Guide , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series , calling it " uninspired " , " insipid " and " creative [ ly ] bankrupt " and feeling it was " clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth : the creators ' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings , photo shoots , and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines . " She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme , while still having a " preachy environmental theme " . 
 Over all Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode had more mixed reviews . Critics praised it for being a modern manga that typifies the magical girl formula , highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses . Mike Dungan , of Mania Entertainment , considered the original series to be " quite charming " and felt that à la Mode was a good continuation of the series with the " same fun and excitement " as its predecessor . Others felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine and that the sequel offered nothing new for readers with the Saint Rose Crusaders ' costumes and plans being nothing more than concepts borrowed from Sailor Moon . Janet Crocker , Shannon Fay and Chris <unk> of Animefringe criticized A la Mode for having the character Duke dressed in a white robe similar to those used by the white supremacy group , the Ku Klux Klan . Garrity felt à La Mode was a vehicle for referencing Tokyo Mew Mew fandom and merchandise and that Berry was a " transparent wish @-@ fulfillment protagonist " . 
 The anime adaptation has been compared to Sailor Moon due to both having female protagonists ; five original team members with signature colors and powers , and similar plot lines . Tokyo Mew Mew received high ratings in Japan with extensive <unk> tie ins and marketing events to promote the series . When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime , heavily edited and localized , fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series . After previews of the retooled series were released , viewers were less disappointed , but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut DVD release . Mew Mew Power became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids , becoming the highest rated 4Kids show at the start of the fall 2005 season , but it was never released to DVD in North America . The 4Kids dub , rather than original Japanese version , was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France , Latin America , Australia , New Zealand , Portugal , Greece , South Africa and Israel . 
 = Roger Bresnahan = 
 Roger Philip Bresnahan ( June 11 , 1879 – December 4 , 1944 ) , nicknamed " The Duke of Tralee " , was an American player and manager in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . As a player , Bresnahan competed in MLB for the Washington Senators ( 1897 ) , Chicago Orphans ( 1900 ) , Baltimore Orioles ( 1901 – 02 ) , New York Giants ( 1902 – 08 ) , St. Louis Cardinals ( 1909 – 12 ) and Chicago Cubs ( 1913 – 15 ) . Bresnahan also managed the Cardinals ( 1909 – 12 ) and Cubs ( 1915 ) . He was a member of the 1905 World Series champions . 
 Bresnahan opened his MLB career as a pitcher . He also served as an outfielder , before becoming a regular catcher . For his MLB career , Bresnahan had a .279 batting average in 4 @,@ 480 at bats and a 328 – 432 managerial win @-@ loss record . Bresnahan popularized the use of protective equipment in baseball . He introduced shin guards to be worn by a catcher in 1907 . He also developed the first batting helmet . 
 After retiring as a player , Bresnahan remained active in professional baseball . He owned the minor league Toledo Mud Hens and coached for the Giants and Detroit Tigers . He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 by the Veterans Committee . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bresnahan was born on June 11 , 1879 in Toledo , Ohio . He was the seventh child of Michael and Mary Bresnahan , who had immigrated to the United States from Tralee , Ireland . Bresnahan used to claim that he was also from Tralee , and early in his life , he earned the nickname " The Duke of Tralee " . 
 Bresnahan began playing baseball in grade school , becoming one of the best known sandlot baseball players . He continued to play baseball at Toledo 's Central High School .

 At 16 , Bresnahan signed with a semi @-@ professional team from Manistee , Michigan . After he graduated high school , Bresnahan signed with Lima of the Ohio State League , where he played primarily as a pitcher , but also as a catcher in 1895 and 1896 . 
 On August 10 , 1897 , the Washington Senators of the National League ( NL ) in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) purchased Bresnahan from Lima . He began his MLB career as a pitcher , throwing a six @-@ hit shutout in his MLB debut against the St. Louis Browns on August 27 , 1897 , recording three strikeouts and walking two batters . He had six hits in 16 at bats ( a .375 batting average ) and had a 4 – 0 win – loss record for the 1897 Senators . However , the Senators released Bresnahan after the season over a salary dispute , when he attempted to hold out for more money . The Senators offered Bresnahan $ 2 @,@ 000 ( $ 56 @,@ 888 in current dollar terms ) , but Bresnahan wanted $ 2 @,@ 400 ( $ 68 @,@ 266 in current dollar terms ) . 
 Bresnahan played for the Toledo Mud Hens of the Interstate League and the Minneapolis Millers of the Western League in 1898 , and the Millers and Buffalo Bisons of the Western League in 1899 . Bresnahan appeared in two games at catcher for the Chicago Orphans of the NL in 1900 , which served as a tryout . 
 With the formation of the American League ( AL ) as a competitor to the NL , Bresnahan , among others , jumped to the AL from the NL . John McGraw , manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL saw Bresnahan pitch for Chicago , and decided to sign him for the Orioles before the 1901 season . For the Orioles , Bresnahan filled in at catcher behind Wilbert Robinson , and also appeared in the outfield . A faster baserunner than the average catcher , Bresnahan had two inside @-@ the @-@ park home runs on May 30 , 1902 . 
 = = = New York Giants ( 1902 – 08 ) = = = 
 With the Orioles reportedly in significant debt , part @-@ owner John Mahon purchased shares of the team from star players Joe Kelley and John McGraw , who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL , becoming the majority shareholder . On July 17 , 1902 , he sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman , principal owner of the Giants , and John T. Brush , principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds , also of the NL . That day , Freedman and Brush released Bresnahan , Kelley , Joe McGinnity , Jack Cronin , Cy Seymour , and Dan McGann from their contracts . Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds , while Freedman signed McGinnity , Bresnahan , Cronin , Gilbert , and McGann , joining McGraw , his new player @-@ manager , on the Giants . 
 With Frank Bowerman and Jack Warner established as the Giants ' catchers , McGraw played Bresnahan as the center fielder for the Giants . In 1903 , Bresnahan batted .350 , trailing Honus Wagner 's .355 average atop the NL . Bresnahan batted .284 in the 1904 season , playing 96 games in the outfield , ten games at first base , four games at shortstop , and one game apiece at second base and third base , as the Giants were champions of the NL . 
 Bresnahan shifted to catcher full @-@ time in 1905 , as Bowerman became less effective and Warner left the Giants . Christy Mathewson preferred pitching to Bresnahan . Bresnahan caught all five games in the 1905 World Series , including three shutouts by Mathewson , and one shutout thrown by Joe McGinnity . Bresnahan led the Giants with a .313 batting average in the World Series . 
 On Opening Day in 1907 , Bresnahan began to experiment with protective gear . Though Negro league catcher Chappie Johnson wore protective gear and Nig Clarke wore similar gear in MLB in 1905 , most catchers did not wear any protective equipment . Bresnahan practiced in shin guards that are worn in cricket during spring training , and debuted them on April 11 , 1907 . Fans , used to seeing catchers play without protective equipment , threw snowballs on the field , and without police at the game , umpire Bill Klem called off the game , with the Giants forfeiting to the Philadelphia Phillies . The press also criticized the use of shin guards . However , other catchers began to adopt Bresnahan 's idea . Though Pittsburgh Pirates manager Fred Clarke protested Bresnahan 's gear to the league , the protest was denied and the equipment was approved . Bresnahan caught a career @-@ high 138 games in 1908 , batting .283 and leading the NL in walks . 
 Bresnahan also developed the first batting helmet . He was hit in the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18 , 1907 . Bresnahan was unconscious , and a Catholic priest read him his last rites . Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days , during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet , though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s . Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching .

 The Giants obtained younger and faster players in 1909 ; McGraw had Chief Meyers ready to succeed Bresnahan at catcher . Stanley Robison of the St. Louis Cardinals became interested in hiring Bresnahan to be a player @-@ manager . As McGraw did not want to block Bresnahan from the opportunity , the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for Red Murray , Bugs Raymond and Admiral <unk> after the 1908 season . Bresnahan led the Cardinals , who won only 49 games in 1908 , to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910 . Attendance increased from 205 @,@ 000 fans in 1908 to 299 @,@ 000 fans in 1909 , and 355 @,@ 000 fans in 1910 . 
 Grateful for the improvement at the box office , Robison signed Bresnahan to a five @-@ year contract to manage the team for a salary of $ 10 @,@ 000 per season ( $ 253 @,@ 964 in current dollar terms ) , plus ten percent of the club 's profits . Robison died in March 1911 , and ownership of the team transferred to Helene Hathaway Britton , his niece . 
 On July 11 , 1911 , with the Cardinals only three games out of first place , the team was involved in a train wreck while riding the Federal Express from Philadelphia to Boston . Fourteen passengers were killed after the train derailed and plunged down an 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) embankment outside Bridgeport , Connecticut . None of the Cardinals were seriously injured , due to a fortuitous pre @-@ trip change in the location of their Pullman car , requested by Bresnahan . The Cardinals helped remove bodies and rescue the injured . 
 Bresnahan and Britton feuded publicly in 1912 , as the Cardinals fell to sixth place in the NL . The Cardinals fired Bresnahan after the 1912 season due to various arguments Bresnahan had with Britton , including over Bresnahan 's desire to sell Miller Huggins to another franchise . Britton cited decreased profits as a sign that Bresnahan was uninterested in the job . Huggins succeeded Bresnahan as Cardinals ' manager , as she preferred Huggins ' " gentlemanly " manner , as opposed to Bresnahan 's rougher personality . <unk> hired an attorney to obtain the remainder of his salary .

 Following his termination by the Cardinals , the NL declared Bresnahan a free agent .

He served as player @-@ manager for the Cubs in 1915 , but was released when his batting average slipped . As the rival Federal League collapsed and the Cubs merged with the Chicago Whales of the Federal League , the Cubs decided to replace Bresnahan with Whales manager Joe Tinker . 
 The Cubs paid Bresnahan for the remaining two years on his contract and aided Bresnahan in purchasing the Toledo Mud Hens , then in the American Association , in 1916 . The club had moved to Cleveland to block the Federal League from placing a team there , but returned to Toledo under Bresnahan 's control . Bresnahan played for the team until 1918 , when he announced his retirement . He played for a semi @-@ professional team in 1919 , and appeared in five games for the Mud Hens in 1921 . Bresnahan worked to add lights to Toledo 's stadium , so that they could play night games . 
 Bresnahan sold the Mud Hens before the 1924 season . McGraw then hired Bresnahan as a coach for the Giants , a position he held from 1925 through 1928 . He coached for the Detroit Tigers in 1930 and 1931 .

 During the offseasons , Bresnahan returned to Toledo . He worked as a hotel detective at the <unk> House , which he later purchased . Bresnahan lost much of his money in the stock market crash of 1929 . He worked as a manual laborer , as a guard at the Toledo Workhouse , and as a salesman for Toledo 's Buckeye Brewing Company . 
 Bresnahan ran for sheriff of Lucas County as a member of the Democratic Party in 1932 . He lost , and endorsed the victorious candidate in his reelection bid two years later . Bresnahan ran for county commissioner in 1944 , winning the Democratic Party nomination , but losing in the general election by a few hundred votes out of 140 @,@ 000 votes cast .

 Bresnahan stood approximately 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) . He was described as " highly strung and almost abnormally emotional " by a reporter . Bill James wrote that Bresnahan " was one of those guys that if you were on his team and played hard he was as nice to you as could be , but if you got on his bad side you 'd think he was the Breath of Hell . " 
 Bresnahan was known for baiting umpires . He and McGraw were often ejected from games , suspended , and on a few occasions escorted from the field by police . A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch , compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing batters with verbal abuse , mentioned only Bresnahan by name . 
 Bresnahan was elected to the Hall of Fame the year after his death . He had received 47 votes of the 226 electors in the 1936 Hall of Fame balloting , and between 43 and 67 votes each time from 1937 through 1942 . In the 1945 balloting , occurring one month after Bresnahan 's death , he received 133 votes , still falling short of enshrinement . However , the Permanent Committee noticed the surge in votes and elected him in April 1945 . 
 Regarding his Hall of Fame induction , James has criticized the election , saying that Bresnahan " wandered in the Hall of Fame on a series of miscalculations " , and regarding his election , that " the Hall of Fame had , for the first time , selected a player who clearly had no damn business being there " .

 Vasil Levski ( Bulgarian : <unk> <unk> , originally spelled <unk> <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ; 18 July 1837 – 18 February 1873 ) , was a Bulgarian revolutionary and is a national hero of Bulgaria . Dubbed the Apostle of Freedom , Levski <unk> and <unk> a revolutionary movement to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule . Founding the Internal Revolutionary Organisation , Levski sought to foment a nationwide uprising through a network of secret regional committees . 
 Born in the Sub @-@ Balkan town of Karlovo to middle class parents , Levski became an Orthodox monk before emigrating to join the two Bulgarian Legions in Serbia and other Bulgarian revolutionary groups . Abroad , he acquired the nickname Levski , " <unk> " . After working as a teacher in Bulgarian lands , he propagated his views and developed the concept of his Bulgaria @-@ based revolutionary organisation , an innovative idea that superseded the foreign @-@ based detachment strategy of the past . In Romania , Levski helped institute the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee , composed of Bulgarian expatriates . During his tours of Bulgaria , Levski established a wide network of insurrectionary committees . Ottoman authorities , however , captured him at an inn near Lovech and executed him by hanging in Sofia . 
 Levski looked beyond the act of liberation : he envisioned a " pure and sacred " Bulgarian republic of ethnic and religious equality . His concepts have been described as a struggle for human rights , inspired by the progressive liberalism of the French Revolution and 19th century Western European society . Levski is commemorated with monuments in Bulgaria and Serbia , and numerous national institutions bear his name . In 2007 , he topped a nationwide television poll as the all @-@ time greatest Bulgarian . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 In 1396 the medieval Bulgarian Empire had ceased to exist , falling under full Ottoman domination . The <unk> Ottoman millet system ( Sharia Laws ) had turned Bulgarians and other Non @-@ Muslim subjects into second @-@ class citizens , and the religious differences had created insurmountable cultural antagonism . The empire 's 19th @-@ century economic hardships , which prompted its personification as the " sick man of Europe " , meant that the Ottoman state 's Non @-@ Muslim residents suffered more than its Muslim subjects , and reforms planned by the sultans faced insuperable difficulties . 
 Bulgarian nationalism gradually emerged during the mid @-@ 19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen , the development of Bulgarian @-@ funded popular education , the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards the formation of a separate Bulgarian state . The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s , and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832 , in the wake of the Greek War of Independence . However , support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal . Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace . There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders , who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership .

 = = = Early life , education and <unk> = = = 
 Vasil Levski was born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev on 18 July [ O.S. 6 July ] 1837 in the town of Karlovo , within the Ottoman Empire 's European province of Rumelia . He was the namesake of his maternal uncle , Archimandrite ( superior abbot ) Basil ( <unk> , Vasiliy ) . Levski 's parents , Ivan Kunchev and Gina <unk> ( née <unk> ) , came from a family of clergy and craftsmen and were members of the emerging Bulgarian middle class . An eminent but struggling local craftsman , Ivan Kunchev died in 1844 . Levski had two younger brothers , Hristo and Petar , and an older sister , Yana ; another sister , Maria , died during childhood . 
 Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later described the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile , wiry appearance — with light , greyish @-@ blue eyes , blond hair , and a small moustache . He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking . Hitov 's memories of Levski 's appearance are supported by Levski 's contemporaries , revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan <unk> . The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height , while <unk> noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel . 
 Levski began his education at a school in Karlovo , studying homespun tailoring as a local craftsman 's apprentice . In 1855 , Levski 's uncle Basil — archimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monastery — took him to Stara Zagora , where he attended school and worked as Basil 's servant . Afterward , Levski joined a clerical training course . On 7 December 1858 , he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the religious name Ignatius ( <unk> , Ignatiy ) and was promoted in 1859 to <unk> , which later inspired one of Levski 's informal nicknames , The Deacon ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 = = = First Bulgarian Legion and educational work = = = 
 Inspired by Georgi Sava Rakovski 's revolutionary ideas , Levski left for the Serbian capital Belgrade during the spring of 1862 . In Belgrade , Rakovski had been assembling the First Bulgarian Legion , a military detachment formed by Bulgarian volunteers and revolutionary workers seeking the overthrow of Ottoman rule . Abandoning his service as a monk , Levski enlisted as a volunteer . At the time , relations between the Serbs and their Ottoman suzerains were tense . During the Battle of Belgrade in which Turkish forces entered the city , Levski and the Legion distinguished themselves in repelling them . Further militant conflicts in Belgrade were eventually resolved diplomatically , and the First Bulgarian Legion was disbanded under Ottoman pressure on 12 September 1862 . His courage during training and fighting earned him his nickname Levski ( " <unk> " ) . After the legion 's disbandment , Levski joined <unk> <unk> 's detachment at Kragujevac , but returned to Rakovski in Belgrade after discovering that <unk> 's plans to invade Bulgaria had failed . 
 In the spring of 1863 , Levski returned to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania . His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities , and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months , but released due to the help of the doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice @-@ consul <unk> Gerov . On Easter 1864 , Levski officially relinquished his religious office . From May 1864 until March 1866 , he worked as a teacher in <unk> near Karlovo ; while there , he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population . His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities , and he was forced to move . From the spring of 1866 to the spring of 1867 he taught in <unk> and <unk> , two Northern Dobruja villages near Tulcea . 
 = = = Hitov 's detachment and Second Bulgarian Legion = = = 
 In November 1866 , Levski visited Rakovski in Iaşi . Two revolutionary bands led by Panayot Hitov and Filip <unk> had been inciting the Bulgarian diaspora community in Romania to invade Bulgaria and organise anti @-@ Ottoman resistance . On the recommendation of Rakovski , Vasil Levski was selected as the standard @-@ bearer of Hitov 's detachment . In April 1867 , the band crossed the Danube at <unk> , moved through the <unk> region and reached the Balkan Mountains . After skirmishing , the band fled to Serbia through Pirot in August . 
 In Serbia , the government was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries ' aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion , an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals . Levski was a prominent member of the Legion , but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery . Bedridden , he could not participate in the Legion 's training . After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure , Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots , but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned . Upon his release he went to Romania , where <unk> Dimitar and Stefan <unk> were mobilising revolutionary detachments . For various reasons , including his stomach problems and strategic differences , Levski did not participate . In the winter of 1868 , he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo <unk> and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest . 
 = = = Bulgarian tours and work in Romania = = = 
 Rejecting the emigrant detachment strategy for internal propaganda , Levski undertook his first tour of the Bulgarian lands to engage all layers of Bulgarian society for a successful revolution . On 11 December 1868 , he travelled by steamship from Turnu Măgurele to Istanbul , the starting point of a trek that lasted until 24 February 1869 , when Levski returned to Romania . During this canvassing and reconnaissance mission , Levski is thought to have visited Plovdiv , <unk> , Karlovo , Sopot , Kazanlak , Sliven , Tarnovo , Lovech , Pleven and Nikopol , establishing links with local patriots . 
 After a two @-@ month stay in Bucharest , Vasil Levski returned to Bulgaria for a second tour , lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869 . On this tour he carried proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan <unk> . They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government . Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol , Pleven , Karlovo , Plovdiv , Pazardzhik , <unk> , Stara Zagora , <unk> , Sliven , Lovech , Tarnovo , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . According to some researchers , Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour , but those assumptions are based on uncertain data . 
 From late August 1869 to May the following year , Levski was active in the Romanian capital Bucharest . He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov , whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing . Karavelov 's publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee ( BRCC ) , a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter . In disagreement over planning , Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network . 
 = = = Creation of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation = = = 
 Despite insufficient documentation of Levski 's activities in 1870 , it is known that he spent a year and a half establishing a wide network of secret committees in Bulgarian cities and villages . The network , the Internal Revolutionary Organisation ( IRO ) , was centred around the Lovech Central Committee , also called " BRCC in Bulgaria " or the " provisional government " . The goal of the committees was to prepare for a coordinated uprising . The network of committees was at its densest in the central Bulgarian regions , particularly around Sofia , Plovdiv and Stara Zagora . Revolutionary committees were also established in some parts of Macedonia , Dobruja and Strandzha and around the more peripheral urban centres Kyustendil , Vratsa and Vidin . IRO committees purchased armaments and organised detachments of volunteers . According to one study , the organisation had just over 1 @,@ 000 members in the early 1870s . Most members were intellectuals and traders , though all layers of Bulgarian society were represented . 
 Individuals obtained IRO membership in secrecy : the initiation ritual involved a formal oath of allegiance over the Gospel or a Christian cross , a gun and a knife ; treason was punishable by death , and secret police monitored each member 's activities . Through clandestine channels of reliable people , relations were maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community . The internal correspondence employed encryption , conventional signs , and fake personal and committee names . Although Levski himself headed the organisation , he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk @-@ turned @-@ revolutionary <unk> <unk> , the adventurous Dimitar Obshti , and the young Angel <unk> . 
 Apocryphal and semi @-@ legendary anecdotal stories surround the creation of Levski 's Internal Revolutionary Organisation . Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture , Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels . For example , he is known to have dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes . In the autumn of 1871 , Levski and Angel <unk> published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People , a BRCC draft statute containing ideological , organisational and penal sections . It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion . The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872 ; at the time , his views on the revolution had clearly matured . 
 As IRO expanded , it coordinated its activities more with the Bucharest @-@ based BRCC . On Levski 's initiative , a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872 . At the assembly , the delegates approved a programme and a statute , elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation 's leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body 's only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands . After attending the assembly , Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IRO 's internal structure in accordance with BRCC 's recommendations . Thus , the Lovech Central Committee was reduced to a regular local committee , and the first region @-@ wide revolutionary centres were founded . The lack of funds , however , precipitated the organisation into a crisis , and Levski 's one @-@ man judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned . 
 = = = Capture and execution = = = 
 In that situation , Levski 's assistant Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the <unk> pass on 22 September 1872 , without approval from Levski or the leadership of the movement . While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125 @,@ 000 groschen , Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested . The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation 's size and its close relations with BRCC . Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski 's leading role . 
 Realising that he was in danger , Levski decided to flee to Romania , where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events . First , however , he had to collect important documentation from the committee archive in Lovech , which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans . He stayed at the nearby village inn in <unk> , where he was surprised and arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872 . Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov the most accepted version has been that a priest named <unk> <unk> betrayed Levski to the police . This theory has been disputed by the researchers Ivan <unk> and Vasil <unk> for lack of evidence . 
 Initially taken to Tarnovo for interrogation , Levski was sent to Sofia on 4 January . There , he was taken to trial . While he acknowledged his identity , he did not reveal his accomplices or details related to his organisation , taking full blame . Ottoman authorities sentenced Levski to death by hanging . The sentence was carried out on 18 February [ O.S. 6 February ] 1873 in Sofia , where the Monument to Vasil Levski now stands . The location of Levski 's grave is uncertain , but in the 1980s writer Nikolay <unk> campaigned for the Church of St. Petka of the <unk> as Levski 's burial place , which the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences concluded as possible yet unverifiable . 
 Levski 's death intensified the crisis in the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and most IRO committees soon disintegrated . Nevertheless , five years after his hanging , the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the wake of the April Uprising of 1876 . The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established the Bulgarian state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under de jure Ottoman suzerainty . 
 = = Revolutionary theory and ideas = = 
 At the end of the 1860s , Levski developed a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire . The insurrection was to be prepared , controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation , which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors . Levski 's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski 's ideas effectively , such as the use of foreign @-@ based armed detachments ( <unk> , <unk> ) to provoke a general revolt . Levski 's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either — in fact , he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it . Instead , many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution . 
 Levski envisioned Bulgaria as a democratic republic , occasionally finding common ground with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , and largely reflecting the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and contemporary Western society . He said , " We will be free in complete liberty where the Bulgarian lives : in Bulgaria , Thrace , Macedonia ; people of whatever ethnicity live in this heaven of ours , they will be equal in rights to the Bulgarian in everything . We will have a flag that says , ' Pure and sacred republic ' ... It is time , by a single deed , to achieve what our French brothers have been seeking ... " Levski held that all religious and ethnic groups in a free Bulgaria — whether Bulgarians , Turks , Jews or others — should enjoy equal rights . He reiterated that the Bulgarian revolutionaries fought against the sultan 's government , not against the Turkish people and their religion : " We 're not driving away the Turkish people nor their faith , but the emperor and his laws ( in a word , the Turkish government ) , which has been ruling not only us , but the Turk himself in a barbarian way . " 
 Levski was prepared to sacrifice his life for the revolution and place Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people above personal interests : " If I shall win , I shall win for the entire people . If I shall lose , I shall lose only myself . " In a liberated Bulgaria , he did not envision himself as a national leader or a high @-@ ranking official : " We yearn to see a free fatherland , and [ then ] one could even order me to graze the ducks , isn 't that right ? " In the spirit of Garibaldi , Levski planned to assist other oppressed peoples of the world in their liberation once Bulgaria was reestablished . He also advocated " strict and regular accounting " in his revolutionary organisation , and did not tolerate corruption . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 In cities and villages across Bulgaria , Levski 's contributions to the liberation movement are commemorated with numerous monuments , and many streets bear his name . Monuments to Levski also exist outside Bulgaria — in Belgrade , Serbia , Dimitrovgrad , Serbia , <unk> , Transnistria , Moldova , Bucharest , Romania , Paris , France , Washington , D.C. , United States , and Buenos Aires , Argentina . Three museums dedicated to Levski have been organised : one in Karlovo , one in Lovech and one in <unk> . The Monument to Vasil Levski in Sofia was erected on the site of his execution . 
 Several institutions in Bulgaria have been named in Vasil Levski 's honour ; these include the football club PFC Levski Sofia , the Vasil Levski National Sports Academy and the Vasil Levski National Military University . Bulgaria 's national stadium bears the name Vasil Levski National Stadium . The 1000 Bulgarian leva banknote , in circulation between 1994 and 1999 , featured Levski 's portrait on its obverse side and his monument in Sofia on the reverse . The town of Levski and six villages around the country have also been named in his honour . The Antarctic Place @-@ names Commission of Bulgaria named an Antarctic ridge and peak on Livingston Island of the South Shetland Islands Levski Ridge and Levski Peak respectively . 
 The life of Vasil Levski has been widely featured in Bulgarian literature and popular culture . Poet and revolutionary Hristo <unk> dedicated his last work to Levski , " The Hanging of Vasil Levski " . The poem , an elegy , was probably written in late 1875 . Prose and poetry writer Ivan Vazov devoted an ode to the revolutionary . <unk> titled " Levski " , it was published as part of the cycle Epic of the Forgotten . Levski has also inspired works by writers Hristo <unk> and Nikolay <unk> , among others . Songs devoted to Levski can be found in the folklore tradition of Macedonia as well . In February 2007 , a nationwide poll conducted as part of the <unk> <unk> ( " The Great Bulgarians " ) television show , a local spin @-@ off of 100 Greatest Britons , named Vasil Levski the greatest Bulgarian of all time . 
 There have been motions to glorify Vasil Levski as a saint of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church . However , historian Stefan <unk> has emphasised that while Levski 's post @-@ <unk> life was one of a martyr , it was incompatible with the Orthodox concept of sainthood . <unk> makes reference to Levski 's correspondences , which show that Levski threatened wealthy Bulgarians ( <unk> , <unk> ) and traitors with death , endorsed theft from the rich for pragmatic revolutionary purposes and voluntarily gave up his religious office to devote himself to the secular struggle for liberation . 
 Vasil Levski 's hanging is observed annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February , due to the erroneous calculation of 19th @-@ century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916 . Although the location of Levski 's grave has not been determined , some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History . After Levski gave up <unk> in 1863 , he shaved his hair , which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved . Levski 's personal items — such as his silver Christian cross , his copper water vessel , his Gasser revolver , made in Austria – Hungary in 1869 , and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia — are also exhibited in the military history museum , while Levski 's sabre can be seen in the Lovech regional museum . 
 = Arthur Morris = 
 Arthur Robert Morris MBE ( 19 January 1922 – 22 August 2015 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 46 Test matches between 1946 and 1955 . An opener , Morris is regarded as one of Australia 's greatest left @-@ handed batsmen . He is best known for his key role in Don Bradman 's Invincibles side , which made an undefeated tour of England in 1948 . He was the leading scorer in the Tests on the tour , with three centuries . His efforts in the Fourth Test at Headingley helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day . Morris was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century in 2000 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001 . 
 In his youth , Morris excelled at rugby union as well as cricket , being selected for the state schoolboys ' team in both sports . Originally trained in spin bowling , Morris developed as a batsman during his teens and during the 1940 – 41 season became the first player in the world to score two centuries on his first @-@ class debut . His career was interrupted by the Second World War , during which he served in the Australian Army and gained selection in its rugby union team . Upon the resumption of cricket in 1946 , Morris made his Test debut against England and quickly made himself a core member of the team . He made a century in his third match and scored twin centuries in the following Test , becoming only the second Australian to do so in an Ashes Test . His rise was such that he was made a selector during the Invincibles tour after only 18 months in the team . 
 After the 4 – 0 series win over England , which was Bradman 's farewell series , Morris became Australia 's vice @-@ captain and was expected to be its leading batsman . He started well , scoring two centuries during Australia 's first series in the post @-@ Bradman era , a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4 – 0 . By the end of the South African tour , Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65 , but thereafter his form declined . Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman 's team aged and retired . Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned . His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill . Later in his life , Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The son of a schoolteacher who played for Waverley Cricket Club in Sydney as a fast bowler , Morris was born in 1922 in the Sydney seaside suburb of Bondi and spent his early years in the city . His family moved when he was five to <unk> , then to Newcastle before returning to Sydney in the suburb of Beverly Hills . By this time , Morris ' parents had separated . 
 His father encouraged him to play sport and he showed promise in a variety of ball sports , particularly cricket , rugby and tennis . Aged 12 , he gained a place as a slow bowler for Newcastle Boys ' High School 's cricket team . On Saturday afternoons he played for Blackwall , a team in the local C @-@ grade competition . Morris attended Canterbury Boys ' High School from 1936 to 1939 where he represented the school at cricket and rugby union , and was appointed school captain ( head boy ) in Year 11 . 
 In his last two years of high school , he was selected for Combined High Schools teams in both cricket — as captain in both years — and rugby . At the age of 14 , he made his debut for St George , and in 1937 – 38 he was elevated to the second XI . In a club under @-@ 16 competition , the A W Green Shield , Morris took 55 wickets at 5 @.@ 23 , which remains a record . The following year he was selected for the team as a batsman , after captain Bill O 'Reilly decided that his left @-@ arm unorthodox spin had less potential . O 'Reilly described him as " moderately skilled " in bowling and noted that he would not have many opportunities with the ball as future Test bowling world record holder Ray Lindwall was also in the team . O 'Reilly quickly moved Morris up to the No. 6 position in the batting order . After scoring a century against Sydney University , O 'Reilly moved him into the opening position without prior notice , where he remained . 
 While still at high school , Morris was selected to play for the New South Wales Second XI against Victoria in January 1939 , his first taste of representative cricket . However , Morris made only six and three and did not gain further honours . After finishing his secondary education at the end of 1939 , Morris became a clerk in the Prosecutions Branch at Sydney Town Hall . He was chosen to make his debut , aged 18 , for New South Wales against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1940 – 41 season , a season in which there was no Sheffield Shield cricket due to the Second World War . He scored centuries in both innings , becoming the first player in the world to achieve the feat on debut . Morris made 148 in the first innings and participated in a second wicket partnership of 261 with Sid Barnes ; he added 111 in the second innings , completing his feat on 28 December . He gave chances that were dropped early in both innings , but impressed observers with his ability to remain settled . New South Wales went on to win by 404 runs . He was unable to maintain the standard of his debut in later performances , but finished the war @-@ shortened season with 385 runs at a strong average of 55 @.@ 14 in four matches . 
 = = Second World War and Test debut = = 
 Morris ' first @-@ class cricket career was interrupted by the Second World War , when domestic matches were cancelled at the end of the season . On 5 January 1943 , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force , and served in the South West Pacific , mostly in New Guinea with the 8th Movement Control Group , part of the Royal Australian Corps of Transport . During his time in the army , Morris spent more time playing rugby union than cricket . The coach of the Army and Combined Services rugby team , Johnny Wallace , regarded him as the " best five eighth in Australia " . He remained a Private throughout his military service and was demobbed on 18 June 1946 . Despite his eligibility , Morris was not selected for the Australian Services XI in 1945 , something that baffled commentators , although he did play a one @-@ off military match in 1943 . 
 He returned to his pre @-@ war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall , but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company , which allowed him more time for cricket commitments . Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946 – 47 upon the resumption of competition . He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland , and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond 's touring MCC team when first @-@ choice opener Bill Brown was injured . In what was effectively a trial for the Test team , Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196 @-@ run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman , who scored 106 . It was the beginnings of a productive cricketing relationship . Morris said of Bradman : " He was marvellous . If you had a problem , you could go to him and sort it out . I found him relaxed and straightforward " . 
 After scoring 81 for New South Wales in his next match , against the MCC , Morris was selected to make his Test debut in the First Test against England in Brisbane . He failed in his first two Tests , managing just two and five , although Australia won both matches by an innings . Despite being criticised for having a " loose technique " by Neville Cardus , Bradman advised Morris to stick to his approach . Morris responded by scoring 83 and 110 in the traditional pre @-@ Christmas match between New South Wales and Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the top score in both innings . However , he was unable to prevent an innings defeat . He was retained for the Third Test in Melbourne , but made only 21 in the first innings . If he had failed a fourth time , it could have allowed another player to claim his position , but Morris secured his place with his maiden Test century , scoring 155 in the second innings , and making the most of an ideal batting surface . After defending stoutly at the beginning of the innings , Morris accelerated his scoring , employing a wide range of strokes to reach 150 in six hours . 
 Morris managed a century in each innings of the Fourth Test at Adelaide , making 122 and 124 not out in extremely hot weather . This made him the second Australian after Warren Bardsley to score two centuries in one Ashes Test . With Australia having fallen to 2 / 24 at the end of play on the second day in response to England 's first innings score of 460 , Morris combined with Lindsay Hassett , who scored 78 , to lead a recovery . After England 's Denis Compton scored his second century of the match in the second innings , Morris put in another determined effort to ensure a draw . With the match secure , Morris played more aggressively towards the end in an unbeaten 99 @-@ run partnership with Bradman . Ahead of the final Test , Morris made 44 and 47 for New South Wales in a drawn match against Hammond 's men . He made 57 in the Fifth Test in Sydney to end the series with an aggregate of 503 runs , at an average of 71 @.@ 85 , second only to Bradman . He ended his first full first @-@ class season with 1234 runs at 68 @.@ 55 , partnering Sid Barnes at the top of the order at both state and international level . E. W. Swanton wrote " Morris set himself up as a No. 1 for Australia for a while to come ... Arthur at his best looked out of the top draw , a left @-@ hander with all the strokes ... and what the figures do not say is that few more charming men have played for Australia , and I cannot name one who was more popular with his opponents " . 
 = = Invincibles tour = = 
 Morris started the 1947 – 48 Australian season strongly , scoring 162 in his second match as New South Wales crushed the touring Indians by an innings ahead of the Tests . He played in the first four Tests , scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne . In that match , he dropped down the order as Bradman used the tail @-@ enders to protect the batsmen from a sticky wicket . Morris then came in and combined with Bradman in a double century stand . The selectors wished to trial other possible choices for the 1948 tour of England , including Brown in the opening position , so wither Barnes or Morris had to sit out . This was decided by a coin toss . Morris lost and did not play ; he was given 10 pounds as compensation . Morris thus ended the series with 209 runs at an average of 52 @.@ 25 . Australia won the final Test to seal the series 4 – 0 , and Morris ended the season with 772 runs at 55 @.@ 14 . He scored four consecutive half @-@ centuries for his state as they reclaimed the Sheffield Shield from Victoria . For the first two Tests , Morris was paired with the recovered Brown , before the latter was replaced by Barnes . 
 Morris , the recently appointed co @-@ captain of New South Wales , had greatly impressed Australia captain Don Bradman , to the extent that Bradman made Morris one of the three selectors for the 1948 tour of England . Morris was a key part of Bradman 's inner circle in planning for the tour . Bradman had long harboured the ambition of touring England without losing a match . 
 Morris marked his first @-@ class debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire , which was scored in only four hours and made him the first Australian centurion on tour . Morris found batting difficult for the first few weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions , reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24 @.@ 77 ; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length , and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught . Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease . He rectified this , and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test . Five more centuries before the end of the season . 
 Morris ' Test form peaked in the series , heading the Test averages with 696 runs at 87 @.@ 00 , and he was the only player to compile three Test centuries . After scoring 31 and 9 in the First Test victory at Trent Bridge , he was criticised by former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton , who believed Morris was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot . Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire , before scoring 105 and 62 in the Second Test at Lord 's to help Australia take a 2 – 0 series lead . Fingleton called the innings " a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings " ; the knock was noted for powerful , well @-@ placed cover drives . Morris featured in century partnerships with Bradman in the first innings and Barnes in the second innings , laying the foundation of a lead of 595 runs . 
 After being rested against Surrey , the following match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol , where in only five hours , Morris scored his career best of 290 . Having lost the opening two games of the series , England were contemplating changes to their team : Tom Goddard was tipped to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner , having been in prolific form in county cricket . The English hoped that he would be the weapon to cut through Australia 's strong batting line @-@ up . Morris ' assault ended Goddard 's hopes of Test selection . His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball , followed by decisive footwork . Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a full length and rocked onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short . On many occasions , he hit Goddard on the full . Unable to contain Morris , Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump . Morris stepped down the wicket , repeatedly lofting the ball over the off side . Morris reached his century by lunch and was 231 by the tea interval . By the time he was dismissed , he had struck 40 fours and a six . Fingleton said that " Morris flayed it [ the home team 's bowling ] in all directions " , while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said " Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . " Australia promptly crushed the locals by an innings . 
 Morris followed his effort in Bristol with two half centuries , 51 and 54 not out in the drawn Third Test . He then struck 108 against Middlesex in a tour match . Morris ' century meant that he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket . 
 The Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest ; England started well with 496 in the first innings and took a 38 @-@ run lead as Australia replied with 458 , Morris contributing only six . England declared at 8 / 365 , leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly , with only six runs in the first six overs . When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin , 13 runs were taken from his first over , but only 44 runs came in the first hour , leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes . Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary . Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter @-@ attack , hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 1 / 121 . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Denis Compton 's bowling . Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called " indescribably bad bowling " . He reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours . Morris had added 37 runs in the 15 minutes since lunch . He had become the first Australian to hit 20 boundaries in his reaching his century in a Test in England . This forced English captain Norman Yardley to replace Compton , and Australia reached 202 — halfway to the required total — with 165 minutes left . When Bradman suffered a fibrositis attack , Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided . Morris passed his century and Australia reached tea at 1 / 288 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed for 182 , having survived multiple chances and partnered Bradman in a partnership of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . Australia proceeded to accumulate the remaining 46 runs to secure the victory by seven wickets . 
 Morris was the batsman at the other end of the pitch in the Fifth Test at The Oval when Bradman was famously bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck in his final Test innings . Morris went on to score 196 in an innings noted for his hooking and off @-@ driving before finally being removed by a run out as Australia reached 389 . He scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took five wickets . With England having been bowled out for 52 in their first innings , Australia sealed the series 4 – 0 with an innings victory . Morris took four catches , including a famous dismissal of Compton , who hooked the ball . Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch , described by Fingleton as " one of the catches of the season " . 
 In recognition of his performances , Morris was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 , described as " one of the world 's best left @-@ hand batsmen " . Neville Cardus , his former critic , praised Morris ' performance during the Invincibles tour as " masterful , stylish , imperturbable , sure in defence , quick and handsome in stroke play . His batting is true to himself , charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful . " 
 Morris ended the first @-@ class tour with 1 @,@ 922 runs at 71 @.@ 18 , despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball . The wound often opened while he was batting , forcing him to undergo a minor operation , which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour . 
 = = Vice @-@ captain of Australia = = 
 With the retirement of Bradman following the 1948 tour , Morris was regarded by commentators as Australia 's leading batsman . In the 1948 – 49 season , he scored 1 @,@ 049 runs at 66 @.@ 81 in nine matches with six centuries and two fifties , taking his tally for the previous twelve months to 2 @,@ 991 runs at 69 @.@ 56 , with 13 centuries . He scored a century in each of his first three matches for the season , making 120 against Queensland , 108 in Bradman 's Testimonial and 163 against Western Australia . After a match without triple figures , he added 177 against Victoria . 
 In a low @-@ scoring match against Queensland , New South Wales started the final day needing 142 to win . Morris scored 108 in only 80 balls , steering his team to victory before lunch . Previously , only Bradman had scored a century before lunch in a Shield match . The innings took only 82 minutes and Morris promptly returned to his work as a salesman . Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia . The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to lure Morris to switch states , but he declined . 
 Morris was appointed Australian vice @-@ captain under Lindsay Hassett for a five @-@ Test tour of South Africa in 1949 – 50 , narrowly missing out on the captaincy after a 7 – 6 vote by the board . He scored two centuries in six tour matches before the Tests . In his first Test in his new leadership role , Morris was out for a duck in Australia 's only innings as the team won by an innings . He made starts in the next two Tests , passing twenty but failing to reach a half @-@ century on all four occasions . In the second innings of the Third Test , Morris played fluently to reach 42 on a sticky wicket before stepping on his stumps . Australia looked set for their first Test defeat to South Africa , but an unbeaten Neil Harvey century salvaged a win . Morris returned to form by making 111 and 19 in the drawn Fourth Test in Johannesburg . In between , Morris struck two further centuries in the tour matches , against Border and Transvaal . He finished with a score of 157 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth , laying the foundation for an innings victory and a 4 – 0 series result . He ended the series with 422 runs at 52 @.@ 75 . On either side of the final Test , Morris added centuries against Griqualand West and Western Province , and for the entire tour had amassed eight centuries , equal to Neil Harvey . At this stage of his career , he had amassed 1 @,@ 830 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 67 @.@ 77 , with nine centuries . Following the tour , Morris received an invitation from the New South Wales branch of the ruling Liberal Party asking him to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming state elections , an offer that he declined . 
 England toured Australia for the 1950 – 51 Ashes series and Morris started the season strongly . He scored 74 , 101 and 78 not out as New South Wales won consecutive matches against Queensland . Morris then warmed up the Tests by amassing 168 for New South Wales against England . However , he made a poor start to the Test series by aggregating only 45 runs in the first three Tests , which included two ducks . Four of his five dismissals came at the hands of Alec Bedser , leading commentators to claim that Bedser had a " hoodoo " on Morris and he was called " Bedser 's Bunny " . In contrast to his struggles in the Tests , Morris played for an Australian XI and New South Wales in two matches against England during this period , and scored 100 and 105 . In a match against arch @-@ rivals Victoria , Morris hammered 182 and targeted Test teammate Jack Iverson , who responded poorly to being attacked . The match ended in a draw but stopped Victoria 's challenge for interstate supremacy . The attack effectively ended Iverson 's run at the top of cricket . However , on his 29th birthday , Morris again fell cheaply to Bedser in a tour match and he found himself eating at table 13 ahead of the next Test . 
 Facing omission from the side , Morris recovered in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval , where Hassett shielded him from Bedser . This helped Morris to settle in before batting for a day and a half to score 206 , his highest Test score and only double century at the highest level . It constituted the majority of Australia 's total of 371 , which set up 274 @-@ run victory and a 4 – 0 series lead , and was his seventh Ashes century , ranking him second only to Bradman at the time for Ashes centuries . Bradman described the innings as " faultless – a terrific Test double hundred " , comparing it to Morris 's 182 and 196 at Headingley and The Oval during the 1948 Invincibles tour . Morris ended the series with a half @-@ century in Melbourne in Australia 's only loss , to give him a series aggregate of 321 runs at 35 @.@ 66 . It was the first Test loss he had played in after 24 matches for Australia . In contrast to his below par Test series , Morris was in strong form during the first @-@ class season ; he scored three centuries against England in the tour matches and compiled six in all to finish with 1 @,@ 221 runs at 58 @.@ 14 . Despite these performances , the press continued to emphasise his perceived difficulties against Bedser . 
 = = Difficulties against the West Indies = = 
 The 1951 – 52 season saw the second tour to Australia by the West Indies . Morris experimented with his stance during the winter in response to criticism about his footwork when facing Bedser . Morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on the leg side . He opened his season by punishing the Queenslanders with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria . In the first of these innings , Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team 's 400 , with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting . His Test form was unimpressive though ; he started steadily , with 122 runs in the first two Tests , which were won by Australia . 
 The Third Test in Adelaide was Morris 's first Test as captain , after Hassett withdrew on match eve due to a strained hip muscle . Australia were already one batsman short after the Australian Board of Control had earlier vetoed the selection of Barnes " for grounds other than cricketing ability " , which was widely believed to be a result of Barnes ' previous clashes with authority . Under board 's regulations at the time , a replacement player needed the approval of the entire board . Since it was the weekend , some of the members could not be contacted by phone , and as a result Hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside the twelve man squad . Instead , his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in the squad . This left Morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and Miller as the all @-@ rounder . Morris had a long tail with wicketkeeper Gil Langley and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23 , and was reportedly " in a state of shock " . Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a sticky wicket . Because of a leak in the covers , one end of the pitch was dry and the other was wet . Australia were bowled out for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict the West Indies to 105 . In all 22 wickets fell on the first day , the most in a Test on Australian soil in 50 years . Morris proceeded to reverse the batting order in the second innings , with bowler Ian Johnson and Langley opening the batting . They were followed by bowlers Geff Noblet and Doug Ring , in order to protect the batsmen from a wicket that was still wet . Ring made an unexpected 67 and Morris scored 45 as Australia compiled 255 , but it was not enough ; the West Indies reached the target with six wickets in hand . 
 After scores of 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test , he missed the final Test due to injury , ending an unproductive Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23 @.@ 25 . The series was noted for Morris ' difficulties against the spin duo of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin , who bowled left @-@ arm orthodox and leg spin respectively . The pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on the tour . Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53 @.@ 69 . He topped his state 's Shield batting averages , leading from the front as New South Wales regained the title . 
 = = Australia 's decline = = 
 The 1952 – 53 season started poorly for Morris . He was replaced by Keith Miller as state captain , despite having scored almost 700 runs at a fast rate in the previous Shield season at an average above 50 , and leading his state to another title . As was the norm for the era , Morris was not informed personally and learned of his demotion second @-@ hand . No official reason was given by the New South Wales Cricket Association , but it was speculated among the media that his penchant for wearing brightly @-@ coloured rubber @-@ soled shoes could have upset the conservative administrators , and that Morris was too genial to be captain . The media made Morris a scapegoat for dwindling public attendances following the retirement of Bradman and lobbied for Miller , who they deemed to be more appealing to the public . Morris had led his state to two Shield triumphs , but remained national vice @-@ captain ahead of Miller . Richie Benaud said that Morris " led the side just as well as Miller but in a less flamboyant manner " . 
 In spite of this , Morris started the new season consistently , scoring four fifties in his first five innings , including 55 and 39 in his state 's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests . The on @-@ field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris ' Test fortunes . He made only one half @-@ century and a total of 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2 – 1 . In the Second Test , he had progressed to 42 when he drove Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder . The ball ballooned to mid @-@ off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball 's trajectory and caught it . By the standards of the era , the catch was regarded as miraculous . He ended the series strongly , with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide , before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test , which Australia lost by six wickets . Morris ' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix @-@ up while batting with debutant Ian Craig , Australia 's youngest ever Test cricketer . Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig 's in a run out . His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years , and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again . Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new team @-@ mate . He ended the series with 370 runs at 41 @.@ 11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide , that of John Watkins . The series ended 2 – 2 , the first Test series in Morris ' career that Australia had not won . Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm @-@ up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45 @.@ 65 for the summer . 
 In 1953 , Morris returned to England , the setting for his three Test centuries five years earlier , for another Ashes series . In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey , Morris made 103 in eighty minutes . After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons , Morris warmed up in 10 lead @-@ in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34 @.@ 70 . However , his performances in the first two drawn Tests , in which he struck three half centuries , indicated that might be returning to his earlier form . He was unable to maintain his form however , and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests , ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33 @.@ 70 . The teams were locked at 0 – 0 heading into the Fifth Test , and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at The Oval would favour fast bowling . However , they were mistaken , and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts ' spinners cut down the tourists , while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands . Denis Compton pulled Morris ' spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets . This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes for the first time in two decades with a 1 – 0 triumph , and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career . It was a low @-@ scoring series , and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates , behind Hassett with 365 at 36 @.@ 50 . Morris ' batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the Invincibles tour . He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket , that of Alec Bedser , in the Third Test at Old Trafford . Morris also struggled in the first @-@ class matches , making 1 @,@ 302 runs at 38 @.@ 09 with only one century , which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour , against the Gentlemen of England . Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages . He made many starts , with 11 fifties , but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once . 
 Speculation linked his difficulties on the field to his personal relationships : during the tour Morris had fallen in love with English showgirl Valerie Hudson ; he spotted her when she was performing in the Crazy Gang vaudeville show at London 's Victoria Palace . The team was also hindered by tension brought on by a generational divide . The senior players , Morris among them , were retired servicemen who were drinkers , while the younger players tended to abstain from alcohol . The seniors frequently stopped the team bus to drink at pubs , leaving their younger colleagues disgruntled at the fact that the squad travelled at around 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) . 
 = = Career twilight = = 
 With the retirement of Hassett following the 1953 England tour , the Australian captaincy was open for competition . No international cricket was scheduled until 1954 – 55 , so there was a full domestic season in 1953 – 54 for players to stake their claims . Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia , but was unable to maintain his form , passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings . He ended with 487 runs at 54 @.@ 11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller 's leadership . Nevertheless , the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris ' XI , which played Hassett 's XI in a testimonial match . Morris ' XI won by 121 runs . 
 = = = 1954 – 55 Ashes = = = 
 At the start of the next season , Morris was not made Australian captain despite being the incumbent vice @-@ captain . Instead , he was remained as deputy as Victoria 's Ian Johnson was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy . There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for Morris , the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller , while the remainder voted Johnson . When England returned to Australia in 1954 – 55 , Morris made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane . After English skipper Len Hutton won the toss and controversially sent Australia in , Morris made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8 / 601 declared and an innings victory . This included a partnership of 202 runs with Neil Harvey . The pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over , despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of Frank Tyson , who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era . Those were the only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series , and Morris was covered in bruises ; he deliberately used his body to fend off short @-@ pitched balls rather than risk a catch . 
 In the Second Test in Sydney , Johnson and Miller were both unavailable due to injury ; Morris led the team for the second and final time in Tests . The Australian Board of Control made the surprising move of appointing the young and inexperienced Richie Benaud as Morris ' vice @-@ captain for the match . Benaud , selected as a batsman , had scored just 195 runs at 13 @.@ 92 in ten Test matches and was not a regular member of the team . Benaud noted that the situation was embarrassing and that Morris had asked him not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players Ray Lindwall and Harvey , who had been Test regulars for seven years . Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a green pitch , in a match marred by time @-@ wasting . Although Australia took a first innings lead , they lost the low @-@ scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse in the face of a Tyson pace barrage on the final day . Aided by a powerful tailwind , Tyson bowled at extreme pace and the slips cordon stood 45 m away from the wicket . Morris had a poor personal performance , scores of 12 and 10 , a disappointment amidst his team 's defeat . He failed to pass 25 in either of the following Tests as Australia fell 3 – 1 behind with a hat @-@ trick of losses and he was dropped for the Fifth Test , ending the series with 223 runs at 31 @.@ 86 . Aside from the First Test century , Morris struggled throughout the entire season , passing fifty on only one other occasion and managing only 382 runs at 31 @.@ 83 . 
 = = = 1954 – 55 West Indies tour = = = 
 Morris ' international farewell was the 1954 – 55 tour of the West Indies . Prior to the tour , Miller replaced him as Australian vice @-@ captain . He struck 157 against Jamaica in his first tour match , earning a recall to the Test team . He made 65 in the First Test victory in Kingston , Jamaica , before making his final Test century ( 111 ) in the drawn Second Test in Port of Spain , Trinidad . He made 44 and 38 in the Third Test win and then missed the Fourth Test with dysentery . He scored seven in his final Test innings in the Fifth Test , which Australia won by an innings to seal the series 3 – 0 . Morris ended the Test series with 266 runs at 44 @.@ 33 . In his final tour in Australian colours , Morris totalled 577 runs at 57 @.@ 45 in seven first @-@ class matches . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Returning to Sydney after the West Indian tour , Morris learned that his new wife Valerie had been diagnosed with breast cancer in his absence . She had concealed her illness until his return , fearing that it would distract him from his cricket . With his wife 's condition deteriorating over the following year despite the removal of a breast , Morris retired at the age of 33 , as he realised that his wife 's condition was terminal and that their marriage would soon be over . Morris scored centuries on his first first @-@ class appearances in four countries : England , South Africa , the West Indies and Australia , a record not equalled as of 1997 . In general , he was known for scoring centuries in his debut appearance at many grounds . His eight centuries against England was second only to Bradman . He was a popular player , highly lauded by Australian and English commentators for both his character , goodwill and ability . His childhood mentor O 'Reilly said that he was a " man worth knowing " , while Tyson called him " one of cricket 's patricians ... endowed with a genteel equanimity , without seeming aloof or less than cordial and friendly " . The English commentator John Arlott , known for rarely praising an Australian , said that Morris " was one of the best @-@ liked cricketers of all time – charming , philosophical and relaxed " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 With his wife 's death imminent , Morris organised the couple 's return to Britain with financial help from Hassett . He worked as a cricket reporter for London 's Daily Express during the 1956 Ashes tour while his wife was reunited with her family for the last time . She died soon after they returned to Australia at the end of the tour , aged just 33 . They had been married only 18 months . 
 In the wake of his personal loss , Morris , known for his sincerity and high personal values , received many offers of work and financial assistance . With a reference from English cricketer Doug Insole , Morris joined British engineering company George Wimpey for a few years . He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group Wormald International where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s . He was appointed to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years , eight of them as deputy chairman . During this time , the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected . In 1968 , Morris met and married his second wife Judith <unk> . He was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to sport . In late 1989 , Morris and his wife retired to the town of Cessnock in the Hunter Region , north of Sydney . He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching Test cricket although he refused to watch one @-@ day cricket , introduced after his playing days , due to his preference for tradition . 
 He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1992 . In 2001 , he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame alongside Bill Woodfull , the fourteenth and fifteenth players to be inducted . In 2000 , he was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century . Morris was named as an opening batsman in Bradman 's selection of his greatest team in Test history . Bradman described him as the " best left @-@ hand option to open an innings " and characterised his temperament as " ideal " . Following the death of Sam Loxton in December 2011 , Morris became Australia 's oldest living Test cricketer , and after Norman Gordon 's death in 2014 he became the third oldest surviving Test cricketer . 
 Morris died on 22 August 2015 at the age of 93 . His former Australian teammate Neil Harvey , the last surviving Australian member of the " Invincibles " tour , paid tribute to him as " one of the best players this country has produced " and said that " you wouldn 't find a nicer bloke in the world " . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Morris was seen as an elegant and aggressive player , and is regarded alongside Clem Hill , Neil Harvey and Allan Border as one of Australia 's greatest left @-@ handed batsmen . Adept at playing against both pace and spin bowling , he was known for the variety of his shots on both sides of the wicket . Despite standing only five feet nine inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) , opponents spoke of his imposing appearance and his apparent air of complete composure at the crease . He had the ability to decide on his stroke early in the ball 's flight and employed an unusual defensive technique , shuffling across the stumps to get behind the ball . This created a perception that he was vulnerable to leg before wicket decisions and was vulnerable to losing his leg stump . <unk> placement allowed him to pierce the gaps between fielders , and he was especially noted for his cover driving , square cutting and on @-@ driving . Most of all , he was known for his back foot play , especially his pulling and hooking . According to cricket writer Ray Robinson , " no other post @-@ war batsman has rivalled his smashing counter @-@ attacks on bowling swift enough to give the toughest team the tremors … A menacing bouncer colliding with Morris ' bat was like a rocky fist against an iron jaw . " While many batsmen tended to evade deliveries aimed at the head , Morris was known for standing and hooking . In one interstate match , Miller , one of the world 's leading pacemen , bowled an entire eight @-@ ball over of bouncers . Morris hooked the five balls that he faced in the over for 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 and 3 . 
 According to Bradman , Morris ' success was due to his powerful wrists and forearms . Bradman interpreted Morris ' unorthodox methods — he often defended with his bat not straight — as a sign of genius . Ian Johnson believed that Morris ' idiosyncratic technique was a strength , as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition . Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day , Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives , backing his ability to clear the infield . Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War . Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis of the length of the ball , and as a result , he quickly and decisively moved forward or back . Morris ' productivity declined in the latter half of his career , something he put down to the break @-@ up of his opening pairing with Barnes . Morris ' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs , leading him to remark that " When <unk> [ Barnes ] went , I lost a lot of support because he 'd always get ones . " Morris was also known for his unselfishness , often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix @-@ ups while running between wickets , and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average . 
 However , Morris was regarded as the " bunny " of English medium pace bowler Alec Bedser , who dismissed him 20 times in first @-@ class cricket , including 18 times in Test matches . Bedser dismissed Morris more than any other bowler . Typically , Bedser took Morris ' wicket with deliveries pitched on leg stump that moved across him . This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics ; Morris ' average was 57 @.@ 42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser , and more than sixty in the 46 first @-@ class innings when the two met . In their last meeting at Test level in 1954 – 55 , Morris scored 153 . The pair were very close friends , and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris ' performance against him . Bedser noted Morris ' gracious demeanour despite his struggles , recalling an incident during the 1950 – 51 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English . Instead of thinking of his difficulties against Bedser , Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times . Morris stated that " Bob Berry hasn 't got a wicket and John Warr hasn 't taken a catch all tour so I 'll see what can be done . " Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry 's bowling without adding to his score . 
 Morris took only two wickets in Tests , one of them Bedser in 1953 ; he was rarely used as a bowler and was a reliable catcher . Despite his success , he was a pessimist who claimed to be low on self @-@ confidence , saying that he was always surprised not to be dismissed for a duck . In an interview in 2000 , he said , " I wish I had the confidence of some of the players today . " After reaching Test cricket , Morris began smoking to relieve tension ahead of an innings .

 Jackie Ray Slater ( born May 27 , 1954 ) is a retired National Football League offensive tackle who played his entire 20 @-@ year career with the Rams organization , playing 19 seasons for the Rams in Los Angeles ( 1976 – 1994 ) and one season for the Rams in St. Louis in 1995 . 
 A graduate of Jackson State University , he was a teammate of Walter Payton . Drafted in the third round of the 1976 NFL Draft , Slater seldom played his first few years before starting in 1979 . Known as the most consistent member of one of the most potent offensive lines in NFL history , Slater was selected to seven Pro Bowls and broke a record for most seasons with one team . His jersey number was retired and he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001 . 
 Slater is currently the offensive line coach at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa , California . His son , Matthew Slater , is currently a special teams ace for the New England Patriots .

 Slater was born in Jackson , Mississippi . He was the first member of his family to attend a desegregated school while growing up at Wingfield High School . He attended Jackson State University where he played alongside Walter Payton for three years , who personally recruited him to the university . Slater later credited Payton as the player who " taught him to compete in practice " , seeing how Payton often played with an injured elbow . He was a letterman in football and was selected to the Southwestern Athletic Conference All @-@ Star Game three times , and as a senior , he was a First @-@ team All – Black America selection , and was named an All @-@ American selection by the Pittsburgh Courier . After his senior season , he was invited to participate in the College All @-@ Star Game .

 Although used primarily as a backup and special teams player during his first three seasons , Slater became the starting right tackle in 1979 . That year the Rams went to Super Bowl XIV , where he successfully defended L.C. Greenwood from getting a quarterback sack . In 1980 , he was a part of an offensive line that surrendered just 29 sacks and helped the Rams ’ offense finish second in the NFL in total yards gained with 6 @,@ 006 . In 1983 , he and the Rams offensive line demonstrated their versatility when they allowed a league @-@ low 23 sacks while also paving the way for Eric Dickerson ’ s rookie rushing record of 1 @,@ 808 yards . In 1985 , he was the key blocker for Dickerson as he ran for a playoff record 248 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys in a NFL divisional game . During a 1989 playoff game , Slater prevented Reggie White , who was considered the premium pass rusher in the NFL , from sacking the quarterback , a game that Slater later became best known for . Slater was considered by critics the most consistent lineman on one of the best offensive lines in the NFL , which also included Pro Bowlers Kent Hill and Dennis Harrah and was <unk> for his " work ethic and leadership skills " when he was inducted to the Hall of Fame . He retired after the 1995 season when injuries reduced him to playing one game the entire year . He is the only player in league history to play for one single team / franchise in three different cities ( Los Angeles 1976 @-@ 1979 , Anaheim 1980 @-@ 1994 , and St. Louis 1995 ) 
 He was voted the National Football League Players Association NFC Offensive Lineman of the year four times — 1983 , 1986 , 1987 , and 1989 and was the Athletes in Action / Bart Starr Award winner after the 1995 season . Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995 , a then @-@ record for offensive lineman ( broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season ) . He was the first player to play 20 seasons for one team , later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all @-@ time . He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career , during which seven running backs reached for over 1 @,@ 000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls . Former teammate Jim Everett stated " Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days " . He was Dickerson 's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999 . In 2001 , Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame . Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said " Jackie Slater didn 't want to just beat you , he wanted to dominate you . That 's what made him the player that he was .

 = John of Tours = 
 John of Tours or John de Villula ( died 1122 ) was a medieval Bishop of Wells in England who moved the diocese seat to Bath . He was a native of Tours and was King William I of England 's doctor before becoming a bishop . After his consecration as bishop , he was either given or purchased Bath Abbey , a rich monastery , and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells , to the abbey . He rebuilt the church at Bath , building a large cathedral that no longer survives . He gave a large library to his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath . Not noted for his scholarship , he died suddenly in 1122 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 A native of Tours , John was an Angevin @-@ French physician to King William I of England , being present at the king 's deathbed in 1087 . William of Malmesbury , the medieval chronicler , called him " a very skilled doctor , not in theoretical knowledge , but in practice . " He had been a priest of Tours before becoming doctor to King William . He seems to have learned his medical skills not in a school , but was considered a skilled doctor . The name " de Villula " first appears in 1691 , and is not a contemporary name . It resulted from a misreading of John 's name in his episcopal profession . 
 = = Bishop of Bath = = 
 John was appointed Bishop of Wells in 1088 by King William II " Rufus " , the son and successor to William I. The bishop 's consecration was in July , at Canterbury by Archbishop Lanfranc , the Archbishop of Canterbury . He probably owed his appointment to the king 's desire to honour his father 's physician . 
 Shortly after his consecration , John bought Bath Abbey 's grounds from the king , as well as the city of Bath itself . Whether John paid Rufus for the town or whether he was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear . The abbey had recently lost its abbot <unk> , and was according to Domesday Book the owner of large estates in and near the town . It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery . By acquiring the town of Bath , John also acquired the mint that was in the town . In 1090 he transferred the seat , or administration , of the bishopric to Bath Abbey , probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see . Bath was a rich abbey , and Wells had always been a poor diocese . By taking over the abbey , John increased his episcopal revenues . William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey , but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns . When John moved his episcopal seat , he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter , turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons located at Wells that had previously served the diocese . 
 John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath , which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray 's rebellions . As rebuilt , it was only surpassed in size by the cathedrals at Ely , Norwich and Winchester . The present Bath Cathedral is not the building that John built , and occupies only a fraction of the space that John 's building encompassed . He also reformed the administration of his diocese , setting up archdeacons and organising a court for hearing ecclesiastical cases . His efforts to reform his diocese led to his cathedral chapter 's complaining of their treatment , which John seems to have ignored . At Wells , he was accused of destroying the community of canons there , which had been created by his predecessor . 
 In 1092 , he helped with the consecration of Old Sarum Cathedral , although its roof was almost immediately damaged by a storm and required decades of repair . In 1094 , he performed the same service for Battle Abbey . After the accession of King Henry I of England , John received a confirmation of the grant of the city of Bath , paying 500 pounds of silver for the verification . In 1102 , John secured from King Henry the right to hold fairs at Bath on the feast day of the cathedral 's patron saint , Saint Peter . He gave an extensive library to the cathedral at Bath , and eventually the monks there became reconciled to him . John , however , continued to hold most of the old abbey 's manors himself , rather than using them for the support of the monks . 
 = = Investiture Controversy = = 
 John was one of the bishops that sided with King William against Anselm of Canterbury at the king 's Whitsun council in 1097 , one of early councils called during the Investiture Controversy in England . During the reign of King Henry I , who succeeded his brother King William in 1100 , John along with Robert Bloet , the Bishop of Lincoln , consecrated abbots who had been invested in office by the king . John attended Anselm 's reforming Council of London in 1102 , which debated and passed decrees to reform the clergy . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 John died in December 1122 and was buried in Bath Cathedral . He suffered a heart attack after dinner and died suddenly . Traditionally the date of his death is given as 29 December . 
 Under John , the monks of Bath became known for their scholarship , although he was not particularly noted for learning . William of <unk> claimed he was generous and affable , although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably . William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self @-@ restraint , but that his health was good and he lived to be old . At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use , but in 1106 he restored their lands to them . John 's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings as part of the movement of the see to Bath . A layman official of the diocese , Hildebert , was probably John 's brother ; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells , an inheritable office . John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert . Another relative , a nephew also named John , was named archdeacon in the diocese . 
 = Amargasaurus = 
 Amargasaurus ( / <unk> / ; " La Amarga lizard " ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous epoch ( 129 @.@ 4 – 122 @.@ 46 mya ) of what is now Argentina . The only known skeleton was discovered in 1984 and described in 1991 , forming the holotype specimen of the single species Amargasaurus cazaui . The skeleton is nearly complete , including a fragmentary skull , making Amargasaurus one of the best @-@ known sauropods from the Early Cretaceous . Amargasaurus was small for a sauropod , reaching 9 to 10 meters ( 30 to 33 feet ) in length . It sported two parallel rows of tall spines down its neck and back , taller than in any other known sauropod . It is unclear how these spines appeared in life — they could have supported skin sails or stuck out of the body as solitary structures supporting a keratinous sheath . They might have been used for display , combat , or defense . 
 Amargasaurus was discovered in sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation , which dates back to the Barremian and late Aptian of the Early Cretaceous epoch . It shared its environment with at least three other sauropod genera , which might have exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition . Amargasaurus probably fed at mid @-@ height , as shown by the orientation of its inner ear and the articulation of its neck vertebrae , which suggest a habitual position of the snout some 80 centimeters ( 31 inches ) above the ground and a maximum height of 2 @.@ 7 meters ( 8 @.@ 9 feet ) . Within the Sauropoda , Amargasaurus is closely related to the Late Jurassic genera Dicraeosaurus , Brachytrachelopan and Suuwassea . Together , these genera form the family Dicraeosauridae , which differ from other sauropods in showing very short necks and small body sizes . 
 = = Description = = 
 Amargasaurus was small for a sauropod , measuring 9 to 10 meters ( 30 to 33 feet ) in length and weighing approximately 2 @.@ 6 metric tons ( 2 @.@ 9 short tons ) . It followed the typical sauropod bauplan , with a long tail and neck , a small head , and a barrel @-@ shaped trunk supported by four column @-@ like legs . The neck of Amargasaurus was shorter than in most other sauropods , a common trait within the Dicraeosauridae . Measuring 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 feet ) in length , the neck corresponds for 136 % of the length of the dorsal vertebral column . This is comparable to Dicraeosaurus ( 123 % ) but greater than in the extremely short @-@ necked form Brachytrachelopan ( 75 % ) . The neck consisted of 13 cervical vertebrae , which were opisthocoelous ( convex at the front and hollow at the back ) , forming ball @-@ and @-@ socket joints with neighboring vertebrae . The trunk was made out of 9 dorsal and probably 5 fused sacral vertebrae . The foremost dorsals were opisthocoelous , while the remaining dorsals were <unk> ( flat on both ends ) . Robust transverse processes ( lateral projections connecting to the ribs ) indicate a strongly developed rib cage . The dorsal vertebrae of Amargasaurus and other dicraeosaurids lack pleurocoels , the deep lateral excavations that were characteristic for other sauropods . 
 The most striking feature of the skeleton were the extremely tall , upwardly projecting neural spines on the neck and anterior dorsal vertebrae . The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length , forming a double row . They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips . The tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck , where they reached 60 centimeters ( 24 inches ) on the 8th cervical . On the neck , they were bowed backwards , projecting above the adjacent vertebra . Greatly elongated spines continue along the last two dorsal vertebrae , the hip and foremost tail . However , in these regions the spines were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle @-@ shaped upper end . The pelvic region was relatively wide , judging from the long , laterally projecting transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae . The forelimbs are somewhat shorter than the hindlimbs , as in related sauropods . Most of the hand and foot bones are not preserved , but probably possessed five digits each as in all sauropods . 
 Only the rear part of the skull is preserved . It likely showed a <unk> , broad snout equipped with pencil @-@ like teeth , as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known . As in other dicraeosaurids , the external naris ( nostril opening ) was situated in the posterior half of the skull , diagonally above the eye socket , which was proportionally large . As in most other dinosaurs , the skull featured three additional openings ( fenestrae ) . The infratemporal fenestra , located below the eye socket , was long and narrow . Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra , which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side . This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles , where these openings were directed upwards , thus being visible only in top view . In front of the eye socket , the antorbital fenestra would have been located , although this region is not preserved . An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull , the so @-@ called parietal openings or <unk> . In other tetrapods , these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The only known skeleton ( MACN @-@ N 15 ) was discovered in February 1984 by Guillermo Rougier during an expedition led by the famous Argentine paleontologist José Bonaparte . This was the eighth expedition of the project " Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America " , which was supported by the National Geographic Society and initiated in 1975 with the aim to improve the at that time sparse knowledge of the Jurassic and Cretaceous tetrapod life of South America . The same excursion uncovered the nearly complete skeleton of the horned theropod Carnotaurus . The discovery site is located in the La Amarga Arroyo in the <unk> <unk> Department of Neuquén Province , some 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) south of <unk> . The skeleton stems from sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation , which dates to the Barremian through early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous , or around 130 to 120 million years ago . 
 The skeleton is reasonably complete and includes a partial skull . Sauropod skull bones are rarely found , and the Amargasaurus skull is only the second skull known from the Dicraeosauridae . Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position : The vertebral column of the neck and back , which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae , was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum . Of the skull , only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved . The sacrum , despite being partly eroded prior burial , is fairly complete . Most of the tail is missing , with three anterior , three middle , and one posterior vertebrae being preserved , along with fragments of several others . The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula ( shoulder blade ) and coracoid ( which sits on the lower end of the scapula ) , while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium ( the uppermost of the three pelvic bones ) . The limbs are equally fragmentary , with the manus ( hand ) and most of the pes ( foot ) missing . The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires . 
 The first , unofficial , mention of Amargasaurus as a new genus of dinosaur was published by Bonaparte in the 1984 Italian book <unk> Orme dei Dinosauria . Here , the species was designated as Amargasaurus <unk> , which was changed into Amargasaurus cazaui in the official description published several years later . The official description , written in Spanish , has been published in 1991 by Leonardo Salgado and Bonaparte in the <unk> scientific journal <unk> . The name Amargasaurus alludes to the site of discovery , the La Amarga Arroyo . La Amarga is also the name of a nearby town , as well as the geologic formation the remains were recovered from . The word <unk> itself is Spanish for " bitter , " while sauros is Greek for " lizard . " The one species ( A. cazaui ) is named in honor of Luis <unk> , a geologist with the YPF oil company , which at the time was state @-@ owned . In 1983 , <unk> informed Bonaparte 's team about the paleontological significance of the La Amarga Formation , leading to the discovery of the skeleton . One year later , Salgado and Jorge O. Calvo published a second paper focussing on the description of the skull . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Amargasaurus is classified as a member of the Dicraeosauridae , a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea . Currently , this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera . These are , besides Amargasaurus cazaui , the species Dicraeosaurus <unk> and Dicraeosaurus <unk> from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania , and the recently described Brachytrachelopan <unk> from the Late Jurassic of Argentina . Whitlock ( 2011 ) argued that Suuwassea <unk> from the Morrison Formation of the United States has to be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well , which was supported by subsequent studies . Amargasaurus is the only named <unk> from the Cretaceous ; however , an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous . Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus . Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family . A recent analysis by Tschopp et al . ( 2015 ) came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae . 
 Together with the Diplodocidae and the Rebbachisauridae , the Dicraeosauridae is nested inside the Diplodocoidea . All members of the Diplodocoidea are characterized by their box @-@ shaped snout and narrow teeth restricted to the <unk> portion of the jaws . Both the Dicraeosauridae and the Diplodocidae are characterized by bifurcated neural spines of the cervical and dorsal vertebra . In the Dicraeosauridae , the bifurcated neural spines were strongly elongated , a trend reaching its extreme in Amargasaurus . 
 The following cladogram follows an analysis by Tschopp et al . ( 2015 ) : 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Vertebral spines = = = 
 Both the appearance of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines in life and their function remain elusive . Salgado and Bonaparte ( 1991 ) suggested the spines to represent defense weapons against predators , arguing that they taper towards their tips . Alternatively , they may had been used for display , either for the intimidation of rivaling conspecifics or for courtship . In a subsequently published skeletal reconstruction drawing , Salgado ( 1999 ) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath , which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines . The presence of some kind of covering , either of keratin or skin , is shown by a striation pattern on the surface of the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today 's bovids . 
 As pointed out by Jack Bailey ( 1997 ) , the spines resembled those of sail @-@ bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon . According to Bailey , Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail , which might have been used for display . Other than those of pelycosaurs , the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated , forming a double row along the neck and back . As the space between both rows was merely 3 to 7 centimeters ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 8 inches ) , the existence of two parallel sails seems unlikely . Instead , Bailey suggests the spines to represent a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin . American science writer Gregory Paul ( 2000 ) argued against the sail hypothesis , noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion , and that the spines were circular in cross @-@ section rather than flatted as is the case in sail @-@ bearing animals . The spines , if elongated by an keratinous sheath , could have been used as a weapon both against predators and conspecifics , as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck . He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound . 
 Daniela Schwarz and colleagues ( 2007 ) concluded that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac , which would have been connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system . In Dicraeosaurus , this air sac ( the so @-@ called <unk> diverticulum ) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines . In Amargasaurus however , the upper two thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin , restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one third of the spines . 
 Neural spines from the penultimate dorsal vertebra to the <unk> tail vertebrae still were strongly elongated , but different in structure , forming a single row of paddle @-@ shaped projections . According to Bailey , these projections resembled those of modern humped ungulates such as the bison , indicating the presence of a fleshy hump above the hips . Bailey suggested similar humps for other dinosaurs with strongly elongated neural spines , such as Spinosaurus and Ouranosaurus . 
 = = = Senses and posture = = = 
 Paulina Carabajal and colleagues ( 2014 ) <unk> @-@ scanned the skull , allowing for the generation of three @-@ dimensional models of both the cranial endocast ( the cast of the brain cavity ) and the inner ear . Using these models , the cranial endocast was shown to encompass 94 to 98 milliliters ( 0 @.@ 025 to 0 @.@ 026 U.S. gallons ) in volume . The inner ear was 30 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 2 inches ) tall and 22 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 87 inches ) wide . The lagena , the part containing the hair cells for hearing , was rather short , indicating that the sense of hearing would have been poorer in Amargasaurus than in other sauropods for which inner ears have been studied . 
 The first skeletal reconstructions show the skull in a near horizontal posture . Salgado ( 1999 ) argued that such a posture would have been anatomically impossible due to the elongated neural spines of the neck vertebrae . Instead , he envisaged the head in a nearly vertical orientation . The habitual orientation of the head usually is reflected by the orientation of the semicircular canals of the inner ear , which housed the sense of balance ( vestibular system ) . Using their three @-@ dimensional model of the inner ear , Carabajal and colleagues suggested that the snout faced downwards at an angle of ca . 65 ° relative to the horizontal . A similar value has recently been proposed for the related Diplodocus . The neutral posture of the neck can be approximated based on how the cervical vertebrae attached to each other . According to Carabajal and colleagues , the neck was gently sloping downwards , so that the snout would have rested some 80 cm above the ground in neutral posture . In reality , neck posture would have varied according to the respective activities of the animals . Raising of the neck , e.g. for reaching an alert position , would have been constricted by the elongated neural spines , not permitting heights greater than 270 cm . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Amargasaurus was quadrupedal ( moved on four legs ) , and probably was unable to rear on its hind legs . Salgado and Bonaparte ( 1991 ) suggested Amargasaurus to be a slow walker , as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short , a feature common to slow moving animals . This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña ( 1999 ) , who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of a rapid locomotion . During locomotion , leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments — the latter therefore represent a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal . The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy then those of today 's white rhinoceros , which is adapted to galloping . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 Amargasaurus stems from sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation , which is part of the Neuquén Basin and dates to the Barremian and late Aptian of the Early Cretaceous . Most vertebrate fossils , including Amargasaurus , have been found in the lowermost ( oldest ) part of the formation , the Puesto <unk> Member . This member is approximately 29 meters ( 95 feet ) in thickness and mainly composed of sandstones deposited by braided rivers . The Amargasaurus skeleton itself was recovered from a layer composed of sandy conglomerates . The sauropod fauna of the La Amarga Formation was diverse and included the basal rebbachisaurid <unk> , the titanosaur <unk> , and unnamed remains of basal <unk> . The high diversity suggests that different sauropod species exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition . Basal <unk> showed proportionally longer necks , longer forelimbs , and broader tooth crowns than <unk> and <unk> , suggesting greater feeding heights . Amargasaurus probably fed above ground level at heights of up to 2 @.@ 7 meters ( 8 @.@ 9 feet ) , as evidenced by the anatomy of its neck and inner ear . <unk> like <unk> presumably fed at ground @-@ level , while basal <unk> exploited food sources at higher levels . 
 Other dinosaurs of the La Amarga Formation include the stegosaur <unk> ; predatory dinosaurs include the small ceratosaur <unk> , and the presence of a large tetanuran is indicated by teeth . Other than dinosaurs , the formation is famous for the <unk> mammal <unk> , the only mammal known from the Early Cretaceous of South America . <unk> are present with the <unk> <unk> – the holotype of this genus was found in association with the Amargasaurus bones . 
 = Timor Leste Defence Force = 
 The Timor Leste Defence Force ( <unk> : Forcas Defesa Timor <unk> , Portuguese : Forças de Defesa de Timor Leste or <unk> @-@ FDTL , often F @-@ FDTL ) is the military body responsible for the defence of East Timor . The F @-@ FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions , a small naval component and several supporting units . 
 The F @-@ FDTL 's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats . It also has an internal security role , which overlaps with that of the <unk> Nacional de Timor Leste ( PNTL ) . This overlap has led to tensions between the services , which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F @-@ FDTL . 
 The F @-@ FDTL 's problems came to a head in 2006 when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions . The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F @-@ FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security . The F @-@ FDTL is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long @-@ term force development plan . 
 = = Role = = 
 The constitution of East Timor assigns the F @-@ FDTL responsibility for protecting East Timor against external attack . The constitution states that the F @-@ FDTL " shall guarantee national independence , territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the populations against any aggression or external threat , in respect for the constitutional order . " The constitution also states that the F @-@ FDTL " shall be non @-@ partisan and shall owe obedience to the competent organs of sovereignty in accordance with the Constitution and the laws , and shall not intervene in political matters . " The National Police of East Timor ( or PNTL ) and other civilian security forces are assigned responsibility for internal security . In practice the responsibilities of the F @-@ FDTL and PNTL were not clearly delineated , and this led to conflict between the two organisations . 
 The East Timorese Government has broadened the F @-@ FDTL 's role over time . As what have been designated " new missions " , the F @-@ FDTL has been given responsibility for crisis management , supporting the suppression of civil disorder , responding to humanitarian crises and facilitating co @-@ operation between different parts of the government . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ independence = = = 
 The F @-@ FDTL was formed from the national liberation movement guerrilla army known as FALINTIL ( Portuguese acronym for Forças Armadas de Libertação de Timor @-@ Leste or Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor ) . During the period before 1999 some East Timorese leaders , including the current President José Ramos @-@ Horta , proposed that a future East Timorese state would not have a military . The widespread violence and destruction that followed the independence referendum in 1999 and the need to provide employment to FALINTIL veterans led to a change in policy , however . Following the end of Indonesian rule , FALINTIL proposed the establishment of a large military of about 5 @,@ 000 personnel . 
 In mid @-@ 2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) invited a team from King 's College London to conduct a study of East Timor 's security force options . The team 's report identified three options for an East Timorese military . Option 1 was based on FALINTIL 's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 personnel , option 2 was a force of 1 @,@ 500 regulars and 1 @,@ 500 conscripts and option 3 was for a force of 1 @,@ 500 regulars and 1 @,@ 500 volunteer reservists . The study team recommended option 3 as being best suited to East Timor 's security needs and economic situation . This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and formed the basis of East Timor 's defence planning . The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor . The King 's College report has been criticised on the grounds that it led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its security needs may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force . 
 While East Timor 's decision to form a military has been criticised by some commentators , the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons . Critics of the F @-@ FDTL 's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government 's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL . While East Timor 's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat , they believe that it is necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression . The establishment of the F @-@ FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor . 
 = = = Formation of the F @-@ FDTL = = = 
 FALINTIL officially became F @-@ FDTL on 1 February 2001 . The first 650 members of the F @-@ FDTL were selected from 1 @,@ 736 former FALINTIL applicants and began training on 29 March . The FDTL 's 1st Battalion was established on 29 June 2001 and reached full strength on 1 December . Most members of the battalion were from East Timor 's eastern provinces . The 2nd Battalion was established in 2002 from a cadre of the 1st Battalion and was manned mainly by new personnel under the age of 21 who had not participated in the independence struggle . Due to the force 's prestige and relatively high pay , there were 7 @,@ 000 applications for the first 267 positions in the battalion . The F @-@ FDTL 's small naval component was established in December 2001 . The Australian UNTAET contingent provided most of the F @-@ FDTL 's training , and the United States equipped the force . 
 Some of the problems that have affected the F @-@ FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force . A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL 's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight . As a result , the selection was conducted , to a large degree , on the basis of applicants ' political allegiance . This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force 's public standing . Furthermore , UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents , administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military . These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002 . 
 The F @-@ FDTL gradually assumed responsibility for East Timor 's security from the UN peacekeeping force . The <unk> District was the first area to pass to the F @-@ FDTL in July 2002 . After further training the F @-@ FDTL took over responsibility for the entire country 's external security on 20 May 2004 , although some foreign peacekeepers remained in East Timor until mid @-@ 2005 . The F @-@ FDTL conducted its first operation in January 2003 when an army unit was called in to quell criminal activity caused by west Timorese militia gangs in the <unk> district . While the F @-@ FDTL operated in a " relatively disciplined and orderly fashion " during this operation , it illegally arrested nearly 100 people who were released 10 days later without being charged . 
 The F @-@ FDTL has suffered from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment . These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F @-@ FDTL 's role , poor conditions of service due to limited resources , tensions arising from FALINTIL 's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries . The F @-@ FDTL 's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed . The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale . 
 Tensions between the F @-@ FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the effectiveness of East Timor 's security services . During 2003 and 2004 , members of the police and F @-@ FDTL clashed on a number of occasions , and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004 . These tensions were caused by the overlapping roles of the two security services , differences of opinion between members of East Timor 's leadership and the fact that many members of the PNTL had served with the Indonesian National Police prior to East Timor 's independence while the F @-@ FDTL was based around FALINTIL . In 2003 , the East Timorese Government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons . The formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with the Government among some members of the F @-@ FDTL . 
 = = = 2006 crisis = = = 
 The tensions within the F @-@ FDTL came to a head in 2006 . In January , 159 soldiers from most units in the F @-@ FDTL complained in a petition to then President Xanana Gusmão that soldiers from the east of the country received better treatment than westerners . The ' petitioners ' received only a minimal response and left their barracks three weeks later , leaving their weapons behind . They were joined by hundreds of other soldiers and on 16 March the F @-@ FDTL 's commander , Brigadier General <unk> <unk> <unk> , dismissed 594 soldiers , which was nearly half of the force . The soldiers dismissed were not limited to the petitioners , and included about 200 officers and other ranks who had been chronically absent without leave in the months and years before March 2006 . 
 The crisis escalated into violence in late April . On 24 April , the petitioners and some of their supporters held a four @-@ day demonstration outside the Government Palace in Dili calling for the establishment of an independent commission to address their grievances . Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace . The PNTL failed to contain the protest and the Palace was badly damaged . After violence spread to other areas of Dili , Prime Minister Mari <unk> requested that the F @-@ FDTL help restore order . Troops with no experience in crowd control were deployed to Dili on 29 April and three deaths resulted . On 3 May Major Alfredo Reinado , the commander of the F @-@ FDTL 's military police unit , and most of his soldiers including Lt Gastão <unk> abandoned their posts in protest at what they saw as the army 's deliberate shooting of civilians . 
 Fighting broke out between the remnants of the East Timorese security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May . On 23 May Reinado 's rebel group opened fire on F @-@ FDTL and PNTL personnel in the Fatu Ahi area . On 24 May F @-@ FDTL personnel near the Force 's headquarters were attacked by a group of rebel police officers , petitioners and armed civilians . The attack was defeated when one of the F @-@ FDTL naval component 's patrol boats fired on the attackers . During the crisis the relationship between the F @-@ FDTL and PNTL had deteriorated further , and on 25 May members of the F @-@ FDTL attacked the PNTL 's headquarters , killing nine unarmed police officers . 
 As a result of the escalating violence the government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May . Peacekeepers began to arrive in Dili the next day and eventually restored order . A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155 @,@ 000 fled their homes . A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F @-@ FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended that they be prosecuted . 
 = = = Force development plans = = = 
 The 2006 crisis left the F @-@ FDTL " in ruins " . The F @-@ FDTL 's strength fell from 1 @,@ 435 in January 2006 to 715 in September and the proportion of westerners in the military fell from 65 percent to 28 percent . The F @-@ FDTL started a rebuilding process with support from several nations and the United Nations , but was still not ready to resume responsibility for East Timor 's external security two years after the crisis . 
 In 2004 the commander of the F @-@ FDTL formed a team , which included international contractors , to develop a long @-@ term strategic vision document for the military . This study was supported by the Australian Government . The resulting Force 2020 document was completed in 2006 and made public in 2007 . The document sets out an ' aspirational ' vision for the development of the F @-@ FDTL to 2020 and beyond and is of equivalent status to a defence white paper . It proposes expanding the military to a strength of 3 @,@ 000 regular personnel in the medium term through the introduction of conscription . It also sets longer @-@ term goals such as establishing an air component and purchasing modern weapons , such as anti @-@ armour weapons , armoured personnel carriers and missile boats , by 2020 . 
 The Force 2020 plan is similar to option 1 in the King 's College report . The King 's College study team strongly recommended against such a force structure , labelling it " unaffordable " and raising concerns over the impact of conscription upon East Timorese society and military readiness . The team estimated that sustaining such a force structure would cost 2 @.@ 6 to 3 @.@ 3 percent of East Timor 's annual gross domestic product and would " represent a heavy burden on the East Timor economy " . Moreover , the Force 2020 plan may not be realistic or suitable as it appears to emphasise military expansion to counter external threats over spending on other government services and internal security and outlines ideas such as the long @-@ term ( ~ 2075 ) development of space forces . 
 While the Force 2020 plan has proven controversial , it appears to have been adopted by the East Timorese government . The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as unaffordable and in excess of East Timor 's needs . East Timorese President José Ramos @-@ Horta defended the plan , however , arguing that its adoption will transform the F @-@ FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor 's sovereignty and contributing to the nation 's stability . East Timorese defence officials have also stressed that Force 2020 is a long @-@ term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years . 
 The repercussions of the 2006 crisis continue to be felt . On 11 February 2008 , a group of rebels led by Alfredo Reinado attempted to kill or kidnap President Ramos @-@ Horta and Prime Minister Gusmão . Although Ramos @-@ Horta and one of his guards were badly wounded , these attacks were not successful and Reinado and another rebel were killed . A joint F @-@ FDTL and PNTL command was established to pursue the surviving rebels and the military and police have demonstrated a high degree of co @-@ operation during this operation . The joint command was disbanded on 19 June 2008 . While the joint command contributed to the surrender of many of Reinado 's associates , it has been alleged that members of this unit committed human rights violations . In June 2008 the Government offered to provide financial compensation to the petitioners who wished to return to civilian life . This offer was accepted , and all the petitioners returned to their homes by August that year . In May 2009 , the F @-@ FDTL accepted its first intake of recruits since the 2006 crisis . While the regional diversity of the 579 new recruits was generally much greater than that of the pre @-@ crisis intakes , 60 @.@ 3 percent of officer candidates were from the country 's eastern districts . From 2009 the F @-@ FDTL established platoon @-@ sized outposts to support the PNTL border police in the <unk> and <unk> border districts , and it has increasingly been deployed to undertake internal security tasks . From February to August 2010 , 200 members of the F @-@ FDTL were deployed to support PNTL operations against " Ninja " gangs . These troops undertook community engagement tasks , and were unarmed and not closely integrated with the PNTL efforts . 
 The F @-@ FDTL is still in the process of rebuilding from the events of 2006 . It remains under @-@ strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards . Tensions within the F @-@ FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force . However , the East Timorese government places a high priority on re @-@ establishing the F @-@ FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country . In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans . 
 = = Command arrangements = = 
 The constitution of East Timor states that the president is the supreme commander of the defence force and has the power to appoint the F @-@ FDTL 's commander and chief of staff . The Council of Ministers and National Parliament are responsible for funding the F @-@ FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor 's security . <unk> José <unk> serves as the current minister of Defence and Security , and Julio Tomas Pinto is the Secretary of State for Defense . Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012 . A Superior Council for Defence and Security was established in 2005 to advise the president on defence and security policy and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel . The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister , the defence , justice , interior and foreign affairs ministers , the heads of the F @-@ FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament . The council 's role is not clear , however , and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F @-@ FDTL personnel in 2006 . A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor 's security sector . Major General <unk> Anan Timor is the current commander of the F @-@ FDTL , and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011 . 
 A small ministry of defence ( which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007 ) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F @-@ FDTL . A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F @-@ FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor 's defence policy up to at least 2004 . The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F @-@ FDTL also limited the extent to which foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F @-@ FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis . As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence ( including the F @-@ FDTL ) and security ( including the PNTL ) , each headed by their own secretary of state . At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry 's capacity with assistance from UNMIT , but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited the extent to which the ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector . Moreover , elements of the F @-@ FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time , and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny . 
 = = Organisation = = 
 The F @-@ FDTL is organised into a headquarters , a land component , a naval component and supporting units . When <unk> <unk> <unk> moved into politics , the two most senior officers in the Defence Force became Major General <unk> Anan Timor as CDF and Brigadier General Meno <unk> as Vice Chief of Defence Force . The supporting units include a logistics support company and a military police platoon . East Timor does not have an air force and the F @-@ FDTL does not currently operate any aircraft . Following its establishment the F @-@ FDTL also had the " largest and most sophisticated " human intelligence network in East Timor , which was based on the clandestine resistance reporting networks built up during the Indonesian occupation . However , in May 2008 the national parliament legislated to place the F @-@ <unk> 's intelligence branch under the authority of the head of the National Information Service . 
 The F @-@ FDTL has an authorised strength of 1 @,@ 500 regular personnel and 1 @,@ 500 reservists . It has never reached these totals as funding shortfalls have prevented the reserve component from being formed and the Army 's two regular battalions have remained under @-@ strength . While all the F @-@ FDTL 's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force 's composition has changed over time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force 's narrow age requirement . After the F @-@ FDTL 's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18 , including women . Few women have joined the F @-@ FDTL , however , and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female . 
 = = = Army = = = 
 When initially established , the F @-@ FDTL land force comprised two light infantry battalions , each with an authorised strength of 600 personnel . Each battalion has three rifle companies , a support company and a headquarters company . Although the army is small , the guerrilla tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers and it has the potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion . The Army 's current doctrine is focused on low @-@ intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter @-@ insurgency tasks . Most of the force 's training and operations are conducted at the section level , and company or battalion @-@ sized exercises are rare . 
 The army 's two battalions were located in separate bases . The 1st Battalion is based at <unk> , with a contingent in the seaside coastline village of Laga . The 2nd Battalion is stationed at the Nicolau Lobato Training Centre near <unk> . Almost all of the 2nd Battalion 's soldiers were dismissed during the 2006 crisis . The 2011 edition of Jane 's Sentinel put the total strength of the Army at 1 @,@ 300 . 
 Logistics and service support is provided through Headquarters F @-@ FDTL in Dili . There is also a military police platoon that polices the F @-@ FDTL and performs traditional policing tasks , resulting in conflicting roles with the PNTL . The military police have also been responsible for presidential security since February 2007 . In 2010 the United States Embassy in Dili reported that the F @-@ FDTL also planned to raise two engineer squadrons during that year ; these two units were to have a total strength of 125 personnel . 
 The F @-@ FDTL is armed only with small arms and does not have any crew @-@ served weapons . The 2007 edition of Jane 's Sentinel stated that the F @-@ FDTL had the following equipment in service : 1 @,@ 560 M16 rifles and 75 <unk> grenade launchers , 75 FN Minimi squad automatic weapons , 8 sniper rifles and 50 .45 <unk> pistols . A further 75 <unk> were to be ordered at that time . The majority of the F @-@ FDTL 's weapons were donated by other countries . An assessment of East Timor 's security forces published by the Centre for International Governance Innovation in 2010 stated that " F @-@ FDTL weapons management and control systems , while superior to that of PNTL , are underdeveloped " . 
 = = = Naval component = = = 
 The naval component of the F @-@ FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz @-@ class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy . Its establishment was not supported by the King 's College study team , the UN , or East Timor 's other donor countries on the grounds that East Timor could not afford to operate a naval force . The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and border protection patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the <unk> enclave remains open . All of the force 's warships are based at Hera Harbour , which is located a few kilometres east of Dili . Under the Force 2020 plan the naval component may eventually be expanded to a light patrol force equipped with corvette @-@ sized ships and landing craft . 
 On 12 April 2008 East Timor signed a contract for two new Chinese @-@ built 43 @-@ metre Type @-@ 62 class patrol boats . These ships were to replace the Albatroz @-@ class vessels and to be used to protect East Timor 's fisheries . The contract for the ships also involved 30 to 40 East Timorese personnel being trained in China . The two new patrol boats arrived from China in June 2010 , and were commissioned as the Jaco @-@ class on the eleventh of the month . In November 2010 it was reported that East Timor would order a further two patrol boats from South Korea . In the event , three ex @-@ Republic of Korea Navy Chamsuri class patrol boats were donated , and these entered service with the naval component on 26 September 2011 . The East Timorese government also ordered two fast patrol boats from the Indonesian company PT Pal in March 2011 for the price of $ <unk> million . 
 Reports on the naval component 's strength are contradictory ; while the 2011 – 2012 edition of Jane 's Fighting Ships states that 150 personnel are under training , the 2013 edition of the IISS Military Balance lists the naval component 's size as 80 personnel . The 2011 edition of Jane 's Sentinel put the strength of the naval component at 250 ; this source also stated that recruitment for an approximately 60 @-@ person strong marine unit began in 2011 from existing naval component personnel , members of the Army and civilians . The marines will serve as a special operations force .

 The F @-@ FDTL 's budget for 2015 is $ <unk> million . The Ministry of Defence and Security and Secretariat of State for Defence are funded separately from the F @-@ FDTL , and were allocated $ <unk> million and $ <unk> million respectively in 2015 . The total expenditure on defence during 2014 was $ <unk> million , which was equivalent to 2 @.@ 4 percent of gross domestic product . 
 Most of the F @-@ FDTL 's weapons and other equipment have been provided by foreign donors , and this is likely to remain the case in the future . The East Timor government has used some of the revenue it earns from the country 's oil and gas sector to purchase military equipment , however . No military production currently takes place in East Timor . 
 Funding shortfalls have constrained the development of the F @-@ FDTL . The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the <unk> enclave and two reserve infantry battalions . These units formed an important part of the King 's College report 's option 3 force structure and their absence may have impacted on East Timor 's defence policy . As of 2011 the government was yet to announce what , if any , reserve units would be formed , though provisions for such units had been included in legislation .

 While the UN was reluctant to engage with the F @-@ FDTL , several bilateral donors have assisted the force 's development . Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F @-@ FDTL since it was established , and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F @-@ FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security . Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal . China provided US $ 1 @.@ 8 million in aid to the F @-@ FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed to build a new US $ 7 million headquarters for the force in late 2007 . East Timor is one of Brazil 's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F @-@ FDTL 's military police unit ( <unk> Mission ) . The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F @-@ FDTL through the State Department 's International Military Education and Training Program . While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid , this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis . Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F @-@ FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills . As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F @-@ FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission in Liberia . In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia 's Pacific Patrol Boat Program . 
 East Timor and Indonesia have sought to build friendly relations since 2002 . While movements of people and drug smuggling across their international border has caused tensions , both countries have worked with the UN to improve the security situation in the region . The East Timorese and Indonesian governments signed a defence agreement in August 2011 which aims to improve co @-@ operation between their national militaries . The Timor Leste @-@ Indonesia Defense Joint Committee was also established at this time to monitor the agreement 's implementation . 
 East Timor ratified the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty , Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Chemical Weapons Convention in 2003 . The East Timorese Government has no plans to acquire nuclear , biological or chemical weapons . The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty , which bans anti @-@ personnel mines , in 2003 .

 = Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe , BWV 22 = 
 Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe ( Jesus gathered the twelve to Himself ) , BWV 22 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach composed for Quinquagesima , the last Sunday before Lent . Bach composed it as an audition piece for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig and first performed it there on 7 February 1723 . 
 The work , which is in five movements , begins with a scene from the Gospel reading in which Jesus predicts his suffering in Jerusalem . The unknown poet of the cantata text took the scene as a starting point for a sequence of aria , recitative , and aria , in which the contemporary Christian takes the place of the disciples , who do not understand what Jesus is telling them about the events soon to unfold , but follow him nevertheless . The closing chorale is a stanza from Elisabeth Cruciger 's hymn " Herr Christ , der einig Gotts Sohn " . The music is scored for three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir , oboe , strings and continuo . The work shows that Bach had mastered the composition of a dramatic scene , an expressive aria with obbligato oboe , a recitative with strings , an exuberant dance , and a chorale in the style of his predecessor in the position as Thomaskantor , Johann Kuhnau . Bach directed the first performance of the cantata during a church service , together with another audition piece , Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn , BWV 23 . He performed the cantata again on the last Sunday before Lent a year later , after he had taken up office . 
 The cantata shows elements which became standards for Bach 's Leipzig cantatas and even the Passions , including a " frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative " , " the fugal setting of biblical words " and " the biblical narrative ... as a dramatic scena " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background , Mühlhausen , Weimar and Köthen = = = 
 As far as we know , the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708 . He was employed as an organist there , but he occasionally composed cantatas , mostly for special occasions . The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns , such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich , Herr , zu dir , BWV 131 ( a psalm setting ) , and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 . 
 Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co @-@ reigning dukes in Saxe @-@ Weimar , Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August . He initially concentrated on the organ , composing major works for the instrument , including the Orgelbüchlein , the Toccata and Fugue in D minor , BWV 565 , and the Prelude and Fugue in E major , BWV 566 . He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714 , an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche . The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig , sei willkommen , BWV 182 , for Palm Sunday , Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday , and Erschallet , ihr Lieder , BWV 172 , for Pentecost . Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet , Salomo Franck , they contain recitatives and arias . When Johann Samuel Drese , the Kapellmeister ( director of music ) , died in 1716 , Bach hoped in vain to become his successor . Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold , Prince of Anhalt @-@ Köthen . However , the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience . He was released on 2 December 1717 . 
 In Köthen , Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself . The court was Calvinist , therefore Bach 's work from this period was mostly secular , including the orchestral suites , the cello suites , the sonatas and partitas for solo violin , and the Brandenburg Concertos . He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year 's Day and the prince 's birthday , including Die Zeit , die Tag und Jahre macht , BWV 134a . He later parodied some of them as church cantatas without major changes , for example Ein Herz , das seinen Jesum <unk> weiß , BWV 134 . 
 = = = Audition in Leipzig = = = 
 Bach composed his cantata as part of his application for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig , the official title being Cantor et Director <unk> ( Cantor and Director of Music ) . As cantor , he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches , the main churches Thomaskirche ( St. Thomas ) and the Nikolaikirche ( St. Nicholas ) , but also the Neue Kirche ( New Church ) and the Peterskirche ( St. Peter ) . As director of music , the Thomaskantor was Leipzig 's " senior musician " , responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages . Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche . The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722 . Bach was interested , mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig : " ... but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally ( particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [ university ] studies ) I cast my lot , in the name of the Lord , and made my journey to Leipzig , took my examination , and then made the change of position . " 
 = = = Audition in Leipzig = = = 
 By August 1722 , the town council had already chosen Georg Philipp Telemann as Kuhnau 's successor , but he declined in November . In a council meeting on 23 November , seven candidates were evaluated , but no agreement was reached on whether to prefer a candidate for academic teaching abilities or musical performance . The first council document with Bach named as a candidate dates from 21 December , together with Christoph Graupner . Of all candidates , Bach was the only one without a university education . 
 The decision to invite Bach was made by the council on 15 January 1723 . The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each , while other candidates were requested to show only one . Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service . Graupner 's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany , 17 January 1723 . Two days before the event , the town council already agreed to offer him the position . 
 Christoph Wolff assumes that Bach received an invitation for the audition together with the texts , probably prescribed to the candidates and drawn from a printed collection , only weeks before the date . In Köthen Bach composed two cantatas on two different themes from the prescribed Gospel for the Sunday , Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn , BWV 23 , on the topic of healing the blind near Jericho and Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe about Jesus announcing his suffering , which the disciples do not understand . 
 Bach had to travel to Leipzig early because he was not familiar with the location and the performers . Wolff assumes that Bach was in Leipzig already on 2 February for the Marian feast of Purification when candidate Georg Balthasar Schott presented his audition piece at the Nikolaikirche . Bach brought the scores and some parts , but additional parts had to be copied in Leipzig by students of the Thomasschule . Bach led the first performance of the two audition cantatas on 7 February 1723 as part of a church service at the Thomaskirche , this cantata before the sermon , and Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn after the sermon . The score of BWV 22 bears the note " This is the Leipzig audition piece " ( Das ist das Probe @-@ <unk> für Leipzig ) . 
 Wolff notes that Bach employed the three lower voices in BWV 22 and the upper three voices in BWV 23 , and presents a list of the different composition techniques Bach employed in the two audition cantatas ; they displayed " a broad and highly integrated spectrum of ... vocal art " . 
 A press review reads : " On Sunday last in the morning the Hon. Capellmeister of Cöthen , Mr. Bach , gave here his test at the church of St. Thomas 's for the hitherto vacant <unk> , the music of the same having been amply praised on that occasion by all knowledgeable persons ... " . 
 Bach left Leipzig without hope for the position because it had been offered to Graupner , but he was not dismissed by his employer , Ernst @-@ Ludwig of Hesse @-@ Darmstadt . After a meeting on 9 April 1723 , with incomplete documentation containing " ... since the best could not be obtained , a mediocre one would have to be accepted ... " , Bach received an offer to sign a preliminary contract . 
 = = = Assuming the position = = = 
 Bach assumed the position of Thomaskantor on 30 May 1723 , the first Sunday after Trinity , performing two ambitious cantatas in 14 movements each : Die Elenden sollen essen , BWV 75 , followed by Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes , BWV 76 . They form the beginning of his attempt to create several annual cycles of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year . 
 He performed Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe again on 20 February 1724 , as a printed libretto shows , and probably did so again in later years . 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = Occasion and words = = = 
 Bach composed his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Quinquagesima which Bach knew as Estomihi , the last Sunday before Lent . In the city of Leipzig , tempus clausum was observed during Lent , therefore it was the last Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciation , Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians , " praise of love " ( 1 Corinthians 13 : 1 – 13 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , healing the blind near Jericho ( Luke 18 : 31 – 43 ) . The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem , and that the disciples do not understand what he is saying . 
 The cantata text is the usual combination of Bible quotation , free contemporary poetry and as closing chorale a stanza from a hymn as an affirmation . An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for movement 1 , and wrote a sequence of aria , recitative and aria for the following movements . His poetic text places the Christian in general , including the listener at Bach 's time or any time , in the situation of the disciples : he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering , although he does not comprehend . The poetry ends on a prayer for " denial of the flesh " . The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger 's " Herr Christ , der einig Gotts Sohn " , intensifying the prayer , on a melody from the Lochamer @-@ Liederbuch . 
 Stylistic comparisons with other works by Bach suggest that the same poet wrote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantatas which Bach performed when taking up his office . The poetry for the second aria has an unusually long first section , which Bach handled elegantly by repeating only part of it in the da capo . 
 = = = Scoring and structure = = = 
 The cantata has five movements and is scored for three vocal soloists ( an alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir ( SATB ) , and for a Baroque orchestra of an oboe ( Ob ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) and basso continuo . The duration is given as c . 20 minutes . 
 In the following table of movements , the scoring , divided in voices , winds and strings , follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The continuo group is not listed , because it plays throughout .

 The text of the first movement , " Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe " ( Jesus gathered the Twelve to Himself ) is a quotation of two verses from the prescribed Gospel for the Sunday ( Luke 18 : 31 – 43 ) . The movement is a scene with different actors , narrated by the Evangelist ( tenor ) , in which Jesus ( bass , as the vox Christi or voice of Christ ) and his disciples ( the chorus ) interact . An " ever @-@ ascending " instrumental ritornello " evokes the image of the road of suffering embodied by going up to Jerusalem " . The Evangelist begins the narration ( Luke 18 : 31 ) . Jesus announces his future suffering in Jerusalem , Sehet , wir <unk> <unk> gen Jerusalem ( " Behold , we go up to Jerusalem " ) . He sings , while the ritornello is played several times . After another repeat of the ritornello as an interlude , a choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples , following verse 34 from the Gospel ( Luke 18 : 34 ) : Sie aber <unk> der <unk> ( " However they understood nothing " ) . The voices are first accompanied only by the continuo , then doubled by the other instruments . Bach marks the voices in the autograph score as " <unk> " for the first section and " ripienists " when the instruments come in . 
 The movement is concluded by an instrumental postlude . The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the fugue deviates from the " traditional alternating of tonic and dominant entries ... as a rather abstruse indication of the lack of clarity and expectation amongst the disciples , Bach is hinting at this in musical terms by having each voice enter on a different note , B @-@ flat , F , C and G and briefly touching upon various related keys . The music is , as always , lucid and focussed but the departure from traditional fugal procedure sends a fleeting message to those who appreciate the subtleties of the musical processes " . 
 The musicologist Richard D. P. Jones points out that " the biblical narrative is set as a dramatic scena worthy of the Bach Passions " and that the " vivid drama of that movement has no real counterpart in Bach 's Cycle I cantatas . " 
 = = = = 2 = = = = 
 In the first aria , " Mein Jesu , ziehe mich nach dir " ( " My Jesus , draw me after You " ) , the alto voice is accompanied by an obbligato oboe , which expressively intensifies the text . 
 An aria is , according to Johann Mattheson in Der <unk> Capellmeister ( Part II , chapter 13 , paragraph 10 ) , " correctly described as a well @-@ composed song , which has its own particular key and meter , is usually divided into two parts , and concisely expresses a great affection . Occasionally it closes with a repetition of the first part , occasionally without it . " 
 In this aria , an individual believer requests Jesus to make him follow , even without comprehending where and why . Mincham observes a mood or affekt of " deep involvement and pensive commitment " , with the oboe creating " an aura of suffering and a sense of struggling and reaching upwards in search of something indefinable in a way that only music can suggest . "

 The recitative " Mein Jesu , ziehe mich , so werd ich laufen " ( " My Jesus , draw me , then I will run " ) is not a simple secco recitative , but is accompanied by the strings and leans towards an arioso , especially near the end . It is the first movement in a major mode , and illustrates in rapid runs the motion and the running mentioned .

 The second aria , " Mein alles in allem , mein ewiges Gut " ( " My all in all , my eternal good " ) , again with strings , is a dance @-@ like movement in free da capo form , A B A ' . The unusually long text , of four lines for the A section and two for the B section , results in Bach 's solution to repeat the end of the first line ( my eternal good ) after all text of A , and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A ' , thus ending A and A ' the same way . In this modified repeat , the voice holds a long note on the word Friede ( " peace " ) , after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo . The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the <unk> character of the music , reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas . Mincham describes : " Bach 's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited " , and summarises : " The 3 / 8 time signature , symmetrical phrasing and rapid string <unk> combine to create a sense of a dance of abandonment . "

 The closing chorale is " Ertöt uns durch dein Güte " ( " Kill us through your goodness " or " Us mortify through kindness " ) , the fifth stanza of Elisabeth Cruciger 's " Herr Christ , der einig Gotts Sohn " . Its melody is based on one from Wolflein Lochamer 's Lochamer @-@ Liederbuch , printed in Nürnberg around 1455 . It first appears as a sacred tune in Johann Walter 's Wittenberg hymnal Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn ( 1524 ) . 
 The usual four @-@ part setting of the voices is brightened by continuous runs of the oboe and violin I. Isoyama thinks that Bach may have intentionally imitated the style of his predecessor Johann Kuhnau in the " elegantly flowing obbligato for oboe and first violin " . John Eliot Gardiner describes the movement 's bass line as a " walking bass as a symbol of the disciples ' journey to fulfilment . Mincham comments that Bach " chose to maintain the established mood of buoyancy and optimism with a chorale arrangement of almost unparalleled energy and gaiety " and concludes : 
 It would seem that Bach had not yet reached a conclusion , if indeed he ever did , as to the most appropriate way of utilising the chorales in his cantatas . Certainly the quiet , closing moments of reflection and introspection became the norm , particularly in the second cycle . But the chorale could , as here , act as a focus of bounding energy and positivity .

 Jones summarises : " The audition cantatas ... show Bach feeling his way towards a compromise between the progressive , opera @-@ influenced and the conservative , ecclesiastical styles . " He acknowledges the standard BWV 22 sets for later church cantatas : 
 " places an ecclesiastical frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative , a frame that would become a standard in the cantatas of cycle I. Moreover , the impressive opening movement incorporates two modes of treatment that would recur regularly during Cycle I and beyond : the fugal setting of biblical words and the use as the bass voice as vox Christi , as in traditional Passion settings . " 
 Isoyama points out : " BWV 22 incorporates dance rhythms , and is written with a modern elegance . " Mincham interprets Bach 's approach in both audition works as " a fair example of the range of music which is suitable for worship and from which others might learn " , explaining the " sheer range of forms and musical expression in these two cantatas " . Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir and wrote a diary on the project , comments on the disciples ' reaction ( " and they understood none of these things , neither knew they the things which were spoken " ) : 
 " One could read into this an ironic prophecy of the way Bach 's new Leipzig audience would react to his creative outpourings over the next twenty @-@ six years – in the absence , that is , of any tangible or proven signs of appreciation : neither wild enthusiasm , deep understanding nor overt dissatisfaction " .

 " Field Trip " is the twenty @-@ first episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on May 9 , 1999 in the United States and Canada , and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on July 18 . The episode was written by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan , from a story by Frank Spotnitz , and was directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Field Trip " earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 5 , being watched by 15 @.@ 40 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In the episode , the mysterious discovery of two skeletons leads Mulder and Scully to investigate . What they discover is a giant fungal growth that causes the agents to have two separate hallucinogenic episodes , which eventually merge into one shared hallucination . The two are saved thanks to an FBI rescue team led by Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) . 
 The episode was written to give the audience a chance to see Mulder and Scully 's separate viewpoints during their hallucinations . Members of the cast and crew , as well as reviewers , noted that the episode was a more serious version of the season five episode " Bad Blood " . In order to prepare for the episode , various information on mushrooms , fungi , human decomposition , and cave geology was researched by the series ' crew members . Furthermore , the episode has been critically examined due to its themes pertaining to alternate reality and its use of abductive reasoning . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Boone , North Carolina , Wallace ( David Denman ) and Angela Schiff ( Robyn Lively ) return home after a day out hiking in the fields . Angela gets a headache and , whilst taking a shower , thinks that she sees images of a yellow substance running down the walls . Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another 's arms but as the camera pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains in the same position in the middle of a field . FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) investigate and after closer examination of the bones , the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination . Mulder , believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights , heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner ( Jim Beaver ) to perform more tests . 
 As Mulder arrives in the fields , he inadvertently drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores . Mulder — unbeknownst to the viewer — begins to hallucinate . He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave , and the two claim they were abducted by aliens , who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons . Later , Scully arrives at Mulder 's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened . He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain . Scully , however , accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings . Eventually , after seeing the yellow substance , much like Angela saw , Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier , covered in the yellow secretion , being digested alive . 
 Meanwhile , Scully has discovered that the yellow substance mainly consists of organic material found in digestive juices , although it appears plant @-@ like . Arriving at the field , Scully accidentally steps on another mushroom , and begins hallucinating . Scully and the coroner start to look for Mulder , only to find his skeletal remains . Back at the coroner 's office , Scully identifies Mulder 's remains from his dental records but finds no evidence of the secretion on the skeleton . Later , at Mulder 's wake Mulder shows up , clearly alive . Suddenly , the wake congregation disappears . As Mulder and Scully discuss what has happened , they both begin to realize that they are still in the cave being digested by the substance while they are comatose ; somehow , they are sharing the same hallucination . As the realization occurs , they both awaken , deep in the cave and Mulder fights his way out of the ground dragging Scully behind him to safety . 
 Later , in Walter Skinner 's ( Mitch Pileggi ) office , Mulder begins to doubt once more that they are free at all , asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once the user knows they are hallucinating . Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by shooting Skinner in the chest ; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds . Once again , their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave . Mulder manages to stick his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner and a team of rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance . Once inside the ambulance , Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 " Field Trip " was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz , who described the writing process as " an experience " . The script went through several phases ; originally , the script was supposed to feature Mulder trapped in a cave with a mysterious monster . Then , the script was changed so that both Mulder and Scully would be trapped in the cave . Finally , the story was altered so that both Mulder and Scully only believed that they two were trapped in a cave , with only Mulder beginning to realize what was actually going on . 
 Spotnitz noted that the episode 's conceit got many crew members excited : " We 'd never really done an X @-@ Files like this . We could explore Mulder 's and Scully 's differences by seeing the extremes of their two hallucinations — a serious version of what we did comically last season in ' Bad Blood ' " . This presented an opportunity for Mulder to confront his partner with the fact that he is normally right , resulting in a response from Scully , affirming the fact . 
 Spotnitz called the episode a " wonderful mind game " but was worried that the convoluted story and pace would confuse the viewer . In order to placate these concerns , the teleplay was assigned to be finalized by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan . Once the script was finished , Spotnitz felt the story had become much more understandable ; he was particularly pleased with the way Shiban and Gilligan showed Mulder and Scully stepping on the mushrooms as a way to subtly cue their initial exposure to the hallucinogenic mushroom . Gilligan noted that " another really important thing we did was making sure that the audience didn 't think that Mulder and Scully weren 't really in jeopardy — that it was all a dream , like that whole season of Dallas a few years back . That 's why we made sure they realized that the goo from the mushroom would kill them " . 
 = = = Research , filming , and effects = = = 
 Lee Smith , a researcher for the series , consulted with researchers at the body farm , a 30 @-@ acre facility operated by the University of Tennessee 's Department of Anthropology . The facility buried human body parts from donated cadavers and studied the different conditions in which human bodies decompose . 
 Special effects coordinator John Vulich was tasked with designing " spidery , eight @-@ foot tall " fiberglass mushrooms . Production designer Corey Kaplan wanted Vulich to design the mushrooms to look " organic and earthbound " as opposed to " alien " . Members of the art department consulted various geological text books to properly create the stalagmites and stalactites for the cave scenes . Once the pods and cave set were finished , they were moved to a sound stage on the Fox Studio lots . The opening to the cave was filmed at Bronson Canyon , most notable for being the location of Bruce Wayne 's Batcave in the Batman television series that aired in the 1960s . 
 In order to create the effect of Mulder and Scully " melting " , special effects producer Bill Millar captured video of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in three @-@ dimensional high @-@ definition video — the two actors were scanned with a special laser at Glendale , California and the results were manipulated by a computer . Millar noted that , " when we looked at our first test , we realized we couldn 't melt Mulder and Scully without some degree of difficulty [ ... ] They had to melt like movie stars [ ... ] without turning Gillian into Margaret Thatcher and David into John Hurt as The Elephant Man " . In order to compensate for the difficulties , Millar used a " leading edge " melting effect that melted parts of the actors ' faces , keeping their facial features intact until the " goop " overtook them . For other shots , Anderson and Duchovny had to endure hours of being covered by a vegetable @-@ derived food thickener with yellow food coloring that stood in for the fungal secretion . In addition , Anderson and Duchovny were literally buried under the earth for the final scene : large pits were dug and scaffolding was constructed inside of them . The two actors then wore wet suits and were covered in the vegetable fluid and soil . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The idea of alternative realities had been explored in previous entries of The X @-@ Files in ways that M. Keith Booker called " relatively conservative [ … ] that allow for recuperation of the alternatives as a single ' real ' reality . " He cites the third season episode " Jose Chung 's From Outer Space " as an example of a faulty narrator , and the sixth season episode " How the Ghosts Stole Christmas " as an example of a comedic alternate reality . 
 <unk> J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke , in the book The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode stresses abductive reasoning , a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence . <unk> reasoning follows the logic : a surprising fact , C , is observed ( Result ) ; If A , the hypothesis , were true , C would make perfect sense ( Rule ) ; Thus , there is reason to suspect that A is true ( Case ) . An example that has been given is : the lawn is wet . But if it is raining , then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet . Therefore , it is raining . This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show . In this episode , however , it is Scully who first uses the method . She takes three separate facts — the massive size of some types of mushrooms , the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi , and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants — and formulates an abductive conclusion : she and Mulder are trapped underground , experiencing a hallucination , and slowly being digested . 
 <unk> logic has three parts . First , there is the surprising fact — also called the result — that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating , despite not taking any drugs . Second , there is Scully 's hypothesis — the rule — that , if it were true the hallucination " would be a matter of course " . Third , there is the conclusion — the case — that " there is a reason to suspect [ Scully 's hypothesis ] as true . " This abduction , Abrams and Cooke point out , is an example of creative abduction , because Scully manages to pull three , separate ideas " creatively " together . Mulder , however , next makes an abductive conclusion . While discussing the events with Skinner , he states that he is not convinced , because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects . This abduction also has three parts . The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully 's escape seems problematic . The rule is that Mulder and Scully only think that they have escaped , but they really are still underground and being digested . Finally , the case states that " there is reason to suspect that " Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom . This type of logic is an example of <unk> abduction , because it is the most plausible rule among many .

" In a subsequent review , VanDerWerff awarded the episode an " A " and called it " one of my favorite episodes of The X @-@ Files ' sixth season " due to its analysis of what Mulder and Scully each desire from the world , and the fact that the episode argues that the " mysteries can only be solved if both of these people are working to solve them .

 = Hod Stuart = 
 William Hodgson " Hod " Stuart ( February 20 , 1879 – June 23 , 1907 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey cover @-@ point ( now known as a defenceman ) who played nine seasons for several teams in different leagues . He also played briefly for the Ottawa Rough Riders football team . With his brother Bruce , Stuart played in the first professional ice hockey league , the American @-@ based International Professional Hockey League ( IPHL ) , where he was regarded as one of the best players in the league . 
 Frustrated with the violence associated with the IPHL , he left the league late in 1906 and returned to Canada , where in 1907 he helped the Montreal Wanderers win the Stanley Cup , the championship trophy for hockey . Two months later , he died in a diving accident . To raise money for his widow and children , the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association hosted an all @-@ star game , the first of its kind to be played in any sport . An estimated 3 @,@ 800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2 , 1908 , described by the Montreal Herald as " unique in the history of hockey in Montreal , if not in the whole of Canada " . 
 In an era when defencemen were expected to stay behind during the play , Stuart became known for his ability to score goals while playing a defensive role , and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent . He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players . His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and he became one of the first nine players to be inducted . He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Stuart was born in Ottawa , Ontario , the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson . He had two brothers , Alex and Bruce , and two sisters , Jessie and <unk> . Stuart was involved in sports from an early age . His father had been a good curler and was once point skip of the Ottawa Curling Club , and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age , often for the same teams . Stuart also played rugby and football , and played for the local professional football team , the Ottawa Rough Riders . 
 Outside of hockey Stuart worked as a bricklayer , and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction . He was said to have been a quiet person , and unlike other athletes of his era was not one to talk about his exploits , except with close friends . Loughlin , his wife , came from Quebec ; around 1903 they were married and had two children together . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Stuart first joined a senior hockey team when he spent the winter of 1895 – 1896 with the Rat Portage Thistles , a team in northwestern Ontario . Along with his brother Bruce , Stuart joined the Ottawa Hockey Club of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League ( CAHL ) for the 1899 season . He played the 1900 season for Ottawa , captaining the team . Through his father 's business contacts , Stuart got a job in Quebec and moved there in 1900 ; upon arriving there he joined the Quebec Bulldogs , also of the CAHL . He scored seven goals in fifteen games with the team over the next two seasons . 
 In 1902 , the Pittsburgh Bankers of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League signed Stuart to a professional contract ; this was disputed between the Bankers and the Pittsburgh Victorias , who also claimed him . Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart ; the following year they would also sign Bruce . Stuart was offered a salary of US $ 15 – 20 per week , plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh . Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover @-@ point in the league in 1903 . 
 After one season in Pittsburgh , Stuart moved to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club , a team in northern Michigan , for the 1903 – 1904 season and played in fourteen exhibition games , finishing fourth on the team with thirteen goals scored . With the formation of the International Professional Hockey League , Stuart left Portage Lake for the Calumet Miners , where he accepted the positions of coach and manager , in addition to playing cover @-@ point , for $ 1 @,@ 800 . He scored eighteen goals for Calumet in 1904 – 1905 , helped the team with the league championship and was named to the end of season all @-@ star team as the best cover @-@ point in the league . 
 On December 11 , 1905 , before the start of the 1905 – 06 season , Stuart was suspended from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league . He was reinstated by the league on December 30 , and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals . After Pittsburgh finished their season , Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship , which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club . Once again he was named best cover @-@ point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals . A big man with a fluid skating stride , he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence . 
 As the IPHL convinced players to move to the United States and get paid to play , hockey teams in Canada were forced to match the salaries in order to keep their players . Stuart , who was unhappy playing in Pittsburgh because of the violence involved in games , heard from Dickie Boon that the Montreal Wanderers , defending Stanley Cup winners , of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) were willing to make Stuart the highest paid player in hockey if he were to join the team . On December 13 , 1906 , Stuart had a letter published in the Montreal Star that detailed his problems with the IPHL . Stuart 's chief concern was the officiating ; he said they " don 't know how to run hockey over here , the rink people appoint the most dumb and incompetent referees that could be found . " In December 1906 Pittsburgh refused to play a game against Michigan Soo , claiming they did not like the choice of referee . While a common problem in the IPHL , Pittsburgh 's management believed Stuart was behind the action , and released him from the team . No longer bound to any team , Stuart joined the Wanderers ; his first game with the team was watched by 6 @,@ 069 fans . He took part in the Wanderers ' Stanley Cup challenge against the New Glasgow Cubs , a team from Nova Scotia , on December 27 and 29 , 1906 , and along with teammates Riley Hern , Frank Glass , Moose Johnson and Jack Marshall , became the first professional hockey players to compete for the Stanley Cup . 
 Stuart did not escape violence in the ECAHA . On January 12 , 1907 , the Wanderers faced the Ottawa Senators , a game the Wanderers ultimately won 4 – 2 . Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as " attempting to split Cecil Blachford 's skull " , Alf Smith hit Stuart " across the temple with his stick , laying him out like a corpse " , and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie " Moose " Johnson 's face , breaking Johnson 's nose . Stuart was commended for his actions during the game ; it was said that he neither flinched nor retaliated , even after bearing most of the hits . At a league meeting on January 18 , the Montreal Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in response to their actions , but this was voted down and the president of the league , Fred <unk> , resigned . The next time the Senators visited Montreal for a game , the police arrested Spittal , Alf and Harry Smith , leading to $ 20 fines for Spittal and Alf , and an acquittal for Harry . Even with the persistent violence , Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season ; they then accepted a challenge from the Kenora Thistles for the Stanley Cup . The Thistles won the series , held in January , but lost a rematch between the teams in March , giving the Cup back to the Wanderers . Stuart participated in both challenges , and though did not score a goal in any of the four games , he was said to have played the best game of his career in the first game of the series , even with a broken finger . Regarded as the most important player on the Wanderers , Stuart was said to know how to play every position on the ice , and passed his knowledge of the game onto his teammates . 
 = = Death = = 
 Tired of the constant violence , Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction . As part of this job , Stuart was sent to Belleville , Ontario , to oversee the building of the Belleville Drill Shed , one of his father 's contracts . While in Belleville , he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team . He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team ; a similar offer came from Peterborough , Ontario , while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president 's salary if Stuart would join them . On the afternoon of June 23 , 1907 , Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte , near Belleville , to swim with some friends . Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse , about half a kilometre away from his group , climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water . He dived head first onto jagged rocks , gashing his head and breaking his neck . He was killed instantly . His body was brought back to Ottawa , where a service was held at his family 's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery .
