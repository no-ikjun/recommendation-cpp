 In an emotional press conference , Manning told Colts fans , " Thank you for letting me be your quarterback . " Upon his release , Colts owner Jim Irsay announced that no Colt will ever wear the No. 18 jersey again , and it was formally retired on March 18 , 2016 .

 As one of the most highly sought @-@ after free agents , Manning selected the Denver Broncos after meeting with John Elway , a retired Broncos Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer quarterback who was now the team 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager , and Broncos head coach John Fox . Manning reached an agreement with the Broncos on a five @-@ year contract worth $ 96 million on March 20 , 2012 . Although No. 18 is retired in honor of Frank Tripucka , he gave Manning permission to wear it .

 On Thursday , August 9 , 2012 , Manning made his first appearance as a Bronco in a preseason game against the Chicago Bears , where he completed 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards , and was intercepted once by Bears safety Major Wright . 
 Manning made his regular season debut as a Denver Bronco in the prime time game on the first Sunday of the 2012 NFL Season , against the Pittsburgh Steelers . In the game , Manning completed 19 of 26 passes for 253 yards , 2 touchdowns , and no interceptions . He posted a 129 @.@ 2 QB rating in the 31 – 19 win , and made history in the third quarter when he connected with Demaryius Thomas on a 71 @-@ yard touchdown pass . The touchdown was Manning 's first in the NFL with a team other than the Colts , and marked the 400th of his career , making him the third quarterback , after Dan Marino and Brett Favre , to accomplish the feat and the fastest of the three to reach that mark . Despite the preseason concerns about his recovery , by late October ESPN stated that Manning " has silenced the critics " about his arm strength . Manning was later named to the 2013 Pro Bowl , his twelfth . 
 The Broncos made the playoffs , but lost 38 – 35 in double overtime to Baltimore , who went on to win Super Bowl XLVII that season . 
 On February 2 , 2013 , Manning was awarded the AP National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award and was named a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro selection , in addition to finishing second in MVP voting .

 On the opening game of the 2013 NFL season , Manning became one of only six players in NFL history to throw seven touchdowns in a game , doing so against the defending Super Bowl XLVII champions , the Baltimore Ravens . He added to this feat by not throwing an interception , tying Y. A. Tittle as one of the only two players to have a 7 : 0 touchdown to interception ratio in a single game ( although Nick Foles would later match that feat in week 9 of the same season ) . Against the Oakland Raiders in week three , Manning broke the record for most touchdown passes in the first three games of a season after throwing 12 , surpassing Tom Brady 's 2011 record . In Week 5 , Manning threw his first interception of the season , in a win against the Dallas Cowboys . He was intercepted by Morris Claiborne . Two weeks later , Manning returned to Indianapolis for the first time in the regular season since being released by the Indianapolis Colts . In an emotional pregame ceremony , the Indianapolis Colts showed a tribute video to Manning . 
 In Week 16 against the Houston Texans , Manning broke Brady 's record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51 on a 25 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Julius Thomas , he finished the regular season with 55 touchdown passes , in addition to throwing for a league record 5 @,@ 477 yards . His 450 completions are tied for second most all time . The Broncos scored an NFL record 606 points , becoming the first team ever to eclipse 600 points in a season . They had more 50 @-@ point games in a season than any other team in NFL history , with 3 . Four Broncos receivers recorded at least ten touchdowns — an NFL record — and Manning set a season record with nine games with four or more touchdown passes . His 115 @.@ 1 passer rating ranks fifth all time and he joined Tom Brady as the only two quarterbacks to achieve a passer rating of 110 @.@ 0 or higher in more than one season . The Broncos went on to win their divisional round playoff game against the San Diego Chargers by a score of 24 – 17 . They beat the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game by a score of 26 @-@ 16 . Manning became the third starting quarterback to reach the Super Bowl two different teams , after Craig Morton and Kurt Warner . 
 In Super Bowl XLVIII , Manning 's Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 43 – 8 . Manning was up against the Seahawks ' young starting quarterback Russell Wilson , who idolized Manning and attended one of Manning 's passing camps as a teenager , and later met Manning at a Broncos pre @-@ draft interview . The Seahawks ' number one ranked defense proved too much for the Broncos ' number one ranked offense to overcome , while the Broncos ' defense also struggled due to injuries . The Broncos ' first play from scrimmage set the tone for the game . While Manning was stepping forward to call an audible , center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball too early and it flew past Manning 's head into the end zone , where running back <unk> Moreno downed it for a safety . Manning set a Super Bowl record with 34 completions ( broken by Tom Brady the following year in Super Bowl XLIX ) , but the record @-@ setting offense didn 't record a first down until the 2nd quarter , and didn 't score any points until the final seconds of the 3rd quarter . While Manning threw one touchdown pass , he also threw two costly interceptions , one of which was returned for a touchdown .

 On August 28 , 2014 , Manning was fined $ 8 @,@ 268 for taunting D. J. <unk> during a preseason game against the Houston Texans . With the Broncos ' win in their opening game of the 2014 NFL season against the Indianapolis Colts , Manning became , along with Brett Favre , one of only two starting quarterbacks in NFL history who have beaten all 32 teams . On October 5 , 2014 , Manning threw his 500th career touchdown pass to Julius Thomas against the Arizona Cardinals , and also tied Dan Marino for the most 400 yard games by a quarterback . 
 On October 19 , 2014 , against the San Francisco 49ers , Manning threw his 509th career touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas , passing Brett Favre to become the NFL 's all @-@ time leader in passing touchdowns . By the end of the regular season , Manning would be selected to his 14th Pro Bowl appearance , tying him with Tony Gonzalez , Bruce Matthews , and Merlin Olsen for most Pro Bowl selections in a career . However , his season ended after the Broncos lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to his former team , the Indianapolis Colts , 24 – 13 . 
 = = = = 2015 season : Final season and second Super Bowl championship = = = = 
 After much speculation , Manning announced in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL . In the season opener , Manning 's play seemed to have deteriorated , going 24 – 40 for 175 yards and 1 interception , but a pick @-@ 6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19 – 13 . The Broncos got off to a dominant 7 – 0 start to the season ; however , the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis , losing 24 – 27 . During that winning streak , and the loss in Indianapolis , Manning played better , putting up over 250 yards in 6 of the 7 games , and he scored 9 touchdowns . However , he never had a game without an interception bringing his 8 @-@ game TD – INT ratio to 9 – 13 and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories . 
 In Week 10 against Kansas City , the game 's biggest highlight was Manning breaking Brett Favre 's record for career passing yards with a 4 @-@ yard pass to Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter . Despite the accomplishment , however , Manning went 5 @-@ for @-@ 20 for 35 yards and four interceptions with a 0 @.@ 0 passer rating before head coach Gary Kubiak benched him during the third quarter . Brock Osweiler filled in for Manning for the rest of the game as the Broncos would eventually lose 29 – 13 . A day later , sources said that Manning had suffered a bout of plantar fasciitis . It was later announced that this injury would keep him out of Week 11 , marking the first time Peyton had missed a game in a season he played . Osweiler replaced Manning and performed well in a 17 – 15 win over the Chicago Bears , leading to questions about whether Manning would retain his role when healthy in a Week 12 showdown against the New England Patriots . The next day , head coach Gary Kubiak , citing Manning 's injuries , announced that Osweiler would start against New England . On December 15 , it was announced that Osweiler would make his fifth consecutive start , against the Pittsburgh Steelers , even though Manning had returned to practice and the Broncos had gone seven straight quarters without scoring a touchdown on offense . Overall , the Broncos went 4 @-@ 2 in six games without Manning , giving them an 11 @-@ 4 record heading into the final week of the regular season . 
 Manning was listed as active for the Week 17 regular season finale against the San Diego Chargers , but for the first time since his freshman year at college , he was listed as a backup . In the third quarter , with the Broncos down 13 – 7 , Manning entered the game in relief of Brock Osweiler , who had been intercepted twice and fumbled once . The Broncos went on to beat the Chargers , 27 – 20 , and secure the top seed in the AFC . Despite the Broncos ' 12 – 4 record ( and Manning 's 8 – 2 record in games that he played in ) , Manning had the worst season statistically of his career , as he threw a career low 9 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions in just 10 games , and posting a quarterback rating of 67 @.@ 9 , the lowest rating of his career , and first time he had a rating below 84 since his rookie season . Manning 's 59 @.@ 8 completion percentage was the second lowest of his career , only behind his rookie season . Manning 's 17 interceptions were second to Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles , who threw 18 interceptions but started all 16 games . 
 The Broncos , by virtue of having the AFC 's # 1 seed , earned home field advantage throughout the NFL playoffs . The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional round to advance to the AFC Championship game to host the defending Super Bowl champions , the New England Patriots . It was the 17th , and ultimately final , meeting between Manning and his longtime rival Tom Brady . Despite a late comeback from the Patriots , the Broncos won 20 – 18 to advance to Super Bowl 50 . Manning threw two touchdowns and no interceptions in the win . 
 On February 7 , 2016 , the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers 24 – 10 in Super Bowl 50 as the Broncos ' defense shut down the heavily @-@ favored Panthers ' top @-@ ranked offense and regular season MVP Cam Newton . Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception while being sacked five times , scoring his only passing points with 3 : 08 left in the 4th quarter when he connected with Bennie Fowler for a 2 @-@ point conversion , which ended up being the final pass of his career . Manning became the oldest starting quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl . Manning also became the first quarterback to start two Super Bowls with multiple franchises , with different head coaches each time ( Dungy , Caldwell , Fox and Kubiak ) and the first quarterback to lead two different franchises to a Super Bowl victory . The victory gave Manning his 200th overall win including regular season and playoffs , making him the starting quarterback with the most combined regular season and postseason wins in NFL history , snapping a tie with Brett Favre . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Manning announced his retirement , after 18 seasons , on March 7 , 2016 . Manning 's final words of his retirement speech were , " I 've fought a good fight . I 've finished my football race and after 18 years , it 's time . God bless all of you and God bless football . "

The first Manning Bowl was held on September 10 , 2006 , and Peyton 's Colts defeated Eli 's Giants by a score of 26 – 21 .

 Grand Theft Auto IV is an open world action @-@ adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles , and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows . It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series , and the first main entry since 2004 's Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas . Set within the fictional Liberty City ( based on New York City ) , the single @-@ player story follows a war veteran , Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses . The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City , consisting of three main islands . 
 The game is played from a third @-@ person perspective and its world is navigated on @-@ foot or by vehicle . Throughout the single @-@ player mode , players play as Niko Bellic . An online multiplayer mode is included with the game , allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co @-@ operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single @-@ player setting . Two expansion packs were later released for the game , The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony , which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline , and follow new protagonists . 
 Development began in 2004 , soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas . As part of their research for the open world , the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team . Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar 's studios worldwide . Following its announcement in May 2006 , Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated . Upon release , the game received universal critical acclaim , with praise particularly directed at the game 's narrative and open world design . However , the game also generated controversy , with criticism directed at the game 's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol . Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest @-@ selling entertainment product in history at the time , earning US $ 310 million in its first day and US $ 500 million in its first week . Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games , and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time , it won year @-@ end accolades , including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications . Its successor , Grand Theft Auto V , was released in September 2013 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Grand Theft Auto IV is an action @-@ adventure game played from a third @-@ person perspective . Players complete missions — linear scenarios with set objectives — to progress through the story . It is possible to have several active missions running at one time , as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events . Outside of missions , players can freely roam the game 's open world , and have the ability to complete optional side missions . Composed of the fictional city of Liberty City , the world of Grand Theft Auto IV is larger in area than most earlier entries in the series . At the beginning of the game , players can only explore the first island – composed of Dukes and Broker – with all other islands unlocking as the story progresses . 
 Players use melee attacks , firearms and explosives to fight enemies , and may run , jump , swim or use vehicles to navigate the game 's world . There is a first @-@ person perspective option when using vehicles . In combat , auto @-@ aim and a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies . Should players take damage , their health meter can be fully regenerated using multiple techniques , such as eating , using medical kits , or calling for paramedics . If players commit crimes while playing , the game 's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a " wanted " meter in the head @-@ up display ( HUD ) . On the meter , the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level ( for example , at the maximum six @-@ star level , efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive ) . Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity . The wanted meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers ' line of sight . 
 The game 's cover system allows players to deftly move between cover , to fire blindly , aim freely , and target a specific enemy . Individual body parts can also be targeted . Melee attacks include additional moves , such as dodging , blocking , disarming an opponent and counter @-@ attacking . Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage , but is used up in the process . When health is entirely depleted , gameplay stops , and players respawn at the nearest hospital . 
 The game 's single @-@ player mode lets players control a war veteran , Eastern European Niko Bellic . During the story , Niko meets various new characters , many of whom he befriends . These characters can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks ; for example , his cousin Roman , who owns a taxi service , can send one of his cabs to Niko and take him to any destination around the city . Cabs are always available during gameplay , allowing players to quickly travel to a destination . Throughout the course of the game , players are also faced with morality choices , which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player 's choice . While free roaming the game world , players may engage in context @-@ specific activities such as bowling or darts . Other available activities include a vigilante minigame , and in @-@ game television programming . Niko has a smartphone for contacting friends and starting activities .

 Grand Theft Auto IV takes place in 2008 , in a redesigned version of Liberty City consisting of four boroughs , based on four of the boroughs of New York City : Broker ( based on Brooklyn ) , Dukes ( Queens ) , Bohan ( The Bronx ) , and Algonquin ( Manhattan ) . Adjacent to the city is the independent state of Alderney ( Northern New Jersey ) . There are three minor islands present in the game : Charge Island ( Randall 's Island ) , Colony Island ( Roosevelt Island ) , and Happiness Island ( Liberty Island ) . Initially , bridges are locked down due to a terrorist threat , and players are constantly pursued by police if the bridges are crossed , but the blockades are lifted as the story progresses , allowing the player to traverse between islands . Grand Theft Auto IV takes place in a different storyline and timeline from the previous games in the series . However , the game takes place in the same canon as its expansion packs , The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony , and its successor , Grand Theft Auto V.

 Following his cousin Roman 's request , Niko Bellic , an Eastern European , comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream , and to search for the man who betrayed his unit in a war fifteen years prior . Upon arrival , however , Niko discovers that Roman 's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loan sharks , and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion . 
 Niko defends Roman from his loan sharks several times , eventually killing Vlad <unk> , Roman 's Russian loan shark . Niko was forced to work for Vlad to settle Roman 's debts but ended up killing him after learning that he had slept with Roman 's girlfriend , <unk> .

 Work on Grand Theft Auto IV began in November 2004 , almost immediately after the release of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas ( 2004 ) . Around 150 game developers worked on Grand Theft Auto IV , led by core members of the team that previously worked on Grand Theft Auto III ( 2001 ) . For the game , Rockstar used their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine ( RAGE ) , which was previously used in Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis ( 2006 ) , in combination with the Euphoria game animation engine . Instead of pre @-@ written animations , Euphoria uses procedural animation to control the way the player moves , enabling character movements to be more realistic . The Euphoria engine also enables NPCs to react in a realistic way to the player 's actions . In one preview , a player knocked an NPC out of a window and the character grabbed onto a ledge to stop himself from falling . The game also uses middleware from Image Metrics to facilitate intricate facial expressions and ease the process of incorporating lip @-@ synching . Foliage in the game is produced through SpeedTree . 
 Grand Theft Auto IV sees a shift in the series to a more realistic and detailed style and tone , partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high @-@ definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles . Rockstar co @-@ founder Dan Houser said " what we 're taking as our watchword on [ Grand Theft Auto IV ] is the idea of what high definition actually means . Not just in terms of graphics , which obviously we are achieving , but in terms of all aspects of the design . [ ... ] You know , trying to make something more realistic , more held together , but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had . " Art director Aaron Garbut said one of the reasons they decided to set the game in New York because " we all knew what an amazing , diverse , vibrant , cinematic city it is , " and since they were hoping the push the " detail , variety and life " to a high level , it seemed that " basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit . " Dan Houser added " because we were working in high definition and we knew we 'd need a <unk> of research , we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold . " The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City , Dan Houser said " what we 've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment , but is also fun from a game design perspective . " The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series Although smaller than San Andreas , the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IV 's predecessor Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when " the level of verticality of the city , the number of buildings you can go into , and the level of detail in those buildings " are taken into account . The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces , such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas . To achieve a realistic environment , the Rockstar North team , based in Edinburgh , Scotland , made two trips to New York for research , one at the start of the project ( which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game ) and another smaller one further into development . A full @-@ time research team , based in New York , handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns . 
 The story of Grand Theft Auto IV was written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries . Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence , " [ Grand Theft Auto IV doesn 't ] really have any cinematic influences " , as explained by Houser . " We were consciously trying to go , well , if video games are going to develop into the next stage , then the thing isn 't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff . It 's to reference the actual place itself " . Houser also said , " In terms of the character , we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [ a ] movie . [ ... ] Maybe [ we ] could do something ourselves that would live alongside that stuff " . 
 Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich said " [ we had ] to pick the songs that make New York today what it is , but make sure they won 't feel dated by the time the game comes out . " The developers contacted over 2 @,@ 000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights . They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late <unk> Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band 's song , " Walk the Night " . Citing sources close to the deals , Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $ 5 @,@ 000 per composition and another $ 5 @,@ 000 per master recording per track . Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in @-@ game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player , but both ideas were cut . DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game 's hip @-@ hop radio station The Beat 102 @.@ 7 . Record label owner and record producer Bobby <unk> , who hosts the in @-@ game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96 @.@ 9 , went through the extra effort of flying to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re @-@ record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City . 
 The Corporate Vice @-@ President of Microsoft 's Interactive Entertainment Business division , Peter Moore , announced at E3 2006 that the game would appear on Xbox 360 , by rolling up his sleeve to reveal a Grand Theft Auto IV temporary tattoo . Rockstar Games initially appeared to be committed to the original 16 October 2007 release date ; however , Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter suggested that Take @-@ Two may choose to delay the release of the game in order to boost its financial results for 2008 and to avoid competing with the release of other highly anticipated titles , such as Halo 3 . Rockstar responded by saying that Grand Theft Auto IV was still on track for release in " late October " . On 2 August 2007 , Take @-@ Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would miss its original release date of 16 October 2007 contrary to their previous statements , and would be delayed to their second fiscal quarter ( February – April ) of 2008 . In a later conference call with investors , Take @-@ Two 's Strauss Zelnick attributed the delay to " almost strictly technological problems ... not problems , but challenges . " It was later revealed that technical difficulties with the PlayStation 3 version of the game contributed to the delay , along with storage problems on the Xbox 360 . On 24 January 2008 , Take @-@ Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would be released on 29 April 2008 . As the release date approached , Rockstar Games and Take @-@ Two marketed the game heavily through various forms , including television ads , Internet video , billboards , viral marketing , and a redesigned website . A special edition of the game was also released for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . At a Take @-@ Two shareholder meeting on 18 April 2008 , Take @-@ Two CEO Ben Feder announced that Grand Theft Auto IV had already " gone gold " and was " in production and in trucks en route to retailers " . The game was eventually released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles in Europe , North America , and Oceania on 29 April 2008 , and in Japan on 30 October 2008 . Overall , Grand Theft Auto IV took over 1000 people and more than three and a half years to complete , with a total cost estimated at approximately $ 100 million , making it , at the time , the most expensive video game ever developed . 
 On 6 August 2008 , Rockstar announced that a Microsoft Windows version of Grand Theft Auto IV was in development by Rockstar North and Rockstar Toronto . The game was originally announced for release in North America on 18 November 2008 and in Europe on 21 November 2008 but was later pushed back to 2 and 3 December 2008 , respectively . It contains expanded features , including traffic density control , draw distance configurations and a replay editor . The replay editor allows players to record and edit game clips , videos can then be uploaded to Rockstar 's Social Club website . It utilised Games for Windows - Live for online play and supports 32 players for multiplayer . SecuROM protection is utilised and a one time online activation is required in order to play the game . The game was made available on Steam on 4 January 2009 . 
 = = = Episodic content = = = 
 Two episodic packs for Grand Theft Auto IV have been released . These two episodes were first released separately , exclusively on Xbox Live , as downloadable content ( DLC ) , requiring the original game to play . They were later released together as part of a standalone game , titled Grand Theft Auto : Episodes From Liberty City , which does not require the original game to play . Dan Houser stated the episodes shows " a different side of Liberty City " . 
 The first expansion , titled Grand Theft Auto : The Lost and Damned , was originally released on 17 February 2009 . The protagonist of The Lost and Damned is Johnny <unk> , a member of Liberty City 's biker gang The Lost . The second expansion , titled Grand Theft Auto : The Ballad of Gay Tony , was released on 29 October 2009 . The protagonist of The Ballad of Gay Tony is Luis Fernando Lopez , an assistant to nightclub owner Tony " Gay Tony " Prince , and follows him as he resolves the conflicts of his friends , family , and boss . 
 Jeronimo Barrera , Vice President of Product Development for Rockstar Games , said that the episodes were experiments because the team were not sure that there was enough users with access to online content on the Xbox 360 . Take @-@ Two Interactive 's Chief Financial Officer , Lainie Goldstein revealed that Microsoft was paying a total of $ 50 million for the first two episodes . In January 2010 , Rockstar announced that the DLC as well as Episodes From Liberty City would be made available for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on 13 April 2010 in North America and 16 April 2010 in Europe . 
 Both episodes were released for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on 13 April 2010 in North America and on 16 April 2010 in Europe . Grand Theft Auto IV : The Complete Edition , including the original Grand Theft Auto IV and its two episodic expansions , was listed on online stores , before being confirmed by Rockstar . The compilation was released on PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Windows on 26 October 2010 in North America , and 29 October in Europe . 
 = = = Soundtrack = = = 
 Like previous games in the Grand Theft Auto series , Grand Theft Auto IV features a soundtrack that can be heard through radio stations while the player is in a vehicle . Liberty City is serviced by 19 radio stations , three of which are talk radio stations . The other stations feature music from a large range of genres , including tracks from Genesis , David Bowie , Bob Marley , The Who , Queen , Kanye West and Elton John . 
 Grand Theft Auto IV uses a similar music system to that of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas ( 2004 ) . In other games in the series , each radio station was essentially a single looped sound file , playing the same songs , announcements and advertisements in the same order each time . With the radio stations in Grand Theft Auto IV , each sound file is held separately , and sequenced randomly , allowing songs to be played in different orders , announcements to songs to be different each time , and plot events to be mentioned on the stations . Certain songs are also edited to incorporate references to the fictional Liberty City . 
 A variety of real celebrities provide voices for the radio DJs in the game , including fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld , musicians Iggy Pop , Femi Kuti , Jimmy Gestapo and <unk> , and real @-@ life radio talk show host <unk> Jones . Saturday Night Live actors Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis appear on the liberal and conservative radio talk shows respectively , with Fred Armisen playing several guests on <unk> 's " Integrity 2 @.@ 0 " . Numerous other comedians , including Jim Norton , Patrice O 'Neal , Rick Shapiro , and Robert Kelly , as well as radio hosts Opie & Anthony appeared on the radio and / or as characters in @-@ game . 
 The Music of Grand Theft Auto IV is a 2008 soundtrack packaged with the special edition of Grand Theft Auto IV . The disc contains several soundtrack selections . The soundtrack features several genres , from hip hop to rock and reggae . Several artists re @-@ recorded their songs to make references to in @-@ game locations . Two songs , " Liberty City : The Invasion " and " No Sex for Ben " , were composed specifically for the game and the soundtrack . The theme song of Grand Theft Auto IV , " Soviet Connection " , was composed by Michael Hunter , who previously composed the theme for Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .

 = = Controversies = = 
 Prior to and since the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , the game had been subject to a great deal of controversy , as was the case with previous Grand Theft Auto titles . Figures including George Galloway , Jack Thompson and Hillary Clinton have criticised the game , as have organisations including New York City officials and Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) . MADD asked ESRB to change the rating of the game from " M " ( for ages seventeen and up ) to " AO " ( for adults only ) due to the player 's ability to drive under the influence of alcohol . 
 The initial version of Grand Theft Auto IV released in Australia and New Zealand was pre @-@ censored by Rockstar to allow the game to meet the perceived requirements of the Australian classification system . However , the game was resubmitted to the New Zealand OFLC by Stan Calif , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old student who was unhappy that New Zealand received an edited version of the game as a result of Australian censorship laws . The unedited version was subsequently given an R18 rating and cleared for sale in New Zealand . For the PC release , the uncensored version of the game was awarded MA15 + in Australia . Following the release of The Lost and Damned , Rockstar distributed a patch which uncensored the Australian release for consoles . 
 There have been reports in the United Kingdom and the United States of crimes perpetrated against people purchasing Grand Theft Auto IV , as well as employees of stores selling the game . One of these incidents , an attack near a Gamestation store in Croydon , London was later reported to be an unrelated argument between two groups of people leaving a pub and the story has been referred to as a " media panic . " Six teenagers were later arrested in June 2008 after engaging in a crime spree in New Hyde Park , New York , assaulting and robbing several people , and attempting a carjacking . According to police , the teens claimed that they were " inspired " by Grand Theft Auto IV . 
 = Norwood – 205th Street ( IND Concourse Line ) = 
 Norwood – 205th Street ( formerly 205th Street ) is the northern terminal station on the IND Concourse Line of the New York City Subway . Located at the intersection of 205th Street and Bainbridge Avenue in Norwood , Bronx , it is served by the D train at all times . 
 = = History = = 
 The station was built as part of the sixth and seventh sections of the IND Concourse Line beginning in the late 1920s . The station was built under East 205th Street at its eastern end , and underneath preexisting private property for most of its length . The station opened on July 1 , 1933 , along with the rest of the Concourse subway . On July 1 , 1937 , an escalator was opened in the station , the first of its kind in the Bronx . 
 On August 23 , 1954 , a D train relaying east of the station overshot the bumper blocks at the end of the track , crashing into the wall at the end of the line . The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours , and when he was freed , his left foot had to be amputated . 
 = = Station layout = = 
 This underground station has two tracks and one island platform . Both track walls have a lime green trim line with a medium Kelly green border . Small " 205 " signs are placed below them at regular intervals . The platform has a row of concrete @-@ clad I @-@ beam columns on both sides ; these are painted medium Hunter green . There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling , the wall tiles , and to a number of the support columns . The station is also notorious for having piles of trash bags on the platform and at entrances , as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans . 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005 , problems which have persisted into the 2010s . 
 Due to changes in the street grid of the neighborhood , the station is located at East 205th Street and Perry Avenue at its eastern end , and at East 206th Street and Bainbridge Avenue at its western end . 205th Street turns diagonally southwest at Perry Street , while the subway maintains its previous direction , lining up with Van Cortland Avenue before turning south onto Grand Concourse . 
 The station is located close to several Norwood landmarks , including the New York Public Library 's Mosholu Branch ; the Montefiore Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital , north of the station on East 210th Street ; St. Brendan 's Church and School ; the Valentine – Varian House ; and the <unk> Oval , the former site of the <unk> Reservoir . 
 = = = Fare control = = = 
 This station has two fare control areas . The full @-@ time side at the south ( geographical west ) end has a turnstile bank , token booth , and two staircases going up to the southeast and northwest corners of East 206th Street and Bainbridge Avenue . Because of the varying topography of the surrounding neighborhood , a single escalator was installed in 1937 in this fare control area , traversing an elevation difference of 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) between the mezzanine and platform . Access to fare control otherwise requires walking up three flights of stairs from platform level . 
 The other fare control area at the station 's north ( geographical east ) end , accessed by a ramp to the platform , is unstaffed , containing full height turnstiles and two staircases going up to the northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue . The token booth at this location was closed on July 30 , 2005 and removed sometime afterward . 
 = = Track layout = = 
 This station was not intended to be the terminus of the Concourse Line or the D train ; both were supposed to have been extended east past Bronx Park and the IRT White Plains Road Line along Burke Avenue to serve the northeast section of the Bronx . This idea was postponed due to lack of funding , and ultimately abandoned when the City of New York bought the right @-@ of @-@ way of the bankrupt New York , Westchester and Boston Railway and converted it for subway use in 1941 . Another proposal in the 1970s involved extending the Concourse Line to White Plains Road , but financial troubles caused the plan to be aborted . 
 As a result of the planned extension , the two tracks continue east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue , ending at a concrete wall , and this station does not have any crew quarters . Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard , the next station south . Additionally , there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station ; here , a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard . Because of this , terminating trains arrive on the southern ( railroad northbound ) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east to the end of the track . They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern ( railroad southbound ) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn . Due to the track configuration , trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track , and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track .

 Corey Todd Taylor was born in Des Moines , Iowa on December 8 , 1973 . Taylor was mostly raised by his mother in Waterloo , Iowa , a place described by Taylor as a " hole in the ground with buildings around it . " He is of German and Native American background from his father 's side and Irish and Dutch on his mother 's side . Taylor was raised by his single mother . He developed a fond feeling toward rock ' n ' roll after his grandmother introduced him to Elvis Presley . 
 In 1979 , Taylor and his mother saw the science fiction series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century . Before the series , there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film Halloween . Taylor said this " developed some sense of Slipknot in [ himself ] . " While Halloween introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes , Taylor 's grandmother introduced him to rock music , showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the mid @-@ fifties to late seventies . He especially found some songs like " Teddy Bear " , " In the Ghetto " , and " Suspicious Minds " , to appeal to his interests the most , describing them as " good times . " Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age , beginning with their early work . 
 Taylor , along with his mother and sister , lived at one point in an " old dilapidated farmhouse , " which on days in late autumn would " look like Black Sabbath album covers . " By age fifteen , Taylor had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice . By this time , Taylor was living in Waterloo , Iowa , but later set out on his own and ended up at his grandmother 's house in Iowa . She took legal custody of him and helped him buy musical equipment . When Taylor was eighteen , he left his grandmother 's home and went to various places , Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned . 
 In his early twenties , when Taylor was living with his grandmother , he attempted suicide by way of overdose . Taylor 's ex @-@ girlfriend 's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him . He describes this as the lowest point in his life . 
 Taylor and his father first met when Taylor was 30 years old , and now have a relationship , although he said their paths do not cross that often . On September 17 , 2002 , Taylor 's then @-@ fiancée , Scarlett Stone , gave birth to their son Griffin Parker . Taylor also has a daughter named Angeline from an earlier relationship . Taylor and Stone married on March 11 , 2004 , and divorced three years later . 
 Taylor has also had alcohol abuse problems , which his wife , Scarlett , helped him through as well as keeping him from committing suicide . In 2006 , Taylor told MTV that he had attempted to jump off a balcony of the eighth floor of the Hyatt on Sunset Boulevard in 2003 , but " somehow [ Scarlett ] stopped me " . This was later recanted by Taylor in an interview with Kerrang ! radio and stated that it was , in fact , his friend Thom <unk> who stopped him from jumping . Scarlett then told him that either he would have to get sober or she would annul their marriage . Before Stone Sour started recording Come What ( ever ) May in January 2006 , Taylor was sober . 
 On August 3 , 2009 , he co @-@ hosted the 2009 Kerrang ! Awards alongside Scott Ian of Anthrax . The following year , they both once again co @-@ hosted The Kerrang Awards , where Corey collected the K ! Services to Metal award on behalf of Paul Gray who died after an accidental overdose of morphine and fentanyl . 
 In early September 2010 , Taylor announced that his book , Seven Deadly Sins : Settling The Argument Between Born Bad And Damaged Good would be released on July 12 , 2011 through Da Capo Press . 
 On November 13 , 2009 , Taylor married Stephanie <unk> at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas .

 In Des Moines , Iowa , Joey Jordison , Shawn Crahan , and Mick Thomson approached him asking him to join Slipknot . He agreed to go to one of their practices , and ended up singing in front of them . Of Slipknot 's nine members , Corey was the sixth to join the band . Performing with Slipknot , he would also come to be known as " Number Eight " , being that the band follows a numbering scheme for its members , ranging from 0 – 8 . According to Shawn Crahan , Corey wanted number eight , because it symbolizes infinity . 
 Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour , Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour , even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon . Taylor 's first gig with Slipknot was on August 22 , 1997 , which according to band members did not go well . During his first gig , Taylor did not perform wearing a mask ; however , for his second show nearly a month later , Corey wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask . Taylor 's current mask was described by MTV 's Chris Harris as looking " as though it were made of dried , human flesh — like Leatherface , if only he used moisturizer . " 
 Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album , a self @-@ titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers . As permanent vocalist , he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu , California and released Slipknot , the band 's debut album that peaked number one on the Top Heatseekers chart , went 2 × Platinum in the United States , and was included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . Taylor was accused of copyright infringement , regarding the lyrics of the song " Purity " , but no action was taken . Taylor began recording for their second studio album , Iowa , in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys , Los Angeles . It was released August 28 , 2001 and peaked number one on the UK Albums Chart , as well as number three on the Billboard 200 . While writing Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) , Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label . It peaked number two on the Billboard 200 . All Hope Is Gone was the first Slipknot album to peak number one on the Billboard 200 .

 Taylor is a founding member of the American hard rock band Stone Sour . After he formed the band with drummer Joel Ekman , Shawn Economaki joined filling in the bass position , leaving the electric guitar position to be filled by Josh Rand . Stone Sour recorded a demo album in 1993 , and another in 1994 . In 1997 , Taylor was approached by the metal band , Slipknot , resulting in him abandoning Stone Sour while they were recording a demo album with Sean McMahon at SR studios . Taylor did not return until five years later to record their debut album , Stone Sour in 2002 . Both Taylor and guitarist Josh Rand contacted Jim Root , Slipknot 's guitarist , and Shawn Economaki , Stone Sour 's original bassist , to begin writing songs for their debut album . Drummer Joel Ekman came back on board as well . This " reformation " later resulted in Stone Sour recording at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls , Iowa . 
 Their self @-@ titled debut album was released August 27 , 2002 , and it debuted at number 46 on the Billboard 200 . Their second album , Come What ( ever ) May debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 . It was released August 1 , 2006 , and charted on several different charts . Live in Moscow is currently their only album specifically released only for music download . During the recording of the album , drummer Joel Ekman left the band for personal reasons . As a result , drummer Roy Mayorga was recruited , taking his place . The group released their third studio album , Audio Secrecy , on September 7 , 2010 . 
 Later , Corey Taylor has announced the release of a concept double album with Stone Sour . The albums are titled " House of Gold And Bones " . During the process of making the double album , bassist Shawn Economaki left the band . He was temporarily replaced for touring purposes by Johny Chow . The first part was released in October 2012 and the second part in April 2013 . There are 23 songs in total , 11 on the first part and 12 on the second . In addition to these two albums is a four @-@ part comic book series written by Taylor and published by Dark Horse Comics . They are set to go on sale in 2013 . With these albums came a story that was written by Taylor that coincide with the album . Fans can also construct a miniature " house of gold and bones " from the packaging design of the physical versions of the two albums . Taylor has also said that he would like to finish off the project by making the story into a movie but nothing has come of this yet .

Taylor provided guest narration on the track " Repentance " for Dream Theater 's 2007 album Systematic Chaos . In an interview with Billboard magazine , Taylor confirmed that on January 13 , 2009 , he was planning on making a solo album , as well as returning to his side project Stone Sour after Slipknot 's All Hope Is Gone World Tour . Taylor has stated that he was writing songs that " don 't fit either of his main bands . " He describes them as a cross between Foo Fighters , Johnny Cash , and Social Distortion , saying that there 's " a country background that comes built @-@ in with living in Iowa " . 
 On March 30 , 2009 , it was confirmed that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009 . The group performed on April 24 , 2009 at People 's Court in Des Moines , Iowa , marking Taylor 's first official solo show . Taylor performs with his band the Dum <unk> , who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal . Taylor also performs with Audacious P , a band that is primarily a Tenacious D cover band . Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album <unk> , but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time . Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver , but said that it just did not work out . However , according to a recent Billboard article , it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver , though no official confirmation has been made . Duff McKagan added that they can neither " confirm or deny " Taylor 's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the " real deal " . Slash has since ruled Corey out as the possible new vocalist explaining that " [ it ] just wasn 't right " although he does love him . He however , has recorded 10 new songs with the band , drummer Matt Sorum stated it 's unlikely it will ever be released . Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on Hoppus on Music that McKagan and he were writing new music for a possible new supergroup . 
 In July 2011 Taylor collaborated with Aaron Lewis while promoting Lewis ' solo album , Town Line for a one night only acoustic duet show covering songs such as , Pearl Jam 's " Black " , Pink Floyd 's Comfortably Numb , and Alice in Chains ' Down in a Hole , videos from this show with Taylor and Lewis can be found on YouTube . Taylor also shared the stage with Aaron Lewis on August 16 , 2009 during the Ride For Dime memorial concert . They performed Pantera covers with a variety of other musicians . 
 As a solo artist he recorded a song , " X @-@ M @ $ " , for The Teenage Cancer Trust . The single was made available to digital retailers on December 12 , 2010 . It debuted at number thirty @-@ seven in the UK . Taylor clarified on YouTube that the song was just a joke about people who don 't enjoy Christmas . He personally loves Christmas especially due to the fact he gets to see his extended family but finds the frustration of people who don 't like it to be hilarious . 
 In 2011 , Taylor collaborated with Blink @-@ 182 drummer Travis Barker on Barker 's solo album Give the Drummer Some on the song " On My Own " .

 The first two Slipknot albums with Taylor 's vocals , Slipknot and Iowa , both contain gratuitous explicit content . Many critics claimed Taylor relied on the profanity , which is why Slipknot 's third album , Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) is profanity @-@ free , ( with the exceptions of the word bitch on the song " Duality " and bastard on the spoken intro of " Pulse of the Maggots " ) , and did not warrant the explicit label . Compared with the previous vocalist for Slipknot , Anders Colsefni , Taylor has a vocal style that was characterized by drummer Joey Jordison as " really good melodic singing " . Taylor 's vocal style , which contains at times melodic singing , growling , screaming , shouting , and rapping , led him to place at number 86 on the Hit Parader 's Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time and is often compared to other vocalists such as Ivan L. Moody , John Bush , Phil Anselmo and Jamey Jasta . 
 Taylor 's two major projects have contrasting temperaments . Slipknot is considered to be heavy metal , nu metal and alternative metal , and expresses moods such as depression , hostility , anger , misanthropy , and rebellion . Stone Sour is classified as alternative metal , expressing moods of bleakness and somberness as well as anger and rebellion .

 The International Association for Plant Taxonomy ( IAPT ) promotes an understanding of plant biodiversity , facilitates international communication of research between botanists , and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names . The IAPT was founded on July 18 , 1950 at the Seventh International Botanical Congress in Stockholm , Sweden . Currently , the IAPT headquarters is located in Bratislava , Slovakia . Its current president , since 2011 , is Vicki Funk of the Smithsonian Institution , Washington , DC . ; vice @-@ president is Sandra Knapp of the Natural History Museum , London ; and secretary @-@ general is Karol Marhold of the Institute of Botany , Slovak Academy of Sciences , Bratislava . 
 Both the taxonomic journal Taxon and the series Regnum Vegetabile are published by the IAPT . The latter series includes the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants , the Index <unk> <unk> , and Index Herbariorum . 
 = = Purpose = = 
 The IAPT 's primary purpose is the promotion and understanding of biodiversity — the discovery , naming , classification , and systematics of plants — for both living and fossil plants . Additionally , it promotes the study and conservation of plant biodiversity , and works to raise awareness of the general public to this issue . The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics , taxonomy , and nomenclature . This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources , such as reference publications and journals . 
 The IAPT also seeks to achieve uniformity and stability in plant names . It accomplishes this through the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants , previously known as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature , and through the oversight of the International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature . 
 = = Publications and online resources = = 
 = = = Taxon = = = 
 Taxon is the bi @-@ monthly journal of the IAPT . The journal , which was initiated in 1951 , publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense . Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification . Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature , and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICN ) . Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee . The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant <unk> , reviews and notices of books and other publications , and news in the world of plant systematics . Although the journal is " devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany " , it has been in the past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics . 
 = = = Regnum Vegetabile = = = 
 Regnum Vegetabile is a published series of books on topics of interest to plant taxonomists . Many of the volumes are literature surveys or monographs in the area of plant systematics . There are several volumes of general use : 
 International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( Vol . 154 , 2012 ) The ICN is a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal names that are given to plants . The current edition is known as the " Melbourne Code " , as it was drafted in 2011 at the Seventeenth International Botanical Congress in Melbourne , Australia . 
 International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants , 8th edition ( Vol . 151 , 2010 ) Companion to the ICN , this volume sets forth rules regarding the names of plant cultivars . 
 Index <unk> <unk> ( Vols . 100 @-@ 102 & 113 ) An index of all published generic names covered by the ICN , including the place of publication and information about the type species . The index is prepared in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution . An electronic version is available online . 
 Index Herbariorum , the first six editions ( Vol . 15 , 31 , 86 , 92 , 93 , 106 , 109 , 114 , 117 , 120 ) A directory and guide to the herbaria of the world , including contact information , abbreviation codes , and important collections located in each herbarium . Index Herbariorum is now an online database , managed by The New York Botanical Garden , and available for on @-@ line searching . 
 International Directory of Botanical Gardens ( Updated as Vol . 95 , 1977 ) A directory to botanical gardens and arboreta around the world . 
 The series includes many additional volumes of interest to specialists in specific subdisciplines of botany , in addition to the ones listed above .

 = Lhasa ( prefecture @-@ level city ) = 
 Lhasa City , is a prefecture @-@ level city , formerly a prefecture until 7 January 1960 , one of the main administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China . It covers an area of 29 @,@ 274 square kilometres ( 11 @,@ 303 sq mi ) of rugged and sparsely populated terrain . The prefecture @-@ level city contains two districts Chengguan District and Doilungdêqên District . 
 The prefecture @-@ level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the Lhasa River , a major tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River . It lies on the Lhasa terrane , the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the Himalayas . The terrane is high , contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active . The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter . Most of the rain falls in summer . The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks , sheep and goats , while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley , wheat and vegetables . Wildlife is not abundant , but includes the rare snow leopard and black @-@ necked crane . Mining has caused some environmental problems . 
 The former prefecture is divided into seven mostly rural counties and one district , which contains the main urban area of Lhasa . The 2000 census gave a total population of 474 @,@ 490 , of whom 387 @,@ 124 were ethnic Tibetans . The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas . The prefecture @-@ level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai – Tibet Railway , which terminates in the city of Lhasa . Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power , as do many smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Station . The population is well @-@ served by primary schools and basic medical facilities , although more advanced facilities are lacking . Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century . Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution , but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions .

 Lhasa lies in south @-@ central Tibet , to the north of the Himalayas . The prefecture @-@ level city is 277 kilometres ( 172 mi ) from east to west and 202 kilometres ( 126 mi ) from north to south . It covers an area of 29 @,@ 518 square kilometres ( 11 @,@ 397 sq mi ) . It is bordered by <unk> Prefecture to the north , <unk> Prefecture to the east , Lhoka ( Shannan ) Prefecture to the south and Shigatse prefecture @-@ level city to the west . The prefecture @-@ level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the Lhasa River , which is the center of Tibet politically , economically and culturally . Chengguan District is also the center of Tibet in terms of transport , communications , education and religion , as well as being the most developed part of Tibet and a major tourist destination with sights such as the Potala Palace , Jokhang and Ramoche Temple .

 Lhasa prefecture @-@ level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the Lhasa River , a major tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo River . Exceptions are the north of Damxung County , which crosses the watershed of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains and includes part of the Namtso lake , and Nyêmo County , which covers the basin of the <unk> Maqu River , a direct tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo . The river basin is separated from the Yarlung Tsangpo valley to the south by the <unk> <unk> range . The largest tributary of the Lhasa River , the Reting Tsangpo , originates in the <unk> Mountains in <unk> Prefecture at an elevation of about 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) , and flows southwest into Lhasa past Reting Monastery . 
 The Lhasa River drains an area of 32 @,@ 471 square kilometres ( 12 @,@ 537 sq mi ) , and is the largest tributary of the middle section of the Yarlung Tsangpo . The average altitude of the basin is around 4 @,@ 500 metres ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) . The basin has complex geology and is tectonically active . Earthquakes are common . Annual runoff is 10 @,@ 550 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 3 @.@ 73 × 1011 cu ft ) . Water quality is good , with little discharge of sewage and minimal chemical pesticides and fertilizers . 
 The Lhasa River forms where three smaller rivers converge . These are the <unk> Chu , the <unk> Chu which flows from Damxung County and the Reting Tsangpo , which rises beyond the Reting Monastery . The highest tributary rises at around 5 @,@ 290 metres ( 17 @,@ 360 ft ) on the southern slope of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains . In its upper reaches the river flows southeast through a deep valley . Lower down the river valley is flatter and changes its direction to the southwest , The river expands to a width of 150 to 200 metres ( 490 to 660 ft ) . Major tributaries in the lower reaches include the Pengbo River and the Duilong River . At its mouth the Lhasa Valley is about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) wide . 
 The bulk of the water is supplied by the summer monsoon rains , which fall from July to September . There are floods in the summer from July to September , with about 17 % of the annual runoff flowing in September . In winter the river has low water , and sometimes freezes . Total flow is about 4 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 96 cu mi ) , with average flow about 125 cubic metres per second ( 4 @,@ 400 cu ft / s ) . The total hydropower potential of the river basin is 2 @,@ 560 @,@ 000 kW . Zhikong Hydro Power Station in Maizhokunggar County delivers 100 MW . The Pangduo Hydro Power Station in Lhünzhub County has total installed capacity of 160 MW . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The former Lhasa prefecture lies in the Lhasa terrane , to which it gives its name . This is thought to be the last crustal block to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the collision with the Indian plate in the Cenozoic . The terrane is separated from the Himalayas to the south by the Yarlung @-@ Tsangpo suture , and from the <unk> terrane to the north by the <unk> @-@ <unk> suture . The Lhasa terrane consisted of two blocks before the Mesozoic , the North Lhasa Block and the South Lhasa Block . These blocks were joined in the Late Paleozoic . 
 The Lhasa terrane moved northward and collided with the <unk> terrane along the <unk> suture . The collision began towards the end of the late Jurassic ( c . 163 – 145 Ma ) , and collision activity continued until the early Late Cretaceous ( c . 100 – 66 Ma ) . During this period the terrane may have been shortened by at least 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) . The collision caused a peripheral foreland basin to form in the north part of the Lhasa terrane . In some parts of the foreland basin the north @-@ dipping subduction of the <unk> oceanic crust below the Lhasa terrane caused volcanism . The Gangdese batholith was formed as this subduction continued along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane . The Gangdese intrudes the southern half of the Lhasa terrain . 
 Contact with India began along the Yarlung @-@ <unk> suture around 50 Ma during the Eocene , and the two continents continue to converge . <unk> continued in the Gangdese arc until as late as 40 Ma . There was significant crustal shortening as the collision progressed . The South Lhasa terrane experienced metamorphism and magmatism in the Early Cenozoic ( 55 – 45 Ma ) and metamorphism in the Late Eocene ( 40 – 30 Ma ) , presumably due to the collision between the continents of India and Eurasia . 
 Rocks in this region include sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic into which granite has intruded during the Cretaceous . The rocks have metamorphosed and are deeply eroded and faulted . The rocks exposed in the Reting Tsangpo canyon range in age from 400 Ma to 50 Ma . The result of faulting has been to often juxtapose relatively recent rocks with much older rocks . Some parts of the ocean floor were pushed up onto the Tibetan Plateau and formed marble or slate . Sea fossils from 400 Ma are found in the river 's canyons , and houses are roofed with slate . 
 The <unk> Basin lies between the <unk> Range to the northwest and the <unk> @-@ <unk> suture to the south . The Yangbajain Geothermal Field is in the central part of a half @-@ graben fault @-@ depression basin caused by the <unk> fault zone of the <unk> Mountains . The SE @-@ dipping detachment fault began to form about 8 Ma . The geothermal reservoir is basically a Quaternary basin underlaid by a large granite batholith . The basin has been filled with glacial deposits from the north and alluvial @-@ pluvial sediments from the south . Fluid flows horizontally into the reservoir through the faults around the basin . Chemical analysis of the thermal fluid indicate that there is shallow @-@ seated magmatic activity not far below the geothermal field . 
 During the ice ages of the last two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the expanded polar ice cap several times . As the ice moved it eroded the rock , filling the river canyons with gravel . In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock , and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids .

 The Lhasa valley is roughly the same latitude as the southern United States , but at an altitude of 3 @,@ 610 metres ( 11 @,@ 840 ft ) or more it is of course cooler . The central river valleys of Tibet are warm in summer , and even in the coldest months of winter the temperature is above freezing on sunny days .

Average annual precipitation is 466 @.@ 3 millimetres ( 18 @.@ 36 in ) , with 85 % falling in the June – September period . Typically there are 3 @,@ 000 hours of sunshine each year . It is cooler in the northern regions , warmer in the south . Annual figures : 
 Studies of temperature and precipitation data from 1979 to 2005 indicate that higher temperatures are leading to longer snow @-@ free periods at the lower elevations . However , at higher levels the amount of precipitation has increased , so despite warming the snow @-@ free period is shorter . 
 = = Environment = = 
 Most of the population of Tibet lives in the southern valleys , including those around Lhasa . The higher regions are used by nomadic <unk> who tend herds of yaks , sheep and goats on the steppe grasslands of the hills and high valleys . In the lower parts it is possible to cultivate products that include barley , wheat , black peas , beans , mustard , hemp , potatoes , cabbage , cauliflower , onions , garlic , celery and tomatoes . The traditional staple food is barley flour called <unk> , often combined with buttered tea and made into a paste . 
 A visitor described the valley around Lhasa in 1889 as follows , 
 The plain over which we are riding is a wonderfully fruitful one . It is skirted on the south by the Kyi river , and is watered , moreover , by another smaller stream from the north , which flows into the Kyi ... some five miles west of Lhasa . All this land is carefully irrigated by means of dikes and cross @-@ channels from both rivers . Fields of buckwheat , barley , pea , rape , and <unk> lie in orderly series everywhere . The meadows near the water display the richest emerald @-@ green pasturage . Groves of poplar and willow , in shapely clumps , combine with the grassy stretches to give in places a parklike appearance to the scene . Several hamlets and villages , such as Cheri , Daru , and Shing <unk> , are dotted over these lands . A fertile plain truly for a besieging army !

 The dams on the Lhasa river built as part of the Three Rivers Development Project are unlikely to affect the flow of the Brahmaputra in India . However , the climate and soil are unsuitable for large @-@ scale irrigation . Where grasslands have been converted into irrigated farms fed by dams the result may damage the environment . Jama wetland in Maizhokunggar County is vulnerable to grazing and climate change . Extensive mining in some mountainous regions have turned areas of what was green pasturage into a grey wasteland . The authorities are reported to have suppressed protests by the local people . Military personnel have been involved in efforts to protect and improve the environment , including replanting programs .

 Official census figures for 2000 are : 
 The census figures differ considerably from the Tibet Statistical Yearbooks for the same period , since the yearbook only includes the registered population and counts them based on place of origin rather than place of residence . The 1990 census used an approach similar to the yearbook , so the numbers are misleading , but the 2000 census tried to count people who had actually been present in Lhasa for over six months . The census distinguishes between " agricultural " and " non @-@ agricultural " registration , but this does not reflect the actual occupations of the people . Many with an " agricultural " registration may in fact work in the city or in a town . Also , the census was taken in November , when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet . Finally , the census does not count the military .

As of 2002 Qüxü County had one County Middle School , and 18 primary schools . Outside Lhasa most of the Tibetans do not understand the Chinese language , so Tibetan is the natural language for basic instruction . However , this may be affected by the availability of teachers and the preference of the local administration . As of 2003 the former bilingual mode of instruction had been changed to giving instruction in Chinese in some of the counties near Lhasa . Examination results were already poor in subjects such as mathematics and physics . Marks dropped further after the change .

 Yerpa , on a hillside in <unk> County , is known for its meditation cave connected with Songtsän Gampo . The cliffs contain some of the earliest known meditation sites in Tibet , some dating back to pre @-@ Buddhist times . There are a number of small temples , shrines and hermitages . Songtsän Gampo 's queen , Monza <unk> , founded the Dra Yerpa temple here . Jokhang in Chengguan District is the most sacred temple in Tibet , built in the 7th century when Songtsän Gampo transferred his capital to Lhasa . It was designed to house an image of Buddha that the Nepalese queen <unk> had brought . Later rulers and Dalai Lamas enlarged and elaborated the temple . 
 Ramoche Temple to the north of Jokhang is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after Jokhang , and was completed about the same time . <unk> <unk> Monastery is a small monastery located between the larger Jokhang temple and Barkhor in the city of Lhasa . It was the Lhasa seat of the former State Oracle who had his main residence at Nechung Monastery . It was destroyed during the persecution of Buddhism under <unk> ( c . 838 – 841 ) but rebuilt by Atiśa ( 980 – 1054 ) . The monastery was part of the Sakya sect at one <unk> but became Gelug under Sonam Gyatso , the 3rd Dalai Lama ( 1543 – 89 ) .

 The Nyethang Drolma Temple is southwest of Lhasa , 36 kilometres ( 22 mi ) from the county seat and 33 kilometres ( 21 mi ) from Lhasa . It is in <unk> , Qüxü County . Some sources say that Atiśa ( 980 – 1054 ) built the monastery , which was expanded after his death by his pupil Dromtön ( 1004 – 64 ) . Another version says that Dromtön raised funds to build the temple to commemorate his old friend . Dromtön built Reting Monastery in Lhünzhub County in 1056 . It was the earliest monastery of the Gedain sect , and the patriarchal seat of that sect . In 1240 a Mongol force sacked Reting monastery and killed 500 people . The <unk> was rebuilt . When the Gedain sect joined the Gelug sect in the 16th century the monastery adopted the reincarnation system . 
 Tsurphu Monastery in Doilungdêqên District was built in 1189 and is treated as a regional cultural relic reserve . The monastery was founded by <unk> <unk> , 1st Karmapa Lama , founder of Karma Kagyu school . It is the main Kagyu temple . The Drigung Monastery of the Kagyu Sect was founded in 1179 in Maizhokunggar County . It is the home of the Drikhung Kagyu School of the Kagyu sect . At one time Drigung was highly influential in both the political and religious spheres . It was destroyed in 1290 by Mongols led by a general from the rival Sakya sect , and although rebuilt was never able to regain its power . 
 Yangpachen Monastery in Yangbajain , Damxung County was historically the seat of the <unk> of Karma Kagyu . It is the main monastery of the Red Hat school of the Karma Kagyu sect . It was built in 1490 , and through extensive repairs and additions grew into a major architectural complex that contained a large collection of cultural relics . The Red Hat school of Karma Kagyu died out in 1791 . Other monasteries founded outside the Gelug tradition include <unk> Monastery of the Kagyu school , founded in 1180 in Lhünzhub County , and Nyêmo <unk> monastery of the <unk> school , founded in the 16th century in Nyêmo County .

The mountain is said to have the shape of a reclining elephant . The monastery includes Buddha halls , palace residences , Buddhist colleges and other buildings . 
 Drepung Monastery in Chengguan District was founded in 1416 by <unk> <unk> Tashi Palden ( 1397 – 1449 ) , one of Tsongkhapa 's main disciples . It was named after the sacred abode in South India of <unk> . At one time Drepung Monastery , with up to 10 @,@ 000 resident monks , was the largest in the world . Sera Monastery was not much smaller . Sera Monastery , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Lhasa , was founded in 1419 by Jamchen <unk> Shakya <unk> ( 1354 – 1435 ) , a close disciple of Tsongkhapa .

 Most of the monasteries in the prefecture @-@ level city suffered damage , and many were destroyed , before and during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 76 ) . Jokhang was used as a military barracks and a slaughterhouse during the Cultural Revolution , and then as a hotel for Chinese officials . Many of the statues were taken , or were damaged or destroyed , so most of the present statues are recent copies . Jokhang was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 . Ramoche Temple was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution but has been restored with assistance from the Swiss . The Nyethang Drolma Temple survived the Cultural Revolution without much damage , and was able to preserve most of its valuable artifacts , due to the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai at the request of the government of what is now Bangladesh . 
 Reting Monastery was devastated by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution , and has only been partially restored . Tsurphu monastery was reduced to rubble , but the huge temples and chanting halls have been rebuilt . Before and during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 76 ) Drigung Monastery was looted of almost all its collection of statues , stupas , thangkas , manuscripts and other objects apart from a few small statues that the monks managed to hide . The buildings were severely damaged . Reconstruction began in 1983 and seven of the fifteen temples were rebuilt . Yangpachen Monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution , but later was rebuilt . 
 Ganden Monastery was completely destroyed during the rebellion of 1959 . In 1966 it was severely shelled by Red Guard artillery , and monks had to dismantle the remains .

 = 33 ( Battlestar Galactica ) = 
 " 33 " is the first episode of first season and the pilot episode of the reimagined military science fiction television program Battlestar Galactica , immediately following the events of the 2003 miniseries . " 33 " follows Galactica and her civilian fleet as they are forced to contend with constant Cylon pursuit for days without sleep ; they are forced to ultimately destroy one of their own ships to foil the Cylons and earn their first respite of the series . 
 The episode was written by series creator Ronald D. Moore , and the television directoral debut of Michael Rymer . Moore and executive producer David Eick made the decision to slot this episode as the first of the season because of its potential impact on the audience . " 33 " distinguished the themes of the new Battlestar Galactica series by following characters on the spaceships , on the planets that were fled , and in the minds of other characters . Attention to detail was prevalent in this first episode ; the production team , the editing team , and even the actors themselves strove for authenticity of specific portrayals and moments . 
 Though there were compromises made due to concerns of the episode being too dark for audiences , the episode was lauded by both cast and crew in addition to winning the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form . " 33 " originally aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom on October 18 , 2004 , and subsequently aired on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on January 14 , 2005 , along with the following episode " Water " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Having fled the besieged Ragnar Anchorage , the convoy of refugee spaceships is relentlessly pursued and attacked by Cylon <unk> . The colonial fleet must execute a faster @-@ than @-@ light ( FTL ) jump every 33 minutes to escape the Cylons , who consistently arrive at the new jump coordinates approximately 33 minutes later . After over 130 hours and 237 jumps , the fleet 's crew and passengers , particularly those aboard Galactica , have been operating without sleep while facing the strain of nearly constant military action . 
 Upon the 238th consecutive jump , the Olympic Carrier ( a commercial passenger vessel with 1 @,@ 345 souls aboard ) is accidentally left behind and the attacks unexpectedly cease , allowing the fleet some respite . When it arrives three hours later , President Laura Roslin and Commander Adama order Capt. Lee " Apollo " Adama and Lt. Kara " Starbuck " Thrace to destroy it , believing that it has been infiltrated by Cylons and now poses a threat to the fleet 's safety . The colonial officers destroy the ship while the rest of the colonial fleet jumps away . Baltar 's internal Number Six explains to him that God is looking after his interests , implying that a scientist on the Olympic Carrier was preparing to reveal Baltar 's unwitting collusion with the Cylon attack on the colonies . After the fleet 's last jump , the Cylons do not return , and the President 's survivor whiteboard aboard Colonial One , the result of a fleetwide census , is updated with one additional soul ( to 47 @,@ 973 ) with the birth of the fleet 's first child aboard the Rising Star — a boy . 
 Meanwhile , on Caprica , Lt. Karl Agathon ( call sign " Helo " ) is captured by a Cylon patrol and then " rescued " from his Cylon captors by a Number Eight in the guise of his crewmate Sharon " Boomer " Valerii , who shoots a Number Six to free him . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Preparing for production of Battlestar Galactica 's first season , writer and series creator Ronald D. Moore wrote a short list of potential storylines , one of which was " the fleet jumps every 33 minutes ; because the Cylons are relentlessly pursuing them , the crew gets no sleep . " Conferring with fellow executive producer David Eick , the two decided that this story would be " the best way to kick off the season " . Moore described writing " 33 " as a great experience ; he wrote the whole script without a story outline or much structure , excited to begin the first episode of the first season and start the first year already " at the end of the road " . Moore wrote the episode over his Christmas break before the series was officially picked up ; he later claimed that this aspect was what made the episode " one of the more fun projects that [ he ] wrote all of the first season . " 
 David Eick found the episode to be a " standalone concept " that did not require having seen the miniseries to understand it . Because the miniseries ended " at a very happy place " , starting the series in the middle of a crisis without explanation , and showing the audience that " actually , while you — the audience — were away , really bad things have been happening " made for a much more intriguing and interesting story . " 33 " ' s complex storyline was a harbinger for episodes to come , and laid the groundwork with the network and audiences alike . 
 Moore explained on his blog that the number 33 had no hidden meaning or significance , only that he felt it sufficiently long to allow minor functions like snacking , showering , or cat napping , but was too short to allow anybody to gain any meaningful sleep and recharge their batteries . Further , Moore intentionally gave the number no meaning to avoid creating and inserting unnecessary technobabble into a drama @-@ driven episode . 
 = = Production = = 
 " 33 " was director Michael Rymer 's first television episode . He accepted the job without reading the script , saying that based on his writing experience , " 33 " went well beyond his expectations and excited him . Bear McCreary originally composed the musical theme " Boomer Theme " for this episode ; it was later expanded for use with the Athena character , before becoming the de facto " Hera Theme " for the character Hera Agathon in the fourth season episode , " <unk> in a Stream of Stars " . Joel Ransom was the director of photography for the miniseries , but when Eick learned he was unavailable for the series , he turned to Stephen McNutt , with whom he had worked on American Gothic . In the interim , McNutt had moved on to shooting in high @-@ definition video ; this was fortuitous for the production team because , while Ransom had filmed the miniseries on 35 mm film , the production team was switching to high @-@ definition video for the series . 
 Executive producer David Eick opined that " 33 " was the " silver bullet " that ultimately tipped the scales in their favor and convinced the Sci Fi Channel to pick up the series . The network 's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties ( Star Trek , Andromeda , Stargate ) . Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode 's DVD commentary . First , " 33 " went into Gaius Baltar 's ( James Callis ) mind and visited his house on Caprica ( shot in Lions Bay , British Columbia ) ; being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera @-@ type shows . Second was going back to the devastated Caprica and following @-@ up with Helo 's ( <unk> <unk> ) story . 
 With sleep deprivation one of the major plot points of the episode , actor Edward James Olmos ( William Adama ) liaised with an expert on the subject and the crew to best depict the actual effects realistically . Following up , director Michael Rymer gave each main cast member a specific symptom to play up , so as to avoid repetition on screen . Olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further , to immerse themselves by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night to emphasize what their expert was imparting . 
 In the episode 's DVD commentary , Moore and Rymer related how there were endless discussion about the clocks to feature in this episode . Concerns over digital versus analog , size and shape , the ratio of digital to analog clocks , whether they should run forwards or backwards , and whether any labels should be stenciled or hand @-@ drawn were all brought up . David Eick also noted that as of the commentary 's recording , the clock at Felix Gaeta 's ( Juliani ) station still had its " 33 " label affixed . 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 The first cut of " 33 " was ten minutes too long . Despite this , the production crew took extra care not to eliminate " human moments " in their efforts to trim the episode . These included a shot of Galen Tyrol ( Douglas ) and Cally Henderson ( Clyne ) walking across Galactica 's hangar bay , a shot of Crewman <unk> ( <unk> ) giving a bedraggled look over the shoulder of another crewmember , and a shot of PO2 Dualla ( McClure ) walking through Galactica 's remembrance corridor . 
 In a question @-@ and @-@ answer session , Moore revealed a scene written for , but cut from , the episode . In the cut scene , the recurring prop in the characters ' briefing room was to have been explicitly introduced and explained ; the prop remained in the series , but its backstory was cut . 
 There was a scene cut from " 33 " where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken on the roof of the capitol building on <unk> during the attack . The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire @-@ fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic . I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost . The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees ( possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion ) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city , while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame . The inscription below the photo on Laura 's plaque reads , " Lest We Forget " in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne 's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon . 
 Other cut scenes included one shot in the pilots ' head , showing the pilots " wrecked and exhausted [ ... ] with an exchange between Starbuck and Apollo " , as well as several shots of Commander Adama ( Olmos ) gagging and vomiting because of acid reflux brought on by sleep deprivation . Another line of Olmos ' — an ad @-@ lib about suicides in the fleet — was cut so as not to alienate audiences by being " too dark " . 
 As originally written and shot , when Apollo ( Jamie Bamber ) fires on the Olympic Carrier , it was made clear that he sees people inside . Moore wrote the scene to be strong and clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize " the uncompromising nature of the show . " This was an " enormous fight " between Moore and the network , with the latter feeling this was another scene that was " too dark " and had the potential to turn away audiences ; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact , they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order . To placate the network , Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and " cheated " ; instead , when Apollo flies by the Olympic Carrier , it is unclear whether or not there is anybody inside . In a " small act of defiance " , visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel snuck in small , indeterminate movement behind one or two of the Olympic Carrier 's windows on behalf of the production and writing teams . The episode also originally ended with Helo 's escape from the Cylons on Caprica ; again tasked by the network to keep the episode from being " too dark " , Moore wrote in an additional scene — President Roslin ( Mary McDonnell ) learning of the newborn — upon which to end the episode on a hopeful note .

 = Ralph d 'Escures = 
 Ralph d 'Escures ( died 20 October 1122 ) was a medieval Abbot of Séez , Bishop of Rochester and then Archbishop of Canterbury . He studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec . In 1079 he entered the abbey of St Martin at Séez , and became abbot there in 1091 . He was a friend of both Anselm of Canterbury and Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , whose see , or bishopric , he took over on Gundulf 's death . 
 Ralph was not chosen archbishop of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone . His election involved an assembly of the lords and bishops meeting with King Henry I of England . Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II , rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it . As archbishop , Ralph was very assertive of the rights of the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church . He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland . Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II . 
 Ralph suffered a stroke on 11 July 1119 and was left partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly from that time until his death on 20 October 1122 . A surviving English translation of a sermon delivered by Ralph is preserved in a manuscript in the British Library . The sermon survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ralph was the son of <unk> d 'Escures and his first wife <unk> , and a half brother of <unk> I , Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145 . The surname of de Turbine , by which he is sometimes known in older scholarship , is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil , Ralph 's successor at Canterbury . Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of St Martin at Séez in 1079 . St. Martin was a house founded by the Montgomery and Bellême families , and was still under their lordship . He became abbot of the house in 1091 , and his election was attended by Anselm , abbot of Bec . 
 = = Time in England = = 
 Soon afterwards Ralph paid a visit to England , perhaps to visit Shrewsbury Abbey , which was a daughter house of Séez . He may have been involved in the mediating the surrender of Robert of Bellême at Shrewsbury in 1102 , for some chroniclers state that it was Ralph who delivered the keys of the castle to King Henry I of England . In 1103 he took refuge in England from the demands of Robert of Bellême for homage . Ralph declined to do homage because Pope Urban II had ordered that no clergy could do homage to the laity . Robert was also demanding heavy taxes , and Ralph fled with Serlo , Bishop of Séez , who was also subjected to Robert 's demands . He passed his time in England with his friends Saint Anselm and Gundulf the Bishop of Rochester . He attended the translation of Saint Cuthbert 's remains at Durham , where he was one of examiners of the body , and declared the saint 's remains <unk> . In 1106 he visited Anselm at the Abbey of Bec , but probably did not try to assert himself at Séez . After Anselm was elected to the see of Canterbury , Ralph appears to have become part of the archbishop 's household . 
 In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester , having been nominated by Gundulf before his death . Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108 . He was at Anselm 's deathbed in April 1109 , and , afterwards , Ralph acted as administrator of the see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114 , when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor . The king had wanted his doctor , <unk> , who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon , but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed . The bishops also desired someone who was not a monk , or at least not one who was so close to Henry . As a compromise , Ralph was chosen , rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured . Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk , he was also a bishop , which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection . 
 = = Archbishop of Canterbury = = 
 It is noteworthy that , while Ralph was not chosen by the chapter of Canterbury alone , his election involved an assembly of the magnates and bishops meeting with the king . He was not selected solely by the king , nor solely by the bishops or chapter . Ralph received his pallium from the pope , rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it . It was only with difficulty , however , that Pope Paschal II was persuaded to grant the pallium , as the papacy was attempting to again assert papal jurisdiction over the English Church . It was Anselm of St Saba who brought the pallium to England , along with letters from Paschal complaining that the English Church was translating bishops from see to see without papal permission , that legates from the papacy were being refused entry to England and that the king was allowing no appeals to be made to the pope over ecclesiastical issues . In 1116 the pope even demanded the payment of Peter 's Pence , a payment direct to the papacy of a penny from every household in England . Ralph , when he took the pallium , professed " fidelity and canonical obedience " to the pope , but did not submit to the papal demands and , in fact , supported King Henry in opposing the pope 's demands . 
 As archbishop Ralph championed the rights of the see of Canterbury and the English church . He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland , writing to the pope that " the church of Canterbury has not ceased to provide pastoral care for the whole of Britain and Ireland , both as a benevolence and from its rights of primacy . " He advised the bishop of Llandaff that a new Llandaff Cathedral should be built and granted an indulgence to contributors . He even refused to consecrate Thurstan as Archbishop of York because Thurstan would not profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury , part of the Canterbury @-@ York dispute . At first , Ralph depended only on the king to demand Thurstan to submit , but later he appealed to the popes to force Thurstan to obey . His refusal brought him into a dispute with the papacy , for Pope Paschal II supported Thurstan . Ralph visited Rome in 1117 , but was unable to obtain an interview with Paschal as the pope had fled the city in front of an invading imperial army . Ralph had taken ill with an ulcer on his face during the trip to Rome and , for a time , it was feared that he would die . He recovered enough to continue on to Rome , however , although it was a fruitless trip . Despite instructions from Paschal ’ s successors , Gelasius II and Calixtus II , the archbishop continued to refuse to consecrate Thurstan , and Thurstan was still unconsecrated when Ralph died . Thurstan was eventually consecrated at Rheims by Pope Calixtus II in May 1119 , although the issue of primacy remained unresolved . 
 Although he feuded with York over the primacy , it appears clear that Ralph considered the Investiture Crisis settled in England for , in 1117 while visiting Rome , he took a neutral position as regards the issues between the Pope and the Emperor . In 1115 , however , he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David 's in the royal chapel , although Robert of Meulan , the king 's chief counsellor , advocated that the consecration must take place in the royal chapel according to ancient custom . The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation . He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in <unk> , as he attended the provincial synod , or Council of Rouen , held in 1118 . 
 = = Final years and legacy = = 
 Ralph suffered a stroke on 11 July 1119 as he was removing his vestments after celebrating Mass . From then until his death , Ralph was partially paralysed and unable to speak clearly . He was still involved in decision making and , in 1120 , he agreed to King Alexander I of Scotland 's suggestion that Eadmer become the next Bishop of St Andrew 's . Ralph was one of the lords consulted about the remarriage of Henry I to Adeliza of Leuven at London in 1121 . He also successfully asserted his right to celebrate the king 's new marriage , over attempts by Roger of Salisbury to officiate instead . Due to the damage from the stroke , Ralph was unable to perform the ceremony but , when Roger made an attempt to do so , Ralph successfully insisted on choosing the <unk> and William Giffard the Bishop of Winchester performed the marriage . Ralph died on 20 October 1122 , at Canterbury . He was buried in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 23 October 1122 . His nephew , John , was a clerk under Ralph , and later Ralph appointed him Archdeacon of Canterbury . After Ralph 's death , John was elected to the see of Rochester . 
 Ralph was regarded as a " witty , easygoing " man . The struggle with York , however , along with his illnesses and the effects of the stroke , turned Ralph in his last years into a quarrelsome person . Orderic Vitalis said that he was well educated and well loved by people . Even William of Malmesbury , no lover of ecclesiastics and always ready to find fault with them , could only find fault with him for his occasional lapses into unbecoming frivolity . 
 Ralph wrote a sermon for the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts , probably because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury , until shown to be Ralph 's in 1927 . A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library , Cotton Vespasian D. xiv . The Latin version , which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version , has been edited and published in 1997 . Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church , Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives , BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal is one of the first to take the usual form for bishop 's seals , with Ralph standing , in full vestments including a mitre , and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left . The seal took the form of a pointed oval . 
 = Bow Back Rivers = 
 Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is a complex of waterways between Bow and Stratford in east London , England , which connect the River Lea to the River Thames . Starting in the twelfth century , works were carried out to drain Stratford Marshes and several of the waterways were constructed to power watermills . Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames , and the other channels were called Abbey Creek , Channelsea River , City Mill River , Prescott Channel , Pudding Mill River , Three Mills Back River , Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River . 
 The rivers have been subject to change over centuries , with Alfred the Great diverting the river in 896 to create a second channel , and Queen Matilda bridging both channels around 1110 . Because the river system was tidal as far as Hackney Wick , several of the mills were tide mills , including those at Abbey Mills and those at Three Mills , one of which survives . Construction of the New River in the seventeenth century to supply drinking water to London , with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies , led to a lowering of water levels , and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation . Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767 , which resulted in the construction of the Hackney Cut and the Limehouse Cut , allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers . A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s , authorised by the River Lee ( Flood Relief ) Act , but by the 1960s , commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased . Deteriorating infrastructure led to the rivers dwindling to little more than tidal creeks , and they were categorised in 1968 as having no economic or long @-@ term future . 
 However , British Waterways decided that their full restoration was an important aim in 2002 , and the construction of the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site . It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge , but this did not happen . Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain . 
 = = Name = = 
 It is unclear when the individually named rivers became known collectively as Bow Back Rivers . Charles Tween , writing on behalf of the Lee Conservancy , referred to them as both the Stratford Back Rivers and the Stratford Back Streams in 1905 . The section to the west of the more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow Back River on a map of 1895 , but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River . Powell , writing in 1973 , still referred to them as the Stratford Back Rivers . 
 The 1939 edition of " Inland Waterways of Great Britain " , an early attempt to provide a guide for the leisure use of canals , noted that the River Lee had " several subsidiary canalised waterways " , and listed Bow Creek , Old River Lee , City Mills River and Waterworks River , but did not describe them collectively . Boyes and Russell writing in 1977 referred to them as the Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers , and by the sixth edition of " Inland Waterways of Great Britain " , published in 1985 , they were referred to as Bow Back Rivers . 
 The river which supplies the Bow Back Rivers has been known as the River Lee or River Lea , but modern usage tends to use " Lea " when referring to the natural river , and " Lee " when referring to the navigation , so that the Lee Navigation is a canalisation of the River Lea . The name Bow may derive from either an arched bridge over the River Lea in the 12th century or a bend in the road east of Bow Road station . 
 = = History = = 
 The Bow Back Rivers cross an area originally known as Stratford Marsh , an area of common Lammas land , where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day ( 1 August ) and Lady Day ( 25 March ) , but which was used for growing hay for the rest of the year . The Marsh was between Stratford @-@ Langthorne and Stratford @-@ at @-@ Bow . Little remains from pre @-@ history , but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end of a stone causeway across the marsh . Remains of a stone causeway have been found , but no traces of an associated road . The ford at Old Ford is of pre @-@ Roman origin , part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green . In the Roman era , a new road was built from London to the ford , which carried the principal road to Colchester . There may also have been a ford further south at Bow , and a further causeway existed between <unk> and Leyton , known as Wanstead Slip . 
 These crossings passed across a true marsh , either side of the River Lea . This wide , fast flowing river was then tidal as far as Hackney Wick , and navigable as far as Hertfordshire . Dates for the earliest use of the rivers by boats are unknown , although a late Bronze Age dugout canoe and parts of a Saxon barge have been found in the marshes at Walthamstow . The first alteration to the natural river may have been made by Alfred the Great , who cut another channel to strand a force of Danes in 896 , according to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . This lowered the tide head to Old Ford , and prevented large boats sailing the river until the 15th century . 
 During the reign of King Henry I between 1100 and 1118 , his wife Queen Matilda ( or Maud ) , on hearing of the problems of crossing the river at Old Ford , directed that the road should be routed further south , and paid for two bridges , one to cross the Lee and the other to cross the Channelsea River , from her own funds . She also paid for the road to be built between them , and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford @-@ atte @-@ <unk> , later Stratford @-@ le @-@ Bow , and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge . John Leland , writing in the 1500s , gives a more fanciful account , in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action . The addition of le @-@ Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus , meaning bow . 
 In 1135 , Stratford Langthorne Abbey was founded . The Abbey continued the process of draining Stratford marsh begun in the Middle Ages , and creating artificial channels to drive water and tide mills . A small river port developed at Stratford , mentioned in the 15th century , to serve the needs of Stratford Abbey and the mills at Stratford , and there is similar evidence in later centuries . The Abbey took on responsibility to maintain the marsh walls around Bow Creek , to keep the tidal waters out . The river was being used for the transport of goods and passengers by 1571 , when an Act of Parliament empowered the Lord Mayor of London to make improvements to the river to ensure that supplies of grain continued to reach the capital . These works included a new cut near the Thames , probably the section of river between Bow Tidal Gates and Old Ford , on which no tolls were to be charged , and a pound lock was constructed at Waltham Abbey , only the second to be built in England . 
 Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge there were three others , said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud 's causeway , although there is evidence that the mills pre @-@ dated the causeway . However , the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges , which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas 's , <unk> 's and <unk> mills . The last two were owned by the City of London , and the bridges were called <unk> and St Michael 's Bridges . An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas 's Bridge , but the miller did not complain as <unk> bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain . The names were eventually swapped , and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933 , which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River , the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River , while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in . 
 Crossing the Back Rivers by a series of low @-@ level bridges is the Northern Outfall Sewer which leads to the Abbey Mill Pumping Station , both of which were designed by Joseph Bazalgette in the 1860s . Today , the route of the embankment that encloses the sewer from Bow to Beckton is followed by a public footpath , The Greenway . 
 = = = Public water supply = = = 
 Water was extracted from the rivers to provide a public water supply . The opening of the New River in 1633 , a 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) channel built to bring water to London from Amwell springs , and soon afterwards from the River Lea near Ware , had a detrimental effect on both navigation and milling by reducing water levels . Around 1745 , the West Ham Waterworks Company built a waterworks at <unk> Mill in Stratford , the river on which it was located later being known as Waterworks River . The East London Waterworks Company was set up in 1807 , and built works at Old Ford , where they extracted water from the river . The supply to the works was moved further upstream in 1829 , and in 1830 they built a canal , running parallel to the Hackney Cut , so that water could be obtained from Lea Bridge . Much of the work was carried out by the contractor William Hoof , who had gained a reputation as a specialist tunnelling contractor , after working on Strood Tunnel for the Thames and Medway Canal and Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal . He worked on the waterworks project from 1829 until 1834 . Where there had been a reservoir to the south of the Middlesex Filter Beds weir in 1850 , maps from 1870 show the site occupied by a waterworks , and the canal which supplied the Old Ford works running beside the Hackney Cut . Another large reservoir , triangular in shape , was located between the old river and the Hackney Cut at Old Ford , with two connections to the old river . The water supply canal passed under the old river to feed two compensation reservoirs to the north of the Great Eastern Railway tracks . A covered reservoir was situated on the west bank of the old river . 
 The Waterworks River underwent considerable change over the years . In 1850 , it left the channel of the Old River Lee much further to the north , to the south @-@ west of Temple Mills railway depot . It was called Lead Mills Stream at this point . Near Temple Mills bridge , now on the A12 road , Channelsea River split off . The two channels ran parallel to the Old River Lee , before Channelsea River turned to the south @-@ east . There was another small connection between the Old River Lee and the Waterworks River called Bully Fence , where the northern Channelsea River is shown on modern maps . By 1870 , it was called Waterworks River as far north as Temple Mills depot , and by 1896 , its present connection to the old river near to Carpenters Road had been established . Twenty years later , the northern Waterworks River rejoined the Lee at Bully Fence , and the section between there and Carpenters Road had been filled in . At some point , the connection at Bully Fence became the main source for the Channelsea River , although the 1953 / 66 map still shows it connected to the remnants of the system to the north , for drainage . Administrative boundaries still follow the northern course of the Waterworks River . 
 = = = Navigation = = = 
 Although the River Lee was navigable up to Hertford , this had been achieved by the use of flash locks , where a single gate created a channel through a weir . These caused conflict between the <unk> and the millers , since operation of the lock lowered the water level above it , hindering the operation of the mill . In 1765 , the engineer John Smeaton was asked to survey the river , with a view to improving it " for the good of the public " . His report of September 1766 highlighted the need to replace the flash locks with the more modern locks or pen sluices , each with two sets of gates . Significantly for the Bow Back Rivers , he suggested a new cut from Lea Bridge to Old Ford , and another from Bow Tidal Gates to a basin at Limehouse . The first became known as the Hackney Cut , and the second as the Limehouse Cut . An Act of Parliament was obtained on 29 June 1767 , and work began . 
 The Limehouse Cut would give direct access to the River Thames , avoiding the tidal Bow Creek . It was expected to open in July 1770 , but some of the brickwork collapsed , and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770 . It closed again briefly in December , when a bridge collapsed into it , and it was soon decided that it was too narrow , and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length . This work was finished on 1 September 1777 . The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768 , and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768 . A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock ( close to Bow tidal gates ) . Work progressed quickly , and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769 . 
 The Act of 1767 had specified points on the river at which tolls could be collected , but had made no mention of tolls for use of Bow Creek , Bow Back Rivers , or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford , and these had remained toll @-@ free . An Act of Parliament obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates . To prevent opposition from the bargees , the Act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section . Once the lock was built , however , the trustees charged a toll for using it . This was unpopular , but there was still the option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide , which did not incur a toll . A clause to authorise the lock toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent Act of 1868 , and it was still the case in 1977 that a charge was made for using the lock but not for using the gates . 
 By 1821 , Stratford was served by a number of wharfs , some located on the Lea and others on the Channelsea River or other branches . In addition to wharfs for general goods , some specifically handled timber , chalk , stone , coal , or wheat . Several of the factories and mills had private wharfs . By this date , a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street . It was about 80 by 50 yards ( 73 by 46 m ) , and was connected to the river by its own channel . It was initially called Stratford Dock , later becoming <unk> Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust . Half of it had been filled in by 1896 , and the rest by 1920 . 
 In the 1860s , the income from the navigation had dropped , as a result of attempts to compete against the railways , but economies were made , and capital works continued . The lock at Lea Bridge was removed , and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south , which was built to take 100 @-@ ton barges , rather than the 40 @-@ ton barges specified by an Act of 1805 . Although the original Lee trustees , and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee , were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers , there was little incentive to maintain them , since they did not generate any revenue . Nor could they be closed , since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames , without causing flooding . 
 = = = Regeneration = = = 
 The rivers were run down by the 1920s and , with high unemployment in the area , West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant , with which to fund major improvements . In addition to work on the channels , Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated , Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock , and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed . It used up @-@ and @-@ over radial gates operated by winches , rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock . The gates were quadrant @-@ shaped , and were lowered into the bed of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock . An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work , called the River Lee ( Flood Relief ) Act , and work began the following year . The project was completed in 1935 . Before the work , there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River , and a large pool , the City Mill Pool , connecting to the City Mills River and Bow Back River . Marshgate Lock was situated to the west of the junction between the Pudding Mill River and Bow Back River . It was originally built in 1864 , by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates , a floodgate which had been built around 1847 . The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool , and had two sets of gates at its eastern end , to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west . It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map , but was called Ward Lock , after a local councillor , and is now known as City Mills Lock . The course of the Bow Back River was then straightened , and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed . Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in , as was most of the Three Mills Back River , and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed . Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to 50 feet ( 15 m ) , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width . 
 Prior to the work , the arrangement had been to regulate the navigation with the Pond Lane Flood Gates and Marshgate Lane tidal lock . The new lock at Carpenter 's Road gave access to the Waterworks River , providing barge access to Temple Mills . At high tides , the low headroom of the Northern Outfall Sewer aqueduct prevented access to the southern reaches of the system , and to allow access City Mill Lock was constructed near <unk> Road . In 2005 , the lock was partially restored as part of the planning gain required from the developers of the adjacent Bellamy Homes housing scheme . 
 The 1930s improvements included the construction of the Prescott Channel , designed to allow flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills . The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it , but these became redundant once the tide mills ceased to operate , and eventually seized up . They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted . 
 By the 1960s , only the Bow Back River , the City Mills River and the Channelsea River were still being used for commercial traffic . A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958 . As traffic ceased , the lock structures deteriorated , and by 2006 , City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused . The 1968 British Waterways Act had classified most waterways into commercial , cruising and remainder waterways . Remainder waterways were those for which the government of the time could see no economic future , and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe . The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category , and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways policy document in 2002 . 
 = = Olympics = = 
 The Olympic Stadium for the London 2012 Summer Olympics is constructed on former industrial land between the Lea Navigation to the west and the City Mill River to the east . The land was formerly bisected by the remains of the Pudding Mill River , but this was filled in to provide a site which was large enough . As part of the construction phase for the event , Three Mills Lock was constructed on the Prescott Channel . This consists of a barge lock , suitable for 350 @-@ tonne ( 344 @.@ 5 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 385 @.@ 8 @-@ short @-@ ton ) barges , and an adjacent sluice , which enables the water levels above the structure to be regulated , rather than navigation being subject to the tides . The lock was built to allow construction materials to be delivered to the site and spoil to be removed , and the final cost was £ 23 million , which included a sluice on the Three Mills Wall River . Work began in March 2007 , and the project lasted for just over two years . Despite hopes that it would transport 1 @.@ 75 million tonnes while the stadium was being built , very little commercial traffic used the new lock . 
 With water levels above the structure remaining fairly constant , £ 400 @,@ 000 was spent on refurbishing City Mills Lock . Although some work had been carried out in 2006 , including the fitting of new metal gates , it was not operational , and had not been used for around 40 years . The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation . The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010 . British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards , but the project was postponed until after the completion of the Olympic games , as temporary ' Land Bridges ' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium , some of which will be removed after the event . Following the Olympic games , it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft . 
 The Olympic Delivery Authority took the decision to culvert more of the Channelsea River , where it crossed the northern part of the site . It remains a designated main river , and so they had to liaise with the Environment Agency on matters of flood @-@ risk management , and a site was identified which would provide compensation for the loss of habitat caused by the <unk> . Much of the old River Lea was inaccessible to the public prior to the project , but is a central feature of the northern parklands that have been created . Two ' wetland bowls ' were designed , which have been planted with water @-@ loving plants such as reeds , rushes , sedges and iris . They also provide spawning grounds and refuges during flood conditions for fish , as well as providing storage capacity for flood water . It was the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain when it was completed , and most of the 350 @,@ 000 plants were grown in Norfolk from seeds and cuttings removed from the site . At the southern end of the site , the Waterworks River was reconstructed . Improvements in the 1930s created channels with vertical concrete sides , and little thought for habitat . The channel was made 26 feet ( 8 m ) wider , with sloping banks and ramps down to the water 's edge , and was improved visually and ecologically by the planting of aquatic marginal plants . 
 With the exception of Bow Creek , the Bow Back Rivers were closed for public access during the Olympics construction works , and remained closed until after the events . Access to sections of the Lee Navigation which pass close to the Olympic Stadium , including part of Bow River , part of the Hackney Cut , and the Hertford Union Canal were restricted during the summer of 2012 . The Bow Back Rivers were intended to form a major feature of the Olympic site . The stadium formed the centrepiece of the Olympics on an island site , with the Waterworks River to the east , and the Aquatics Centre on the eastern bank . Five new pedestrian bridges were built across the waterways to provide the principal access to the stadium .

 OSI is an American progressive rock band , originally formed by Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002 . Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore is the only other full @-@ time member of the band . The collaboration may be considered a studio project , as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently , sharing and developing tracks long @-@ distance , only coming together at the end of the process for mixing and additional tracking . The band 's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence , a short @-@ lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda . The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums , including Sean Malone , Steven Wilson , Mikael Åkerfeldt , Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison . 
 Matheos recruited Moore , Dream Theater 's then @-@ drummer Mike Portnoy and Sean Malone ( Fretless Bass and Chapman <unk> ) to perform on what was originally planned to be a Matheos solo album . Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a progressive metal album similar to Matheos ' work in Fates Warning , however Moore 's impact changed the music 's direction and genre , incorporating electronica into the original progressive metal sound . The band 's debut album was released by InsideOut Music in 2003 . 
 OSI was originally intended to be a one @-@ off project , but Matheos and Moore found they both had gaps in their schedules so produced a follow @-@ up . Free was released in 2006 , with Portnoy returning to play drums as a session musician rather than a full band member , due to personal and musical differences between him and Moore . Blood was released in 2009 , with Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison replacing Portnoy . The fourth album Fire Make Thunder was released in 2012 by Metal Blade Records , with Harrison once again on drums .

 Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos originally intended to create a progressive metal supergroup while Fates Warning went on hiatus . He recruited Cynic & Gordian Knot Fretless Bass and Chapman <unk> Sean Malone and then @-@ Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy to work on the project . Matheos then asked Chroma Key and ex @-@ Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard arrangements to the music he had written . Moore instead heavily edited the music , changing the song structures and adding vocals . Matheos decided to pursue this new direction , sounding closer to Chroma Key than standard progressive metal , over his and Portnoy 's original idea . 
 Many vocalists were considered to perform on the album ; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track . Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics , but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics . Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track . Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass , but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant he was unable to join Matheos , Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions . 
 Matheos , Moore and Portnoy recorded the album at Carriage House Studios in Stamford , Connecticut from June 2 to June 9 , 2002 . Songs with a strong progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos , while Moore had greater influence over the vocal @-@ driven tracks . Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not take part in the actual writing of the album . The album 's recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater . In 2009 , Portnoy recalled that he found the experience of making the record difficult , and that he was frustrated by the lack of collaboration between him and Moore . Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his return on the follow @-@ up album as a session drummer rather than full @-@ time member . 
 InsideOut Music released Office of Strategic Influence on February 17 , 2003 . Moore chose the group 's name and album 's title , referring to the Office of Strategic Influence , established by the US Government after the September 11 attacks to spread propaganda . The album was critically well received . Critics praised the members ' musicianship and the fact that the album differed significantly from the members ' other projects .

 Matheos and Moore did not plan to make a second OSI album , and returned to their own projects after the first album 's completion . In 2005 , they both had free schedules , so decided to produce a follow @-@ up album . Joey Vera ( also of Fates Warning ) played bass on the album . Portnoy originally told Matheos and Moore that he did not want to perform drums on the album , but was persuaded to perform on the album as a session musician . 
 Free was released on April 24 , 2006 , receiving generally positive critical reception . Critics noted that the album was darker and more keyboard @-@ focused than the band 's <unk> re : free , an EP featuring remixes of three tracks from Free , was released on October 24 , 2006 . The band were keen to tour in support of Free , but no live shows materialised . " The reality of it is in order to [ tour ] the way we would like ... and present it the way we would want to present it ... would cost too much money for the kind of fan base that we have right now , " Matheos said in 2009 . In 2010 he anticipated that OSI will " remain a studio band . " 
 In September 2008 , Moore posted an update on the Chroma Key website , stating that he and Matheos had been working on a third OSI album for several months . Portnoy was replaced by Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison and Matheos played bass on the album . Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt and No @-@ Man vocalist Tim Bowness wrote lyrics and sang on one track each . 
 Blood was released on April 27 , 2009 in Europe and May 19 in North America . The album received positive reviews : Andrew Reilly of <unk> said that " with Blood the two have finally found the stylistic fusion their first two discs hinted at " , and praised Harrison 's drumming .

 In 2010 , OSI signed with Metal Blade Records . The label reissued Office of Strategic Influence on September 28 , 2010 . 
 Written and recorded throughout most of 2011 , OSI 's fourth album " Fire Make Thunder " was released on March 27 , 2012 . Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree was once again enlisted as session drummer along with a co @-@ writing credit for the song " Enemy Prayer " . All other instruments and programming were performed by Matheos and Moore , while lyrics and vocals were handled exclusively by Moore . The recordings for the album , with the exception of drums , were performed at the musician 's respective home studio . In July 2011 at Sound Farm Studio & Recording Environment final overdubs as well as some additional writing and arranging were completed . The band mixed the album alongside engineer Matt <unk> . Engineer Roger Siebel handled the final mastering . The record was produced by both Moore and Matheos . During the development process , Kevin Moore kept frequent updates referring to the mixing process of the album on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Moore has described OSI 's sound as " a new approach to progressive rock " , combining elements of progressive metal and electronica . Moore considers the two genres to be " almost natural enemies " , and that the conflict between the two genres " keeps [ the music ] interesting " . Matheos cites progressive rock and heavy metal bands such as Genesis , Jethro Tull , Black Sabbath and UFO as influences . Moore described his influences as minimal techno , experimental , electronic musicians and " bands that play live and then chop it up " . 
 Matheos and Moore primarily work alone , exchanging files and ideas by email . The writing process for all OSI 's albums has been the same , with Matheos sending Moore an idea " from just a guitar riff to elaborate , almost completed songs " , which Moore then edits and sends back to Matheos . Moore , the band 's vocalist and lyricist , has described the process of writing lyrics as an " audio Rorschach test " . The lyrics on Office of Strategic Influence feature political themes , but the lyrics on later releases are less political , instead being based on Moore 's personal experiences . " I 'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something , " he said , " but then by the time I 'm finished the lyrics it 'll be about a relationship or something like that . " On Blood , Moore largely abandoned his earlier stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness approach to writing lyrics , in an attempt to make the lyrics more coherent . " I didn 't want it to be like ' Oh , you get your own impression of the lyrics . Everybody has their own idea ! ' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate , and something communicable , " he explained . 
 Moore has acknowledged the narrow range of his vocals . He considers his vocal style to " [ come ] from how I feel when I ’ m singing , when I 'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which , a lot of times , comes as the same time . It 's sort of an introspective time . A lot of the material lends itself to that kind of voice and that kind of spirit . "

 = First interracial kiss on television = 
 The first interracial kiss on television is a much debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss on television were . For a time , it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British soap opera Emergency – Ward 10 in 1964 . However , in November 2015 , a Granada Play of the Week , You in Your Small Corner , was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962 ; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor , Hot Summer Night , televised in Britain on 1 February 1959 . Competing claims have also been made in favor of I Love Lucy .

 The 1950s American television program I Love Lucy broadcast multiple instances of real @-@ life husband and wife Desi Arnaz , an Hispanic male , and Lucille Ball , a woman of North European ancestry , kissing . However , despite Arnaz and Ball being frequently described as an " interracial couple , " " Hispanic " is generally understood to be a catchall indicating persons of a Latin American or Iberian cultural background , as opposed to a race . Arnaz was usually considered to be a white male of Cuban ancestry . 
 = = = You in Your Small Corner and Hot Summer Night = = = 
 In June 1962 , a live performance of the play You in Your Small Corner by Barry Reckord was broadcast on British television as part of the series Granada Play of the Week . The central theme of the play is a relationship between a young black intellectual and a white working class girl . During the play , a kiss takes place between actors Lloyd Reckord and Elizabeth MacLennan , and what has been described as an " explicit post @-@ coital scene " . 
 You In Your Small Corner was rediscovered during preparations for a November 2015 British Film Institute panel discussion on " Race and Romance on TV " and was used in publicity for the event . As a result , panel moderator Samira Ahmed was able , on the night , to announce the rediscovery of an even earlier TV kiss by Lloyd Reckord , with Andrée Melly , in the ITV Armchair Theatre adaptation of Ted Willis 's play Hot Summer Night , broadcast on 1 February 1959 .

 One of the earliest interracial kisses on television occurred in a July 1964 episode of British soap opera Emergency Ward 10 , during which characters Louise Mahler ( portrayed by Joan Hooley ) and Giles Farmer ( portrayed by John White ) kissed . The scene in which Mahler and Farmer kissed was originally scripted to occur in Mahler 's bedroom , but was rewritten so as to occur outdoors , due to concerns it would otherwise be too risqué ( the earlier Lloyd Reckord plays had both been shown well after the 9pm adult @-@ content watershed ) . According to an issue of the Daily Express published after the episode aired , " not a viewer rang @-@ up to complain " . In a 2015 interview , conducted prior to the discovery of the You in Your Small Corner footage , Hooley noted that the historic importance of what had been known as the " first interracial kiss on television " had been inflated in popular memory : 
 A lot of people spoke about it more ten years later than they did at the time it was happening . So , it was much later that it occurred to me that I was part of history . I find it odd to have to admit that I was part of history because I don 't see why there should be anything to do about it . I don 't think there should have been all this fuss about it .

 The first interracial kiss on American network television is often attributed to a 1968 episode of Star Trek , " Plato 's Stepchildren " . 
 Other sources contend that both The Wild Wild West ( " The Night the Dragon Screamed " , aired 1966 Jan. 14 ) and I Spy had broadcast interracial kisses between Caucasian and Asian actors prior to the Star Trek episode . In addition , a December 1967 episode of Movin ' with Nancy featured a kiss between Nancy Sinatra and Sammy Davis , Jr . , more than a year before " Plato 's Stepchildren " aired . Further , some contend that " Plato 's Stepchildren " did not include an interracial kiss at all , full lip contact between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols not having occurred , the actors having turned their heads away from the camera at the last moment to present the illusion of a kiss . The latter point has been disputed , Shatner claiming that he and Nichols ' lips never fully touched , while Nichols has alternately asserted that the kiss was , in fact , real . 
 = Geographical name changes in Turkey = 
 Geographical name changes in Turkey have been undertaken , periodically , in bulk from 1913 to the present by successive Turkish governments . Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names , as part of the Turkification policy . The governments have argued that such names are foreign and / or divisive against Turkish unity . Names changed were usually of Armenian , Greek , Laz , Georgian , Bulgarian , Kurdish , Assyrian , or Arabic origin . 
 Turkey 's efforts to join the European Union in the early 21st century has led to a decrease in the incidence of such changes from local , and particularly the central government . In some cases legislation has restored the names of certain villages ( primarily those housing Kurdish minorities ) . Place names that have formally changed frequently persist in local dialects and languages throughout the ethnically diverse country . 
 The policy commenced during the final years of the Ottoman Empire and continued into the Turkish Republic . Under the Kemalist oriented government , specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names . Approximately 28 @,@ 000 topographic names were changed , which included 12 @,@ 211 village and town names and 4 @,@ 000 mountain , river , and other topographic names . Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of the country where minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population . Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered divisive and inappropriate .

 The Committee of Union and Progress took the reins of the Ottoman government through a coup d 'état in 1913 . At the height of World War I and during the final years of the Ottoman Empire , when the ethnic cleansing policies of non @-@ Muslim Greek , Armenian , and Assyrian minorities were underway , Minister of War Enver Pasha issued an edict ( ferman ) on October 6 , 1916 , declaring : 
 It has been decided that provinces , districts , towns , villages , mountains , and rivers , which are named in languages belonging to non @-@ Muslim nations such as Armenian , Greek or Bulgarian , will be renamed into Turkish . In order to benefit from this suitable moment , this aim should be achieved in due course . 
 General Directorate of State Archives of the Republic of Turkey , İstanbul Vilayet <unk> , no . <unk> , 23 <unk> 1331 ( October 6 , 1916 ) Ordinance of Enver Paşa 
 Enver Pasha did not change the geographical names belonging to Muslim minorities ( i.e. Arabs and Kurds ) due to the Ottoman government 's role as a Caliphate . His decree inspired many Turkish intellectuals to write in support of such measures . One such intellectual , Hüseyin Avni <unk> ( 1877 – 1921 ) , a Turkish soldier and author of books about Turkish language and culture , was inspired by the efforts of Enver Pasha , writing in his book Trabzon <unk> <unk> <unk> ? Türk <unk> ? ( Is the Trabzon province Laz or Turkish ? ) that : 
 If we want to be the owner of our country , then we should turn even the name of the smallest village into Turkish and not leave its Armenian , Greek or Arabic variants . 
 Only in this way can we paint our country with its colors . 
 It is not known how many geographical names were changed under the ordinance . The ultimate overarching objective behind it failed due to the collapse of the Ottoman government and trials of its leaders before Ottoman and European courts for massacres against ethnic minorities committed in 1915 . 
 A decreased level of cultural repression has taken place in the Turkish Republic , however non @-@ mainstream Turkic origin place names have invariably been officially renamed over the course of time .

 Turkish nationalism and secularism were two of the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic . Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the leader of the early decades of the Republic , aimed to create a nation state ( Turkish : <unk> ) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire . During the first three decades of the Republic , efforts to <unk> geographical names were a recurring theme . Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia , Kurdistan , or <unk> ( the official name of the province of Rize until 1921 ) were prohibited ( as was the case with Der Grosse <unk> , a map published in Leipzig ) . 
 Journalist and writer <unk> <unk> has noted that after the death of Ataturk and during the Democratic period of the Turkish Republic in the late 1940s and 50s , " ugly , humiliating , insulting or derisive names , even if they were Turkish , were subjected to changes . Village names with lexical components meaning red ( <unk> ) , bell ( <unk> ) , church ( <unk> , e.g. Kirk Kilise ) were all changed . To do away with " separatist notions " , the Arabic , Persian , Armenian , Kurdish , Georgian , Tatar , Circassian , and Laz village names were also changed . " 
 The Special Commission for Name Change ( Ad <unk> <unk> Komisyonu ) was created under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior . It brought together professors , politicians , generals , linguists , and academicians throughout Turkey to take up the task of official name changing . Among the commission 's participants were members of the Office of the General Staff , Ministry of Defense , Ministry of Education , and history and geography professors from Ankara University . The initiative proved successful , as approximately 28 @,@ 000 topographic names were changed , including 12 @,@ 211 village and town names and 4 @,@ 000 mountain , river , and other topographic names . This figure also included names of streets , monuments , quarters , neighborhoods , and other components that make up certain municipalities . By 1927 , all street and square names in Istanbul which were not of Turkish origin were changed . The campaign continued until 1978 , and was reintroduced after the military coup of 1980 in 1981 – 83 . During the heightened tension between Kurdish rebels and the Turkish government , the focus of geographical name changing in the 1980s was on Kurdish villages , towns , rivers , etc . 
 In 1981 , the Turkish government stated in the preface of <unk> , a publication dedicated to names of Turkish villages , that : 
 Approximately 12 @,@ 000 village names that are non @-@ Turkish , understood to originate from non @-@ Turkish roots , and identified as causing confusion have been examined and replaced with Turkish names , and put into effect by the Substitution Committee for Foreign Names functioning at the Directorate General for Provincial Governments in our Ministry . 
 At the culmination of the policy , no geographical or topographical names of non @-@ Turkish origin remained . Some of the newer names resembled their native names , but with revised Turkish connotations ( i.e. Aghtamar was changed to Akdamar ) . 
 = = = Current status = = = 
 Although geographical names have been formally changed in Turkey , their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country . At times , Turkish politicians have also used the native names of cities during their speeches . In 2009 , when addressing a crowd in the town of <unk> , president Abdullah Gul used the native name Norşin . Also that year , when talking about his family origins , Prime Minister Recep <unk> Erdogan used the native Greek name of <unk> instead of <unk> . 
 Efforts at restoring the former names of geographical terms have been recently introduced in Turkey . In September 2012 , legislation was introduced to restore the names of ( primarily Kurdish ) villages to their former native names . According to the bill , the province of <unk> would be named <unk> , <unk> would be named Norşin , and <unk> would be named <unk> .

 Most of the geographical name changes occurred in the eastern provinces of the country and on the coast of the eastern Black Sea , where minority populations tend to live .

 = = = Armenian = = = 
 Armenian geographic names were first changed under the reign of Sultan <unk> II . In 1880 , the word Armenia was banned from use in the press , schoolbooks , and governmental establishments , to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan . Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century . It included the Turkification of last names , change of animal names , change of the names of Armenian historical figures ( i.e. the name of the prominent <unk> family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani ) , and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events . 
 Most Armenian geographical names were in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire . Villages , settlements , or towns that contain the suffix <unk> , meaning built or built by ( i.e. <unk> ( today <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , <unk> , meaning village ( i.e. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , and <unk> , meaning town ( i.e. <unk> , Nakhichevan , <unk> ) , signify an Armenian name . Throughout Ottoman history , Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names ( i.e. the Armenian <unk> was changed to Norşin ) . This was especially true after the Armenian genocide , when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population . 
 Sevan Nişanyan estimates that 3 @,@ 600 Armenian geographical locations have been changed .

 Most Assyrian name changes occurred in the southeast of Turkey near the Syrian border in the Tur Abdin region . The Tur Abdin ( Syriac : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a hilly region incorporating the eastern half of Mardin Province , and Şırnak Province west of the Tigris , on the border with Syria . The name ' Tur Abdin ' is from the Syriac language meaning ' mountain of the servants ( of God ) ' . Tur Abdin is of great importance to Syriac Orthodox Christians , for whom the region used to be a monastic and cultural heartland . The Assyrian / Syriac people of Tur Abdin call themselves <unk> and <unk> , and traditionally speak an Eastern Aramaic dialect called <unk> . 
 After the Assyrian genocide , the Assyrians of the region were either depopulated or massacred . Currently , there are 5 , 000 Assyrians living in the region . 
 Nişanyan estimates that 400 Assyrian geographical locations have been changed .

 Many of the Greek names have maintained their origins from the Byzantine empire and Empire of Trebizond era . 
 With the establishment of the Ottoman empire , many Turkish name changes have continued to retain their Greek origins . For example , the modern name " İzmir " derives from the former Greek name <unk> " Smyrna " , through the first two syllables of the phrase " εις <unk> " ( pronounced " is <unk> " ) , which means " to Smyrna " in Greek . A similar etymology also applies to other Turkish cities with former Greek names , such as <unk> ( from the phrase " is <unk> " , meaning " to Nicaea " ) , Istanbul ( from the phrase " is tan <unk> " or " to the City " ) , or even for the Greek island of Kos , called " <unk> " in Turkish .

 The Kurdish geographical name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire due to the Islamic religious orientation of Kurds . During the Republican era and especially after the <unk> massacre , Kurdish geographical name changes became more common . During the Turkish Republican era , the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned . The Turkish government had disguised the presence of the Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks . This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980 . 
 Also included in the category of Kurdish geographical name changes are <unk> , which is considered among Kurdish group , along with <unk> . Nişanyan estimates that 4 @,@ 000 Kurdish geographical locations have been changed .

 = Solar energy = 
 Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever @-@ evolving technologies such as solar heating , photovoltaics , solar thermal energy , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis . 
 It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power . Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems , concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy . Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun , selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light @-@ dispersing properties , and designing spaces that naturally circulate air . 
 The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity . The United Nations Development Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1 @,@ 575 – 49 @,@ 837 exajoules ( EJ ) . This is several times larger than the total world energy consumption , which was 559 @.@ 8 EJ in 2012 . 
 In 2011 , the International Energy Agency said that " the development of affordable , inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer @-@ term benefits . It will increase countries ’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous , inexhaustible and mostly import @-@ independent resource , enhance sustainability , reduce pollution , lower the costs of mitigating global warming , and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise . These advantages are global . Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments ; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared " . 
 = = Potential = = 
 The Earth receives 174 @,@ 000 terawatts ( TW ) of incoming solar radiation ( insolation ) at the upper atmosphere . Approximately 30 % is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds , oceans and land masses . The spectrum of solar light at the Earth 's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near @-@ infrared ranges with a small part in the near @-@ ultraviolet . Most of the world 's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150 @-@ 300 watts / m ² , or 3 @.@ 5 @-@ 7 @.@ 0 kWh / m ² per day . 
 Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth 's land surface , oceans – which cover about 71 % of the globe – and atmosphere . Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises , causing atmospheric circulation or convection . When the air reaches a high altitude , where the temperature is low , water vapor condenses into clouds , which rain onto the Earth 's surface , completing the water cycle . The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection , producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind , cyclones and anti @-@ cyclones . Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 ° C. By photosynthesis , green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy , which produces food , wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived . 
 The total solar energy absorbed by Earth 's atmosphere , oceans and land masses is approximately 3 @,@ 850 @,@ 000 exajoules ( EJ ) per year . In 2002 , this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year . Photosynthesis captures approximately 3 @,@ 000 EJ per year in biomass . The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth 's non @-@ renewable resources of coal , oil , natural gas , and mined uranium combined , 
 The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography , time variation , cloud cover , and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire . 
 Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation . However , the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator . Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb . This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day . Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells . 
 In addition , land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels . Roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells , as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way . Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established . 
 Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture , convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world , mostly depending on distance from the equator . Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends , all renewable energies , other than Geothermal power and Tidal power , derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun . 
 Active solar techniques use photovoltaics , concentrated solar power , solar thermal collectors , pumps , and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs . Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties , designing spaces that naturally circulate air , and referencing the position of a building to the Sun . Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies , while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies . 
 In 2000 , the United Nations Development Programme , UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs , and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation , cloud cover , and the land that is usable by humans . The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1 @,@ 575 – 49 @,@ 837 EJ per year ( see table below ) .

 = = = Early commercial adaptation = = = 
 In 1897 , Frank Shuman , a U.S. inventor , engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether , which has a lower boiling point than water , and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine . In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants . He , along with his technical advisor <unk> Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys , developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes , increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether . Shuman then constructed a full @-@ scale steam engine powered by low @-@ pressure water , enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912 . 
 Shuman built the world ’ s first solar thermal power station in Maadi , Egypt , between 1912 and 1913 . His plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45 – 52 kilowatts ( 60 – 70 hp ) engine that pumped more than 22 @,@ 000 litres ( 4 @,@ 800 imp gal ; 5 @,@ 800 US gal ) of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields . Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy , Shuman ’ s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy . In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy 's utilization , saying : 
 We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun . 
 = = = Water heating = = = 
 Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water . In low geographical latitudes ( below 40 degrees ) from 60 to 70 % of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60 ° C can be provided by solar heating systems . The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors ( 44 % ) and glazed flat plate collectors ( 34 % ) generally used for domestic hot water ; and unglazed plastic collectors ( 21 % ) used mainly to heat swimming pools . 
 As of 2007 , the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 154 thermal gigawatt ( GWth ) . China is the world leader in their deployment with 70 GWth installed as of 2006 and a long @-@ term goal of 210 GWth by 2020 . Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 % of homes using them . In the United States , Canada , and Australia , heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005 . 
 = = = Heating , cooling and ventilation = = = 
 In the United States , heating , ventilation and air conditioning ( HVAC ) systems account for 30 % ( 4 @.@ 65 EJ / yr ) of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50 % ( 10 @.@ 1 EJ / yr ) of the energy used in residential buildings . Solar heating , cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy . 
 Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat — heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy . Common thermal mass materials include stone , cement and water . Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night . However , they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well . The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate , daylighting and shading conditions . When properly incorporated , thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment . 
 A solar chimney ( or thermal chimney , in this context ) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building . As the chimney warms , the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building . Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses . 
 Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling . When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere , their leaves provide shade during the summer , while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter . Since bare , leafless trees shade 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of incident solar radiation , there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating . In climates with significant heating loads , deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator @-@ facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability . They can , however , be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain . 
 = = = Cooking = = = 
 Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking , drying and pasteurization . They can be grouped into three broad categories : box cookers , panel cookers and reflector cookers . The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767 . A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid . It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90 – 150 ° C ( 194 – 302 ° F ) . Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers . Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries ( dish , trough , Fresnel mirrors ) to focus light on a cooking container . These cookers reach temperatures of 315 ° C ( 599 ° F ) and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun . 
 = = = Process heat = = = 
 Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish , trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications . The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project ( <unk> ) in Shenandoah , Georgia , USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50 % of the process heating , air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory . This grid @-@ connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water , and had a one @-@ hour peak load thermal storage . Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation . The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy . Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams . Clothes lines , <unk> , and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas . In some states of the United States legislation protects the " right to dry " clothes . <unk> transpired collectors ( UTC ) are perforated sun @-@ facing walls used for preheating ventilation air . <unk> can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 ° C ( 40 ° F ) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45 – 60 ° C ( 113 – 140 ° F ) . The short payback period of transpired collectors ( 3 to 12 years ) makes them a more cost @-@ effective alternative than glazed collection systems . As of 2003 , over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35 @,@ 000 square metres ( 380 @,@ 000 sq ft ) had been installed worldwide , including an 860 m2 ( 9 @,@ 300 sq ft ) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1 @,@ 300 m2 ( 14 @,@ 000 sq ft ) collector in Coimbatore , India , used for drying marigolds . 
 = = = Water treatment = = = 
 Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable . The first recorded instance of this was by 16th @-@ century Arab alchemists . A large @-@ scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas . The plant , which had solar collection area of 4 @,@ 700 m2 ( 51 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , could produce up to 22 @,@ 700 L ( 5 @,@ 000 imp gal ; 6 @,@ 000 US gal ) per day and operate for 40 years . Individual still designs include single @-@ slope , double @-@ slope ( or greenhouse type ) , vertical , conical , inverted absorber , multi @-@ wick , and multiple effect . These stills can operate in passive , active , or hybrid modes . Double @-@ slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes , while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large @-@ scale applications . 
 Solar water disinfection ( <unk> ) involves exposing water @-@ filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) bottles to sunlight for several hours . Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions . It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage . Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water . 
 Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity . A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis , although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable . 
 = = Electricity production = = 
 Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity , either directly using photovoltaics ( PV ) , or indirectly using concentrated solar power ( CSP ) . CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . PV converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect . 
 Solar power is anticipated to become the world 's largest source of electricity by 2050 , with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption , respectively . 
 Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s . Since 1985 the eventually 354 MW SEGS CSP installation , in the Mojave Desert of California , is the largest solar power plant in the world . Other large CSP plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station , both in Spain . The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project , in the United States , and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India , are the world ’ s largest photovoltaic plants . Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed , but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW , which are connected to the grid using net metering and / or a feed @-@ in tariff . In 2013 solar generated less than 1 % of the world 's total grid electricity . 
 = = = Photovoltaics = = = 
 In the last two decades , photovoltaics ( PV ) , also known as solar PV , has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source . A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect . The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s . In 1931 a German engineer , Dr Bruno Lange , developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide . Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 % of incident light into electricity , both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery . Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s , researchers Gerald Pearson , Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954 . These early solar cells cost 286 USD / watt and reached efficiencies of 4 @.@ 5 – 6 % . By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20 % , and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40 % . 
 = = = Concentrated solar power = = = 
 Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP ) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam . The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant . A wide range of concentrating technologies exists ; the most developed are the parabolic trough , the concentrating linear fresnel reflector , the Stirling dish and the solar power tower . Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light . In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight , and is then used for power generation or energy storage .

 Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history . Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese , who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth .
