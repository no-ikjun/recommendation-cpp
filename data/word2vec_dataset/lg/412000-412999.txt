 Aside from the official forms of their respective languages , the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms . The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically : in the German @-@ speaking regions , Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since the second half of the 20th century , especially in the media , such as radio and television , and are used as an everyday language , while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication ( c.f. diglossic usage of a language ) . Conversely , in the French @-@ speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared ( only 6 @.@ 3 % of the population of Valais , 3 @.@ 9 % of Fribourg , and 3 @.@ 1 % of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century ) , while in the Italian @-@ speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation . 
 The principal official languages ( German , French , and Italian ) have terms , not used outside of Switzerland , known as Helvetisms . German Helvetisms are , roughly speaking , a large group of words typical of Swiss Standard German , which do not appear either in Standard German , nor in other German dialects . These include terms from Switzerland 's surrounding language cultures ( German <unk> from French ) , from similar term in another language ( Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion ) . The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms , which are equally known as Helvetisms . The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary , phrases , and pronunciation , but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise . Duden , one of the prescriptive sources for Standard German , is aware of about 3000 Helvetisms . Current French dictionaries , such as the Petit Larousse , include several hundred Helvetisms . 
 Learning one of the other national languages at school is compulsory for all Swiss pupils , so many Swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual , especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Swiss citizens are universally required to buy health insurance from private insurance companies , which in turn are required to accept every applicant . While the cost of the system is among the highest it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes ; patients who are citizens have been reported as being , in general , highly satisfied with it . In 2012 , life expectancy at birth was 80 @.@ 4 years for men and 84 @.@ 7 years for women — the highest in the world . However , spending on health is particularly high at 11 @.@ 4 % of GDP ( 2010 ) , on par with Germany and France ( 11 @.@ 6 % ) and other European countries , and notably less than spending in the USA ( 17 @.@ 6 % ) . From 1990 , a steady increase can be observed , reflecting the high costs of the services provided . With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies , health spending will likely continue to rise . 
 = = = Urbanization = = = 
 Between two thirds and three quarters of the population live in urban areas . Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years . Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2 @,@ 000 years . This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use . However , from the beginning of the 21st century , the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside . 
 Switzerland has a dense network of cities , where large , medium and small cities are complementary . The plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of human presence . The weight of the largest metropolitan areas , which are Zürich , Geneva – Lausanne , Basel and Bern tend to increase . In international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests . In addition the two main centers of Zürich and Geneva are recognized for their particularly great quality of life . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Switzerland has no official state religion , though most of the cantons ( except Geneva and Neuchâtel ) recognize official churches , which are either the Catholic Church or the ( Protestant ) Swiss Reformed Church . These churches , and in some cantons also the Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations , are financed by official taxation of adherents . 
 Christianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland ( about 71 % of resident population and 75 % of Swiss citizens ) , divided between the Catholic Church ( 38 @.@ 21 % of the population ) , the Swiss Reformed Church ( 26 @.@ 93 % ) , further Protestant churches ( 2 @.@ 89 % ) and other Christian denominations ( 2 @.@ 79 % ) . There has been a recent rise in Evangelicalism . Immigration has established Islam ( 4 @.@ 95 % ) and Eastern Orthodoxy ( around 2 % ) as sizeable minority religions . According to a 2015 poll by Gallup International , 12 % of Swiss people self @-@ identified as " convinced atheists . " 
 As of the 2000 census other Christian minority communities included Neo @-@ Pietism ( 0 @.@ 44 % ) , Pentecostalism ( 0 @.@ 28 % , mostly incorporated in the Schweizer <unk> ) , Methodism ( 0 @.@ 13 % ) , the New Apostolic Church ( 0 @.@ 45 % ) , Jehovah 's Witnesses ( 0 @.@ 28 % ) , other Protestant denominations ( 0 @.@ 20 % ) , the Old Catholic Church ( 0 @.@ 18 % ) , other Christian denominations ( 0 @.@ 20 % ) . Non @-@ Christian religions are Hinduism ( 0 @.@ 38 % ) , Buddhism ( 0 @.@ 29 % ) , Judaism ( 0 @.@ 25 % ) and others ( 0 @.@ 11 % ) ; 4 @.@ 3 % did not make a statement . 21 @.@ 4 % in 2012 declared themselves as <unk> i.e. not affiliated with any church or other religious body ( Agnostic , Atheist , or just not related to any official religion ) . 
 The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant , with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country . Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536 , just before John Calvin arrived there . One canton , Appenzell , was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597 . The larger cities and their cantons ( Bern , Geneva , Lausanne , Zürich and Basel ) used to be predominantly Protestant . Central Switzerland , the Valais , the Ticino , Appenzell <unk> , the Jura , and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic . The Swiss Constitution of 1848 , under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg , consciously defines a <unk> state , allowing the peaceful co @-@ existence of Catholics and Protestants . A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78 @.@ 9 % of the voters . Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority , not because they were growing in members , quite the contrary , but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body ( 21 @.@ 4 % in Switzerland , 2012 ) especially in traditionally Protestant regions , such as Basel @-@ City ( 42 % ) , canton of Neuchâtel ( 38 % ) , canton of Geneva ( 35 % ) , canton of Vaud ( 26 % ) , or Zürich city ( city : > 25 % ; canton : 23 % ) . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Three of Europe 's major languages are official in Switzerland . Swiss culture is characterised by diversity , which is reflected in a wide range of traditional customs . A region may be in some ways strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language , the country itself being rooted in western European culture . The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception , it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition . 
 Switzerland is home to many notable contributors to literature , art , architecture , music and sciences . In addition the country attracted a number of creative persons during time of unrest or war in Europe . Some 1000 museums are distributed through the country ; the number has more than tripled since 1950 . Among the most important cultural performances held annually are the Paléo Festival , Lucerne Festival , the Montreux Jazz Festival , the Locarno International Film Festival and the Art Basel . 
 Alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the Swiss national identity . Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter , and a hiking ( ger : das <unk> ) or Mountain biking culture in summer . Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism , yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors . A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities . Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country . In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music , dance , poetry , wood carving and embroidery . The <unk> , a trumpet @-@ like musical instrument made of wood , has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 As the Confederation , from its foundation in 1291 , was almost exclusively composed of German @-@ speaking regions , the earliest forms of literature are in German . In the 18th century , French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere , while the influence of the French @-@ speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before . 
 Among the classics of Swiss German literature are Jeremias Gotthelf ( 1797 – 1854 ) and Gottfried Keller ( 1819 – 1890 ) . The undisputed giants of 20th century Swiss literature are Max Frisch ( 1911 – 91 ) and Friedrich Dürrenmatt ( 1921 – 90 ) , whose repertoire includes Die <unk> ( The Physicists ) and Das <unk> ( The Pledge ) , released in 2001 as a Hollywood film . 
 Prominent French @-@ speaking writers were Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau ( 1712 – 1778 ) and Germaine de Staël ( 1766 – 1817 ) . More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand <unk> ( 1878 – 1947 ) , whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers , set in a harsh environment and Blaise Cendrars ( born Frédéric <unk> , 1887 – 1961 ) . Also Italian and Romansh @-@ speaking authors contributed but in more modest way given their small number . 
 Probably the most famous Swiss literary creation , Heidi , the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps , is one of the most popular children 's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland . Her creator , Johanna <unk> ( 1827 – 1901 ) , wrote a number of other books on similar themes . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 The freedom of the press and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the federal constitution of Switzerland . The Swiss News Agency ( SNA ) broadcasts information around @-@ the @-@ clock in three of the four national languages — on politics , economics , society and culture . The SNA supplies almost all Swiss media and a couple dozen foreign media services with its news . 
 Switzerland has historically boasted the greatest number of newspaper titles published in proportion to its population and size . The most influential newspapers are the German @-@ language <unk> @-@ Anzeiger and Neue Zürcher Zeitung <unk> , and the French @-@ language Le Temps , but almost every city has at least one local newspaper . The cultural diversity accounts for a large number of newspapers . 
 The government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media , especially due to finance and licensing . The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation , whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR , is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programs . SRG SSR studios are distributed throughout the various language regions . Radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programs are produced in Geneva , Zürich and Lugano . An extensive cable network also allows most Swiss to access the programs from neighboring countries . 
 = = = Sports = = = 
 Skiing , snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland , the nature of the country being particularly suited for such activities . Winter sports are practiced by the natives and tourists since the second half of the 19th century with the invention of bobsleigh in St. Moritz . The first world ski championships were held in Mürren ( 1931 ) and St. Moritz ( 1934 ) . The latter town hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and the fifth edition in 1948 . Among the most successful skiers and world champions are <unk> Zurbriggen and Didier <unk> . 
 Most prominently watched sport events in Switzerland are football , ice hockey , Alpin skiing , " <unk> " , and tennis . 
 The headquarters of the international football 's and ice hockey 's governing bodies , the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) and International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) , are located in Zürich . Actually many other headquarters of international sports <unk> are to be found in Switzerland . For example , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , IOC 's Olympic Museum and the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) are located in Lausanne . 
 Switzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup , and was the joint host , with Austria , of the Euro 2008 tournament . The Swiss Super League is the nation 's professional football club league . Europe 's highest football pitch , at 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) above sea level , is located in Switzerland and is named the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium . 
 Many Swiss also follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 clubs in the League A , which is the most attended league in Europe . In 2009 , Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time . It also became World Vice @-@ Champion in 2013 . The numerous lakes make Switzerland an attractive place for sailing . The largest , Lake Geneva , is the home of the sailing team <unk> which was the first European team to win the America 's Cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007 . Tennis has become an increasingly popular sport , and Swiss players such as Martina Hingis , Roger Federer , and most recently , Stanislas Wawrinka have won multiple Grand Slams . Swiss professional wrestler Claudio Castagnoli is currently signed with WWE , and is a former United States champion . 
 Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland following the 1955 Le Mans disaster with exception to events such as Hillclimbing . During this period , the country still produced successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni , Sébastien Buemi , Jo <unk> , Dominique <unk> , successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu , 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Marcel <unk> and 2015 24 Hours Nürburgring winner Nico Müller . Switzerland also won the <unk> World Cup of Motorsport in 2007 – 08 with driver Neel Jani . Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the <unk> category . In June 2007 the Swiss National Council , one house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland , voted to overturn the ban , however the other house , the Swiss Council of States rejected the change and the ban remains in place . 
 Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or " <unk> " . It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some . <unk> is another indigenous Swiss sport , which is like a cross between baseball and golf . <unk> is the Swiss variant of stone put , a competition in throwing a heavy stone . Practiced only among the alpine population since prehistoric times , it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century . It is also central to the <unk> , first held in 1805 , with its symbol the 83 @.@ 5 kg stone named <unk> . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted . While some dishes such as fondue , <unk> or <unk> are omnipresent through the country , each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages . Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to those in other European countries , as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as <unk> or Emmental , produced in the valleys of Gruyères and Emmental . The number of fine @-@ dining establishments is high , particularly in western Switzerland . 
 Chocolate has been made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its reputation at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as <unk> and tempering which enabled its production on a high quality level . Also a breakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel Peter . The Swiss are the world 's largest consumers of chocolate . 
 Due to the popularization of processed foods at the end of the 19th century , Swiss health food pioneer Maximilian Bircher @-@ Benner created the first nutrition @-@ based therapy in form of the well @-@ known rolled oats cereal dish , called <unk> . 
 The most popular alcoholic drink in Switzerland is wine . Switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in <unk> , with their specific mixes of soil , air , altitude and light . Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais , Vaud ( <unk> ) , Geneva and Ticino , with a small majority of white wines . Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era , even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin . The most widespread varieties are the <unk> ( called <unk> in Valais ) and Pinot noir . The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino . 
 = North Shore Towers = 
 The North Shore Towers and Country Club is a three @-@ building residential cooperative located in the Floral Park neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens , near the city 's border with Nassau County . The complex is located next to the Long Island Jewish Medical Center . 
 The three constituent residential buildings — Amherst , Beaumont , and Coleridge Towers — which sit on a 110 @-@ acre ( 45 ha ) property , are some of the tallest structures in Queens with 34 floors each . The towers are constructed on the highest point of land in Queens , a hill located 258 feet ( 79 m ) above sea level . This hill is part of the terminal moraine of the last glacial period . The North Shore Towers complex contains 1 @,@ 844 apartments ranging from studios to three @-@ bedroom apartments . 
 The North Shore Towers complex has an 18 @-@ hole golf course and its own power plant that produces electricity independent of local power companies . The community also has an indoor shopping concourse that connects the three residential buildings with 22 retail units , as well as fitness centers that include five swimming pools and five tennis courts . The North Shore Towers is the only gated residential community in New York with its own United States Postal Service zip code , <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 The neighborhood where the North Shore Towers were built was a rural , unnamed section of Flushing , part of a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 8 @,@ 100 ha ) land grant to Massachusetts settlers . In 1923 , the Glen Oaks Golf Club was built , created on 167 acres ( 68 ha ) purchased from William K. Vanderbilt II 's country estate . By 1971 , the golf course was replaced by the North Shore Towers . The North Shore Towers were constructed in Glen Oaks because of Queens 's lax zoning rules , which are less restrictive than those in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island . Some Glen Oaks residents , mostly single @-@ home dwellers , protested the construction of the North Shore Towers because they were afraid it would dominate the horizon . However , it was a highly anticipated " big Queens project " for most New Yorkers . 
 The North Shore Towers were originally built as rentals , but in 1985 a filing with the New York State Attorney General 's office sought to convert the complex into cooperative apartments . At the time , this was touted as the most expensive conversion in New York City ’ s history . In 1987 , all but 150 units of the North Shore Towers complex were successfully converted to a co @-@ op under a <unk> plan . 
 The buildings are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units are designed to stop the spread of flames , also known as compartmentalization . This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette , where no one was seriously injured because the fire was self @-@ contained . 
 In 2000 , a North Shore Towers resident noticed a zip code error when making an online purchase . After further investigation in 2001 , it was determined that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8 @.@ 5 % instead of the New York City sales tax of 8 @.@ 25 % because the zip codes cross the city line . Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County . This error was corrected by late 2001 . 
 = = = Energy independence = = = 
 The North Shore Towers complex has a self @-@ generating power plant that produces electricity independent of local power companies , which as of December 31 , 1996 had a 8 @.@ 9 megawatt capacity . This was noted during the New York City Blackout of 1977 when the entire city was without power but lights were still visible in the North Shore Towers . During the Northeast Blackout of 2003 , the North Shore Towers continued to produce electricity unaffected . This resulted in extensive media coverage on the co @-@ op 's self @-@ sufficiency with regard to energy . After seeing this news coverage of North Shore Towers ' ability to produce power during the blackout , city tax collectors sent energy tax bills to North Shore Towers and the Penn South co @-@ op in Chelsea , Manhattan . The tax bills were for $ 1 million each , representing unpaid fuel taxes going back 20 years . This was extremely controversial because both co @-@ ops produce their own power . Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Councilman David Weprin ( D @-@ Queens ) , then Councilwoman Christine Quinn ( D @-@ Manhattan ) , and other city officials worked towards settling the tax bills and removing future energy taxes for the co @-@ ops . Then Council Speaker Gifford Miller ( D @-@ Manhattan ) commented that such co @-@ ops " should be rewarded , not punished for providing their own energy . "

 = Gene Derricotte = 
 Eugene " Gene " Derricotte ( born June 14 , 1926 ) is a former American football player who played with the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1944 to 1948 . He was one of the University 's first African American athletes in the era when NCAA Division I college football was beginning to integrate . Derricotte established school records that still stand as a punt returner for the Michigan Wolverines football team . He also established several short @-@ lived school interceptions records . Derricotte also served as a Tuskegee Airman and later had a successful career in dentistry while continuing to serve in the military . 
 = = Early years and college = = 
 Derricotte was born in <unk> , Ohio on June 14 , 1926 , and he grew up in Defiance , Ohio , where his father Clarence Cobb Derricotte ran a shoe repair business . In addition to Eugene , Bessie M. Anderson and Clarence Derricotte had two other sons , Bruce ( b . June 22 , 1928 ) and Raymond . Gene married Jeanne E. Hagans and had a son Robert . Years later , Gene Derricotte would tell a reporter friend of his that he always wondered about his ancestry . He knew his name was French , but he was not able to find out much more about his roots . One thing he must have known was that despite living under segregation , other members of the Derricotte family had distinguished themselves as educated professionals . A black newspaper , the Philadelphia Tribune , did a tribute to the family in November 1944 , mentioning that Eugene 's father was a veteran of World War I where he fought in France before returning to Defiance to open his business , marry and raise a family . Eugene had an uncle ( J. Flipper Derricotte ) who was an attorney in Washington DC , and an aunt Juliette who had been a dean at Fisk College in Nashville TN before dying tragically after an automobile accident , when the nearby white hospital refused to admit her . ( Jason , 1944 ) 
 While Eugene ( or Gene , as he was often called ) would become known for his athletic ability , he was also an excellent student , graduating from Defiance High School as the class valedictorian . ( Jason , 1944 ) Because he was a star athlete , he was awarded a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan . He enrolled in 1944 , majoring in chemistry . While there , he became the first African @-@ American to play in the offensive backfield for the Michigan Wolverines football program . Derricotte was an immediate contributor as the team 's leading ground gainer in 1944 . Press reports in 1944 typically referred to his race , identifying him as " freshman negro halfback , " the " Negro speedster , " the " speedy negro freshman , " or the " lithe Negro star . " 
 In December 1944 , Derricotte was drafted into the United States Army . He was initially assigned as an artillery <unk> with the 16th Separate Training Battalion in Fort Bragg , North Carolina . He later transferred to the Tuskegee Airmen pilot training program in Tuskegee , Alabama . Derricotte graduated from the program in May 1946 . With the war over , he was discharged , and he returned to the University of Michigan to continue his education . 
 When he returned from the war in 1946 and resumed his education , he continued to excel in academics as well as sports . He maintained a " B " average and majored in pharmacy . In football , he shared the starting duties at the left halfback position with Bob Chappuis , who went on to All @-@ Big Ten Conference honors in 1946 . After starting nine games at left halfback for Fritz Crisler in 1944 , Derricotte started five games to Chappuis ' four in 1946 . In the first game of the 1946 season , Derricotte threw a touchdown pass to Paul White and was described as the " sparkplug of the Michigan running game . " Derricotte broke his nose in a scrimmage after the first game and saw limited playing time , which gave Chappuis an opportunity to shine . 
 Derricotte , who wore # 41 while a Michigan Wolverine , had an unusual college football career because he began by starting many games , but gradually became more of a return specialist . In 1946 , Derricotte also set the school 's single @-@ season interceptions record . By 1947 , Chappuis had become an All @-@ American halfback and Derricotte 's only start was one game at quarterback . In 1947 , Derricotte averaged 24 @.@ 8 yards on punt returns , which still stands as a Michigan school record ( min 1 @.@ 2 returns / game ) . In fact , Derricotte still ranks fifth in NCAA Division I @-@ A history in average yards per punt return . Oddly , the NCAA recognizes that he had 347 return yards on 14 returns that season ( 24 @.@ 8 ) . The University of Michigan claims he had 396 punt return yards that season ( which would be 24 @.@ 8 with 16 returns ) , but did not average at least 12 @.@ 3 with a minimum of 15 returns to rank in the top ten in school history . The Big Ten record book claims he did not have at least a 17 @.@ 4 return average with a minimum of 10 returns to place in the top ten in conference history . The 396 was a Michigan record from 1947 until 1990 when Tripp <unk> totaled 455 in 1990 . In 1948 , he again only had one start , but this time back at halfback under new coach , Bennie Oosterbaan . Both the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team , Fritz Crisler 's last team , and the 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team were undefeated and finished the season ranked number 1 in the Associated Press polls . The 1947 team referred to as " Michigan 's Mad Magicians " is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . 
 During his Michigan career , Derricotte returned four punts for touchdowns , which set a school record that has since been tied ( but not exceeded ) by Steve <unk> and Derrick Alexander . He also returned three punts for touchdowns in one season , which was a Big Ten Conference record for more than 50 years until Ted Ginn , Jr. returned four punts for touchdowns in 2004 . The record had been tied by both Ira Matthews of the Wisconsin Badgers ( 1976 ) and Tim Dwight of the Iowa Hawkeyes ( 1997 ) . 
 In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern AP voter had voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players ( Derricotte , Bob Mann and Len Ford ) were African @-@ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African @-@ American players . 
 Michigan beat USC , 49 – 0 , in the 1948 Rose Bowl game . Derricotte scored a touchdown on a 45 @-@ yard reception from Henry <unk> in the game . Derricotte also completed a ten @-@ yard pass during the game . 
 Over the course of his Michigan career , he set the career interceptions record . Neither Derricotte 's career nor single @-@ season interceptions records lasted very long .

 Derricotte was selected in the first round of the All @-@ America Football Conference draft in 1949 by the undefeated league defending champion , Cleveland Browns . Unfortunately , he was injured during training camp with the Browns at the end of July 1949 while standing along the sidelines playing catch with a teammate . Coach Paul Brown said Derricotte had a chronic knee injury that only rest could cure . Accordingly , Brown placed Derricotte on waivers , but said hoped he could return for another tryout in 1950 . 
 Derricotte was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1987 . Derricotte also had a successful career in dentistry . In 1950 , Derricotte earned a degree in pharmacy , and in 1958 , he earned a further degree in dentistry . After receiving the second degree , Derricotte returned to the military , serving in Vietnam , as well as South Dakota , Massachusetts , Texas , Hawaii , Virginia , Illinois and at the United States Air Force Academy before his retirement in 1985 . Derricotte then relocated to San Antonio , Texas , where he started another career at the University of Texas Health Science Center . He married , and he and his wife Jeanne had a son , Rob .

 = William S. Hamilton = 
 William Stephen Hamilton ( August 4 , 1797 – October 9 , 1850 ) , a son of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton , was a politician and miner who lived much of his life in the U.S. state of Illinois and territorial Wisconsin . Hamilton was born in New York , where he attended the United States Military Academy before he resigned and moved to Illinois in 1817 . In Illinois he lived in Springfield and Peoria and eventually migrated to the lead @-@ mining region of southern Wisconsin and established Hamilton 's Diggings at present @-@ day Wiota . Hamilton served in various political offices and as a commander in two Midwest Indian Wars . In 1849 he moved to California on the heels of the California Gold Rush . He died in Sacramento , most likely of cholera , in October 1850 .

 William Stephen Hamilton was born August 4 , 1797 in New York , third @-@ youngest child and second @-@ youngest son of Alexander Hamilton . William was a month shy of his seventh birthday in 1804 when his father was infamously killed in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr . In 1814 he was admitted to the United States Military Academy , from which he had resigned by 1817 . Following his resignation from West Point , Hamilton migrated to Sangamon County , Illinois . He lived in Springfield and Peoria , Illinois until 1827 when he moved to the lead mining region around the Fever River . 
 = = Political and militia service = = 
 Hamilton first held elected office in 1824 as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from Sangamon County in 1824 . While working in the legislature Hamilton sponsored a bill that imposed a statewide tax intended to fund road repair and maintenance . The tax was proportional to property value , to be paid in labor or money , and replaced an older system which required every able @-@ bodied man to work on the roads five days per year . The bill passed , and the new law was met with much opposition ; it was repealed by the next legislature in 1826 – 27 . Hamilton served as aide de camp to Governor Edward Coles , and while living in Illinois , first in Springfield and later in Peoria , Hamilton worked for the General Land Office as Deputy Surveyor of Public Lands . In that position he surveyed Springfield 's township . He was also an incorporator of the original Illinois and Michigan Canal Company , along with Coles and other prominent <unk> . 
 In late 1827 Hamilton served during the Winnebago War in the volunteer Illinois Militia as a captain . Hamilton commanded a company raised in Galena , Illinois known as the Galena Mounted Volunteers . Hamilton 's company was under the command of Henry Dodge and was mustered into service on August 26 , 1827 and released on September 10 , 1827 . Hamilton moved to Wisconsin and established Hamilton 's Diggings in 1827 . 
 During the April – August 1832 Black Hawk War , between white settlers in the lead mining regions and Sauk Chief Black Hawk 's British Band , Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia . Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often in charge of the militia 's indigenous allies . At the war 's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk . Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory , north of Prairie du Chien , to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies . The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war . 
 In June , Hamilton 's return to Fort Hamilton with a large group of militia @-@ aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the survivors of the June 14 Spafford Farm massacre . The survivor , Francis Spencer , arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned Menominee . Afraid that the fort , like his party at the farm , had also been attacked , Spencer retreated back into the woods . He avoided the fort for between six and nine days , when hunger finally drove him into the open and he realized his mistake . On June 16 , about an hour after the fight at Horseshoe Bend , Hamilton arrived on the battlefield with U.S. aligned Menominee , Sioux and Ho @-@ Chunk warriors . According to Dodge , the warriors were given some of the scalps his men had taken , with which they were " delighted " . Dodge also reported that the allied warriors then proceeded onto the battlefield and mutilated the corpses of the fallen Kickapoo . 
 In 1842 and 1843 Hamilton served as an elected member of the Wisconsin Territorial Assembly . Hamilton lost an 1843 election for the national @-@ level office of Wisconsin Territory delegate to the United States Congress , and in 1848 he lost an election for delegate to the Wisconsin Constitutional Convention . Though well known as a smelter and miner in the lead region of southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois , Hamilton was unable to achieve the political fame he desired . 
 = = Mining career = = 
 When Hamilton moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in the late 1820s he established a lead ore mine that became known as Hamilton 's Diggings ; he later renamed the settlement Wiota . During the 1832 Black Hawk War a fort was erected at Hamilton 's Diggings , it was known as Fort Hamilton . Two contemporary descriptions of Hamilton 's Diggings provide a glimpse into the mining life of Hamilton and the others settled at present @-@ day Wiota . An 1831 account from Juliette Kinzie noted the unkempt conditions as " shabby " and " unpromising " . Kinzie also decried the foul language from the miners , whom she called the " roughest @-@ looking set of men I ever beheld . " The other description of early Wiota was provided by Theodore <unk> in 1834 . <unk> , a one @-@ time political opponent of Hamilton , contrasted the settlement 's apparently rough exterior with small , finer details , such as the presence of a quarto edition of Voltaire 's works , printed in Paris . 
 Hamilton never married and presented a rough , garish appearance . His mother , Elizabeth Schuyler ( daughter of General Philip Schuyler ) visited Hamilton at Hamilton 's Diggings during the winter of 1837 – 38 . During the same period , Hamilton briefly owned the Mineral Point Miners ' Free Press ; he sold it to a group from Galena and the paper became known as the Galena Democrat . 
 When gold was discovered in California , in 1848 , gold fever spread into the Midwest lead @-@ mining region . Hamilton set out for California , arriving in 1849 , with high hopes , and new equipment . His life in the west would prove to be a disappointment and he later regretted moving there . Hamilton told a friend in California that he would " rather have been hung in the ' Lead Mines ' than to have lived in this miserable hole ( California ) . "

 Before his death Hamilton fell ill for two weeks . He suffered multiple symptoms , including dysentery , and , according to his doctor , died from " malarial fever resulting in spinal exhaustion terminating in paralysis <unk> by great bodily and mental strain . " William S. Hamilton died in Sacramento , California on October 9 , 1850 at age 53 . He was interred in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery . The section of the cemetery where he is buried was named Hamilton Square in his honor . Hamilton had been in California about one year when he died from what he called " mountain fever " , most likely cholera during an 1850 epidemic .

 " Maximum Homerdrive " is the seventeenth episode of The Simpsons ' tenth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28 , 1999 . In the episode , Homer challenges trucker Red Barclay to a meat eating contest , which Barclay is the long @-@ standing champion of . Barclay wins , but quickly dies of " beef poisoning " , making it the first time Barclay will miss a shipment . Feeling bad for him , Homer takes on the duty of transporting Barclay 's cargo to Atlanta , with his son Bart by his side . 
 " Maximum Homerdrive " was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Swinton O. Scott III . Although the episode 's first draft was written by Swartzwelder , the writing staff was split into two groups in order to focus on both the A @-@ story and the B @-@ story . The episode features references to comedian Tony Randall , model Bettie Page , and science fiction film 2001 : A Space Odyssey , among other things . 
 In its original broadcast , " Maximum Homerdrive " received a 7 @.@ 8 Nielsen rating among adults between ages 18 and 49 , the highest such rating for the series since " Wild Barts Can 't Be Broken " . Variety credited the boost in ratings to the premiere of Futurama , which aired after " Maximum Homerdrive " . Following the tenth season 's home video release , the episode received mixed reviews from critics .

 Lisa announces that she is going to protest a new steakhouse which allows its customers to kill their own steak , which is called " The Slaughterhouse " ( it is also decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood , and everything on the menu is meat - even the menu itself ) . Homer hears the name of the steakhouse and is astonished that nobody told him about what he thinks is an amazing place , and takes the rest of his family to eat there , where he enters a challenge with a friendly truck driver named Red Barclay . The challenge Homer and Red enter revolves around who will finish off a " Sir <unk> @-@ A @-@ Lot " first , a 16 lb ( 256 ounce or 7 @.@ 26 kg ) steak that only two people in the history of The Slaughter House have finished ( Red being one and Tony Randall being the other ) . The gargantuan steak is more than a match for Homer , as for once in his life he is unable to finish his food and breaks down crying . Red does , but dies seconds later of what Dr. Hibbert called " beef poisoning " . This shocks the diners , before he reassures them that it was " probably from some other steakhouse " ( <unk> informing the Simpsons beforehand that he owns a fair percentage of the steakhouse ) . Homer then decides to finish Red 's last delivery and brings Bart along with him , leaving the rest of the family behind . 
 Lamenting that Homer and Bart always get to go on exciting adventures , Marge says " Maybe it 's time we took a walk on the wild side . " However , she , Lisa , and Maggie end up going to a doorbell store to buy a doorbell that they install themselves , which plays The Carpenters ' song " ( They Long to Be ) Close to You " . Lisa wants to press the doorbell , but Marge insists that they should let visitors do the ringing first . Unfortunately , they barely get any visitors and they never get to ring for various reasons ( Milhouse is trying to sell <unk> , but is attacked by birds , some Jehovah 's Witnesses were about to ring the doorbell when they reconsider their careers ) . Marge desperately tries to order garlic bread from Luigi 's to get someone to ring the doorbell , but unfortunately the delivery man , who is Wiseguy , prefers to knock on the door and leaves when he hears that Marge is not interested in the garlic bread . Finally , Lisa gets fed up and rings the doorbell herself . However , the new doorbell starts to malfunction , playing the song over and over without stopping . 
 Meanwhile , Homer goes to get some pills that will keep him awake overnight . He takes an entire bottle of pep pills , followed by a bottle of sleeping pills to balance it out . In the truck , he alternates between being hyper to being drowsy until he finally falls asleep at the wheel , almost heading off a cliff . The next morning , he awakes to discover a secret : the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive system . He talks it over with other drivers , who inform him that he should not mention anything about the truck driving by itself . The truck 's Autodrive system also helps keep itself safe . To demonstrate the system , Homer and Bart sit on the hood . A passing bus notices this , and Homer outright tells them about the <unk> system and its nature as a secret scam . Another truck driver notices this and informs the other truckers about the situation . 
 Back in Springfield , Marge tries to cut the wires to the doorbell , but discovers that Homer has stolen her tools , so she decides to just pull the wires out , but makes it worse by making the doorbell to speed up and amplify itself , disturbing the whole neighborhood . 
 Homer and Bart are enjoying themselves until an angry mob of truckers get in a showdown with Homer , and he survives without the help of the Autodrive system , which had ejected itself from the truck by managing to get the truck to jump over the others . The truckers briefly consider giving up scamming before deciding just to bootleg Beanie Babies . Homer and Bart finish the shipment of <unk> and migrant workers by taking it to Atlanta , but they still need transport home . The Lord provides one , as a freight train full of napalm headed back to Springfield needs a driver ( as the original driver had quit because he didn 't want to deliver a train full of napalm to Springfield ) . 
 Back at the Simpson house , the doorbell 's tune grows so annoying that an angry crowd has gathered . Chief Wiggum is about to shoot it until the doorbell store 's mascot , Señor Ding Dong , uses his whip to silence the noise from the doorbell . Everyone in Springfield is thankful for him , and Señor Ding @-@ Dong attempts to make a dramatic exit , but his Chevrolet van is malfunctioning and he is instead forced to ask for jumper cables .

 " Maximum Homerdrive " , originally called " Homer the Trucker " , was written by staff writer John Swartzwelder and directed by Simpsons director Swinton O. Scott III . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28 , 1999 . The meat @-@ eating contest seen in the beginning of the episode was conceived by Simpsons writer Donick Cary during a story pitch @-@ out , according to writer and executive producer Matt Selman . When rewriting the episode , the writing staff was divided into two groups , so that one group wrote the A @-@ story , while the other wrote the B @-@ story . After the second act , the writers were " stuck " , as executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully recalled in the DVD commentary for the episode . Eventually , staff writer and co @-@ executive producer George Meyer pitched the idea that the truckers would have " a secret device , that actually did all the driving for them " , called the Navitron Autodrive System . 
 In the season 10 deleted scenes where Homer turns on the radio listening to a song about a trucker who crashed his truck out on I @-@ 95 , and one more where some of the truckers try to flatten Homer 's truck . In order to animate Barclay 's truck in " Maximum Homerdrive " , Scott bought a model truck , which he also based the design of Barclay 's truck on . According to storyboard consultant Mike B. Anderson , the trucks in the episode were very difficult to animate , as the Simpsons animators were still working with traditional cel animation at the time and did not have access to computer tools . In a scene in The Slaughterhouse , an employee is shown killing a number of cows with a captive bolt pistol , however the death of the cows are not shown . Originally , the writers wanted to show the cows being killed , however when Scott saw the scene in the storyboards , the Simpsons staff instead decided to make the deaths " indirect " . During the meat eating contest , Homer becomes exhausted and sees two wine glass holding cows , who appear as " wavy " figures . In order to achieve the " wavy " effect , the Simpsons animators put a ripple glass on the cels and moved it around while shooting the scene . After the contest , Barclay dies of " beef poisoning " . The Fox censors were uneasy with including any mention of " beef poisoning " in the episode , as talk show host Oprah Winfrey had recently been sued by " some Texas ranchers " for defaming the beef industry . In a scene in the episode , Homer buys a jar of " <unk> @-@ Crank " pills in order to stay alert while driving during the night . He swallows all the pills at once , to the clerk 's dismay . Homer replies , " No problem , I 'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills " , and proceeds to swallow an entire jar 's worth of sleeping pills . According to Scully , the censors had " a lot of trouble " with the scene , but it was included anyhow . 
 When Homer turns on the truck radio , the song " Wannabe " by the Spice Girls can be heard . Originally , a " trucker song " about " a horrible wreck out on old 95 " would be heard . The song was a reference to the " Wreck of the Old 97 " , a famous locomotive that crashed in 1903 and inspired the country ballad of the same name . It was sung by main cast member Dan Castellaneta , included mentions of " scraping blood and guts off the road " and was eventually dropped because it was considered too gruesome by the staff . The song was later included as a deleted scene on The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set . While eating dinner at Joe 's Diner , " 12 Bar Blues " by NRBQ ( a band that Mike Scully was fond of ) can be heard playing from a jukebox . According to producer Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , the doorbell tune in the episode " has a history with The Simpsons " , as it is also Homer and Marge 's wedding song . " Maximum Homerdrive " features the first appearance of Señor Ding @-@ Dong , who is a recurring character in the series . He is portrayed by Castellaneta , the voice behind many characters . Red Barclay , the trucker who dies of " beef poisoning " in The Slaughterhouse , was portrayed by regular cast member Hank Azaria , who voices many characters in the series . Barclay 's voice is slightly based on that of American actor Gary Busey . The two Jehovah 's witnesses were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Karl Wiedergott . 
 = = Themes and cultural references = = 
 In Voyages of Discovery : A Manly Adventure in the Lands Down Under , a book about adventuring and masculinity , Ken Ewell described " Maximum Homerdrive " as a " fine example " of " the poor man 's lack of travel acumen " . He wrote " Homer 's usual ineptitude at first spells disaster for the duo , at least until they find out about the truck 's auto @-@ drive system . And though he promises to keep the device a secret , Homer can 't keep his mouth shut , and so shamefully exposes to the world his un @-@ <unk> behavior concerning the mates . So given that Homer once again learns absolutely nothing from his traveling experience , he can only take to heart the thoughts of the British writer Stephen Fry . ' At my age travel broadens the behind . ' " 
 The decal on Homer 's truck reads " Rex Rascal " , a reference to American animator Tex Avery . In the steak restaurant , a photo of actor and comedian Tony Randall can be seen next to Barclay 's photo . Homer 's postcard , which reads " Wish you were her " , shows a picture of American model Bettie Page . In the scene where Homer drives Barclay 's truck into the convoy , Navitron Autodrive System says " I 'm afraid I can 't let you do this , Red . The risk is unacceptable . " The line , as well as the Navitron Autodrive System 's , is a reference to HAL 9000 , the antagonist in the 1968 science fiction film 2001 : A Space Odyssey . The episode also references media mogul Ted Turner , with a sign that reads " Atlanta : the home of Ted Turner 's mood swings " . The title of the episode references the infamous 1986 Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive , which was one of Simpsons cast member Yeardley Smith 's first credited screen roles .

For once , Homer is in the right and you cannot help but cheer as the truckers spectacularly fail to stop him getting to Atlanta . " They concluded by writing " A nice , bonding story for Homer and Bart which is diametrically opposed to the one featuring Marge and Lisa . " On the other hand , giving the episode a more mixed review , Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote " If nothing else , ' Homerdrive ' takes unanticipated paths . The eating contest leads to a long truck drives leads to that ' shocking secret ' . All of this means the show manages to become pretty unpredictable . " However , he maintained that the episode is only " sporadically " funny , and that it " doesn ’ t ever excel in that department – at least not in terms of the trucker story . " He enjoyed the episode 's B @-@ story more , because of its " absurdity " , however he criticized the inclusion of Gil in the episode , calling the character " increasingly overused " . Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News gave the episode a mixed review as well , writing that it " may have been a fairly decent episode but for the fact that something similar was done ( and done better ) on King of the Hill .

 = Clinton Engineer Works = 
 The Clinton Engineer Works ( CEW ) was the name of the Manhattan Project 's production installation during World War II that produced the enriched uranium used in the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945 , as well as the first examples of reactor produced plutonium . It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites , various utilities including a power plant , and the town of Oak Ridge . It was in the eastern part of the state of Tennessee , about 18 miles ( 29 km ) west of Knoxville , and was named after the town of Clinton , Tennessee , eight miles ( 13 km ) to the north . The production facilities were mainly in Roane County although the northern part of the site was in Anderson County . The Manhattan District Engineer , Kenneth Nichols , moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943 . 
 Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley . Built by the Army in 1943 , this temporary community housed 15 @,@ 000 people . The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff . The operating force peaked at 50 @,@ 000 workers just after the end of the war . The construction labor force peaked at 75 @,@ 000 and the combined employment peak was 80 @,@ 000 . The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community ; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley , in government @-@ built " hutments " ( one @-@ room shacks ) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive . 
 = = Site selection = = 
 In 1942 , the Manhattan Project was attempting to construct the first atomic bombs . This would require production facilities , and by June 1942 the project had reached the stage where their construction could be contemplated . On 25 June 1942 , the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) S @-@ 1 Executive Committee deliberated on where they should be located . Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer recommended that the different manufacturing facilities be built at the same site in order to simplify security and construction . Such a site would require a substantial tract of land to accommodate both the facilities and housing for the thousands of workers . The plutonium processing plant needed to be two to four miles ( 3 @.@ 2 to 6 @.@ 4 km ) from the site boundary and any other installation in case radioactive fission products escaped . While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site , it still needed to be near sources of labor , and accessible by road and rail transportation . A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable . Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions , but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction . The substratum needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations , but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work . It was estimated that the proposed plants would need access to 150 @,@ 000 KW of electricity and 370 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 l ; 310 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water per minute . A War Department policy held that as a rule munitions facilities should not be located west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges , east of the Appalachian Mountains , or within 200 miles ( 320 km ) of the Canadian or Mexican borders . 
 Several sites were considered in the Tennessee Valley , two in the Chicago area , one near the Shasta Dam in California , and some in Washington , where the Hanford site was eventually established . An OSRD team had selected the Knoxville , Tennessee , area in April 1942 , and in May Arthur Compton , the director of the Metallurgical Laboratory had met with Gordon R. Clapp , the General Manager of the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) . The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District ( MED ) , Colonel James C. Marshall , asked Colonel Leslie R. Groves , Jr. to undertake a study within the Army 's Office of the Chief of Engineers . After receiving assurances that the TVA could supply the required quantity of electric power if given priority for procuring some needed equipment , Groves also concluded that the Knoxville area was suitable . The only voice of dissent at the 25 June meeting was Ernest O. Lawrence , who wanted the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to his Radiation Laboratory in California . The Shasta Dam area remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September , by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection . 
 On 1 July , Marshall and his deputy , Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols , surveyed sites in the Knoxville area with representatives of the TVA and Stone & Webster , the designated construction contractor . No perfectly suitable site was found , and Marshall even ordered another survey of the Spokane , Washington , area . At the time , the proposed nuclear reactor , gas centrifuge and gaseous diffusion technologies were still in the research stage , and the design of the plant was a long way off . The schedules , which called for construction work on the nuclear reactor to commence by 1 October 1942 , the electromagnetic plant by 1 November , the centrifugal plant by 1 January 1943 and the gaseous diffusion plant by 1 March 1943 , were quite unrealistic . While work could not commence on the plants , a start could be made on the housing and administrative buildings . Stone & Webster therefore drew up a detailed report on the most promising site , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) west of Knoxville . Stephane <unk> later wrote that : 
 This portion of the quiet rural area was called Black Oak Ridge and was the northernmost of five principal <unk> and pine @-@ covered ridges around the meandering Clinch River . It was a verdant , beautiful countryside with rolling hills covered with dogwood and full of partridge and deer . To the east were the Great Smoky Mountains , to the west the peaks of the Cumberland Mountains . 
 The site was located in Roane County and Anderson County , and lay roughly halfway between the two county seats of Kingston and Clinton . Its greatest drawback was that a major road , Tennessee State Route 61 , ran through it . Stone & Webster considered the possibility of re @-@ routing the road . The Ohio River Division ( ORD ) of the Corps of Engineers estimated that it would cost $ 4 @.@ 25 million to purchase the entire 83 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 34 @,@ 000 ha ) site . 
 Groves became the director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September , with the rank of brigadier general . That afternoon , he took a train to Knoxville , where he met with Marshall . After touring the site , Groves concluded that the site " was an even better choice than I had anticipated . " He called Colonel John J. O 'Brien of the Corps of Engineers ' Real Estate Branch , and told him to proceed with acquiring the land . The site was initially known as the Kingston Demolition Range . It officially became the Clinton Engineer Works ( CEW ) in January 1943 . It was given the codename of Site X. After the township was established in mid @-@ 1943 , the name Oak Ridge was chosen from employee suggestions . It met with the Manhattan District 's approval because " its rural connotation held outside curiosity to a minimum . " Oak Ridge then became the site 's postal address , but the site itself was not officially renamed Oak Ridge until 1947 . 
 = = Land acquisition = = 
 Although War Department policy maintained that land should be acquired by direct purchase , as time was short , it was decided to proceed immediately with condemnation . This allowed access to the site for construction crews , provided faster compensation to the owners , and expedited the handling of property with defective titles . On 28 September 1942 , the ORD Real Estate Branch opened a project office in Harriman with a staff of 54 surveyors , appraisers , lawyers and office workers . The ORD Real Estate Branch was quite busy at this time , as it was also acquiring land for the Dale Hollow Reservoir , so some staff were borrowed from the Federal Land Bank and the TVA . The next day , Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson authorized the acquisition of 56 @,@ 000 acres ( 23 @,@ 000 ha ) at an estimated cost of $ 3 @.@ 5 million . At the request of the ORD Real Estate Branch attorneys , the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee issued an order of possession on 6 October , effective the next day . Recognizing the hardship that it would cause to the landowners , it restricted immediate exclusive possession to properties " essential to full and complete development of the project " . 
 Over 1 @,@ 000 families lived on the site on farms or in the hamlets of Elza , <unk> , and Scarboro . The first that most heard about the acquisition was when a representative from the ORD showed up to inform them that their land was being acquired . Some returned home from work one day to find an eviction notice nailed to their door or to a tree in the yard . Most were given six weeks to leave , but some were given just two . The government took possession of 13 tracts for immediate construction work on 20 November 1942 . By May 1943 , 742 declarations had been filed covering 53 @,@ 334 acres ( 21 @,@ 584 ha ) . Most residents were told to prepare to leave between 1 December 1942 and 15 January 1943 . In cases where this would cause undue hardship , the MED allowed residents to stay beyond this date . For some it was the third time that they had been evicted by the government , having previously been evicted for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1920s and the TVA 's Norris Dam in the 1930s . Many expected that , like the TVA , the Army would provide assistance to help them relocate ; but unlike the TVA , the Army had no mission to improve the area or the lot of the local people , and no funds for the purpose . Tires were in short supply in wartime America , and moving vehicles were hard to find . Some residents had to leave behind possessions that they were unable to take with them . 
 A delegation of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting the acquisition of their property on 23 November 1942 , and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting where they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government . Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause . By the end of May 1943 , agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling 21 @,@ 742 acres ( 8 @,@ 799 ha ) , but some landowners rejected the government 's offers . The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered . They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values than those of the ORD appraisers , but the landowners rejected them as well , so the Army discontinued the use of this method . In response to rising public criticism , O 'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture . It found that the appraisals had been fair and just , and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land . 
 The landowners turned to their local Congressman , John Jennings , Jr . On 1 February 1943 , Jennings introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives calling for a committee to investigate the values offered to the landowners . He also complained to Patterson about how buildings and facilities were being demolished by the MED . On 9 July 1943 , Andrew J. May , the chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs , appointed an investigating subcommittee chaired by Clifford Davis , who selected Dewey Short and John Sparkman as its other members . Public hearings were held in Clinton on 11 August 1943 , and in Kingston the following day . The Committee report , presented in December 1943 , made a number of specific recommendations concerning the Corps of Engineers ' land acquisition process , but neither Congress nor the War Department moved to provide any additional compensation for the landowners . 
 In July 1943 , Groves prepared to issue Public Proclamation No. 2 , declaring the site a military exclusion area . He asked Marshall to present it to the Governor of Tennessee , Prentice Cooper . Marshall , in turn , delegated the task to the area engineer , Major Thomas T. Crenshaw , who sent a junior officer , Captain George B. Leonard . Cooper was unimpressed . He told Leonard that he had not been informed about the purpose of the CEW , and that the Army had kicked the farmers off their land and had not compensated the counties for the roads and bridges , which would now be closed . In his opinion it was " an experiment in socialism " , a New Deal project being undertaken in the name of the war effort . Instead of reading the proclamation , he tore it up and threw it in the waste paper basket . Marshall went to Nashville to apologize to Cooper , who refused to talk to him . Nichols , who succeeded Marshall as chief engineer of the Manhattan District , met Cooper on 31 July 1943 , and offered compensation in the form of Federal financing for road improvements . Cooper accepted an offer from Nichols to visit the CEW , which he did on 3 November 1943 . 
 Nichols and Cooper came to an agreement about the Solway Bridge . Although it was in Knox County , Anderson County had contributed $ 27 @,@ 000 towards its construction . It was still paying off the bonds , but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers . Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $ 25 @,@ 000 annually for the bridge , of which $ 6 @,@ 000 was to be used to maintain the access road . Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated . An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $ 10 @,@ 000 for the bridge and $ 200 per month . Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road , which was torn up by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944 . The Army was forced to spend $ 5 @,@ 000 per month on road works in Knox County . 
 Additional parcels of land were acquired during 1943 and 1944 for access roads , a railway spur , and for security purposes , bringing the total to about 58 @,@ 900 acres ( 23 @,@ 800 ha ) . The Harriman office closed on 10 June 1944 , but reopened on 1 September 1944 to deal with the additional parcels . The last acquisition was not complete until 1 March 1945 . The final cost of the land acquired was around $ 2 @.@ 6 million , about $ 47 an acre .

 = = = X @-@ 10 graphite reactor = = = 
 On 2 February 1943 , DuPont began construction of the plutonium semiworks , on an isolated 112 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 5 km2 ) site in the Bethel Valley about 10 miles ( 16 km ) southwest of Oak Ridge . Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at the Hanford Site , it included the air @-@ cooled graphite @-@ moderated X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor . There was also a chemical separation plant , research laboratories , waste storage area , training facility for Hanford staff , and administrative and support facilities that included a laundry , cafeteria , first aid center and fire station . Because of the subsequent decision to construct water @-@ cooled reactors at Hanford , only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot . The facility was known as the Clinton Laboratories , and was operated by the University of Chicago as part of the Metallurgical Laboratory project . 
 The X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor was the world 's second artificial nuclear reactor after Enrico Fermi 's Chicago Pile @-@ 1 , and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation . It consisted of a huge block , 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) long on each side , of nuclear graphite cubes , weighing around 1 @,@ 500 short tons ( 1 @,@ 400 t ) , surrounded by seven feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) of high @-@ density concrete as a radiation shield . There were 36 horizontal rows of 35 holes . Behind each was a metal channel into which uranium fuel slugs could be inserted . The cooling system was driven by three large electric fans . 
 Construction work on the reactor had to wait until DuPont had completed the design . Excavation commenced on 27 April 1943 . A large pocket of soft clay was soon discovered , necessitating additional foundations . Further delays occurred due to wartime difficulties in procuring building materials . There was also an acute shortage of common and skilled labor : the contractor had only three @-@ quarters of the required workforce , and less after high turnover and absenteeism , mainly the result of poor accommodations and difficulties in commuting . The township of Oak Ridge was still under construction , and barracks were built to house workers . Special arrangements with individual workers increased their morale and reduced turnover . Finally , there was unusually heavy rainfall , with 9 @.@ 3 inches ( 240 mm ) falling in July 1943 , more than twice the average of 4 @.@ 3 inches ( 110 mm ) . 
 Some 700 short tons ( 640 t ) of graphite blocks were purchased from National Carbon . The construction crews began stacking it in September 1943 . Cast uranium billets came from Metal Hydrides , Mallinckrodt and other suppliers . These were extruded into cylindrical slugs , and canned by Alcoa , which started production on 14 June 1943 . General Electric and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new welding technique . The new equipment was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943 . Supervised by Compton , Martin D. Whitaker and Fermi , the reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about 30 short tons ( 27 t ) of uranium . A week later the load was increased to 36 short tons ( 33 t ) , raising its power generation to 500 kW , and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created . Modifications over time raised the power to 4 @,@ 000 kW in July 1944 . 
 Construction commenced on the pilot separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected . Not until May 1943 would DuPont managers decide to use the Bismuth @-@ phosphate process . The plant consisted of six cells , separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls . The equipment was operated from the control room by remote control . Construction work was completed on 26 November 1943 , but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs . The first batch was received on 20 December 1943 , allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944 . By February , the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days . Over the next five months , the efficiency of the separation process was improved , with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent . X @-@ 10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945 , when it was turned over to research activities . By this time , 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed . 
 In September 1942 , Compton asked Whitaker to form a skeleton operating staff for X @-@ 10 . Whitaker became director of the Clinton Laboratories . The first permanent operating staff arrived at X @-@ 10 from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1944 , by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site . They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Army 's Special Engineer Detachment . By March 1944 , there were some 1 @,@ 500 people working at X @-@ 10 . 
 A radioisotope building , a steam plant , and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory 's peacetime educational and research missions . All work was completed by December 1946 , adding another $ 1 @,@ 009 @,@ 000 to the cost of construction at X @-@ 10 , and bringing the total cost to $ 13 @,@ 041 @,@ 000 . Operational costs added another $ 22 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Y @-@ 12 electromagnetic separation plant = = = 
 Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory . This method employed devices known as calutrons , a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron . The name was derived from the words " California " , " university " and " cyclotron " . In the electromagnetic separation process , a magnetic field deflected charged uranium particles according to mass . The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient . Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor , an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials , require more manpower to operate , and cost more to build . Nonetheless , the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk . Moreover , it could be built in stages , and rapidly reach industrial capacity . 
 Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant , which came to be called Y @-@ 12 , was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S @-@ 1 Committee in June 1942 . The design called for five first @-@ stage processing units , known as Alpha racetracks , and two units for final processing , known as Beta racetracks . In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks , known as Alpha II . Construction began in February 1943 . 
 When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in November , the 14 @-@ ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely . A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out . In December Groves ordered a magnet broken open , and handfuls of rust were found inside . Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned . A pickling plant was established on @-@ site to clean the pipes and fittings . The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944 , the first Beta and first and third Alpha I 's came online in March , and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April . The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944 . 
 Tennessee Eastman was hired to manage Y @-@ 12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis , with a fee of $ 22 @,@ 500 per month plus $ 7 @,@ 500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $ 4 @,@ 000 per additional racetrack . The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate . They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education . Nichols compared unit production data , and pointed out to Lawrence that the young " hillbilly " girl operators were outperforming his PhDs . They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost , a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors . The girls were " trained like soldiers not to reason why " , while " the scientists could not refrain from time @-@ consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials . " 
 Y @-@ 12 initially enriched the uranium @-@ 235 content to between 13 and 15 percent , and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to the Manhattan Project 's weapons design laboratory , the Los Alamos Laboratory , in March 1944 . Only 1 part in 5 @,@ 825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product . Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process . Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10 percent of the uranium @-@ 235 feed by January 1945 . In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched ( 1 @.@ 4 percent ) feed from the new S @-@ 50 thermal diffusion plant . The next month it received enhanced ( 5 percent ) feed from the K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion plant . By August K @-@ 25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks . 
 The Alpha tracks began to suspend operations on 4 September 1945 , and ceased operation completely on 22 September . The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December 1945 , processing feed from K @-@ 25 and the new K @-@ 27 . By May 1946 , studies suggested that the gaseous plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass . After a trial showed this was the case , Groves ordered all but one Beta track at Y @-@ 12 shut down in December 1946 . Y @-@ 12 remained in use for nuclear weapons processing and materials storage . A production facility for the hydrogen bomb used in Operation Castle in 1954 was hastily installed in 1952 . 
 = = = K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion plant = = = 
 The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion . Graham 's law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass , so in a box containing a semi @-@ permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases , the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules . The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules , while the residual gas is somewhat depleted . The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes , with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture . Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey , Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning . 
 In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600 @-@ stage gaseous diffusion plant . On 14 December , M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant , which was codenamed K @-@ 25 . A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated , eventually totaling $ 2 @.@ 5 million . A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project , headed by Percival C. Keith , one of Kellogg 's vice presidents . The process faced formidable technical difficulties . The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used , as no substitute could be found , and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas . The biggest problem was the design of the barrier , which would have to be strong , porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride . The best choice for this seemed to be nickel . Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel . A six @-@ stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process , but the Norris @-@ Adler prototype proved to be too brittle . A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex , the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation . In January 1944 , Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production . 
 Kellex 's design for K @-@ 25 called for a four @-@ story U @-@ shaped structure 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) long containing 54 contiguous buildings . These were divided into nine sections . Within these were cells of six stages . The cells could be operated independently , or consecutively within a section . Similarly , the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade . A survey party began construction by marking out the 500 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) site in May 1943 . Work on the main building began in October 1943 , and the six @-@ stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944 . In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant , directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540 @-@ stage side feed unit , which became known as K @-@ 27 . Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor , Union Carbide and Carbon , on 11 September 1945 . The total cost , including the K @-@ 27 plant completed after the war , came to $ 480 million . 
 The production plant commenced operation in February 1945 , and as cascade after cascade came online , the quality of the product increased . By April 1945 , K @-@ 25 had attained a 1 @.@ 1 percent enrichment and the output of the S @-@ 50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed . Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7 percent enrichment . In August , the last of the 2 @,@ 892 stages commenced operation . K @-@ 25 and K @-@ 27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period , when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants . Uranium was enriched by the K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion process until 1985 ; the plants were then decommissioned and decontaminated . A 235 MW coal @-@ fired power station was included for reliability and to provide variable frequency , although most electric power came from the TVA .

 The thermal diffusion process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog 's theory , which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient , the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end . Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall , this can be used as a means of isotope separation . This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938 . It was developed by US Navy scientists , but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project . This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility , but the inter @-@ service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part . 
 The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson 's direction , but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944 , when Captain William S. Parsons , the naval officer who was in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos , brought Robert Oppenheimer , the director there , news of encouraging progress in the Navy 's experiments on thermal diffusion . Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y @-@ 12 . Groves set up a committee consisting of Warren K. Lewis , Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea , and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $ 3 @.@ 5 million could enrich 110 pounds ( 50 kg ) of uranium per week to nearly 0 @.@ 9 percent uranium @-@ 235 . Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944 . 
 Groves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland , Ohio , to build the thermal diffusion plant , which was designated S @-@ 50 . Groves ' advisers , Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from Standard Oil , estimated that it would take six months to build . Groves gave Ferguson just four . Plans called for the installation of 2 @,@ 142 forty @-@ eight @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 15 m ) diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks . Inside each column were three concentric tubes . Steam , obtained from the nearby K @-@ 25 powerhouse at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch ( 690 kPa ) and temperature of 545 ° F ( 285 ° C ) , flowed downward through the innermost 1 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 32 mm ) nickel pipe , while water at 155 ° F ( 68 ° C ) flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe . Isotope separation occurred in the uranium hexafluoride gas between the nickel and copper pipes . 
 Work commenced on 9 July 1944 , and S @-@ 50 began partial operation in September . Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve . The plant produced just 10 @.@ 5 pounds ( 4 @.@ 8 kg ) of 0 @.@ 852 percent uranium @-@ 235 in October . Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months , but in June 1945 it produced 12 @,@ 730 pounds ( 5 @,@ 770 kg ) . By March 1945 , all 21 production racks were operating . Initially the output of S @-@ 50 was fed into Y @-@ 12 , but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series . S @-@ 50 became the first stage , enriching from 0 @.@ 71 percent to 0 @.@ 89 percent . This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K @-@ 25 plant , which produced a product enriched to about 23 percent . This was , in turn , fed into Y @-@ 12 . 
 In early September Nichols appointed a production control committee , headed by Major A. V. ( Pete ) Peterson . Peterson 's staff tried various combinations , using mechanical calculating machines , and decided that the S @-@ 50 production should be fed to K @-@ 25 rather than Y @-@ 12 , which was done in April 1945 . The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K @-@ 25 should be abandoned , as should Lawrence 's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y @-@ 12 plant . Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K @-@ 27 gaseous @-@ diffusion plant and one more beta stage track for Y @-@ 12 . These additions were estimated to cost $ 100 million , with completion in February 1946 . Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945 , Peterson recommended that S @-@ 50 be shut down . The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September 1945 . The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K @-@ 25 , and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September 1945 . S @-@ 50 was completely demolished in 1946 . 
 = = = Electric power = = = 
 Despite protests from TVA that it was unnecessary , the Manhattan District built a coal @-@ fired power plant at K @-@ 25 with eight 25 @,@ 000 KW generators . Steam generated from the K @-@ 25 power plant was subsequently used by S @-@ 50 . Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam , and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K @-@ 25 and K @-@ 27 . By 1945 , power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310 @,@ 000 KW , of which 200 @,@ 000 KW was earmarked for Y @-@ 12 , 80 @,@ 000 KW for K @-@ 25 , 23 @,@ 000 KW for the township , 6 @,@ 000 KW for S @-@ 50 and 1 @,@ 000 KW for X @-@ 10 . Peak demand occurred in August 1945 , when all the facilities were running . The peak load was 298 @,@ 800 KW on 1 September 1945 .

 Planning for a " Government village " to house the workers at the Clinton Engineer Works began in June 1942 . Because the site was remote , it was believed more convenient and secure for the workers to live on the site . The gentle slopes of Black Oak Ridge , from which the new town of Oak Ridge got its name , were selected as a suitable location . Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay , the deputy chief of staff of the United States Army Services of Supply , reminded Marshall of a wartime limit of $ 7 @,@ 500 per capita for individual quarters , but Groves , Nichols and Marshall saw no prospect that the kind of workers they needed would be willing to live in substandard accommodations . The first plan , submitted by Stone & Webster on 26 October 1942 , was for a residential community of 13 @,@ 000 people . 
 As Stone & Webster began work on the production facilities , it became clear that building the township as well would be beyond its capacity . The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill to design and build the township . The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant . In turn , Skidmore , Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors . This first phase of construction became known as the East Town . It included some 3 @,@ 000 family dwellings , an administrative center , three shopping centers , three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500 , recreation buildings , men 's and women 's dormitories , cafeterias , a medical services building and a 50 @-@ bed hospital . The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials . Where possible , <unk> and gypsum board were used instead of wood , and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete . The work was completed in early 1944 . 
 In addition to the East Town , a self @-@ contained community known as the East Village , with 50 family units , its own church , dormitories and a cafeteria , was built near the Elza gate . This was intended as a segregated community for Black people , but by the time it was completed , it was required by white people . Black people were instead housed in " hutments " ( one @-@ room shacks ) in segregated areas , some in " family hutments " created by joining two regular hutments together . 
 The Army presence at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall as head of the Manhattan Engineer District . One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge although the name of the district did not change . In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary , the Roane @-@ Anderson Company . The company was paid a fee of $ 25 @,@ 000 per month on a cost @-@ plus contract , about 1 percent of the $ 2 @.@ 8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities . Roane @-@ Anderson did not take over everything at once . A phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943 . Transportation and garbage collection soon followed . It assumed responsibility for water and sewage in November , and electricity in January 1944 . The number of Roane @-@ Anderson workers peaked at around 10 @,@ 500 in February 1945 , including concessionaires and subcontractors . Thereafter , numbers declined to 2 @,@ 905 direct employees and 3 @,@ 663 concessionaires and subcontractors when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946 . 
 By mid @-@ 1943 , it had become clear that the initial estimates of the size of the town had been too low , and a second phase of construction was required . Plans now called for a town of 42 @,@ 000 people . Work began in the fall of 1943 , and continued into the late summer of 1944 . Hospitals were expanded , as were the police and fire services , and the telephone system . Only 4 @,@ 793 of a planned total of 6 @,@ 000 family houses were built , mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along Tennessee State Route 61 . They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories , 2 @,@ 089 trailers , 391 hutments , a cantonment area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks . Some 2 @,@ 823 of the family units were prefabricated off @-@ site . The high school was expanded to cater for 1 @,@ 000 students . Two additional primary schools were built , and existing ones were expanded so that they could cater for 7 @,@ 000 students . 
 Although expected to accommodate the needs of the entire workforce , by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62 @,@ 000 . This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1 @,@ 300 family units and 20 dormitories built . More shopping and recreational facilities were added , the schools were expanded to cater for 9 @,@ 000 students , and a 50 @-@ bed annex was added to the hospital . The number of school children reached 8 @,@ 223 in 1945 . Few issues resonated more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system . Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board , the school system was run autonomously , with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army . Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County . The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75 @,@ 000 in May 1945 , by which time 82 @,@ 000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works , and 10 @,@ 000 by Roane @-@ Anderson . 
 In addition to the township , there were a number of temporary camps established for construction workers . It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off @-@ site , but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult , and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers . Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large <unk> and trailer camps . The largest , the trailer camp at Gamble Valley , had four thousand units . Another , at Happy Valley , held 15 @,@ 000 people . The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off , but they continued to be occupied in 1946 . 
 The main shopping area was Jackson Square , with about 20 shops . The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition , but this met with limited success due to the captive nature of the population , and the requirements of security , which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out . The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about how many people were in or would be in the town , and concessions were only for the duration of the war . Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee . The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls , but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville . By 1945 , community amenities included 6 recreation halls , 36 bowling alleys , 23 tennis courts , 18 ball parks , 12 playgrounds , a swimming pool , a 9 @,@ 400 @-@ volume library , and a newspaper .

 From 1 April 1943 , access to the Clinton Engineer Works was strictly controlled , with wire fences , guarded gates , and guards patrolling the perimeter . All employees had to sign a security declaration , the purpose of which was to make them aware of possible penalties under the Espionage Act of 1917 . Noting the distillation facilities and their high energy consumption , " I thought they were making sour mash to drop on the Germans , get them all drunk , " engineer Benjamin <unk> recalled , before realizing the facilities were enriching nuclear isotopes . Mail was censored , and lie detectors were employed in security checks . Everyone was issued with a color @-@ coded badge that restricted where they could go . Despite the security , the Clinton Engineer Works was penetrated by atomic spies George Koval and David Greenglass , who passed secrets to the Soviet Union . 
 Occupational health and safety presented a challenge , because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals , using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures , and working with high voltages , not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials . Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost , and a vigorous safety program was instituted . Since it did not matter where accidents occurred , this included safety off the job , in homes and in the schools . Safety indoctrination was included in job training , and safety training courses were held . Safety posters , manuals and films were distributed . In December 1945 , the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record . The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest . Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads . There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works : two in 1943 , nine in 1944 , eight in 1945 and two in 1946 . This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size . 
 The citizens of Oak Ridge were not allowed to have any form of local government ; but the state of Tennessee , concerned over the potential loss of tax revenue , did not cede sovereignty over the land . The residents of Oak Ridge therefore did not live on a federal reservation , and were entitled to vote in state and county elections . However , notice of the Clinton City elections was withheld by local authorities until a week after the deadline to pay the poll tax . On the day of a 1945 referendum on whether Anderson should remain a dry county , the Edgemoor Bridge was suddenly closed for repairs , and the dry vote carried . A subsequent vote in 1947 reversed this result , with 4 @,@ 653 dry votes compared to 5 @,@ 888 wet ; 5 @,@ 369 of the wet votes came from Oak Ridge . 
 This was but one point of difference between Oak Ridge residents and the rest of Anderson County . While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas , and many had college degrees , the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6 @.@ 8 years . Oak Ridge residents demanded , and Groves insisted on , schools with fine teachers and first @-@ rate facilities . To achieve this , the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly twice as much as Anderson County . The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment . 
 The Manhattan District accepted that wages and salaries had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers . It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors as they saw fit , subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation . Salaries above $ 9 @,@ 000 had to be approved by Patterson and Groves . 
 The War Production Board was asked to keep stores in Oak Ridge well @-@ stocked in order to reduce absenteeism among the workers . When shortages did occur , the relatively well @-@ paid Oak Ridge residents bought up scarce goods in surrounding areas . In both cases , they attracted the ire of their residents . Personnel employed by the Manhattan District were not exempted from being drafted under the Selective Service System . Efforts were made to employ draft @-@ exempt personnel , and deferments were requested only for critical personnel , mainly young scientists and technicians .

 On 10 May 1945 , Women 's Army Corps typists at Manhattan District headquarters began preparing press kits on the Manhattan Project for use after an atomic bomb had been dropped . Fourteen press releases were prepared , and thousands of copies made by mimeograph . The final wartime shipment of uranium @-@ 235 left the Clinton Engineer Works on 25 July 1945 . Shipments reached Tinian on C @-@ 54 aircraft on 28 and 29 July . They were incorporated into the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August . The news was greeted with wild celebration in Oak Ridge . Patterson issued a letter to the men and women of the Clinton Engineer Works : 
 Today the whole world knows the secret which you have helped us keep for many months . I am pleased to be able to add that the warlords of Japan now know its effects better , even than we ourselves . The atomic bomb which you have helped to develop with high devotion to patriotic duty is the most devastating military weapon that any country has ever been able to tum against its enemy . No one of you has worked on the entire project or knows the whole story , Each of you has done his own job and kept his own secret , and so today I speak for a grateful nation when I say congratulations , and thank you all . I hope you will continue to keep the secrets you have kept so well . The need for security and for continued effort is fully as great now as it ever was . We are proud of every one of you .

 By 1945 , Roane @-@ Anderson was divesting itself of many of its tasks . American Industrial Transit took over the transport system , and Southern Bell the telephone system . Tri @-@ State Homes began managing housing . In 1946 , tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab . Comprehensive medical insurance , originally instituted for security reasons , was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company . Health care had been provided by the Army . As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane @-@ Anderson . The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946 , and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on . 
 The hospital remained an Army hospital until 1 March 1949 , when it was transferred to Roanne @-@ Anderson . Monsanto took over the operation of the Clinton Laboratories on 1 July 1945 . Control of the entire site passed to the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947 . The Clinton Laboratories became the Clinton National Laboratory in late 1947 , and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in January 1948 . Union Carbide took over its management in December 1947 , bringing all of Oak Ridge 's operations under its control . 
 While the war was in progress , the Manhattan District resisted allowing labor unions access to its facilities . In 1946 , they were permitted to operate at the Clinton Engineer Works . Elections were held at K @-@ 25 , Y @-@ 12 and X @-@ 10 in August and September 1946 and the United Chemical Workers became their representative . A contract was negotiated with Union Carbide on 10 December . The Atomic Trades and Labor Council became the representative of the Clinton Laboratories , signing a contract with Monsanto on 18 December . 
 At its peak in May 1945 , 82 @,@ 000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works , and 75 @,@ 000 people lived in the township . By January 1946 , these figures had fallen to 43 @,@ 000 and 48 @,@ 000 respectively . By the time the Manhattan Project concluded at the end of 1946 , the corresponding figures were 34 @,@ 000 and 43 @,@ 000 . The departure of large numbers of construction workers meant that 47 percent of those remaining were family members of workers . Eight dormitories were closed in October 1945 . Most of those who remained in dorms now had their own rooms . The white hutments began to be removed . Trailers were returned to the Federal Public Housing Authority . 
 The end of the war brought national attention to Oak Ridge , and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the Black residents were living in . Roane @-@ Anderson dusted off plans for a village for them . The new village , called Scarboro , was built where the Gamble Valley Trailer Camp had once stood . Construction commenced in 1948 , and the first residents moved in two years later . It would house the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s . 
 In 1947 , Oak Ridge was still part of " an island of socialism in the midst of a free enterprise economy . " The AEC pressed forward with plans to withdraw from running the community , but it could never be too fast for some members of Congress . AEC officials patiently explained over and over how Roane @-@ Anderson provided far more than regular municipal services . For the residents , the benefits of a free enterprise economy were slight . They enjoyed low rents and no property taxes , but high standards of services and an excellent school system . Oak Ridge City Historian William J. Wilcox , Jr . , noted that the townspeople " thoroughly enjoyed their much protected existence and the benevolence the Army had provided " . A straw poll of the residents on opening the gates showed them opposed , 10 to 1 . 
 Nonetheless , on 19 March 1949 the residential and commercial portion of Oak Ridge was ceremoniously opened to public access . Vice President Alben W. Barkley , Governor Gordon Browning , Atomic Energy Commission Chairman David E. Lilienthal , and movie star Marie McDonald were on hand to watch the guards take down the barriers . Access to the nuclear facilities was controlled by three Oak Ridge gatehouses . On 6 June 1951 , the Senate Appropriations Committee called on the Atomic Energy Commission to discontinue " the present undemocratic method " of operating the community , and it initiated steps to coerce Oak Ridge residents to establish democratic institutions and adopt a free enterprise system .

 Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character played by John Barrowman in Doctor Who and its spin @-@ off series , Torchwood . The character first appears in the 2005 Doctor Who episode " The Empty Child " and subsequently features in the remaining episodes of the 2005 series as a companion to the series ' protagonist , the Doctor . Subsequent to this , Jack became the central character in the adult @-@ themed Torchwood , which aired from 2006 to 2011 . Barrowman also reprised the role for guest appearances in Doctor Who in its 2007 series and 2008 series , as well as the two part special The End of Time . 
 In contrast to the Doctor , Jack is more of a conventional action hero , as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble . In the programme 's narrative , Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century , who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and his companion Rose ( Billie Piper ) . As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale , Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth . There he becomes a member of Torchwood , a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats . He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor , over which time he becomes Torchwood 's leader . Eventually , he reunites with the Tenth Doctor ( David Tennant ) for several appearances in Doctor Who . Aspects of the character 's backstory — both prior to meeting the Doctor , and during his many decades living on Earth — are gradually revealed over Torchwood ( and to a lesser extent , Doctor Who ) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue . 
 Jack is the first openly non @-@ heterosexual character in the history of televised Doctor Who . The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin @-@ off series Torchwood . The character became a figure of the British public consciousness , rapidly gaining fame for portrayer John Barrowman . As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television , the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK . Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness .

 Jack Harkness first appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode " The Empty Child " and its continuation " The Doctor Dances " , when Rose ( Billie Piper ) , a companion of the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) , meets him during the Blitz . Although posing as an American volunteering in the Royal Air Force , Jack is actually a former " Time Agent " from the 51st century who left the agency after inexplicably losing two years of his memory . Now working as a con man , Jack is responsible for unwittingly releasing a plague in London in 1941 . After the Doctor cures the plague , Jack redeems himself by taking an unexploded bomb into his ship ; the Doctor and Rose rescue him moments before it explodes . He subsequently travels with the Doctor and Rose in the Doctor 's time traveling spacecraft , the TARDIS . During his time with the Doctor , Jack matures into a hero , and in his final 2005 appearance , he sacrifices himself fighting the evil alien Daleks . Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the time vortex , but when the power leaves her she doesn 't remember doing it . She and the Doctor subsequently leave Jack behind on Satellite 5 . 
 Harkness returned in 2006 as a character of the spin @-@ off series Torchwood , in which he is a member of the Cardiff @-@ based Torchwood Three in combating alien threats and monitoring a spacetime rift which runs through Cardiff . Jack is re @-@ introduced as a changed man , reluctantly immortal , having spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with the Doctor . Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) to the team of experts after she discovers them ; there are hints of romantic feelings between the two , but Gwen has a boyfriend and Jack enters a sexual relationship with the team 's general factotum Ianto Jones ( Gareth David @-@ Lloyd ) . Despite having worked with him for some time , his present @-@ day colleagues know very little about him ; over the course of the series they discover that he cannot die . Jack was once a prisoner of war , and was an interrogator who used torture . In the Torchwood Series One finale " End of Days " , Jack returns to the TARDIS . This immediately leads into the 2007 Doctor Who episode " Utopia " , where he joins the Tenth Doctor ( David Tennant ) and his companion Martha ( Freema Agyeman ) . Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by traveling to 1869 via vortex manipulator , and lived through the 20th century waiting for the Doctor . By the series finale , having spent a year in an alternate timeline enslaved by the Master ( John Simm ) , Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff . Before departing , Jack speculates about his immortality and reminisces about his youth on the <unk> Peninsula , an implicit suggestion that he may one day become the mysterious " Face of Boe " ( a recurring character voiced by Struan Rodger ) . 
 In Torchwood 's second series ( 2008 ) , Jack returns with a lighter attitude , and finds his team have continued working in his absence . They are also more insistent to learn of his past , especially after meeting his former partner , the unscrupulous Captain John Hart ( James Marsters ) . The episode " Adam " explores Jack 's childhood in the <unk> Peninsula , revealing through flashback sequences how his father Franklin ( Demetri <unk> ) died and young Jack ( Jack Montgomery ) lost his younger brother Gray ( Ethan Brooke ) during an alien invasion . Flashbacks in the series ' penultimate episode " Fragments " depict Jack 's capture by Torchwood in the late 19th century . Initially their prisoner , Jack is coerced into becoming a freelance agent for the organization , and eventually becomes leader of Torchwood Three at midnight on 1 January 2000 . The series finale features the return of Captain John and Jack 's brother Gray ( Lachlan Nieboer ) , who , after a lifetime of torture by aliens , want revenge on Jack . While Jack manages to repair his friendship with Captain John to some degree , he is forced to place his brother in cryogenic stasis after Gray kills his teammates Toshiko ( Naoko Mori ) and Owen ( Burn Gorman ) . Jack subsequently appears alongside the casts of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures in the two @-@ part crossover finale of the 2008 Doctor Who series , " The Stolen Earth " and " Journey 's End " . Jack is summoned along with other former companions of the Doctor to assist him in defeating the mad scientist Davros ( Julian Bleach ) and his creation , the Daleks . Jack parts company from the Doctor once again , having helped save the universe from destruction . 
 Torchwood 's third series ( 2009 ) is a five @-@ part serial entitled Children of Earth . Aliens known as the 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 6 announce they are coming to Earth . Civil servant John Frobisher ( Peter Capaldi ) orders the destruction of Torchwood to cover a conspiracy ; in 1965 , the British government had authorized Jack to sacrifice twelve children to the 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 6 , which is shown in flashbacks . Jack is blown apart in an explosion , but painfully <unk> from an incomplete pile of body parts ; Gwen and Ianto escape and later rescue Jack from a concrete grave . Jack 's daughter Alice ( Lucy Cohu ) and grandson Steven ( Bear McCausland ) are taken into custody by the assassins . The 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 6 demand ten percent of the world 's children . Although he handed over twelve children in 1965 , Jack refuses to give up any this time around . The 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 6 release a fatal virus ; Ianto dies in Jack 's arms . To create the signal that will destroy the 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 6 , Jack sacrifices Steven . Six months later , having lost his lover , his grandson and his daughter , he bids farewell to Gwen and is transported aboard an alien ship to leave Earth for parts unknown . In the closing scenes of 2010 Doctor Who special The End of Time , the critically injured Doctor gives each companion a farewell before his impending regeneration . Finding Jack in an exotic alien bar , he leaves him a note containing the name of Titanic crew member Alonso Frame ( Russell Tovey ) , sitting on Jack 's left side ; the two proceed to flirt . 
 The fourth series , Miracle Day ( 2011 ) , an American co @-@ production , sees Jack return to Earth to investigate a phenomenon where humans can no longer die ; Jack discovers that he has become mortal . Investigating their connection to the so @-@ called " miracle " , CIA agent Rex Matheson ( Mekhi Phifer ) renditions Jack and Gwen to America , but joins the team along with CIA colleague Esther Drummond ( Alexa Havins ) after conspirators within the CIA betray them . Jack 's investigations into the miracle repeatedly turn up dead @-@ ends , indicating a decades @-@ old conspiracy to manipulate the global economy , as well as political institutions , for unknown purposes . Flashbacks in " Immortal Sins " depict Jack 's relationship with Italian thief Angelo Colasanto ( Daniele <unk> ) in late 1920s New York City , ending in heartbreak after Jack is killed , bled and tortured repeatedly by the local community . In the present day , Angelo 's granddaughter Olivia ( Nana Visitor ) explains that the descendants of three local businessmen who wished to purchase Jack 's powers — " the Three Families " — are responsible for the miracle , using Jack 's blood in conjunction with what they call " the Blessing " . In " The Gathering " , the team ultimately track down the Families and the Blessing , which is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earth 's morphic field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires ; the team divide , attempting to reach both access points . To end the miracle , in " The Blood Line " , Jack has Gwen kill him so that his mortal blood can reset the human morphic field ; Gwen kills him with a bullet through the chest , while Rex — who <unk> himself with Jack 's blood to keep it safe — allows the Blessing to drain him too , in Buenos Aires . Rex survives , and with the morphic field restored , Jack resurrects . At Esther 's funeral however , they discover that Rex has acquired self @-@ healing abilities just like Jack 's .

 Jack features in the BBC Books " New Series Adventures " Doctor Who novels The Deviant Strain , The Stealers of Dreams , and Only Human . These novels take place between episodes of the 2005 series of Doctor Who . In The Stealers of Dreams , Jack refers to the Face of Boe as a famous figure in his home era ; the producers of the series had not conceptualized the possibility of a Jack and Boe connection until mid @-@ way into the production of the 2007 series . 
 The first wave of BBC Books Torchwood novels , Another Life , Border Princes , and Slow Decay ( published January 2007 ) , are set between episodes of the first series of Torchwood . The novels Trace Memory , The Twilight Streets , and Something in the Water ( published March 2008 ) , are set during the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood . The Twilight Streets suggests Jack was a freelance Torchwood agent in the 1940s , who disagreed with their methods but was persuaded by the love of an ex @-@ boyfriend , Greg . The novel also explained that during the events of the Doctor Who episode " Boom Town " ( which was set in Cardiff ) , Jack placed a lockdown on Torchwood activity so as not to create a paradox involving his past self . Trace Memory similarly depicts Jack as a freelance Torchwood agent , living and working in the late 1960s . Pack Animals , SkyPoint , and Almost Perfect ( October 2008 ) , are made up of more second series adventures , apart from Almost Perfect which is set after Series Two finale " Exit Wounds " . Into the Silence , Bay of the Dead , and The House that Jack Built ( May 2009 ) , similarly are set between the second and third series of the show . The House that Jack Built focuses partly on Jack 's life in 1906 . Risk Assessment , The Undertaker 's Gift , and Consequences ( October 2009 ) , are likewise set between " Exit Wounds " and Children of Earth . 
 First published in January 2008 , the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips , in which Jack also appears . One such comic , written in 2009 by John Barrowman and sister Carole E. Barrowman , " Captain Jack and the Selkie " , expands on Captain Jack 's characterisation . Barrowman comments that " We ’ d already agreed to tell a story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn ’ t been explored too much in other media . I wanted to give fans something original about Jack . " Torchwood Magazine also ran with the ten @-@ part Rift War ! storyline from April to December 2008 . The first Torchwood comic " Jetsam " was later collected along with Rift War ! in a graphic novel . 
 The Torchwood Archives , published after the second series in 2008 , is a companion book written by Gary Russell which gives an " insider 's look " into the life of Jack and the Torchwood team . The book collects and re @-@ publishes ancillary material which appeared on the Torchwood website in the first two seasons , and provides new material such as rough dates for things like Jack 's marriage as relayed by the book 's fictional narrator . The book is composed of fictitious archive notes , personnel forms , photographs , newspaper clippings and staff memos , and offers revelations about the character which would later be confirmed by the television series . For example , Archives first mention Jack 's lover Lucia Moretti , who is mentioned in Children of Earth . In a similar vein to The Torchwood Archives but from a real @-@ world perspective , Gary Russell 's The Torchwood Encyclopedia ( 2009 ) expands on " every fact and figure " for Jack and the Torchwood world .

 During the first series of Torchwood , the Torchwood website , located at <unk> , recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an alternate reality game made up of electronic literature in the form of fictional intercepted blogs , newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew . Written by James Goss , the first series ' website sheds some light on Jack 's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood . For the second series in 2008 , a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised , scripted by series writer Phil Ford , and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack 's unseen adventures . The BBC America Torchwood also has a ' Captain 's Blog ' section which relays Jack 's accounts of the events of each episode . The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form , including the Captain 's Blog section of the BBC America website . 
 During Series Four of Doctor Who , the BBC 's website also included a section called " Captain Jack 's Monster Files " featuring weekly webcast videos narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack giving " top secret " facts collected by Torchwood about Doctor Who monsters , such as the Slitheen . A Christmas special 2008 Monster File features Barrowman in new footage as Jack , as does the Cybermen edition added following the airing of " The Next Doctor " on Christmas Day . For Dr Fiona <unk> , the Monster Files ' mock @-@ documentary format give an " additional twist " to the interplay between history and fiction . Because Captain Jack narrates , " the story unfolds in the tradition of contemporary historical documentary , the docudrama " ; in the Monster File for " The Fires of Pompeii " , Harkness ' commentary moves the ' reality ' of the episode away from the explosion of Vesuvius and the human experience , and to the story itself . From Series Five onwards , the Monster Files are instead presented by River Song ( Alex Kingston ) . 
 Jack also appears in the web @-@ based motion comic series Torchwood : Web of Lies ( 2011 ) , which ties into Miracle Day . The story depicts a series two @-@ set adventure where Jack is kidnapped by unknown assailants and pursued by Gwen . Investigations by a woman named Holly ( voice of Eliza <unk> ) establish that Jack was kidnapped by the Three Families so they could acquire entire vats of his blood , which she destroys .

Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama , " Lost Souls " which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd and Freema Agyeman . Set after the events of the 2008 series , Jack and his team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva , as part of Radio 4 's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on . The special radio episode 's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider 's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite , as well as the team 's mourning of Toshiko and Owen 's recent deaths . Between 1 and 3 July , Radio 4 aired three further audio dramas in The Afternoon Play slot , bridging the gap between Series 2 and 3 . " Golden Age " introduced Jack 's ex @-@ lover Duchess Eleanor ( Jasmine Hyde ) , the leader of Torchwood India , which Jack closed down in 1924 . " The Dead Line " features another ex @-@ girlfriend of Jack 's , Stella Courtney ( Doña Croll ) . 
 2011 audio drama series The Lost Files was released to tie in with Miracle Day . " The Devil and Miss Carew " and " Submission " are set in the same period as the previous audio dramas . " House of the Dead " , however , reveals itself in its final act to be set six months after Ianto 's death ; Jack visited the House of the Dead to make contact with Ianto , who is unaware that he is dead . Jack and Ianto say a final goodbye and tell each other they love one another for the first time . Jack attempts to return to the land of the living alongside Ianto , but Ianto stays behind to close the Cardiff spacetime rift forever with Jack 's device .

 = = = Concept and creation = = = 
 In naming the character , executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness , a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand . Davies states that reusing names ( such as Tyler , Smith , Harper , Harkness and Jones ) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page . Jack 's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero , and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character . Following on that arc , the character 's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous , publicity materials asking , " Is he a force for good or ill ? " 
 Actor John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack . Barrowman says that at the time of his initial casting , Davies and co @-@ executive producer , Julie Gardner had explained to him that they " basically wrote the character around [ John ] " . Davies had singled out Barrowman for the part . On meeting him , Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent , his normal American accent , and an English accent ; Davies decided it " made it bigger if it was an American accent " . Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a " matinée idol quality " , telling him that " the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you " . A number of television critics have compared Barrowman 's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise . 
 The character 's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist , the Doctor , simultaneously paralleling the Doctor 's detached alien nature with Jack 's humanity and " heart " . John Barrowman describes the character in his initial appearance as " an intergalactic conman " and also a " rogue Time Agent " which he defines as " part of a kind of space CIA " and alludes to the moral ambiguity of having " done something in his past " and not knowing " whether it is good or bad because his memory has been erased " . Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel ( David Boreanaz ) , the heroic vampire from America 's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel ; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that " Back alley fights , knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of the correlations between the two characters . " Jack has also been compared to the title character of America 's Xena : Warrior Princess , which featured lesbian subtext between Xena ( Lucy Lawless ) and her close friend Gabrielle ( Renee O 'Connor ) . Polina <unk> , writing for AfterElton.com , an American gay men 's website , notes both are " complex characters " haunted by their past misdeeds . Furthermore , like Xena , Jack is " a gay basher ’ s worst nightmare : a queer weapon @-@ wielding , ass @-@ kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes " . One academic article refers to Jack as " an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure " . In a comparative contrast , where the Doctor is a pacifist , Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends . The BBC News website refers to Jack 's role within Doctor Who as " [ continuing ] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan " . Whereas in the classic series the female " companions " were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences , the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack , citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to " look at good looking men " . John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this . 
 Jack is bisexual , and is the first televised Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual . In Jack 's first appearance , the Doctor suggests that Jack 's orientation is more common in the 51st century , when humankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible . Within Doctor Who 's narrative , Jack 's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could " make it an issue " . On creating Jack , Davies comments " I thought : ' It 's time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television , ' " with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty . Davies also expresses that he didn 't make the character bisexual " from any principle " , but rather because " it would be interesting from a narrative point of view . " The bisexuality @-@ related labels " pansexual " and " omnisexual " are also frequently applied to the character . Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack 's mind ; Moffat also comments " It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone . " Within Torchwood , the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as " quaint " . In an interview with the Chicago Tribune , John Barrowman explained that " [ He ] ’ s bisexual , but in the realm of the show , we call him omnisexual , because on the show , [ the characters ] also have sex with aliens who take human form , and sex with male @-@ male , women @-@ women , all sorts of combinations . " The term is also used once , in @-@ universe , in the novel The House that Jack Built , when Ianto comments to a woman 's remark about Jack , " He prefers the term ' omnisexual ' . " 
 = = = Costume = = = 
 While in his first several Doctor Who appearances , Jack did not have a set costume , Torchwood established a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance . The design has been described as " an iconic piece of sci @-@ fi culture " . A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack 's appeal to the coat : " I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears . Coats are cool , just like fezzes and bow ties and <unk> . The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn 't ever tell you his coat is cool . It just is . " In fact , in her essay " <unk> Masculinity and Desire " , Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwood 's popularity — as well as that of the character — to the costume . She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character 's masculinity , and argues that Jack 's costume creates its own discourse " through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema 's escapism flows " . 
 During Jack 's initial appearances in Doctor Who , Russell T Davies held a " half @-@ hearted " theory that Jack would dress specific to the time period he was in , to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes . He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II @-@ set episodes , but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode " Boom Town " and black leather in futuristic episodes . Davies admits that this was a " bit of a lame idea " and decided that Jack " never looked better than when he was in his World War II outfit " . From the pilot of Torchwood onwards , Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War , including braces and an officer 's wool greatcoat in every appearance . Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that " We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him , so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour . " Because the character was expected to " be running around a lot " , Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain 's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less " weighty " . Jack 's other costumes are " loosely wartime based " , such as the trousers are " getting more and more styled to suit his figure " . Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show . The " hero version " is used for most scenes , while there is also a <unk> made with pre @-@ shrunk fabric , running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught , and two " stunt coats " that had been " hero coats " in the first series . " Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character " likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity " . Julie Gardner describes the coat as " epic and classic and dramatic " , while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack " a sweep and a presence " . 
 For Miracle Day , Davies commissioned new costume designer Shawna Trpcic ( previously costume designer for Angel , Firefly and Dollhouse ) to create a new greatcoat design . This was partially motivated by Los Angeles ' warmer climate ; shooting in Wales had necessitated Barrowman be fit in much warmer clothing . The new coat is custom made by Italian designers , and is actually cashmere @-@ blend wool where the previous one had been cotton . Trpcic says that she " just wanted to modernise it , give it a more modern fit , but leave the drape and keep it cape @-@ like " . Trpcic felt prepared for the job of redesigning the coat because of her prior work on Firefly , tailoring for Nathan Fillion 's Captain Malcolm Reynolds : " I 'm kind of used to iconic captain 's coats and the importance of staying loyal to what the fans expect and to what we need " . Journalist Maureen Ryan commented that the new coat is " greatly improved " and the redesign " gives the coat the kind of movement and swagger Jack brings with him on every adventure " .

 The character is described as both " lethally charming ... good looking and utterly captivating " , as well as " flirtatious , cunning , clever and a bit of an action man " . Within Doctor Who , Jack 's personality is relatively light @-@ hearted , although this changes in Torchwood 's first series , where he becomes a darker character . In Torchwood 's first series , Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader , in which he is predominantly more aloof . In Torchwood , he would occasionally inquire or muse about the afterlife and religion , sympathising with a man 's desire to die . Returning in Doctor Who Series Three , Jack indicates he now maintains a less suicidal outlook than before . In the second series of Torchwood , Jack became a much more light @-@ hearted character once again , after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor . In the third series of Torchwood , the audience sees some of Jack 's " darker side " , as well as " the secrets that Jack has , the pressures , drama and the trauma he 's carrying on his shoulders " . 
 Lynnette Porter comments on Jack 's relation to scholar FitzRoy Somerset , 4th Baron Raglan 's theses on ' the hero ' in fiction . Because Jack is immortal and always comes back from the dead , Porter argues that Jack cannot literally fulfil the " physical death aspect " of Raglan 's criteria for a hero . However , Jack instead has several symbolic deaths . For instance , in the last scene of Children of Earth . Porter observes that camera angles emphasise Jack 's profile as solitary man atop a hill in Cardiff , departing . This scene of " going away for good " against the backdrop of the city he has long protected , hints at the death of the Captain Jack persona ; in Porter 's words , " the immortal captain " dies " at the top of a hill in Wales at the conclusion of the " epic " miniseries " , " epic " traditionally being the genre of heroism . The American political blog Daily Kos states Jack " can certainly be characterised as a Byronic hero , a tragic figure with a streak of melancholy , heroic yet misunderstood , bold yet rash . Most importantly , his sexuality is one single aspect of a much more complex , flawed character . " G. Todd Davis examines the ways in which Jack conforms to the Byronic hero character trope . Physically , he identifies Jack as dark @-@ haired and strikingly handsome , with masculine physique ; he is intelligent and aware of it , to the point of a superiority complex ; he demands unquestioning loyalty , has guilty secrets in his past , and is self @-@ sacrificing . For this , Davis lists Jack alongside Milton 's Satan from Paradise Lost , Shelley 's Prometheus , and also Angel from Buffy , amongst others . 
 As a show , Torchwood is highly intertextual . The consequence of this is that many sides of Jack are shown across various media . One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack 's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes . The character 's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences , would later shape his appearances both as a traditional " action hero " and as a positive role model for younger viewers . Barrowman also remarks that " The beauty of Captain Jack , and one of the reasons why I think , as an actor , I 've landed on my feet , is that he 's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who . " 
 = = = = Moral ambiguity = = = = 
 In several instances in Torchwood , Jack displays no qualms about killing a person of any species , which within Doctor Who , allows Jack 's character to act in ways the lead character cannot . Barrowman remarks , " He 'll do things the Doctor won 't do ... [ such as ] fight . Jack will kill . And the Doctor , in a way , knows that , so he lets Jack do it . I 'd say Jack 's the companion @-@ hero . " A flashback in the third series of Torchwood shows Captain Jack sacrificing twelve children to aliens in order to save millions of lives . Davies feels that the third series of Torchwood is a " tale of retribution and perhaps redemption " for Captain Jack , who experiences " maximum damage " when his lover Ianto is killed . Davies chose to have Ianto die so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his grandson in order to destroy the same aliens . 
 When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series of Doctor Who , he is verbally warned " don 't you dare " when pointing a gun , and scolded when contemplating snapping the Master 's neck . Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen in Torchwood , Jack shoots his killer in the forehead , killing him in an act of swift revenge . Whilst the Doctor scolds Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute ( an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive ) , Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor 's image ; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th @-@ century Torchwood . Actor Gareth David @-@ Lloyd describes the 19th century Torchwood as " quite ruthless and quite evil " and " on the other side " from Jack and the Doctor . Through Jack , whose perspective is widened by his experiences in other planets and times , the organisation was able to grow less jingoistic . One academic article , which compares Torchwood to the American drama series 24 , opines that Jack 's attitudes make the show 's ethos largely antithetical to that of 24 . Because Jack explores the " complexity of negotiating differing worldviews , cultural values , beliefs , and moral codes " through a framework established by the Doctor , to " value life , support democratic principles and egalitarianism , and protect those who cannot protect themselves " , consequently " The world of Torchwood is depicted , not as the dichotomous " us " ( or United States ) and " other " of Jack Bauer 's 24 , but as the <unk> , omnisexual , <unk> world of Jack Harkness . " Porter finds , however , that like Bauer , Jack saves the world using similarly morally grey means when he tortures Beth the sleeper agent , in " Sleeper " , in order to avert an interplanetary attack . 
 Although science fiction heroes have , Porter argues , " grown greyer over time " , Jack represents as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend , resulting in a full " devolution / deconstruction of the traditional hero " . In Children of Earth , Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world . Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular . He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity ; the actor says " when I read all of the stuff he had to do , I had to look at it from the point of view of ' I 'm Jack Harkness and I 'm right ' . " For Lynnette Porter , Jack 's actions in the serial make him " a benchmark for [ morally ] grey heroes " ; some audiences may even view him , in light of his actions , as " villainous or downright monstrous . " Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world 's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456 , the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult ( and to some viewers , reprehensible ) decision . Such , Porter argues , is the mark of a grey hero . Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he " loved " the uproarious reaction to Jack 's actions , defending the character in saying " He saved every single child in the world ! If you would fail to do that then you ’ re the monster , frankly . It ’ s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get . " When Jack is departing Earth , the music playing is titled " Redemption " , signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial . 
 = = = = Face of Boe = = = = 
 Russell T Davies referred to a scene in " Last of the Time Lords " as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character " the Face of Boe " ( a large , mysterious disembodied head in a glass case ) as a consequence of his immortality and slow aging . The Face first appeared in 2005 episode " The End of the World " , appearing fully three times and maintaining a presence through to the end of the 2007 series . Barrowman described himself and David Tennant as being " so excited " to the extent where they " jumped up screaming " when they read Jack 's line regarding the Face of Boe , remarking " It was probably the most excitable moment we had during the shooting of that series . " The Face of Boe had originally been a throwaway line in a script for " The End of the World " ; because creating the character seemed expensive , the Face of Boe was nearly discarded and replaced . However , special effects designer Neil Gorton loved the idea and pushed to make sure the character lived . Davies loved Gorton 's design and to his surprise , the character was written into future episodes and became pivotal in the third series . In a spin @-@ off novel , The Stealer of Dreams ( 2005 ) , Captain Jack makes a reference to the Face of Boe as a famous figure . Davies conceived the idea that the two characters might be connected midway through the production of the 2007 series . 
 Barrowman states that when fans ask him if Jack is really the Face of Boe , he tells them he believes he is and states that he and Davies hold it to be true " in [ their ] little world " ; the link is " unconfirmed " within the text of the show . As to how Jack becomes the Face , Barrowman feels the answer doesn 't matter as it is intentionally mysterious . Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack , " Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information " which he feels is a " wonderful twist of events " . However , Davies doesn 't like making whether Jack really is the Face of Boe explicit , stating " the moment it became very true or very false , the joke dies " . He has refused the publication of spin @-@ off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two . 
 In relationship to Miracle Day , where Jack becomes mortal , critics approached Barrowman and Davies about the implications of such a move for Jack 's potential future as the Face of Boe . Barrowman stated that the open @-@ ended rules of the science fiction genre meant that Jack could still become the Face of Boe even after Miracle Day . By contrast , Davies was keen to emphasise that the possibility of Jack becoming the Face of Boe remained " conjecture " , and that the possibility remained that Jack would not survive Miracle Day , adding " You know how I love killing people off . "

 In a Doctor Who Magazine interview , Barrowman described Jack 's love for Ianto as " lustful " , and explained " I don 't think he 'd settle down with Ianto . He might do , but he 'd let Ianto know that he [ Jack ] has to play around on the side " . The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date , after finding out Gwen is engaged . John Barrowman and Gareth David @-@ Lloyd opined in an interview at Comic @-@ Con to fan questions that Jack 's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack 's empathy , and helped to ground him . John Barrowman said in an interview that Ianto " brings out the " human " in [ Jack ] " and " brings out more ... empathy because he ’ s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... [ which ] makes him warm to other people ... [ and ] makes him more approachable . " In the same interview , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that " I think Ianto ’ s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show . " However , Stephen James Walker feels that Jack 's relationship with Ianto is one @-@ sided ; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is " serious and committed " , but while dancing with Gwen in " Something Borrowed " , Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a " recreational activity " , and considers it " obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen " . The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is " just a shag " , though discloses that the relationship means more to him . In the same novel , however , he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his " boyfriend " . When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play " The Dead Line " ( just prior to Children of Earth ) , however , Jack insists " You will never be just a blip in time , Ianto Jones . Not to me . " 
 Just as Jack and Ianto 's relationship is developing , Ianto dies , in Children of Earth ( 2009 ) . While some fans felt " cheated " at not seeing the relationship develop further , Davies explains his intention was to heighten the tragedy by it also being a loss of potential , stating " You grieve over everything they could have been . Everything you hoped for them . " For dramatic purposes within the story , Davies explains that Ianto 's death was necessary so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his own grandson . Gareth David @-@ Lloyd feels that the lack of resolution for the love story is " part of the tragedy " . Lynnette Porter feels that Ianto 's demise is intended as a watershed moment where Jack loses his effectiveness as a hero . At least for a time , a grieving Jack loses his focus and gives up ; within a few months , Jack flees Earth and his role as the expected hero . Some fans were displeased by Ianto 's death scene and the end of the relationship , and some even accused one the writers of " deliberately egging on the shippers ' " . Subsequent to Ianto 's death , in The End of Time ( 2010 ) , the Doctor sets up Jack with a new romantic interest , Alonso Frame ( Tovey ) . Fans of Ianto , who felt cheated by the character 's death , disliked this development . GayNZ.com compared the situation to Buffy fans ' reaction to Willow 's relationship with Kennedy ( <unk> Limon ) in Buffy 's seventh season , following Tara 's death in the show 's sixth . 
 Ianto makes a post @-@ death appearance in 2011 audio drama " The House of the Dead " . Encountering Ianto 's spirit at a haunted location in Wales , Jack and Ianto are permitted a final goodbye . Without Ianto in his life , Jack wishes to be swept up into the Cardiff spacetime rift as it closes in an attempt at suicide . Ianto tricks Jack into leaving the House of the Dead , however , despite the possibility of resurrection . As they are forced to part forever by the closing of the rift , the couple declare their love for one another for the first and last time . 
 = = = = Gwen = = = = 
 Barrowman states in a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes featurette that Gwen brings a " little bit of soul " back to Jack , following her recruitment . In a 2007 interview , Eve Myles , who plays Gwen , describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a " palpable love " and opines that " with Jack and Gwen , it ’ s the real thing and they ’ re going to make you wait for that . " The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen 's working relationship , with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode " Ghost Machine " as a key example , as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in " Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang " , the series two opener . AfterElton.com 's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of " her warmth , her sense of justice , her very ordinariness and lack of glamour " , whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen 's attraction to Jack by stating : " the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him – it 'd be hard not to " . Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a " compelling trickster " , who acts out Gwen 's private desires with his " outrageous flirting " . She suggests that Jack ( unlike Rhys ) is not mature enough to occupy the role of " steady prince " for Gwen , whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her , " he 'd have to commit completely " ; this is why he does not act on his feelings , because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people , he could " never afford to do anything more " . Gareth David @-@ Lloyd , who played Ianto , feels that for Jack , " there ’ s two different sorts of love going on there " , and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways , although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated . Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen 's idealisation of Jack , which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto 's death . Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth , but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy . 
 A press release for Torchwood Series Four states that Jack is brought back to Earth because of his " unstated love " for Gwen , who in turn still feels for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led beside him . Whilst Miracle Day lead writer Russell T Davies states in response to a question posed by AfterElton that he " hates " the idea of romantic tension between Gwen and Jack , executive producer Julie Gardner answers by stating " They love each other . Of course they do . " Myles believes that in series four , Gwen and Jack have a " love @-@ hate @-@ love relationship " resembling in different ways a sibling relationship , a marital relationship and also " the strongest friendship " . Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter . Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have different needs and that this means they inevitably " clash like steel blades " . Simon Brew of Den of Geek praises the dynamic between Gwen and Jack in series four , describing them as " a terrific double act " and states that " Torchwood is at , or near , its best when the two of them are working in tandem " .

 Discussing whether his character could ever find " The One " , John Barrowman asserts that Jack " likes everybody , and his love for each person is different " . Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor , but " would never take that beyond infatuation " and " would never let the Doctor know " . Barrowman claims that Jack also " fancies " fellow companion Martha Jones , admiring her " tenacity " and willingness to " spat with him " , and describes Jack 's love for Toshiko and Owen as " fatherly " , stating " He was guiding them . That 's why it was so devastating for him to lose them . " The second series of Torchwood also introduced Jack 's ex @-@ lover , Captain John . Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John to act as a " proper nemesis , somebody to really test [ Jack ] , to push him , and to reveal something about Jack 's character " . In the use of Captain John as a literary foil , Chibnall comments " you see the way Jack could have gone , and probably did , for a little while " which underlines how " Jack , in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood , made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour . " 
 In their academic publication , Queer TV , Glyn Davis and Gary Needham discuss Jack 's role within Torchwood as a post @-@ gay , romantic hero . Noting Torchwood 's central gay themes , they comment that " it is through the character of Captain Jack that Torchwood is able to mine its queerness . " Discussing Jack 's brief romance with his namesake , the real Captain Jack ( Matt Rippy ) , academic critics have noted that " The Captain Jacks both share the same name and are quite similar in physical appearance , thus <unk> the homo @-@ ness of the situation . Through the time @-@ travel device this points to a narcissistic self @-@ fascination , the old cliché that homosexuality is the love for sameness . " Other relationships which have been described or alluded to ( both in the television series and other media ) include ex @-@ girlfriends Estelle Cole , Duchess Eleanor , Stella Courtney , and Lucia Moretti , ex @-@ boyfriends and Angelo Colasanto , as well as an unnamed ex @-@ wife . 
 Describing the patterns of his relationships throughout the series , Davis and Needham draw the conclusion that " while Captain Jack desires both men and women , his long @-@ term love affairs and onscreen kisses are mostly with men in the past and present . " Davies himself laments that this one of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character , commenting " The trap you fall into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men . " Commenting on the show 's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality , or in what Russell T Davies calls " <unk> " , they continue to remark that " His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation . " They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes , such as gay time @-@ travel romance episode " Captain Jack Harkness " , and within that the relevance of time @-@ travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post @-@ Brokeback television . In Understanding TV Texts by Phil Wickham , Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly " brings to the fore " with his " brazen bisexuality " , " something we have to come to expect [ from Russell T Davies ] as viewers of his work " . Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack 's bisexuality , but Davies assured interviewers that Jack 's interests in both men and women would be honoured .

 Following the character 's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of Doctor Who , the character became incredibly popular with fans , to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin @-@ off series , Torchwood , primarily centred around the character . The Times described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to " National Treasure status " . For his role as Captain Jack , John Barrowman was nominated for Best Actor at the 2007 BAFTA Cymru Awards , and again for Children of Earth at the 2010 TV Choice Awards , against Eleventh Doctor actor Matt Smith . Harkness was also listed number nine in TV Squad 's " Ten Most mysterious characters on television " , behind the Tenth Doctor , who was listed number three . John Barrowman , who is himself gay , has ranked in the Independent on Sunday Pink List , a list of the most influential gay people in Britain , in 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 with the Independent commenting that " Proof of his popularity came with the continued runaway success of his bisexual Captain Jack Harkness on Russell T Davies 's Torchwood " . Part of Jack 's mystique was his sex appeal , swashbuckling heroism and sexual appetite . In anticipation of the character 's return to Doctor Who in series 3 after a successful run in the first series of Torchwood , mainstream media hailed his return . 
 Captain Jack has gone on to become a recognisable figure in the British public consciousness , and has attracted some parody . These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman 's portrayal . The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers . Played by Jon Culshaw , the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness , as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood . In one sketch , he walks bizarrely towards the camera , kissing a policeman as he passes him . In another sketch , he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen , a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who . Satirical technology columnist Verity <unk> wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas 's radio play Under Milk Wood , called Under Torch Wood . This parody described Captain Jack as " the insomniac <unk> ; snug as a hobbit , pretty as a choirboy , immortal as carbon dioxide , wooden as a horse . " Barrowman 's ubiquity , however , has even provoked criticism of the character . Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror , in his review of Children of Earth , said " Unlike David Tennant 's Doctor , Barrowman 's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight 's the Night , The Kids Are All Right and Any Dream Will Do , is so over @-@ exposed , ' Captain Jack ' is about as intriguing or alien as a <unk> and twice as irritating . Unlike Tennant , as an actor he is just not good enough . " Television journalist Charlie Brooker , in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman , with focus on his acting . " Harkness is of course a man of mystery . You can 't tell what he 's thinking just by looking at his face ... no matter how hard Barrowman tries . " 
 The character 's <unk> extends outside the UK . In a Halloween episode of the 2008 series of American drama Knight Rider , character Billy Morgan ( Paul Campbell ) dresses up as Captain Jack , whom he refers to as " the time @-@ travelling bisexual " . Jack represents a new character archetype , which other writers have begun to draw from . For example , comic book writer Peter David reflects that in writing Marvel Comics character Shatterstar , he " to some degree ... key [ s ] his personality off Captain Jack Harkness " insofar as he is " swashbuckling , enthusiastic and sexually curious about anything with a pulse " . In 2009 , Barrowman 's variety show Tonight 's the Night broadcast a specially written humorous Doctor Who scene scripted by Russell T Davies . In the scene , Barrowman appears initially as Captain Jack confronting an alien on board the TARDIS who claims to be the Doctor . However , David Tennant appears as himself and John Barrowman is revealed as playing Captain Jack in the TARDIS set . Action figures have also been created in the actor 's likeness , which Barrowman says was a " longtime dream " . 
 In the media , Jack is described as both the " first openly gay companion " and as a " hunky bisexual " . Jack 's notability is largely due to his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television , for whom sexual identity is " matter @-@ of @-@ fact " , and not an issue . The ordinariness with which Jack 's orientation is regarded within Doctor Who embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality . The distinct flexibility of Jack 's sexuality contributed directly towards the character 's popularity and public interest . The <unk> of Jack 's sexuality broke new grounds , the labels " pansexual " and " omnisexual " being applied to the character on occasion . In " The Parting of the Ways " , Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips , the latter being the first same @-@ sex kiss in the history of the program . Despite the boldness of the first lesbian , gay or bisexual character in the series ' run , there has been very little uproar about the character , although there was some controversy at the time of Jack 's introduction . <unk> , Barrowman tries to link Jack 's popularity with this portrayal , noting " I think audiences just get Jack because he 's honest ... to finally see a character who doesn 't care who he flirts with , I think is a bit refreshing . " 
 The presence of the character in prime time television sparked discussion of the nature of bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked . <unk> cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers , where little had been present for this audience in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance . Dr Meg John Barker writes for the Journal of Bisexuality that although " the b word does not actually get used during the show " , Jack is one of the first positive and clearly bisexual characters on British television . She does point out however that Jack retains some elements of bisexual stereotyping , particularly in his " flamboyant " promiscuity . Jack has also been cited in America to contrast the portrayals of non @-@ heterosexual characters in mainstream television in the US and the UK . Gary Scott Thompson , producer of the 2008 revival of Knight Rider , said , " If I could use Jack in Torchwood as a role model — I would absolutely use him as a role model — I love his <unk> about ... everybody " . 
 Readers of AfterElton.com voted Jack the tenth best gay or bisexual television character of all time , the poll itself ultimately being won by Brian Kinney , a character from the North American version of Queer as Folk which was developed by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman from the British series created by Russell T Davies . The website praised Jack — one of only two bisexual characters on the list of 25 — for being having both " tough " and " tender " sides to his personality , as seen in the Torchwood episode " Captain Jack Harkness " . Amongst science fiction characters , Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters , beating Hellblazer 's John Constantine for the top spot , commenting upon Jack 's representation of a " ' post @-@ gay ' approach to sexual themes " and awarding him a full 10 / 10 for cultural significance . For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards , Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character . The website commented that " unlike virtually every other TV sci @-@ fi character , lead or supporting , Captain Jack is also openly bisexual . Ironically , this " small " change served to help make the science fiction genre , long the ultimate bastion of straight men , accessible not just to GLBT people , but also straight women , who also enjoy the show ’ s alternate take on sexuality . " The third award won for Torchwood , after Favourite TV Drama and Character , was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple , for which the editor commented " Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual ( or in Jack ’ s case " omnisexual " ) characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci @-@ fi ; it ’ s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter @-@ of @-@ fact way . There ’ s no <unk> [ s ] ing , no <unk> [ s ] ing , and no <unk> [ s ] ing — just good , old @-@ fashioned romance and adventure . "

 The Poznań 1956 protests , also known as the Poznań 1956 uprising or Poznań June ( Polish : Poznański <unk> ) , were the first of several massive protests against the government of the People 's Republic of Poland . Demonstrations by workers demanding better conditions began on June 28 , 1956 at Poznań 's Cegielski Factories and were met with violent repression . 
 A crowd of approximately 100 @,@ 000 gathered in the city center near the local Ministry of Public Security building . About 400 tanks and 10 @,@ 000 soldiers of the People 's Army of Poland and the Internal Security Corps under Polish @-@ Soviet general Stanislav Poplavsky were ordered to suppress the demonstration and during the pacification fired at the protesting civilians . 
 The death toll was placed between 57 and over a hundred people , including a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , <unk> <unk> . Hundreds of people sustained injuries . The Poznań protests were an important milestone on the way to the installation of a less Soviet @-@ controlled government in Poland in October . 
 = = Background = = 
 After Joseph Stalin 's death , the process of <unk> prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc . Nikita Khrushchev 's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries . In Poland , in addition to the criticism of the cult of personality , popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of ' local , national socialism ' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail ; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers ' Party members of Stalin 's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge . 
 Anti @-@ communist resistance in Poland was also bolstered , and a group of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Wheel Club ) in Warsaw . It promoted discussions about Polish independence , questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy , and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II . While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications ( bibuła ) , workers took to the streets . The living conditions in Poland did not improve , contrary to government propaganda , and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party ( nomenklatura ) . 
 The city of Poznań was one of the largest urban and industrial centers of the People 's Republic of Poland . Tensions were growing there , particularly since autumn of 1955 . Workers in the largest factory in the city , Joseph Stalin 's ( or ' Cegielski 's ) Metal Industries , were complaining about higher taxes for most productive workers ( <unk> ) , which affected several thousands of workers . Local directors were unable to make any significant decisions due to micromanagement by the higher officials ; over several months , petitions , letters and delegations were sent to the Polish Ministry of Machine Industry and Central Committee of Polish United Workers ' Party , to no avail . 
 Finally , a delegation of about 27 workers was sent to Warsaw around June 23 . On the night of June 26 , the delegation returned to Poznań , confident that some of their demands had been considered in a favourable light . The Minister of Machine Industry met with the workers next morning and withdrew several promises that their delegation was given in Warsaw . 
 = = Strikes = = 
 A spontaneous strike started at 6 : 00 am at the <unk> complex of Joseph Stalin 's ( or ' Cegielski 's ) Metal Industries . Around 80 % of its workers , most of whom had lost bonus pay in June as the government suddenly raised the required work quota , took to the streets demanding pay compensation and some freedom concessions , marching towards the city centre . Workers at other plants , institutions and students joined the procession . 
 Between 9 : 00 am and 11 : 00 am , about 100 @,@ 000 people gathered on the Adam Mickiewicz Square in front of the Imperial Castle in Poznań , surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and Party authorities and police headquarters . The demonstrators demanded lower food prices , wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers ' conditions . They further requested a visit from Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz , as the local government declared that they had no authority to solve the problems . Some police officers also joined the crowd . 
 After 10 : 00 am the situation rapidly deteriorated when provocateurs came into action , claiming that members of the negotiating delegation had been arrested . The local units of the regular police ( <unk> <unk> ) were unable to contain the crowd and the situation turned into a violent uprising as the crowds stormed the prison at <unk> Street , where some protesters believed the members of the delegation to have been imprisoned ; hundreds of prisoners were released around 10 : 50 am . At 11 : 30 am , the arms depot at the prison building was seized and the firearms were distributed among the demonstrators . 
 The crowd ransacked the Communist Party 's local headquarters and then at around 11 : 00 am attacked the office of the Ministry of Public Security on <unk> Street , but were repulsed when the first shots were fired from its windows into the crowd . From then until 6 : 00 pm , they seized or besieged many government buildings and institutions in and around Poznań , including the district courthouse and the prosecutor 's office , radio jamming station in <unk> Street , police stations in <unk> , Wilda , <unk> , <unk> and Mosina . The prison camp in <unk> and the military school at the Poznań University of Technology were seized and weapons were taken . The police documents at local police station , <unk> and court were destroyed . 
 In the meantime , at about 11 : 00 am , 16 tanks , 2 armored personnel carriers and 30 cars had been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations , a Poznań garrison , to protect the designated buildings , but no shots were exchanged between them and the insurgents . These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters ; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed . Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky , the Minister of National Defense , who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland , decided to take personal control , and the situation changed dramatically . 
 Rokossovsky sent his deputy , the Polish @-@ Soviet general Stanislav Poplavsky and a group of lower Soviet officers , with orders to put down the protest in a manner consistent with Russian standards , intending to end the demonstrations as soon as possible to prevent an occurrence similar to the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany , when a similar protest , not quelled in time , spread to many other regions . The Russian officers arrived at 2 : 00 pm at <unk> Airport and took command . Poplavsky did not bother to use local regulars from Poznań garrisons , instead taking other troops from Silesian Military District and recalling special troops from the <unk> military base north of Poznań . The troops were told that the protesters were led and organized by " German provocateurs " who were attempting to darken Poland 's image during the ongoing Poznań International Fair . 
 Between 4 : 00 pm and 5 : 00 am the following day , the Polish 10th Armored Division , Polish 19th Armored Division , Polish 4th Infantry Division and Polish 5th Infantry Division , totaling about 10 @,@ 300 troops and the Internal Security Corps under the command of Poplavsky entered Poznań . A two @-@ hour long procession of tanks , armored cars , field guns , and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it . At 9 : 00 pm a wave of detentions began . The detainees were taken to <unk> airport , where they were subjected to brutal interrogation ; 746 persons were detained until August 8 . The protests continued until June 30 , when the troops finally pacified the city , after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators . At 7 : 30 am on June 29 the Prime Minister arrived and infamously declared on the local radio station that " any provocateur or lunatic who raises his hand against the people 's government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off . " 
 The number of casualties is currently a subject of academic dispute . The historian Łukasz <unk> from the Institute of National Remembrance ( IPN ) estimates it to be 57 dead and about 600 wounded ( including eight on the side of the government ) , noting that larger estimates , such as that by another IPN scholar , Stanisław <unk> , who places the figure at slightly over 100 , are not fully supported by available data . Estimates of a similar range , such as the " over 70 deaths " , can be found in media reports .

 About 25 people were arrested in the first few days , including 196 workers ; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks . Stanisław <unk> , the lawyer who defended them , was later repressed for his statement that the government 's actions had led to the death of innocent civilians . The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign ( Western ) secret services ; nonetheless this became the official line of the government for years to come . 
 Soon the ideologues realized that they had lost the support of the Soviet Union , and the regime turned to conciliation by announced wage rises and other reforms . Realizing the need for a change in leadership , the Polish communists chose a new leader , Władysław Gomułka , who was considered a moderate ; this transition is known as Polish October ( or " Gomułka Thaw " ) . In spite of this , the communist authorities censored all information on the Poznań events for a quarter of a century . 
 Historians were denied source materials for research , and the campaign was effective in eliminating any mention of the events of June 1956 from publicly available sources . Persecution of the most active participants would be carried out for many years . The memory of the events was preserved by the participants and members of opposition . After the Gdańsk Agreement in 1980 , the Independent Self @-@ governing Trade Union " Solidarity " as one of its first actions decided to raise a monument in the memory of the Poznań June 1956 events . 
 Many historians consider the Poznań 1956 protests to be an important milestone in modern history of Poland , and one of the events that precipitated the fall of communism in Poland . Nonetheless it should be noted that the protests of 1956 were not motivated by anti @-@ communist ideology ; the workers ' demands were mostly of an economic nature , centering around better work conditions rather than any political objectives . The workers sang " The Internationale " and their banners read " We demand bread . " It was the government 's consistent failure to fulfil the first demand which eventually led to the demands for political change , but even during the history of Solidarity few demanded wide political reforms . 
 = = = Commemoration = = = 
 On June 21 , 2006 , to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the events , the Polish parliament Sejm declared June 28 to be a national holiday in Poland ; the Day of Remembrance of the Poznań June 1956 .

 A potential superpower is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be , or is in the process of becoming , a superpower at some point during the 21st century . Presently , only the United States fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower . 
 Predictions about potential superpower have been made in the past , but they have not been perfect . States most commonly mentioned as being potential superpowers , are China , India , the European Union , Russia and Brazil . Collectively , these potential superpowers , as well as the United States , comprise 68 @.@ 0 % of global nominal GDP , 62 @.@ 4 % of global GDP ( PPP ) , more than one third of the total land area and more than 50 % of the world 's population . 
 = = Past predictions = = 
 Predictions made in the past have not been perfect . For example , in the 1980s , many political and economic analysts predicted that Japan would eventually accede to superpower status , due to its large population , huge gross domestic product and high economic growth at that time . Though still the world 's tenth @-@ largest population and third @-@ largest economy as of 2016 in terms of nominal GDP , Japan has faced an ongoing period of weak growth since the Lost Decade of the 1990s , and has been suffering from an aging population since the early 2000s , eroding its potential as a superpower .

 The Federative Republic of Brazil has seen limited discussion among authorities regarding its potential as a superpower .

 Writing for the The Diplomatic Courier , former British Ambassador to Brazil , Peter Collecott , identifies that Brazil 's recognition as a potential superpower largely stems from its own national identity and ambition . Collecott points out that for the past two hundred years Brazil has sought to emerge as a serious global economic and political power , a position " that [ Brazil ] instinctively feels is her due . " However , Collecott also argues that while Brazil has certainly fulfilled some of its aspirations and finally started to gain the international recognition it deserves , it perhaps won 't quite emerge as a superpower ; instead , its current position as an emerging power will allow Brazil to shape the future with more realistic aspirations . 
 In his 2014 publication , The <unk> Superpower Challenge : Foreign and Security Policy Analysis , professor Kwang Ho Chun carefully assesses the likelihood of the <unk> countries attaining the status of superpowers . Regarding Brazil , Kwang Ho Chun highlights that the country possesses enormous and almost untouched " strategic " natural resources , including valuable minerals , a tenth of the world 's fresh water and the Earth 's largest remaining rainforest . Because of this , Kwang Ho Chun feels it is likely that Brazil could gain a dominant role in international relations , especially when it comes to environmental issues . This soft power influence is further enhanced by Brazil 's policy makers seeking to engage in as many international organizations as possible and forming alliances , most notably on social , diplomatic and economic issues . Despite its economic potential and Brazil 's " self @-@ image as a country with a great destiny , " Kwang Ho Chun believes that the country " falls far short of the levels required for a superpower . " Supporting his belief , he emphasizes Brazil 's apparent lack of " traditional hard power " ( i.e. military power and global security influence ) as a major obstacle . Kwang Ho Chun writes that Brazil has " little incentive to invest in its military " as " the country developed in an environment with hardly any inter @-@ state security threats " , therefore Brazil " may never be in a position to accumulate enough influence on global security matters to meet the criteria of being a superpower . " Instead , Ho Chun feels that Brazil will emerge as a great power with an important position in some spheres of influence but limited in others such as international security . 
 = = China = = 
 The People 's Republic of China receives continual coverage in the popular press of its emerging superpower status , and has been identified as a rising or emerging economic growth and military superpower by academics and other experts . In fact , the " rise of China " has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the Global Language Monitor , as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media , on the Internet and blogosphere , and in social media . The term " Second Superpower " has been applied by scholars to the possibility that the People 's Republic of China could emerge with global power and influence on par with the United States . The potential for the two countries to form stronger relations to address global issues is sometimes referred to as the Group of Two . 
 Barry Buzan asserted in 2004 that " China certainly presents the most promising all @-@ round profile " of a potential superpower . Buzan claimed that " China is currently the most fashionable potential superpower and the one whose degree of alienation from the dominant international society makes it the most obvious political challenger . " However , he noted this challenge is constrained by the major challenges of development and by the fact that its rise could trigger a counter coalition of states in Asia . 
 Parag Khanna stated in 2008 that by making massive trade and investment deals with Latin America and Africa , China had established its presence as a superpower along with the European Union and the United States . China 's rise is demonstrated by its ballooning share of trade in its gross domestic product . He believed that China 's " consultative style " had allowed it to develop political and economic ties with many countries including those viewed as rogue states by the United States . He stated that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation founded with Russia and the Central Asian countries may eventually be the " NATO of the East " . 
 Economist and author of Eclipse : Living in the Shadow of China 's Economic Dominance Arvind Subramanian argued in 2012 that China will direct the world 's financial system by 2020 and that the Chinese renminbi will replace the dollar as the world 's reserve currency in 10 to 15 years . The United States ' soft power will remain longer . He stated that " China was a top dog economically for thousands of years prior to the Ming dynasty . In some ways , the past few hundred years have been an aberration . " 
 Lawrence <unk> at the School of Oriental and African Studies , London , argued in 2011 that the United States will be surpassed by China as military superpower within twenty years . Regarding economic power , the Director of the China Center for Economic Reform at Peking University Yao Yang stated that " Assuming that the Chinese and U.S. economies grow , respectively , by 8 % and 3 % in real terms , that China 's inflation rate is 3 @.@ 6 % and America 's is 2 % ( the averages of the last decade ) , and that the renminbi appreciates against the dollar by 3 % per year ( the average of the last six years ) , China will become the world 's largest economy by 2021 . By that time , both countries ' GDP will be about $ 24 trillion . " 
 Historian Timothy Garton Ash argued in 2011 , pointing to factors such as the International Monetary Fund predicting that China 's GDP ( purchasing power parity adjusted ) will overtake that of the United States in 2016 , that a power shift to a world with several superpowers was happening " Now " . However , China was still lacking in soft power and power projection abilities and had a low GDP / person . The article also stated that the Pew Research Center in a 2009 survey found that people in 15 out of 22 countries believed that China had or would overtake the US as the world 's leading superpower . 
 In an interview given in 2011 , Singapore 's first premier , Lee Kuan Yew , stated that while China supplanting the United States is not a foregone conclusion , Chinese leaders are nonetheless serious about displacing the United States as the most powerful country in Asia . " They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second @-@ largest economy in the world . How could they not aspire to be number 1 in Asia , and in time the world ? " The Chinese strategy , Lee maintains , will revolve around their " huge and increasingly highly skilled and educated workers to out @-@ sell and out @-@ build all others . " Nevertheless , relations with the United States , at least in the medium term , will not take a turn for the worse because China will " avoid any action that will sour up relations with the U.S. To challenge a stronger and technologically superior power like the U.S. will abort their ' peaceful rise . ' " Though Lee believes China is genuinely interested in growing within the global framework the United States has created , it is biding its time until it becomes strong enough to successfully redefine the prevailing political and economic order . 
 Chinese foreign policy adviser Wang <unk> in 2012 stated that many Chinese officials see China as a first @-@ class power which should be treated as such . China is argued to soon become the world 's largest economy and to be making rapid progress in many areas . The United States is seen as a declining superpower as indicated by factors such as poor economic recovery , financial disorder , high deficits gaining close to GDP levels and unemployment , increasing political polarization , and <unk> forcing jobs overseas in China .

 Timothy <unk> , founder of Crosby International Holdings , stated in 2013 that he doesn 't see " China becoming a superpower " . He writes that China has basically worked as a manufacturing location for foreign companies , as 83 % of all high @-@ tech products made in China were produced for foreign companies . He added that China has problems regarding wages , an aging and declining population , and gender imbalance ( with China 's 6 : 5 gender ratio , 1 in 6 males will be unable to find a female partner ) , and he suggested that such problems would lead to crime . He also pointed out that China continually polluted its environment during its 30 years of economic growth ( of the 20 most polluted cities in the world , 16 cities are in China ) . 
 James Fallows writes that too many people in China live without indoor plumbing , and that no mainland Chinese scientist has yet won a Nobel Prize , so it is unlikely able to become an " economic Superpower " . 
 Geoffrey Murray 's China : The Next Superpower ( 1998 ) argued that while the potential for China is high , this is fairly perceived only by looking at the risks and obstacles China faces in managing its population and resources . The political situation in China may become too fragile to survive into superpower status , according to Susan <unk> in China : Fragile Superpower ( 2008 ) . Other factors that could constrain China 's ability to become a superpower in the future include limited supplies of energy and raw materials , questions over its innovation capability , inequality and corruption , and risks to social stability and the environment . 
 <unk> Pei argued in 2010 that China is not a superpower and it will not be one anytime soon and argued that China faces daunting political and economic challenges . In 2012 he argued that China , despite using its economic power to influence some nations , has few real friends or allies and is surrounded by potentially hostile nations . This situation could improve if regional territorial disputes were resolved and China participated in an effective regional defense system that would reduce the fears of its neighbors . Alternatively , a democratization of China would dramatically improve foreign relations with many nations . 
 Amy Chua stated in 2007 that whether a country is attractive to immigrants is an important quality for a superpower . She also wrote that China lacks the pull to bring scientists , thinkers , and innovators from other countries as immigrants . However , she believed that China made up for this with its own diaspora , and said that size and resources for them are unparalleled . 
 = = European Union = = 
 The European Union ( EU ) has been called an emerging superpower by academics . Many scholars and academics like T. R. Reid , Andrew Reding , Andrew Moravcsik , Mark Leonard , Jeremy Rifkin , John McCormick , and some politicians like Romano Prodi and Tony Blair , believe that the EU either is , or will become , a superpower in the 21st century . 
 Mark Leonard cites several factors : the EU 's large population , large economy ( the EU has the largest economy in the world ) , low inflation rates , the unpopularity and perceived failure of US foreign policy in recent years , and certain EU member states ' high quality of life ( especially when measured in terms such as hours worked per week , health care , social services ) . 
 John McCormick believes that the EU has already achieved superpower status , based on the size and global reach of its economy and on its global political influence . He argues that the nature of power has changed since the Cold War @-@ driven definition of superpower was developed , and that military power is no longer essential to great power ; he argues that control of the means of production is more important than control of the means of destruction , and contrasts the threatening hard power of the United States with the opportunities offered by the soft power wielded by the European Union . 
 Parag Khanna believes that " Europe is overtaking its rivals to become the world 's most successful empire . " Khanna writes that South America , East Asia , and other regions prefer to emulate " The European Dream " rather than the American variant . This could possibly be seen in the African Union and <unk> . Notably , the EU as a whole has some of the world 's largest and most influential languages being official within its borders . 
 Andrew Reding also takes the future EU enlargement into account . An eventual future accession of the rest of Europe , the whole of Russia , and Turkey , would not only boost its economy , but it would also increase the EU 's population to about 800 million , which he considers almost equal to that of India or China . The EU is qualitatively different from India and China since it is enormously more prosperous and technologically advanced . Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in 2005 : " In 10 or 15 years , the EU will be a place where civilizations meet . It will be a superpower with the inclusion of Turkey . " 
 Robert J. Guttman wrote in 2001 that the very definition of the term superpower has changed , and in the 21st century it does not only refer to states with military power , but also to groups such as the European Union , with strong market economics , young , highly educated workers savvy in high technology , and a global vision . <unk> Arne Petersen , the Danish ambassador to the US , has expressed similar views but has conceded that the EU is a " special kind of superpower " , one that has yet to establish a unified military force that exerts itself even close to the same level as many of its individual members . 
 Additionally , it is argued by commentators that full political integration is not required for the European Union to wield international influence : that its apparent weaknesses constitute its real strengths ( as of its low @-@ profile diplomacy and the emphasis on the rule of law ) and that the EU represents a new and potentially more successful type of international actor than traditional ones ; however , it is uncertain if the effectiveness of such an influence would be equal to that of a more politically integrated union of states such as the United States . 
 Barry Buzan notes that the EU 's potential superpower status depends on its " <unk> " . It is unclear though how much state @-@ like quality is needed for the EU to be described as a superpower . Buzan states that the EU is unlikely to remain a potential superpower for a long time because although it has material wealth , its " political weakness and its erratic and difficult course of internal political development , particularly as regards a common foreign and defence policy " constrains it from being a superpower . 
 Alexander Stubb , the Finnish foreign minister , has said that he thinks the EU is both a superpower and not a superpower . While the EU is a superpower in the sense that it is the largest political union , single market and aid donor in the world , it is not a superpower in the defense or foreign policy spheres . Like Barry Buzan , Alexander Stubb thinks that the major factor constraining the EU 's rise to superpower status is its lack of statehood in the international system ; other factors are its lack of internal drive to project power worldwide , and continued preference for the sovereign nation @-@ state among some Europeans . To counterbalance these , he urged the EU leaders to approve and ratify the Lisbon Treaty ( which they did in 2009 ) , create an EU foreign ministry ( EEAS , established in 2010 ) , develop a common EU defense , hold one collective seat at the United Nations Security Council and G8 , and address what he described as the " sour mood " toward the EU prevalent in some European countries today .

 Some do not believe that the EU will achieve superpower status . " The EU is not and never will be a superpower , " according to the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband . Lacking a unified foreign policy and with an inability to project military power worldwide , the EU lacks " the substance of superpowers " , who by definition have " first of all military reach [ and ] possess the capacity to arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government 's will . " EU parliamentarian Ilka Schroeder argues that the high degree of involvement in conflicts such as the Israeli – Palestinian conflict are used by the EU largely to compensate for European inability to project military power internationally , particularly in contrast to the USA . 
 The Economist 's Robert Lane Greene notes that the lack of a strong European military only exacerbates the lack of unified EU foreign policy and discounts any EU arguments towards superpower status , noting especially that the EU 's creation of a global response force rivaling the superpower 's ( United States of America ) is " unthinkable . " " The biggest barrier to European <unk> is that European elites refuse to bring their postmodern fantasies about the illegitimacy of military ' hard power ' into line with the way the rest of the world interprets reality , " according to <unk> Kern of the Strategic Studies Group . 
 Britain 's Michael Howard has warned against the " worry " that many Europeans are pushing for greater EU integration to counterbalance the United States , while Europe 's total reliance on soft ( non @-@ military ) power is in part because of its lack of a " shared identity . " While to some the European Union should be a " model power " unafraid of using military force and backing free trade , its military shortcomings argue against superpower status . 
 American Thinker 's <unk> Kern questions if " Europe really destined to become a global superpower ? " Kern continues that " A growing body of research says no . Indeed , overwhelming evidence supports the view that contemporary Europe is beset by a mix of problems that is so complex , that apart from dramatic changes in public policy , Europe is headed toward certain decline , not ascendancy . " 
 George Osborne , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , has also pointed out the economic crisis of the European Union . Osborne said , " The biggest economic risk facing Europe doesn 't come from those who want reform and re @-@ negotiation . It comes from a failure to reform and renegotiate . It is the status quo which condemns the people of Europe to an ongoing economic crisis and continuing decline . " Osborne also said that the EU is facing growing competition with global economic powers like China , India and the US , and the European Union should " reform or decline . " 
 = = India = = 
 The Republic of India has seen considerable coverage of its potential of becoming a superpower , both in the media and among academics . In 2006 , Newsweek and the International Herald Tribune joined several academics in discussing India 's potential of becoming a superpower . 
 Anil Gupta is almost certain that India will become a superpower in the 21st century . As an example , he states that due to India 's functional institutions of democracy and its relatively corruption @-@ free society , it will emerge as a desirable , entrepreneurial and resource and energy @-@ efficient superpower in the near future . He predicts that by 2015 India will overtake China to be the fastest growing economy in the world and emerge as a full @-@ fledged economic superpower by 2025 . In addition to that , he states , India has the potential to serve as a leading example of how to combine rapid economic growth with fairness towards and inclusion of those at the bottom rungs of the ladder and of efficient resource utilization , especially in energy . India became world 's fastest growing economy in 2015 and will continue to do so in 2016 . 
 Economists and Researchers at Harvard University have projected India ’ s 7 % projected annual growth rate through 2024 would continue to put it ahead of China , making India the fastest growing economy in the world . 
 Robyn Meredith points out that the average incomes of European and Americans are higher than Chinese and Indians , and hundreds of millions of Chinese as well as Indians live in poverty , she also suggested that economic growth of these nations has been most the important factor in reducing global poverty of the last two decades , as per the World Bank report . Amy Chua adds to this , that India is still faces many problems such as " pervasive rural poverty , entrenched corruption , and high inequality just to name a few " . However , she notes that India has made tremendous strides to fix this , stating that some of India 's achievements , such as working to dismantle the centuries @-@ old caste system and maintaining the world 's largest diverse democracy , are historically unprecedented . 
 Fareed Zakaria pointing out that India 's young population coupled with the second @-@ largest English @-@ speaking population in the world could give India an advantage over China . He also believes that while other industrial countries will face a youth gap , India will have lots of young people , or in other words , workers , and by 2050 , its per capita income will rise by twenty times its current level . According to Zakaria , another strength that India has is that its democratic government has lasted for 60 years , stating that a democracy can provide for long @-@ term stability , that has given India a name . 
 Clyde V. <unk> Jr . , founder and president of the Economic Strategy Institute and former counselor to the Secretary of Commerce in the Reagan administration , has predicted that " It is going to be India 's century . India is going to be the biggest economy in the world . It is going to be the biggest superpower of the 21st century . " 
 According to the report named " Indian Century : Defining India 's Place in a Rapidly Changing Global Economy " by IBM Institute for Business Value , India is predicted to be among the world ’ s highest @-@ growth nations over the coming years .

 Parag Khanna wrote in 2008 that he believes that India is not , nor will it become a superpower for the foreseeable future , lagging decades behind China in both development and strategic appetite . Instead , he believes India will be a key swing state along with Russia . He says that India is " big but not important " , has a highly successful professional class , while millions of its citizens still live in poverty . He also writes that it matters that China borders a dozen more countries than India and is not hemmed in by a vast ocean and the world 's tallest mountains . However , in a recent article written by Khanna , he says that India , along with China , will grow ever stronger , while other powers , like Europe , muddle along . 
 Lant Pritchett , reviewing the book In Spite of the Gods : The Strange Rise of Modern India , writes that , while India has had impressive growth and has some world @-@ class institutions , several other indicators are <unk> poor . The malnutrition and the coverage of immunization programs are at levels similar or worse than in much sub @-@ Saharan African nations . In the Demographic and Health Surveys , India 's child malnutrition was the worst of the 42 nations with comparable and recent data . Adult literacy is 61 % . In one study , 26 % of teachers were absent from work and 1 / 3 of those showing up did not teach . 40 % of health care workers were absent from work . Caste politics in India remains an important force . Pritchett argues that a very large population , a very long statistical " tail " of high quality students , and some very good higher education institutions gives a misleading impression of Indian education . Indian students placed forty @-@ first and thirty @-@ seventh in a study comparing students in the two Indian states Odisha and Rajasthan to the forty @-@ six nations in the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study . 
 <unk> Chatterjee Miller , assistant professor of international relations at Boston University , argues that India is a " would @-@ be " great power but " resists its own rise " . Three factors contribute to this stagnation , she argues . First , New Delhi 's foreign policy decisions are highly individualistic . " This autonomy , in turn , means that New Delhi does very little collective thinking about its long @-@ term foreign policy goals , since most of the strategic planning that takes place within the government happens on an individual level . " Second , a dearth of think tanks helps insulate Indian foreign policymakers from outside influences . " U.S. foreign policymakers , by contrast , can expect strategic guidance from a broad spectrum of organizations that supplement the long @-@ term planning that happens within the government itself . " Third , many of India 's political elites believe that the country 's inevitable rise is a Western construct that has placed unrealistic expectations on India 's economic growth forecasts and its international commitments . By contrast , Miller notes that Chinese political leaders pay very close attention to the international hype surrounding their country 's growing stature . Miller concludes that " India 's inability to develop top @-@ down , long @-@ term strategies means that it cannot systematically consider the implications of its growing power . So long as this remains the case , the country will not play the role in global affairs that many expect . " 
 = = Russia = = 
 The Russian Federation has been suggested as a potential candidate for resuming superpower status in the 21st century . Russia has seen some discussion regarding its potential of re @-@ emerging as a superpower , while others have made the assertion that it is already a superpower . In 2009 , Hugo Chavez , late President of Venezuela whose government was noted to have enjoyed warm relations with the Kremlin , stated that " Russia is a superpower " , citing waning American influence in global affairs , and suggested the ruble be elevated to a global currency . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Russia an important superpower , praising its effectiveness as an ally of Israel and foe of Iran . In his 2005 publication entitled Russia in the 21st Century : The Prodigal Superpower , Steven Rosefielde , a professor of economics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , predicted that Russia would emerge as a superpower before 2010 and augur another arms race . However , Rosefielde noted that such an end would come with tremendous sacrifice to global security and the Russian people 's freedom . 
 In 2014 , Stephen Kinzer of The Boston Globe compared Russia 's actions with its own neighboring territories , to those of " any other superpower " , taking Ukraine and Crimea as examples . A mixed opinion has been offered by Matthew Fleischer of the Los Angeles Times : he contends that Russia will not become a superpower unless climate change eats away at the permafrost that covers , as of March 2014 , two @-@ thirds of the country 's landmass . The absence of this permafrost would reveal immense stores of oil , natural gas , and precious minerals , as well as potential farmland , which would allow Russia to " become the world 's bread basket — and control the planet 's food supply . " 
 Russian news agency RIA Novosti called Russia a " superpower " after its actions in Syria , and after the formation of a coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq , Benny Avni of the New York Post called Russia the " world 's new sole superpower " .

 During the annual state of the nation address at the Moscow Kremlin in December 2013 , Russian president Vladimir Putin denied any Russian aspiration to be a superpower . He was quoted saying : " We do not aspire to be called some kind of superpower , understanding that as a claim to world or regional hegemony . We do not infringe on anyone 's interests , we do not force our patronage on anyone , or try to teach anyone how to live . " 
 Forbes writer Jonathan Adelman has summarized the arguments against Russia 's superpower potential thus : " While Russia may have grabbed the headlines for hosting the forthcoming Olympics and Edward Snowden , it 's no super power . Russia has a trade profile of a Third World country , a GNP the size of Canada , which is less than 15 percent of the United States GDP , no soft power , Silicon Valley , Hollywood , Wall Street or highly rated universities . " 
 Several analysts commented on the fact that Russia showed signs of an aging and shrinking population . Fred Weir said that this severely constricts and limits Russia 's potential to re @-@ emerge as a central world power . Former political journalist Peter Brown wrote that Russia " would like to reclaim the superpower status it held for nearly 40 years after World War II , " but in the 21st century " may lack the combination of economic and military power " to do so . He said that " Russia won 't be a superpower anytime soon , " citing Russia 's shrinking population , high levels of poverty and poor public health . In 2011 , British historian and professor Niall Ferguson also highlighted the negative effects of Russia 's declining population , and suggested that Russia is on its way to " global irrelevance " . Russia has , however , shown a slight population growth since 2012 , partly due to immigration . The number of Chinese in the Russia 's Far East has been growing . Russia 's demographic problems continued in 2015 . 
 Nathan Smith of the National Business Review has said that despite Russia having potential , it did not win the new " Cold War " in the 1980s , and other factors such as American influence over Crimea make superpower status inaccurate .

 End of the Century is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones , released on February 4 , 1980 , through Sire Records . The album was the band 's first produced by Phil Spector , though he had offered the band his assistance earlier in their career . With Spector fully producing the album , it was the first release that excluded original member Tommy Ramone , who in 1978 left the band but produced their previous album Road to Ruin . Spector used more advanced standards of engineering , such as high @-@ quality overdubbing and echo chambers . These methods caused conflict between the band and Spector , since much of the recording used techniques that opposed those the Ramones had previously used . Spector emphasized the production value as well , working with a budget of around $ 200 @,@ 000 . 
 The songs on End of the Century were written primarily to expand the band 's fan @-@ base , straying from the band 's original punk genre and steering toward a more pop oriented sound . The lyrics on the album deal with various different things , ranging from drug addictions to the band 's lifestyle while touring . The album also features a cover of The Ronettes ' piece " Baby , I Love You , " as well as successors to previous Ramones songs " Judy Is a Punk " and " Havana Affair . " 
 It received generally positive reviews from critics , though many reviewers deemed it to be less enjoyable compared to the band 's previous releases . Despite this , the album is the highest charting Ramones album of all time , reaching number 44 on the US Billboard 200 chart , and number 14 on the UK Albums Chart . End of the Century spawned the singles " Baby , I Love You " and " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio ? . " 
 The album 's title is taken from a couplet repeated in the first track " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio ? " : " It 's the end , the end of the seventies / It 's the end , the end of the century . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 In February 1977 after attending a Ramones concert in Los Angeles , music producer Phil Spector offered to assist in making Rocket to Russia . The band declined his offer , feeling as though the album would not be the same without Tommy Ramone and Tony Bongiovi producing the album . While the band refused his initial offer , they later asked Spector to help with the album because of their lack of popularity and sales . End of the Century would be the first album released without former drummer and producer Tommy . Spector had become famous through his work with The Ronettes , The Righteous Brothers , Ike and Tina Turner , The Beatles and John Lennon , among others . With these releases , Spector defined what would become known as the " Wall of Sound , " which is dense , layered , and reverberant sound that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes . These standards are created through instruments performing identical parts in unison , using high @-@ quality overdubbing and echo chambers to aid in the production value . The producer was convinced that the Ramones had talent with lyrics and musical structure , so he intended to promote the band through more advanced methods of sound output . 
 Recording sessions for the album began on May 1 , 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood , Los Angeles . Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys . At the Ramones ' request , Ed Stasium helped with the album 's engineering . During the studio work , Spector 's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums . The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible for the lowest feasible budget , with a relatively low production value . With End of the Century , the band experienced Spector 's infamous perfectionism , and a budget of $ 200 @,@ 000 to fully record and produce the album . This is significant because the band 's debut album cost $ 6 @,@ 400 total , and their second album cost $ 10 @,@ 000 . End of the Century is the most expensive album in the Ramones ' career . 
 = = = Conflict = = = 
 This alternative method of recording caused conflicts to arise during sessions . Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector 's obsessive recording techniques : " Phil would sit in the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum , hour after hour , after hour , after hour . " During the recording of " Rock ' n ' Roll High School , " Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times over the course of several hours . Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates : " To Johnny , this must have been like the Chinese water torture . " 
 Early in the sessions , Spector reportedly held the Ramones hostage at gunpoint . According to Dee Dee , when Spector took Joey away for a three @-@ hour private meeting somewhere in his mansion where the album was to be recorded , Dee Dee went looking for them . " The next thing I knew Phil appeared at the top of the staircase , shouting and waving a pistol . " 
 He leveled his gun at my heart and then motioned for me and the rest of the band to get back in the piano room ... He only holstered his pistol when he felt secure that his bodyguards could take over . Then he sat down at his black concert piano and made us listen to him play and sing " Baby , I Love You " until well after 4 : 30 in the morning . 
 However , in 2008 drummer Marky Ramone stated that no guns were ever pointed at anybody 
 " There were no guns pointed at anybody , " he said . " They [ guns ] were there but he had a license to carry . He never held us hostage . We could have left at any time " 
 Dee Dee claimed to have left the sessions without recording anything . " We had been working for at least fourteen or fifteen hours a day for thirteen days straight and we still hadn 't recorded one note of music , " he wrote in his autobiography . After supposedly hearing that Johnny had returned to New York , Dee Dee wrote that he and drummer Marky Ramone booked a flight and returned home as well . " To this day , I still have no idea how they made the album End of the Century , or who actually played bass on it . " Dee Dee 's account contradicts much of the band 's collective account from the 1982 Trouser Press interview , where the band stated that the only track that Johnny , Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover version of " Baby , I Love You , " as the band , save for Joey , had gone home after cutting basic tracks for the rest of the album . 
 = = Compositions = = 
 End of the Century was described by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity , resulting in more of a pop punk sound . Joey failed to contribute to the best of his abilities on the album , and recalled : " I think that some of the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album . That was me at my worst . " Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band 's prime . 
 " End of the Century was just watered @-@ down Ramones . It 's not real Ramones . ' Baby , I Love You ' — I didn 't play on that at all . What am I gonna do — play along with an orchestra ? There 's no point . End of the Century was trying to get a hit on each song , instead of trying to get a hit on one or two of the songs on the album and trying to make the rest as raunchy as you can . They ain 't gonna play the other ten songs , anyway . " 
 The album opens with " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio ? , " a throwback to the rock music of the 1950s to late 1960s . The lyrics name several famous musicians of this era , including Jerry Lee Lewis , John Lennon , and T. Rex , and also cite The Ed Sullivan Show . Many instruments that were previously rarely — if ever — used in punk rock were featured in the song 's score , including the saxophone and electric organ . The lyrics , written by Dee Dee , depict his childhood in Germany where he would secretly listen to rock radio stations at night . 
 Johnny 's part is not heard on the next track , " I 'm Affected , " as reported by Johnny himself . Joey admitted that he did not favor the song , recalling : " I couldn 't believe how awful it sounded . It was horrible . " " Danny Says , " the third track , was a lyrical depiction of what the band constantly went through while <unk> , autograph sessions , interviews , etc . The title " Danny Says " refers to the band 's tour manager Danny Fields giving the members instructions , schedules , and demands . According to Joey , the ballad was inspired by Lou Reed , who had released the songs " Candy Says " and " Caroline Says . " Joey 's brother Mickey Leigh called the song a " masterpiece " and said it " remains one of the most <unk> beautiful songs I 've ever heard . " 
 Dee Dee wrote the next piece , " Chinese Rock , " in 1976 , and Johnny Thunders later revised it . Dee Dee wrote the piece in response to Lou Reed 's " Heroin , " and attempted to concoct better lyrics on the same subject of drug use and heroin addiction . After Johnny vetoed the song , it was recorded by Thunder 's band The Heartbreakers before the Ramones , though the bands use slightly different words . The lyrics deal with the daily life of a heroin addict , and the term " Chinese Rock " is a euphemism for the drug . " The Return of Jackie and Judy " is a continuation to one of the band 's earlier songs , " Judy is a Punk , " which was released on their debut album Ramones . There were numerous studio guests involved in the song 's recording , including Spector 's bodyguard , Dan and David Kessel ( sons of jazz guitarist Barney Kessel ) , and California disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer . 
 Side B begins with " Baby , I Love You . " Johnny constantly claims in his book Commando that he hated the song and the band didn 't even play on it , only Joey and some studio musicians . Joey exclaimed that he " hated " the song , despite it obtaining a level of popularity in Europe . The song is a cover version of the original by The Ronettes , and contained a string section arrangement that Leigh deemed " gooey " and that it " sounded right out of Redbone 's ' Come and Get Your Love . ' " He also confessed that the song " almost made [ him ] embarrassed . " " Rock ' n ' Roll High School " originally appeared on the soundtrack to Rock ' n ' Roll High School , a film directed by Allan Arkush . The movie depicts a story line in which the Ramones are obsessed over by female high school student Riff Randell along with other pupils attending the school . The album concludes with " High Risk Insurance , " which is a reaction to politics of that era .

 The album received generally positive reviews from critics , yet not as favorable for many of the band 's previous records . Stephen Thomas Erlewine , senior editor for AllMusic , noted that the Ramones desired mainstream success much more and were recording music in such a fashion as to expand their fan @-@ base . Another AllMusic editor , T. Donald Guarisco , noted that the " entire album is pretty controversial in the world of Ramones fandom . " Music critic Robert Christgau called the album " sad , " noting that his favorite songs were " I 'm Affected , " " Baby , I Love You , " and " Danny Says . " He also pointed out that Spector 's production failed to make much of a difference upon the band 's overall sound , saying " his guitar overdubs are worse than his orchestrations , and they 're not <unk> . " 
 Kurt Loder , reviewing the album for Rolling Stone , called it " Phil Spector 's finest and most mature effort in years , " and said that his production created a " rich and vibrant and surging with power " setting . He noted that the Ramones are still " spotlighted , " rather than their producer . Author Richard Williams exclaimed that to " old fans the Ramones ' version of ' Baby , I Love You ' went too far , desecrating the memory of the original despite Joey 's evident devotion to the task of emulating Ronnie 's lead vocal . " Williams also said that " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio " and " Chinese Rock " maintained the principles of the Ramones ' in their earlier days .

 End of the Century is the Ramones ' highest peaking album on the US Billboard 200 , as well as their most successful on the UK Albums Chart and the Swedish chart Sverigetopplistan . The album became the first — and only — Ramones ' album to chart on Norway 's VG @-@ lista chart and New Zealand 's Recorded Music NZ . It was also the band 's first album to chart on the Netherlands ' MegaCharts , with their 1987 album Halfway to Sanity being their only other release to chart their as well . 
 Two singles were spawned from End of the Century : " Baby , I Love You " and " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio ? , " released respectively . The first single charted on Belgium 's Ultratop chart as well as the UK . " Do You Remember Rock ' n ' Roll Radio ? " which debuted at 54 on the UK Singles Chart .

 David John <unk> Irving ( born 24 March 1938 ) is an English Holocaust denier and author who has written on the military and political history of World War II , with a focus on Nazi Germany . His works include The Destruction of Dresden ( 1963 ) , Hitler 's War ( 1977 ) , Churchill 's War ( 1987 ) , and Goebbels : Mastermind of the Third Reich ( 1996 ) . Though Irving 's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians , he was once recognized for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents . Irving marginalized himself in 1988 when , based on his reading of the pseudoscientific Leuchter report , he began to espouse Holocaust denial . 
 Irving 's reputation as a historian was discredited when , in the course of an unsuccessful libel case he filed against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books , he was shown to have deliberately misrepresented historical evidence to promote Holocaust denial . The English court found that Irving was an active Holocaust denier , antisemite , and racist , who " for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence " . In addition , the court found that Irving 's books had distorted the history of Adolf Hitler 's role in the Holocaust to depict Hitler in a favourable light . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Irving and his twin brother were born in Hutton , near Brentwood , Essex , England . His father , John James <unk> Irving ( 1898 – 1967 ) , was a career naval officer and commander in the Royal Navy , and his mother , Beryl Irving ( née Newington ) , an illustrator and writer of children 's books . Irving 's twin brother Nicholas Irving has said that " David used to run toward bombed out houses shouting ' Heil Hitler ! ' " , a statement which Irving denies . 
 During the Second World War , Irving 's father was an officer aboard the light cruiser HMS Edinburgh . On 30 April 1942 , while escorting Convoy QP 11 in the Barents Sea , the ship was badly damaged by the German submarine U @-@ 456 . Two days later she was attacked by surface craft , and now beyond recovery was abandoned and scuttled by a torpedo from HMS Foresight . Irving 's father survived , but severed all links with his wife and their children after the incident . 
 Irving described his childhood in an interview with the American writer Ron Rosenbaum as : " Unlike the Americans , we English suffered great deprivations ... we went through childhood with no toys . We had no kind of childhood at all . We were living on an island that was crowded with other people 's armies " . According to his twin , Nicholas , Irving has also been a provocateur and prankster since his youth . 
 Irving went on to claim to Rosenbaum that his <unk> views about World War II dated to his childhood , particularly due to his objections to the way Adolf Hitler was portrayed in the British media during the war . Irving asserted that his " sceptical " views about the Third Reich were rooted in his doubts about the cartoonist caricatures of Hitler and the other Nazi leaders published in the British wartime press . 
 = = Student years = = 
 After completing A levels at Brentwood School , Irving briefly studied physics at Imperial College London . However , he never graduated , due to financial limitations . While there , he wrote for the Imperial College 's student newspaper , Felix , and in 1959 served as editor of the University of London Carnival Committee 's journal , Carnival Times . 
 Irving later studied for two years toward a degree in political economy at University College London , However , he again had to drop out due to lack of funds . During this period at university , he participated in a debate on Commonwealth immigration , seconding British Union of Fascists founder Oswald Mosley , and was heckled . 
 = = = Carnival Times controversy = = = 
 Irving 's time as editor of the Carnival Times , a student rag mag , became controversial when he added a " secret supplement " to the magazine . This supplement contained an article in which he called Hitler the " greatest unifying force Europe has known since Charlemagne " . Although Irving deflected criticism by characterising the Carnival Times as " satirical " , he also stated that " the formation of a European Union is interpreted as building a group of superior peoples , and the Jews have always viewed with suspicion the emergence of any ' master @-@ race ' ( other than their own , of course ) " . Opponents also viewed a cartoon included in the supplement as racist , and criticised another article in which Irving wrote that the British press was owned by Jews . 
 Volunteers were later recruited to remove and destroy the supplements before the magazine 's distribution . Irving has said that the criticism is " probably justifiable " and has described his motivation in producing the controversial secret issue of Carnival Times as being to prevent the Carnival from making a profit that would be passed on to a South African group which he considered a " subversive organisation " . 
 = = The Destruction of Dresden = = 
 Some time after serving in 1959 as editor of the University of London Carnival Committee 's journal , Irving left for West Germany , where he worked as a steelworker in a Thyssen AG steel works in the Ruhr area , and learned the German language . He then moved to Spain , where he worked as a clerk at an air base . During his time in Spain , Irving married his first wife , a Spanish woman with whom he had five children . 
 In 1962 , he wrote a series of 37 articles on the Allied bombing campaign , Wie Deutschlands Städte <unk> ( How Germany 's Cities Died ) , for the German boulevard journal Neue <unk> . These were the basis for his first book , The Destruction of Dresden ( 1963 ) , in which he examined the Allied bombing of Dresden in February 1945 . By the 1960s , a debate about the morality of the carpet bombing of German cities and civilian population had already begun , especially in the United Kingdom . There was consequently considerable interest in Irving 's book , which was illustrated with graphic pictures , and it became an international best @-@ seller . 
 In the first edition , Irving 's estimates for deaths in Dresden were between 100 @,@ 000 and 250 @,@ 000 – notably higher than most previously published figures . These figures became authoritative and widely accepted in many standard reference works . In later editions of the book over the next three decades , he gradually adjusted the figure downwards to 50 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 . According to the evidence ( as introduced by Richard J. Evans at the 2000 libel trial that Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt ) , Irving based his estimates of the dead of Dresden on the word of one individual who provided no supporting documentation , used forged documents , and described one witness who was a urologist as Dresden 's Deputy Chief Medical Officer . The doctor has since complained about being misidentified by Irving , and further , was only reporting rumours about the death toll . 
 Today , casualties at Dresden are estimated as 22 @,@ 700 – 25 @,@ 000 dead . 
 Irving based his numbers on a falsified document " TB 47 " promulgated by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels , as well as claims made after the war by a former Dresden Nazi functionary , Hans Voigt , without verifying them against official sources available in Dresden . Irving 's estimates and sources were first disputed by Walter <unk> , Mayor of Dresden 1946 – 1958 , in his own account of the Dresden bombing . When it was later confirmed that TB 47 was a forgery , Irving published a letter to the editor in The Times on 7 July 1966 retracting his estimates , writing that he had " no interest in promoting or perpetuating false legends " . In 1977 the original version of TB 47 was finally located in Dresden by Götz <unk> . 
 Despite acknowledging that the copy of " TB 47 " he had used was inaccurate , Irving argued during the late 1980s and 1990s that the death toll at Dresden was very high . In several speeches given during this period he claimed that 100 @,@ 000 or more people had been killed in the bombing of Dresden . In some of the speeches Irving also argued or implied that the raid was comparable to the Nazis ' killing of Jews . 
 = = = 1963 burglary of Irving 's flat = = = 
 By November 1963 , Irving was in England when he called the London Metropolitan Police with suspicions he had been the victim of a burglary by three men who had gained access to his Mayfair flat claiming to be General Post Office ( GPO ) engineers . Anti @-@ fascist activist Gerry Gable was subsequently arrested and held at Hornsey police station , where on 14 January 1964 , along with Manny <unk> and another , Gable admitted breaking in with intent to steal private papers . At the trial , counsel for the defence claimed that this was no ordinary crime , telling the court , " they hoped to find material they could take to Special Branch " . The case was reported in the Daily Telegraph , 17 January 1964 and other newspapers . 
 = = Author = = 
 After the success of the Dresden book , Irving continued writing , including some works of revisionist history , although his 1964 work The Mare 's Nest – an account of the German V @-@ weapons programme and the Allied intelligence countermeasures against it – was widely praised when published and continues to be well regarded . Michael J. Neufeld of the Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum has described The Mare 's Nest as " the most complete account on both Allied and German sides of the V @-@ weapons campaign in the last two years of the war . " 
 Irving translated the Memoirs of Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel in 1965 ( edited by Walter Görlitz ) ; and in 1967 published Accident : The Death of General Sikorski . In the latter book , Irving claimed that the plane crash which killed Polish government in exile leader General Władysław Sikorski in 1943 was really an assassination ordered by Winston Churchill , so as to enable Churchill to betray Poland to the Soviet Union . Irving 's book inspired the highly controversial 1967 play Soldiers by his friend , the German playwright Rolf Hochhuth , where Hochhuth depicts Churchill ordering the " assassination " of General Sikorski . 
 Also in 1967 , Irving published two more works : The Virus House , an account of the German nuclear energy project for which Irving conducted many interviews , and The Destruction of Convoy PQ @-@ 17 , in which he blamed the British escort group commander , Commander Jack Broome for the catastrophic losses of the Convoy PQ @-@ 17 . Amid much publicity , Broome sued Irving for libel in October 1968 , and in February 1970 , after 17 days of deliberation before London 's High Court , Broome won . Irving was forced to pay £ 40 @,@ 000 in damages , and the book was withdrawn from circulation . 
 After PQ @-@ 17 , Irving largely shifted to writing biographies . In 1968 , he published Breach of Security , an account of German reading of messages to and from the British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian D.C. Watt . As a result of Irving 's success with Dresden , members of Germany 's extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler 's inner circle . In an interview with the American journalist Ron Rosenbaum , Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them . Many ageing former mid- and high @-@ ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material . Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of " stone @-@ cleaning " of Hitler , in which he cleared off the " slime " that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler 's reputation . 
 In 1969 , during a visit to Germany , Irving met Robert Kempner , one of the American prosecutors at Nuremberg . Irving asked Kempner if the " official record of the Nuremberg Trials was falsified " , and told him that he was planning to go to Washington , D.C. to compare the sound recordings of Luftwaffe Field @-@ Marshal Erhard Milch 's March 1946 evidence with the subsequently published texts to find proof that evidence given at Nuremberg was " tampered with and manipulated " . Upon his return to the United States , Kempner wrote to J. Edgar Hoover , the director of the FBI , that Irving expressed many " anti @-@ American and anti @-@ Jewish statements " . 
 In 1971 , he translated the memoirs of General Reinhard Gehlen , and in 1973 published The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe , a biography of Field Marshal Milch . He spent the remainder of the 1970s working on Hitler 's War and the War Path , his two @-@ part biography of Adolf Hitler ; The Trail of the Fox , a biography of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel ; and a series in the Sunday Express describing the Royal Air Force 's famous Dam Busters raid . In 1975 , in his introduction to Hitler und seine <unk> , the German edition of Hitler 's War , Irving attacked the diary of Anne Frank as a forgery , claiming falsely that a New York court had ruled that the diary was really the work of an American scriptwriter Meyer Levin " in collaboration with the girl 's father " . 
 The description of Irving as a historian , rather than a historical author , is controversial , with some publications continuing to refer to him as a " historian " or " disgraced historian " , while others insist he is not a historian , and have adopted alternatives such as " author " or " historic writer " . The military historian John Keegan has praised Irving for his " extraordinary ability to describe and analyse Hitler 's conduct of military operations , which was his main occupation during the Second World War " . Donald Cameron Watt , Emeritus Professor of Modern History at the London School of Economics , wrote that he admires some of Irving 's work as a historian , though he rejects his conclusions about the Holocaust . At the libel proceedings against Irving , Watt declined Irving 's request to testify , appearing only after a subpoena was ordered . He testified that Irving had written a " very , very effective piece of historical scholarship " in the 1960s , which was unrelated to his controversial work ; he also suggested that Irving was " not in the top class " of military historians . 
 = = Revisionism = = 
 = = = Hitler 's War = = = 
 In 1977 Irving published Hitler 's War , the first of his two @-@ part biography of Adolf Hitler . Irving 's intention in Hitler 's War was to clean away the " years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument " to reveal the real Hitler , whose reputation Irving claimed had been slandered by historians . In Hitler 's War , Irving tried to " view the situation as far as possible through Hitler 's eyes , from behind his desk " . He portrayed Hitler as a rational , intelligent politician , whose only goal was to increase Germany 's prosperity and influence on the continent , and who was constantly let down by incompetent and / or treasonous subordinates . Irving 's book faulted the Allied leaders , most notably Winston Churchill , for the eventual escalation of war , and claimed that the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a " preventive war " forced on Hitler to avert an alleged impending Soviet attack . He also claimed that Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust ; while not denying its occurrence , Irving claimed that Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich were its originators and architects . Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust , and for decades afterward offered to pay £ 1000 to anyone who could find such an order . 
 Critical reaction to Hitler 's War was generally negative . Reviewers took issue with Irving 's factual claims as well as his conclusions . For example , American historian Charles Sydnor noted numerous errors in Hitler 's War , such as Irving 's <unk> statement that the Jews who fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany 's allies . Sydnor pointed out that Hitler had received an SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363 @,@ 211 Russian Jews executed by the Einsatzgruppen between August – November 1942 . Sydnor remarked that Irving 's statement that the Einsatzgruppen were in charge in the death camps seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust , as the Einsatzgruppen were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps . 
 = = = Irving 's work of the late 1970s and early 1980s = = = 
 Just months after the initial release of Hitler 's War , Irving published The Trail of the Fox , a biography of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel . In it , Irving attacked the members of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Hitler , branding them " traitors " , " cowards " , and " manipulators " , and uncritically presented Hitler and his government 's subsequent revenge against the plotters , of which Rommel was also a victim . In particular , Irving accused Rommel 's friend and Chief of Staff General Hans Speidel of framing Rommel in the attempted coup . The British historian David Pryce @-@ Jones in a book review of The Trail of the Fox in the edition of 12 November 1977 of The New York Times Book Review accused Irving of taking everything Hitler had to say at face value . 
 In 1978 , Irving released The War Path , the companion volume to Hitler 's War which covered events leading up to the war and which was written from a similar point of view . Again , professional historians such as D.C. Watt noted numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations . Despite the criticism , the book sold well , as did all of Irving 's books to that date . The financial success of his books enabled Irving to buy a home in the prestigious Mayfair district of London , own a Rolls @-@ Royce car , and to enjoy a very affluent lifestyle . In addition , Irving , despite being married , became increasingly open about his affairs with other women , all of which were detailed in his self @-@ published diary . Irving 's affairs were to cause his first marriage to end in divorce in 1981 . In 1982 , Irving began a relationship with a Danish model , Bente <unk> . <unk> and Irving live together , and are the parents of a daughter born in 1984 . 
 In the 1980s Irving started researching and writing about topics other than Nazi Germany , but with less success . He began his research on his three @-@ part biography of Winston Churchill . After publication Irving 's work on Churchill received at least one bad review from Professor David Cannadine ( then of the University of London ) : 
 It has received almost no attention from historians or reviewers ... It is easy to see why . ... full of excesses , inconsistencies and omissions ... seems completely unaware of recent work done on the subject ... It is not merely that the arguments in this book are so perversely tendentious and irresponsibly sensationalist . It is also that it is written in a tone which is at best casually journalistic and at worst quite exceptionally offensive . The text is littered with errors from beginning to end . 
 In 1981 , he published two books . The first was The War Between the Generals , in which Irving offered an account of the Allied High Command on the Western Front in 1944 – 45 , detailing the heated conflicts Irving alleges occurred between the various generals of the various countries and presenting rumours about their private lives . The second book was Uprising ! , about the 1956 revolt in Hungary , which Irving characterised as " primarily an anti @-@ Jewish uprising " , supposedly because the Communist regime was itself controlled by Jews . Irving 's depiction of Hungary 's Communist regime as a Jewish dictatorship oppressing Gentiles sparked charges of antisemitism . In addition , there were complaints that Irving had grossly exaggerated the number of people of Jewish origin in the Communist regime and had ignored the fact that Hungarian Communists who did have a Jewish background like Mátyás Rákosi and Ernő Gerő had totally repudiated Judaism and sometimes expressed antisemitic attitudes themselves . Critics such as Neal Ascherson and Kai Bird took issue with some of Irving 's language that seemed to evoke antisemitic imagery , such as his remark that Rákosi possessed " the tact of a kosher butcher " . 
 = = = Hitler Diaries = = = 
 In 1983 , Stern , a weekly German news magazine , purchased for 9 million marks the Hitler Diaries of 61 volumes and published excerpts from them . Irving played the major role in uncovering the Hitler Diaries as a hoax . In October 1982 Irving purchased , from the same source as Stern 's 1983 purchase , 800 pages of documents relating to Hitler , only to discover that many of the documents were forgeries . Irving was amongst the first to identify the diaries as forgeries , and to draw media attention . He went so far as to crash the press conference held by Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper at the Hamburg offices of Stern magazine on 25 April 1983 to denounce the diaries as a forgery and Trevor @-@ Roper for endorsing the diaries as genuine . Irving 's performance at the Stern press conference where he violently harangued Trevor @-@ Roper until ejected by security led him to be featured prominently on the news ; the next day , Irving appeared on the Today television show as a featured guest . Irving had concluded that the alleged Hitler diaries were a forgery because they had come from the same dealer in Nazi memorabilia from whom Irving had purchased his collection in 1982 . At the press conference in Hamburg , Irving announced , " I know the collection from which these diaries come . It is an old collection , full of forgeries . I have some here " . Irving was proud to have detected and announced the hoax material and of the " trail of chaos " he had created at the Hamburg press conference and the attendant publicity it had brought him , and took pride in his humiliation of Trevor @-@ Roper , whom Irving strongly disliked for his sloppy work ( not detecting the hoax ) and criticism of Irving 's methods and conclusions . Irving also noted internal inconsistencies in the supposed Hitler diaries , such as a diary entry for July 20 , 1944 , which would have been unlikely given that Hitler 's right hand had been badly burned by the bomb planted in his headquarters by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg earlier that day . 
 A week later on 2 May , Irving asserted that many of the diary documents appear to be genuine ; at the same press conference , Irving took the opportunity to promote his translation of the memoirs of Hitler 's physician Dr. Theodor Morell . Robert Harris , in his book Selling Hitler , suggested that an additional reason for Irving 's change of mind over the authenticity of the alleged Hitler diaries was that the fake diaries contain no reference to the Holocaust , thereby buttressing Irving 's claim in Hitler 's War that Hitler had no knowledge of it . Subsequently Irving conformed when the diaries were declared as a forgery by consensus . At a press conference held to withdraw his endorsement of the diaries , Irving proudly claimed that he was the first to call them a forgery , to which a reporter replied that he was also the last to call them genuine .

 By the mid @-@ 1980s , Irving had not had a successful book in years , and was behind schedule in writing the first volume of his Churchill series , the research for which had strained his finances . He finished the manuscript in 1985 , but the book was not published until 1987 , when it was released as Churchill 's War , Volume I. 
 In 1989 , Irving published his biography of Hermann Göring .

 = = = Movement towards Holocaust denial = = = 
 Over the years , Irving 's stance on the Holocaust changed significantly . From 1988 , he started to espouse Holocaust denial openly ; he had previously not denied the Holocaust outright and for this reason , many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him . They admired Irving for the pro @-@ Nazi slant in his work and the fact that he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked , but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust . In 1980 , Lucy Dawidowicz noted that although Hitler 's War was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich , because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust , that his book was not part of the " anti @-@ Semitic canon " . In 1980 , Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust @-@ denial conference , which he refused under the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation . In a letter , Irving stated his reasons for his refusal as : " This is pure Realpolitik on my part . I am already dangerously exposed , and I cannot take the chance of being caught in Flak meant for others ! " Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust @-@ denying Institute for Historical Review ( IHR ) , he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States . Robert Jan van Pelt suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus . 
 In a footnote in the first edition of Hitler 's War , Irving writes , " I cannot accept the view … [ that ] there exists no document signed by Hitler , Himmler or Heydrich speaking of the extermination of the Jews " . In 1982 , Irving made an attempt to unify all of the various neo @-@ Nazi groups in Britain into one party called Focus , in which he would play a leading role . Irving described himself as a " moderate fascist " and spoke of plans to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom . The effort failed due to fiscal problems . Irving told the Oxford Mail of having " links at a low level " with the British National Front . Irving described The Spotlight , the main journal of the Liberty Lobby , as " an excellent fortnightly paper " . At the same time , Irving put a copy of Hitler 's " Prophecy Speech " of 30 January 1939 , promising the " annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe " if " Jewish financiers " started another world war , onto his wall . 
 Following the failure of Focus , in September 1983 , Irving for the first time attended a conference of the IHR . Van Pelt has argued that , with the failure of Irving 's political career , he felt freer to associate with Holocaust deniers . At the conference , Irving did not deny the Holocaust , but did appear happy to share the stage with Robert Faurisson and Judge Wilhelm <unk> , and claimed to be impressed with the allegations of Friedrich Berg that mass murder using diesel gas fumes at the Operation Reinhard death camps was impossible . At that conference , Irving repeated his claims that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust because he was " so busy being a soldier " . In a speech at that conference , Irving stated : " Isn 't it right for Tel Aviv to claim now that David Irving is talking nonsense and of course Adolf Hitler must have known about what was going in Auschwitz and Treblinka , and then in the same breath to claim that , of course our beloved Mr. Begin didn 't know what was going on in Sabra and <unk> " . During the same speech , Irving proclaimed Hitler to be the " biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich " . In the same speech , Irving stated that he operated in such a way as to bring himself maximum publicity . Irving stated that : " I have at home ... a filing cabinet full of documents which I don 't issue all at once . I keep them : I issue them a bit at a time . When I think my name hasn 't been in the newspapers for several weeks , well , then I ring them up and I phone them and I say : ' What about this one , then ? ' " 
 A major theme of Irving 's writings since the 1980s was his belief that it had been a great blunder on the part of Britain to declare war on Germany in 1939 , and that ever since then and as a result of that decision , Britain had slipped into an unstoppable decline . Irving also took the view that Hitler often tried to help the Jews of Europe . In a June 1992 interview with the Daily Telegraph , Irving claimed to have heard from Hitler 's naval adjutant that the Führer had told him that he could not marry because Germany was " his bride " . Irving then claimed to have asked the naval adjutant when Hitler made that remark , and upon hearing that the date was 24 March 1938 , Irving stated in response " Herr Admiral , at that moment I was being born " . Irving used this alleged incident to argue that there was some sort of mystical connection between himself and Hitler . 
 In a 1986 speech in Australia Irving argued that photographs of Holocaust survivors and dead taken in early 1945 by Allied soldiers were proof that the Allies were responsible for the Holocaust , not the Germans . Irving claimed that the Holocaust was not the work of Nazi leaders , but rather of " nameless criminals " , and claimed that " these men [ who killed the Jews ] acted on their own impulse , their own initiative , within the general atmosphere of brutality created by the Second World War , in which of course Allied bombings played a part . " In another 1986 speech , this time in Atlanta , Irving claimed that " historians have a blindness when it comes to the Holocaust because like Tay @-@ Sachs disease it is a Jewish disease which causes blindness " . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , Irving associated himself with the IHR , began giving lectures to groups such as the far @-@ right German Deutsche Volksunion ( DVU ) , and publicly denied that the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews in gas chambers during World War II . Irving was a frequent speaker for the DVU in the 1980s and the early 1990s , but the relationship ended in 1993 apparently because of concerns by the DVU that Irving 's espousal of Holocaust denial might lead to the DVU being banned . 
 In 1986 , Irving visited Toronto , where he was met at the airport by Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel . According to Zündel , Irving " ... thought I was ' Revisionist @-@ Neo @-@ Nazi @-@ Rambo @-@ Kook ! ' " , and asked Zündel to stay away from him . Zündel and his supporters obliged Irving by staying away from his lecture tour , which consequently attracted little media attention , and was considered by Irving to be a failure . Afterwards , Zündel sent Irving a long letter in which he offered to draw publicity to Irving , and so ensure that his future speaking tours would be a success . As a result , Irving and Zündel became friends , and Irving agreed in late 1987 to testify for Zündel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust . In addition , the publication in 1987 of the book Der <unk> <unk> 1917 – 1945 by Ernst Nolte , in which Nolte strongly implied that maybe Holocaust deniers were on to something , encouraged Irving to become more open in associating with Zündel . 
 = = = Zündel trial = = = 
 In January 1988 , Irving travelled to Toronto , Ontario , to assist Douglas Christie , the defence lawyer for Ernst Zündel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust . Working closely with Robert Faurisson , who was also assisting the defence , Irving contacted Warden Bill <unk> of the Missouri State Penitentiary who recommended that Irving and Faurisson get into touch with Fred A. Leuchter , a self @-@ described execution expert living in Boston . Irving and <unk> then flew to Boston to meet with Leuchter , who agreed to lend his alleged technical expertise on the behalf of Zündel 's defence . Irving argued that an alleged expert on gassings like Leuchter could prove that the Holocaust was a " myth " . After work on the second Zündel trial , Irving declared that based on his exposure to Zündel 's and Leuchter 's theories that he was now conducting a " one @-@ man intifada " against the idea that there had been a Holocaust . Subsequently , Irving claimed to the American journalist D.D. <unk> in a 1999 interview that Zündel had convinced him that the Holocaust had not occurred . 
 In the 1988 Zündel trial , Irving repeated and defended his claim from Hitler 's War that until October 1943 Hitler knew nothing about the actual implementation of the Final Solution . He also expressed his evolving belief that the Final Solution involved " atrocities " , not systematic murder : " I don 't think there was any overall Reich policy to kill the Jews . If there was , they would have been killed and there would not be now so many millions of survivors . And believe me , I am glad for every survivor that there was . " On 22 – 26 April 1988 , Irving testified for Zündel , endorsing Richard Harwood 's book Did Six Million Really Die ? as " over ninety percent ... factually accurate " . 
 As to what evidence further led Irving to believe that the Holocaust never occurred , he cited The Leuchter report by Fred A. Leuchter , which claimed there was no evidence for the existence of homicidal gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp . Irving said in a 1999 documentary about Leuchter : " The big point [ of the Leuchter report ] : there is no significant residue of cyanide in the brickwork . That 's what converted me . When I read that in the report in the courtroom in Toronto , I became a hard @-@ core disbeliever " . In addition , Irving was influenced to embrace Holocaust denial by the American historian Arno J. Mayer 's 1988 book Why Did the Heavens Not Darken ? , which did not deny the Holocaust , but claimed that most of those who died at Auschwitz were killed by disease ; Irving saw in Mayer 's book an apparent confirmation of Leuchter 's and Zündel 's theories about no mass murder at Auschwitz . 
 After the trial , Irving published Leuchter 's report as Auschwitz The End of the Line : The Leuchter Report in the United Kingdom in 1989 and wrote its foreword . Leuchter 's book had been first published in Canada by Zündel 's Samisdat Publishers in 1988 as The Leuchter Report : The End of a Myth : An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz , Birkenau and <unk> . In his foreword to the British edition of Leuchter 's book , Irving wrote that " Nobody likes to be swindled , still less where considerable sums of money are involved " . The alleged swindle was the reparations money totalling 3 billion DM paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Israel between 1952 – 1966 for the Holocaust . Irving described the reparations as being " essentially in atonement for the ' gas chambers ' of Auschwitz " , which Irving called a " myth " that would " not die easily " . In his foreword , Irving praised the " scrupulous methods " and " integrity " of Leuchter . 
 For publishing and writing the foreword to Auschwitz The End of the Line , on 20 June 1989 Irving together with Leuchter was condemned in an Early Day Motion of the House of Commons as " Hitler 's heirs " . The motion went on to describe Irving as a " Nazi propagandist and longtime Hitler apologist " and Auschwitz The End of the Line as a " fascist publication " . In the Motion , the House stated that they were " appalled by [ the Holocaust denial of ] Nazi propagandist and long @-@ time Hitler apologist David Irving " . In response to the House of Commons motion , Irving in a press statement challenged the MPs who voted to condemn him that : " I will enter the ' gas chambers ' of Auschwitz and you and your friends may lob in Zyklon B in accordance with the well known procedures and conditions . I guarantee that you won 't be satisfied with the results ! " . 
 In a pamphlet Irving published in London on 23 June 1989 Irving made the " epochal announcement " that there was no mass murder in the gas chambers at the Auschwitz death camp . Irving labelled the gas chambers at Auschwitz a " hoax " , and writing in the third person declared that he " has placed himself [ Irving ] at the head of a growing band of historians , worldwide , who are now sceptical of the claim that at Auschwitz and other camps were ' factories of death ' , in which millions of innocent people were systematically gassed to death " . Boasting of his role in criticising the Hitler diaries as a forgery in 1983 , Irving wrote " now he [ Irving ] is saying the same thing about the infamous ' gas chambers ' of Auschwitz , Treblinka and Majdanek . They did not exist – ever – except perhaps as the brainchild of Britain 's brilliant wartime Psychological Warfare Executive " . Finally , Irving claimed " the survivors of Auschwitz are themselves testimony to the absence of an extermination programme " . Echoing the criticism of the House of Commons , on 14 May 1990 a leader in The Times described Irving as a " man for whom Hitler is something of a hero and almost everything of an innocent and for whom Auschwitz is a Jewish deception " . 
 = = = Holocaust denial lecture circuit = = = 
 In the early 1990s , Irving was a frequent visitor to Germany , where he spoke at neo @-@ Nazi rallies . The chief themes of Irving 's German speeches were that the Allies and Axis states were equally culpable for war crimes , that the decision of Neville Chamberlain to declare war on Germany in 1939 , and that of Winston Churchill to continue the war in 1940 , had been great mistakes that set Britain on a path of decline , and the Holocaust was just a " propaganda exercise " . In June 1990 , Irving went to the former East German states on a well @-@ publicized tour entitled " An Englishman Fights for the Honour of the Germans , " on which he accused the Allies of having used " forged documents " to " humiliate " the German people . Irving 's self @-@ proclaimed mission was to guide " promising young men " in Germany in the " right direction " ( Irving has often stated his belief that women exist for a " certain task , which is producing us [ men ] " , and should be " subservient to men " ; leading , in Lipstadt 's view , to a lack of interest on Irving 's part in guiding young German women in the " right direction " ) . German nationalists found Irving , as a non @-@ German Holocaust denier , to be particularly credible . 
 In January 1990 , Irving gave a speech in Moers where he asserted that only 30 @,@ 000 people died at Auschwitz between 1940 – 45 , all of natural causes , which was equal — so he claimed — to the typical death toll from one Bomber Command raid on German cities . Irving claimed that there were no gas chambers at the death camp , stating that the existing remains were " mock @-@ ups built by the Poles " . On 21 April 1990 Irving repeated the same speech in Munich , which led to his conviction for Holocaust denial in Munich on 11 July 1991 . The court fined Irving DM 7 @,@ 000 . Irving appealed the judgement , and received a fine of DM 10 @,@ 000 for repeating the same remarks in the courtroom on 5 May 1992 . During his appeal in 1992 , Irving called upon those present in the Munich courtroom to " fight a battle for the German people and put an end to the blood lie of the Holocaust which has been told against this country for fifty years " . Irving went on to call the Auschwitz death camp a " tourist attraction " whose origins Irving claimed went back to an " ingenious plan " devised by the British Psychological Warfare Executive in 1942 to spread anti @-@ German propaganda that it was the policy of the German state to be " using ' gas chambers ' to kill millions of Jews and other undesirables " . During the same speech , Irving denounced the judge as a " senile , alcoholic <unk> " . Following his conviction for Holocaust denial , Irving was banned from visiting Germany . 
 Expanding upon his thesis in Hitler 's War about the lack of a written Führer order for the Holocaust , Irving argued in the 1990s that the absence of such an order meant that there was no Holocaust . In a speech delivered in Toronto in November 1990 Irving claimed that Holocaust survivors had manufactured memories of their suffering because " there 's money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it " . In that speech , Irving used the metaphor of a cruise ship named Holocaust , which Irving claimed had " ... luxury wall to wall fitted carpets and a crew of thousands … marine terminals established in now virtually every capital in the world , disguised as Holocaust memorial museums " . Irving went on to assert that the " ship " was due for rough sailing because recently the Soviet government had allowed historians access to " the index cards of all the people who passed through the gates of Auschwitz " , and claimed that this would lead to " a lot of people [ who ] are not claiming to be Auschwitz survivors anymore " ( Irving 's statement about the index cards was incorrect ; what the Soviet government had made available in 1990 were the death books of Auschwitz , recording the weekly death tolls ) . Irving claimed on the basis of what he called the index books that , " Because the experts can look at a tattoo and say ' Oh yes , 181 , 219 that means you entered Auschwitz in March 1943 " and he warned Auschwitz survivors " If you want to go and have a tattoo put on your arm , as a lot of them do , I am afraid to say , and claim subsequently that you were in Auschwitz , you have to make sure a ) that it fits in with the month you said you went to Auschwitz and b ) it is not a number which anyone used before " . 
 On 17 January 1991 Irving told a reporter from the Jewish Chronicle that " The Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time " . Irving went to say that he believed anti @-@ Semitism will increase all over the world because " the Jews have exploited people with the gas chamber legend " and that " In ten years , Israel will cease to exist and the Jews will have to return to Europe " . In his 1991 revised edition of Hitler 's War he had removed all references to death camps and the Holocaust . In a speech given in Hamburg in 1991 , Irving stated that in two years time " this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz , Majdanek and Treblinka ... which in fact never took place " will be disproved ( Auschwitz , Majdanek , and Treblinka were all well known extermination camps ) . Two days later , Irving repeated the same speech in Halle before a group of neo @-@ Nazis , and praised Rudolf Hess as " that great German martyr , Rudolf Hess " . At another 1991 speech , this time in Canada , Irving called the Holocaust a " hoax " , and again predicted that by 1993 the " hoax " would have been " exposed " . In that speech , Irving declared , " Gradually the word is getting around Germany . Two years from now too , the German historians will accept that we are right . They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie " . During that speech given in October 1991 , Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that : 
 Ridicule alone isn 't enough , you 've got to be tasteless about it . You 've got to say things like ' More women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy 's car at Chappaquiddick than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz . ' Now you think that 's tasteless , what about this ? I 'm forming an association especially dedicated to all these liars , the ones who try and kid people that they were in these concentration camps , it 's called the Auschwitz Survivors , Survivors of the Holocaust and Other Liars , ' <unk> ' . Can 't get more tasteless than that , but you 've got to be tasteless because these people deserve our contempt . 
 In another 1991 speech , this time in Regina Irving called the Holocaust " a major fraud ... There were no gas chambers . They were fakes and frauds " . 
 In November 1992 , Irving was to be a featured speaker at a world anti @-@ Zionist congress in Stockholm that was cancelled by the Swedish government . Also scheduled to attend were fellow Holocaust @-@ deniers Robert Faurisson and Fred A. Leuchter , and Louis Farrakhan , together with representatives of the militant Palestinian group Hamas , the Lebanese militant Shiite group Hezbollah , and the right @-@ wing Russian antisemitic group <unk> . In a 1993 speech , Irving claimed that had been only 100 @,@ 000 Jewish deaths at Auschwitz , " but not from gas chambers . They died from epidemics " . Irving went on to claim that most of the Jewish deaths during World War II had been caused by Allied bombing . Irving claimed that " The concentration camp inmates arrived in Berlin or Leipzig or in Dresden just in time for the RAF bombers to set fire to those cities . Nobody knows how many Jews died in those air raids " . In a 1994 speech , Irving lamented that his predictions of 1991 had failed to occur , and complained of the persistence of belief in the " rotting corpse " of the " profitable legend " of the Holocaust . In another 1994 speech , Irving claimed that there was no German policy of genocide of Jews , and that only 600 @,@ 000 Jews died in concentration camps in World War II , all due to either Allied bombing or disease . At the same time , Irving started to appear more frequently at the annual conferences hosted by the IHR . In a 1995 speech , Irving claimed that the Holocaust was a myth invented by a " world @-@ wide Jewish cabal " to serve their own ends . Irving also spoke on other topics at the IHR gatherings . A frequent theme was the claim that Winston Churchill had advance knowledge of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor , and refused to warn the Americans to bring the United States into World War II . 
 At the same time , Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience . In a 1993 letter , Irving lashed out against his former friend Zündel , writing that : " In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto . I would not make the same mistake again . As a penalty for having defended you then , and for having continued to aid you since , my life has come under a gradually mounting attack : I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations , violence , vituperation and persecution " ( emphasis in the original ) . Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Zündel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement ; van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter . In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995 , Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II , though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps . Irving 's statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson , who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust . In 1995 , Irving stated in another speech that " I have to take off my hat to my adversaries and the strategies they have employed — the marketing of the very word Holocaust : I half expected to see a little TM after it " . Likewise , depending on his audience , Irving during the 1990s has either used the absence of a written <unk> ( Führer order ) for the " Final Solution " to argue that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust , or that the absence of a written order meant there was no Holocaust . 
 = = Racism and antisemitism = = 
 Irving has expressed racist and antisemitic sentiments , both publicly and privately . Irving has often expressed his belief in the theory of a sinister Jewish conspiracy ruling the world , and that the belief in the reality of Holocaust was manufactured as part of the same alleged conspiracy . Irving used the label " traditional enemies of the truth " to describe Jews , and in a 1963 article about a speech by Sir Oswald Mosley wrote that the " Yellow Star did not make a showing " . In 1992 , Irving stated that " ... the Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time " and claimed he " foresees a new wave of antisemitism " the world over due to Jewish " exploitation of the Holocaust myth " . During an interview with the American writer Ron Rosenbaum , Irving stated his belief that Jews were his " traditional enemy " . In one interview cited in the libel lawsuit , Irving also stated that he would be " willing to put [ his ] signature " to the " fact " that " a great deal of control over the world is exercised by Jews " . 
 Several of these statements were cited by the judge 's decision in Irving 's lawsuit against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt , leading the judge to conclude that Irving " had on many occasions spoken in terms which are plainly racist . " One example brought was his diary entry for 17 September 1994 , in which Irving wrote about a ditty he composed for his young daughter " when halfbreed children are wheeled past " : 
 I am a Baby Aryan 
 Not Jewish or Sectarian 
 I have no plans to marry <unk> or Rastafarian . 
 Christopher Hitchens wrote that Irving sang the rhyme to Hitchens ' wife , Carol Blue , and daughter , Antonia , in the elevator following drinks in the family 's Washington apartment . 
 = = Persona non grata = = 
 After Irving denied the Holocaust in two 1989 speeches given in Austria , the Austrian government issued an arrest warrant for him and barred him from entering the country . In early 1992 a German court found him guilty of Holocaust denial under the <unk> section of the law against <unk> ( a failed appeal by Irving would see the fine rise from 10 @,@ 000 DM to 30 @,@ 000 DM ) , and he was subsequently barred from entering Germany . Other governments followed suit , including Italy and Canada , where he was arrested in November 1992 and deported back to the United Kingdom . In an administrative hearing surrounding those events , he was found by the hearing office to have engaged in a " total fabrication " in telling a story of an exit from and return to Canada which would , for technical reasons , have made the original deportation order invalid . He was also barred from entering Australia in 1992 , a ban he made five unsuccessful attempts to overturn . 
 In 1992 , Irving signed a contract with Macmillan for a biography of Joseph Goebbels entitled Goebbels : Mastermind of the Third Reich . Following charges that Irving had selectively " edited " a recently discovered complete edition of Goebbels 's diaries in Moscow , Macmillan cancelled the book deal . The decision by the Sunday Times ( who had bought the rights to serialised extracts from the diaries before Macmillan published them ) in July 1992 to hire Irving as a translator of Goebbels 's diary was criticised by historian Peter <unk> , who argued that Irving , because of his views about the Third Reich , was not the best man for the job . Andrew Neil , the editor of the Sunday Times , called Irving " reprehensible " , but defended hiring Irving because he was only a " transcribing technician " , which others criticised as a poor description of translation work . 
 On 27 April 1993 Irving was ordered to attend court to be examined on charges relating to the Loi <unk> in France , making it an offence to question the existence or size of the category of crimes against humanity . The law does not extend to extradition , and Irving refused to travel to France . Then , in February 1994 , Irving spent 10 days of a three @-@ month sentence in London 's Pentonville prison for contempt of court following a legal wrangling over publishing rights . 
 In 1995 , St. Martin 's Press of New York City agreed to publish the Goebbels biography ; but after protests , they cancelled the contract , leaving Irving in a situation in which , according to D. D. <unk> , he was desperate for financial help , publicity , and the need to re @-@ establish his reputation as a historian . The book was eventually self @-@ published . 
 = = = Libel suit = = = 
 On 5 September 1996 , Irving filed a libel suit against Deborah Lipstadt and her British publisher Penguin Books for publishing a British edition of Lipstadt 's book , Denying the Holocaust , which had first been published in the United States in 1993 . In her book , Denying the Holocaust , Lipstadt called Irving a Holocaust denier , <unk> , and bigot , and said that he manipulated and distorted real documents . 
 Lipstadt hired the British solicitor Anthony Julius to present her case , while Penguin Books hired Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman , libel specialist from media firm Davenport Lyons . They briefed the libel barrister Richard Rampton QC and Penguin also briefed junior barrister Heather Rogers . The defendants ( with Penguin 's insurers paying the fee ) also retained Professor Richard J. Evans , historian and Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University , as an expert witness . Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian Christopher Browning , the German historian Peter Longerich and the Dutch architectural expert Robert Jan van Pelt . The latter wrote a report attesting to the fact that the death camps were designed , built and used for the purpose of mass murder , while Browning testified for the reality of the Holocaust . Evans ' report was the most comprehensive , in @-@ depth examination of Irving 's work : 
 Not one of [ Irving 's ] books , speeches or articles , not one paragraph , not one sentence in any of them , can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject . All of them are completely worthless as history , because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere , in any of them , to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about . ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past , and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible , then Irving is not a historian . 
 The BBC quoted Evans further : - 
 Irving , ( ... ) had deliberately distorted and wilfully mistranslated documents , consciously used discredited testimony and falsified historical statistics . ( ... ) Irving has fallen so far short of the standards of scholarship customary amongst historians that he does not deserve to be called a historian at all . " 
 Not only did Irving lose the case , but in light of the evidence presented at the trial a number of his works that had previously escaped serious scrutiny were brought to public attention . He was also liable to pay all of Penguin 's costs of the trial , estimated to be as much as £ 2 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 2 million ) though it remains uncertain how much of these liabilities he will ultimately pay for . When he did not meet these , Davenport Lyons moved to make him bankrupt on behalf of their client . He was forced into bankruptcy in 2002 and lost his home , though he has been able to travel around the world despite his financial losses . 
 = = = Life after libel suit = = = 
 Early in September 2004 , Michael Cullen , the deputy prime minister of New Zealand , announced that Irving would not be permitted to visit the country , where he had been invited by the National Press Club to give a series of lectures under the heading " The Problems of Writing about World War II in a Free Society " . The National Press Club defended its invitation of Irving , saying that it amounted not to an endorsement of his views , but rather an opportunity to question him . A government spokeswoman said that " people who have been deported from another country are refused entry " to New Zealand . Irving rejected the ban and attempted to board a Qantas flight for New Zealand from Los Angeles on 17 September 2004 . He was not allowed on board . 
 On 11 November 2005 , the Austrian police in the southern state of Styria , acting under the 1989 warrant , arrested Irving . Irving pleaded guilty to the charge of " trivialising , grossly playing down and denying the Holocaust " and was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment in accordance with the law prohibiting National Socialist activities ( officially <unk> , " Prohibition Statute " ) . After he was arrested , Irving claimed in his plea that he changed his opinions on the Holocaust , " I said that then based on my knowledge at the time , but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers , I wasn 't saying that anymore and I wouldn 't say that now . The Nazis did murder millions of Jews . " Irving sat motionless as judge Peter <unk> asked him if he had understood the sentence , to which he replied " I 'm not sure I do " before being bundled out of the court by Austrian police . Later , Irving declared himself shocked by the severity of the sentence . He had reportedly already purchased a plane ticket home to London . 
 In December 2006 , Irving was released from prison , and banned from ever returning to Austria . Upon Irving 's arrival in the UK he reaffirmed his position , stating that he felt " no need any longer to show remorse " for his Holocaust views . On 18 May 2007 , he was expelled from the 52nd Warsaw International Book Fair in Poland because books he took there were deemed by the organizers as promoting Nazism and antisemitism , which is in violation of Polish law . 
 Since then , Irving has continued to work as a freelance writer , despite his troubled public image . He was drawn into the controversy surrounding Bishop Richard Williamson , who in a televised interview recorded in Germany in November 2008 denied the Holocaust took place , only to see Williamson convicted for incitement in April 2010 after refusing to pay a fine of 12 @,@ 000 euros . Irving subsequently found himself beset by protesters on a book tour of the United States . Irving has actively toured the United States . Irving has also given lectures and tours in the UK and Europe ; one tour to Poland in September 2010 which led to particular criticism included the Treblinka death camp as an itinerary stop . During his 2008 tour of the US Deborah Lipstadt stated that Irving 's audience was mainly limited to like @-@ minded people . 
 Irving and Nick Griffin ( then the British National Party leader ) were invited to speak at a forum on free speech at the Oxford Union on 26 November 2007 , along with Anne Atkins and Evan Harris . The debate took place after Oxford Union members voted in favour of it , but was disrupted by protesters . As of 2013 , Irving was lecturing to small audiences at venues disclosed only to attendants on various topics including alleged Jewish conspiracies and alleged holocaust denial ; more recently , lecture topics included the life and death of Heinrich Himmler , or the saturation bombings during World War II . 
 Irving established a website selling Nazi memorabilia in 2009 . The items are offered by other people , with Irving receiving a commission from each sale for authenticating them . Irving stated in 2009 that the website was the only way he could make money after being bankrupted in 2002 . Items sold through the website include Hitler 's walking stick and a lock of the dictator 's hair . Irving has also investigated the authenticity of bones purported to be from Hitler and Eva Braun .

 In October 2008 a controversy erupted in Norway over the invitation of David Irving to speak at the 2009 Norwegian Festival of Literature . Several of Norway 's most distinguished authors protested against the invitation . The leader of the board for the festival , Jesper Holte , defended the invitation by stating that " Our agenda is to invite a liar and a <unk> of history to a festival about truth . And confront him with this . Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of truth in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this . " Although Irving is introduced in the festival 's webpages as " historian and writer " the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterize Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen . Lars <unk> Christensen and Roy Jacobsen were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving 's invitation and Anne B. <unk> stated that Sigrid Undset would have turned around in her grave . As the festival has as its subsidiary name " Sigrid Undset Days " , a representative of Undset 's family had requested that the name of the Nobel laureate be removed in connection with the festival . Also the Norwegian free speech organization Fritt Ord was critical towards letting Irving speak at the festival and had requested that its logo be removed from the festival . In addition Edvard <unk> announced that he would not attend the 2009 festival with Irving taking part . Per Edgar <unk> , leader of the Norwegian Press Confederation advocated cancelling Irving 's invitation . 
 Days after the controversy had started , the invitation was rescinded . This led to the resignation of Stig <unk> from his position as content director as he was the person who had invited Irving to the event . The head of the Norwegian Festival of Literature , Randi <unk> , deplored what had taken place , stating " Everything is fine as long as everyone agrees , but things get more difficult when one doesn 't like the views being put forward . " <unk> characterized his colleagues as " damned cowards " arguing that they were walking in lockstep . 
 According to editor @-@ in @-@ chief Sven Egil <unk> of Stavanger <unk> the opposition to Irving 's participation at the festival appeared as a concerted effort and <unk> suggested campaign journalism from two of Norway 's largest newspapers , Dagbladet and Aftenposten and Norway 's public service broadcaster NRK . 
 David Irving commented that he had not been told that the festival was going to present him as a liar , and that he was preparing a lecture about the real history of what took place in Norway during World War II , contrary to what official historians have presented . Irving stated that he had thought the Norwegian people to be made of tougher stuff . 
 Only days after the cancellation David Irving announced that he would go to Lillehammer during the literature festival and deliver his 2 @-@ hour lecture from a hotel room . He did not come . 
 = = Reception by historians = = 
 Irving , once highly regarded for his expert knowledge of German military archives , was a controversial figure from the start . His interpretations of the war were widely regarded as unduly favourable to the German side . At first this was seen as personal opinion , unpopular but consistent with full respectability as a historian . By 1988 , however , Irving had begun to reject the status of the Holocaust as a systematic and deliberate genocide ; and he soon became the main proponent of Holocaust denial . This , along with his association with far @-@ right circles , dented his standing as a historian . A marked change in Irving 's reputation can be seen in the surveys of the historiography of the Third Reich produced by Ian Kershaw . In the first edition of Kershaw 's book The Nazi Dictatorship in 1985 , Irving was called a " maverick " historian working outside the mainstream of the historical profession . By the time of the fourth edition of The Nazi Dictatorship in 2000 , Irving was described only as a historical writer who had in the 1970s engaged in " provocations " intended to provide an " <unk> of Hitler 's role in the Final Solution " . Other critical responses to his work tend to follow this chronological pattern .

 = USS Orizaba ( ID @-@ 1536 ) = 
 USS Orizaba ( ID @-@ 1536 / AP @-@ 24 ) was a transport ship for the United States Navy in both World War I and World War II . She was the sister ship of Siboney but the two were not part of a ship class . In her varied career , she was also known as USAT Orizaba in service for the United States Army , as SS Orizaba in interwar civilian service for the Ward Line , and as Duque de Caxias ( U @-@ 11 ) as an auxiliary in the Brazilian Navy after World War II . 
 Orizaba made 15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy carrying troops to and from Europe in World War I with the second shortest average in @-@ port turnaround time of all Navy transports . The ship was turned over to the War Department in 1919 for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba . After her World War I service ended , Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line , her previous owners . The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York – Cuba – Mexico service until 1939 , when the ship was chartered to United States Lines . While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service , American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932 . 
 In World War II the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and again assigned to the War Department as USAT Orizaba . After completing one voyage as an Army transport , the ship was transferred to the US Navy , where she was re @-@ commissioned as USS Orizaba ( AP @-@ 24 ) . The ship made several transatlantic runs , was damaged in an air attack in the Allied invasion of Sicily , and made trips to South America . The transport also served in the Pacific Theatre , making several transpacific voyages , and one to the Aleutians . 
 In June 1945 , Orizaba was transferred under Lend @-@ Lease to the Brazilian Navy where she served as Duque de Caxias ( U @-@ 11 ) . In August 1945 , Duque de <unk> carried parts of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force from Naples back to Rio de Janeiro . The ship was badly damaged by a fire in 1947 , but was repaired and remained in service . Permanently transferred to Brazil in 1953 , Duque de Caxias was decommissioned in 1959 and scrapped in 1963 .

 Orizaba — named after the town of Orizaba , Veracruz , Mexico — was laid down for the Ward Line by William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia and launched in February 1917 . In mid @-@ 1917 the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress , including the still @-@ incomplete Orizaba and her sister ship Siboney . Plans for both ships were modified for troop @-@ carrying duties . Upon Orizaba ’ s completion , the USSB delivered her to the US Navy for transport duty on 11 April 1918 , and she was commissioned as USS Orizaba on 27 May . 
 Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service , Orizaba carried over 15 @,@ 000 troops in six convoy trips to France before the end of World War I. In one such voyage , Orizaba ’ s executive officer , ordnance expert William Price Williamson , worked closely with Commander Richard <unk> White — Orizaba ’ s commanding officer , himself an ordnance expert — to develop a workable depth charge launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines . Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge launcher , and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918 . While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day , a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely , killing Williamson and three other sailors . White , four other officers , and twenty @-@ two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast . 
 Four days later on 21 August at 08 : 30 , Orizaba , traveling with Siboney , spotted a submarine in the act of submerging . Orizaba attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges , but there was no indication that the attack was successful . 
 In December 1918 , she was temporarily assigned to assist the French government in repatriating French , Belgian , and Italian prisoners of war . Detached from that duty on 10 January 1919 , she joined the Cruiser and Transport Force at Brest , and in nine voyages returned over 31 @,@ 700 troops to the United States . After the completion of transport duty service in the summer of 1919 , she decommissioned on 4 September and was turned over to the Army for further transport service as USAT Orizaba . The boat served in that capacity until returned to the Ward Line in 1920 . 
 According to the Statistical Department of the US Navy , Orizaba had the second @-@ shortest average in @-@ port turnaround time out of 37 US Navy transports used in World War I. The ship completed 15 round trips with an average turn @-@ around time of just over 30 days per trip , while the overall Navy average was 39 @.@ 8 days .

 After both were reacquired by the Ward Line , Orizaba and Siboney were placed in transatlantic service on New York – Cuba – Spain routes in 1920 , with Orizaba calling at Corunna , Santander , and Bilbao in Spain . The two ships accommodated 306 first @-@ class , 60 second @-@ class , and 64 third @-@ class passengers , with each ship making several trips on the route , but a lack of passengers ( along with the grounding of Siboney at Vigo in September 1920 ) led to the abandonment of the route . 
 By October 1921 , Orizaba was placed in New York – Cuba – Mexico service , where business thrived , in part because of Prohibition in the United States . Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called " alcohol @-@ enriched vacations " . Three years later , the ship underwent a major refit that , among other things , lengthened her funnels . A typical voyage at this time sailed from New York and called at Nassau , Havana , Progreso , Veracruz and Tampico . 
 By the early 1930s , Orizaba ’ s typical route had remained virtually the same , though Nassau and Tampico were dropped as ports of call . It was in this period that American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from Orizaba . At around noon on 27 April 1932 , while the ship was headed to New York — some 275 miles ( 443 km ) north of Havana and 10 miles ( 16 km ) off the Florida coast — Crane , clad in pajamas and overcoat , climbed the rail at the stern of the ship and plunged into the ocean . The captain of Orizaba immediately stopped the ship and launched four lifeboats that searched in vain for two hours , but no trace of the poet was ever found . Before he jumped , Crane had been drinking and , the night before , had been the victim of homophobic violence after a pick @-@ up attempt of a crewman ended with a severe beating . 
 In April 1934 , American actress Katharine Hepburn sailed from New York on Orizaba , eventually ending up in Mérida , Yucatán . After her arrival there on 22 April , she filed for divorce from businessman Ludlow ( " <unk> " ) Ogden Smith , whom she had married in December 1928 . After the divorce was finalized she and her travel companion , Laura Harding , planned to spend a week in Havana and return to New York on the Ward Line ship Morro Castle . Other notable passengers on Orizaba in the 1930s included Ecuadorean diplomat Gonzalo <unk> and Cuban president Fulgencio Batista . <unk> , the Ecuadorean Minister to the United States , sailed to Mexico for his new posting as Minister to Mexico in August 1932 . In February 1939 , Orizaba carried Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista back to Havana after a two @-@ week goodwill visit to Mexico . 
 Beginning in the mid @-@ 1930s , Orizaba often carried gold and silver bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Chase National Bank , or for later transshipment to London . In October 1933 three short tons ( 2 @.@ 7 tonnes ) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London , prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico to take advantage of its policy of not charging duties on gold . In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16 cases of Mexican gold , and in January 1935 , 20 cases ; in both instances , for delivery to Chase National Bank . Twice in 1935 , the Ward liner delivered over 1 @,@ 000 bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank , bringing 1 @,@ 390 bars in March , and 1 @,@ 933 bars in July . Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals . In March 1934 , she delivered 12 cases of gold — consisting of 84 bars , and worth $ 1 @,@ 624 @,@ 000 — from Havana for Chase . 
 In mid @-@ 1939 , Orizaba was chartered to United States Lines as one of five ships added to increase what was perceived as a slow rate of return of US citizens fleeing war @-@ torn Europe . In September , the ship was diverted to Galway to pick up American survivors of SS Athenia , torpedoed by U @-@ 30 on 3 September ; Orizaba returned with 240 of the survivors later that month . After completing evacuation service , the ship was laid up in New York in the summer of 1940 , and subsequently purchased by the Maritime Commission on behalf of the Army on 27 February 1941 .

 After her reacquisition by the War Department , Orizaba completed one round trip to the Panama Canal Zone . On her return she put in for a refit by the Bethlehem Steel Company at New York . After she was transferred to the Navy on 4 June 1941 , she was commissioned as Orizaba ( AP @-@ 24 ) on 15 June 1941 . 
 Following several months of coastal operations , Orizaba , now armed with two 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) guns and four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns , departed New York in April 1942 on the first transatlantic run of her second world war . Sailing via Iceland , she steamed to England , Cape Town , Recife , and Norfolk , Virginia , from which she got underway for Bermuda and Puerto Rico . Returning to Norfolk in January 1943 , she plied the eastern seaboard for a month , then took up transatlantic duties again . Until July she traversed the ocean to Oran , Algeria , carrying troops over and prisoners of war back to New York . 
 On 5 July she left Oran in Task Force ( TF ) 81 . The next day , she rendezvoused with TF 85 and on 9 July stood off Gela , Sicily , disembarking troops into landing craft . On 11 July , she sustained slight damage in an enemy air attack and retired to Algeria with casualties and prisoners on board the next day . She returned to Sicily at the end of the month to discharge troops and cargo at Palermo and then , on the night of 1 August , weighed anchor and stood out for home . 
 Arriving at New York on 22 August 1943 , she underwent an overhaul , then took on runs to Brazil and the Caribbean . At the end of the year she left the east coast , passed through the Panama Canal , and sailed on to the Southwestern Pacific . After calls at Samoa , Nouméa , Brisbane , and Milne Bay , she returned to the west coast in March 1944 , only to leave again for another Central Pacific run . Back at San Francisco in June , she underwent repairs ; completed a run to the Marshalls and Marianas ; and then sailed north to the Aleutians . Completing her northern run at Seattle , Washington on 1 December , she carried men and supplies to Hawaii , then returned to San Francisco , later sailing to New Guinea , the Philippines , and Ulithi to add men and materiel to forces gathering for the Battle of Okinawa . 
 From Ulithi , Orizaba sailed east , passed through the Panama Canal again , and , as the battle for Okinawa raged , arrived at Tampa , Florida . Decommissioning on 23 April , she underwent an overhaul and on 16 July 1945 she was transferred to Brazil under the terms of Lend @-@ Lease . The ship was permanently transferred to Brazil in June 1953 and struck from the US Naval Vessel Register on 20 July of that same year . Orizaba received one battle star for her US Navy service in World War II . As of 2008 , no other US Navy ship has been named Orizaba . 
 = = Brazilian Navy service = = 
 Assuming control of the vessel at Tampa on 16 July 1945 , the Brazilian Navy renamed the veteran transport Duque de Caxias ( U @-@ 11 ) , the second ship of that navy named in honor of Luís Alves de Lima e Silva , Duke of Caxias , the patron of the Brazilian Army . 
 Duque de Caxias headed to Naples and on 28 August 1945 left there with elements of the returning Brazilian Expeditionary Force . The ship arrived at Rio de Janeiro for the first time on 17 September 1945 . The ship then loaded American military stores from US bases in Brazil and sailed for New York , arriving on 10 November 1945 , with plans to repatriate wounded Brazilian soldiers who had been recuperating in the US . 
 On 31 July 1947 , a day after sailing from Rio de Janeiro for Europe , oil spilled on the ship ’ s boilers , causing an engine @-@ room fire that quickly spread through the first class cabins and killed 27 . The ship was towed from its position off Cabo Frio into Rio de Janeiro on 1 August 1947 . The ship had been carrying 1 @,@ 060 passengers bound for Lisbon , Naples , and Marseille , along with 500 crew members , and had been scheduled to carry Italian refugees on its return voyage . 
 In 1953 , Duque de Caxias was converted into a training ship , and in August of that year began a European and Mediterranean training cruise , which included a 12 @-@ day visit to New York in March 1954 as part of its homeward leg . The ship visited the United States again in December 1955 , with midshipmen aboard touring the United States Naval Academy and honored at a cocktail by the Brazilian Ambassador , Joao Carlos Muniz , at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington , D.C. In October the following year , Duque de Caxias called at Philadelphia , and the new Brazilian Ambassador Ernani do Amaral Peixoto — also an Admiral in the Brazilian Navy — and his wife sponsored a tea dance in honor of Captain Antonio Andrade , other officers of the ship , and the midshipmen aboard the ship ; Peixoto had traveled to Philadelphia to greet Andrade , a former naval attaché at the embassy . The ship was decommissioned 13 April 1959 , and finally scrapped in 1963 .

 A toothcomb ( also tooth comb or dental comb ) is a dental structure found in some mammals , comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming , similar to a hair comb . The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates ( which includes lemurs and lorisoids ) , treeshrews , colugos , hyraxes , and some African antelopes . The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure . In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them . The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only , while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw , followed by a canine @-@ shaped first premolar . The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated , providing multiple tines per tooth . 
 The toothcomb is usually used for grooming . While licking the fur clean , the animal will run the toothcomb through the fur to comb it . Fine grooves or striations are usually cut into the teeth during grooming by the hair and may be seen on the sides of the teeth when viewed through a scanning electron microscope . The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or , in the case of lemuriforms , the sublingua , a specialized " under @-@ tongue " . The toothcomb can have other functions , such as food procurement and bark gouging . Within lemuriforms , fork @-@ marked lemurs and indriids have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions . In some lemurs , such as the aye @-@ aye , the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition . 
 In lemuriform primates , the toothcomb has been used by scientists in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin . They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier . One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids , but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene ( 66 to 55 mya ) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia . Fossil primates such as Djebelemur , ' Anchomomys ' milleri , and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives . The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40 mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids , and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa . 
 = = Homologous and analogous structures = = 
 The toothcomb , a special morphological arrangement of teeth in the anterior lower jaw , is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates , which include lemurs and lorisoid primates ( collectively known as lemuriforms ) . This homologous structure is a diagnostic character that helps define this clade ( related group ) of primates . An analogous trait is found in the bald <unk> ( <unk> calvus ) , a type of New World monkey . 
 <unk> can also be found in colugos and treeshrews , both close relatives of primates ; however , the structures are different and these are considered to examples of convergent evolution . Likewise , small- or medium @-@ sized African antelopes , such as the impala ( Aepyceros melampus ) , have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the " lateral dental grooming apparatus " . Living and extinct hyraxes ( <unk> ) also exhibit a toothcomb , although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record . 
 Dating to the Eocene epoch over 50 mya , <unk> and <unk> — two types of <unk> ( primitive placental mammals ) — also possessed an independently evolved toothcomb . 
 = = Anatomical structure = = 
 The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth , four incisors and two canine teeth that are procumbent ( tilt forward ) in the front of the mouth . The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them , but they are more robust and curve upward and inward , more so than the incisors . In the permanent dentition , the canines erupt after the incisors . The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt , and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side @-@ to @-@ side . The apical ridge , following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth , is V @-@ shaped in most lemuriforms , tapering off from the midline . As a result of this dental reconfiguration , the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another , and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely . 
 The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first identified the two lateral teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840 . Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects . With modified lower canine teeth , the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth ( caniniform ) and assume their function . These premolars are commonly confused with canines . Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines , and in toothcombed primates , the caniniform premolars rest behind it . 
 The lemuriform toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or " under @-@ tongue " , a specialized muscular structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris . The sublingua can extend below the end of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized , serrated points that rake between the front teeth . 
 Among lemurs , the toothcomb is variable in structure . Among indriids ( Indriidae ) , the toothcomb is less procumbent and consists of four teeth instead of six . The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider , with shorter incisors , wider spaces between the teeth ( interdental spaces ) , and a broader apical ridge . It is unclear whether this four @-@ toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines . In fork @-@ marked lemurs ( Phaner ) the toothcomb is more compressed , with significantly reduced interdental spaces . All six teeth are longer , straighter , and form a more continuous apical ridge . In the recently extinct monkey lemurs ( Archaeolemuridae ) and sloth lemurs ( Palaeopropithecidae ) , the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration in the front of the mouth . The aye @-@ aye also lost its toothcomb , replacing it with continually growing ( hypselodont ) front teeth , similar to the incisors of rodents . 
 In colugos , the toothcomb has a completely different structure . Instead of individual incisors and canine teeth being finely spaced to act like the teeth of a comb , the biting edge of the four incisors have become serrated with as many as 15 tines each , while the canine acts more like a molar . These serrated incisors are kept clean using the front of the tongue , which is serrated to match the serrations of the incisors . Similarly , the <unk> toothcomb consists of incisors with multiple tines , called " <unk> " . In contrast to the colugos , the size and shape of the tines are more uniform . 
 The toothcomb of treeshrews is like the lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines , but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are included in the toothcomb and the canines are also excluded . The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger . In the extinct <unk> , all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb . In African antelopes , the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines . 
 = = Functions = = 
 As a homologous structure in lemuriforms , the toothcomb serves variable biological roles , despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance . It is primarily used as a toiletry device or grooming comb . Additionally , some species use their toothcomb for food procurement or to gouge tree bark . 
 = = = Grooming = = = 
 The primary function of the toothcomb , grooming , was first noted by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829 , who pointed out that the ring @-@ tailed lemur ( Lemur catta ) had lower incisors that " sont de <unk> <unk> " ( " are real combs " ) . More than 100 years later , the grooming function was questioned since it was difficult to observe and the interdental spaces were thought to be too small for fur . Observations later showed the teeth were used for that purpose and that immediately after grooming , hair may be found trapped in the teeth , but is removed by the sublingua later . 
 In 1981 , scanning electron microscopy revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs . These grooves were only found on the sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides , as well on the back ridge of the teeth . Between 10 and 20 µm wide , these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth . Inside these grooves were even finer grooves , less than 1 µm , created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair . 
 Among non @-@ primates , the extinct <unk> exhibits microscopic groves on its toothcomb , but the Philippine colugo ( Cynocephalus volans ) does not . The toothcomb of the colugos is generally considered to function as a toothcomb , but due to the lack of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming , its use seems to be limited to food procurement . 
 In African antelopes , the lateral dental grooming apparatus does not appear to be used during grazing or browsing . Instead , it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion . It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites . 
 = = = Olfaction in lemuriforms = = = 
 In lemuriform primates , the toothcomb may also play a secondary role in olfaction , which may account for the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors . The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur . Furthermore , the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth ( <unk> diastema ) that connects the philtrum ( a cleft in the middle of the wet nose , or rhinarium ) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth . This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ . 
 = = = Food procurement and other uses = = = 
 Mouse lemurs ( Microcebus ) , sifakas ( Propithecus ) , and the indri ( Indri ) use their toothcombs to scoop up fruit pulp . Other small lemuriforms , such as fork @-@ marked lemurs ( Phaner ) , the hairy @-@ eared dwarf lemur ( Allocebus ) , and galagos ( particularly the genera <unk> and <unk> ) use their toothcombs to tooth @-@ scrape plant exudates , such as gum and sap . In fork @-@ marked lemurs , the toothcomb is specially adapted to minimize food <unk> since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced . The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement . 
 Indriids such as the sifakas use their toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood ( bark @-@ prising ) , which is done prior to scent @-@ marking with the gland on their chest . The more robust structure of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark @-@ prising . 
 = = Evolution in lemuriforms = = 
 The origins of the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of considerable debate for more than a century . In 1920 , British <unk> Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews ( which he believed were primates ) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms . Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb , he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently . This view was later overturned , and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted . 
 The ancestral condition of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw , based on Eocene primate fossils , suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb . Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb . Collectively , early strepsirrhine primates are known as adapiforms . Adapiforms are considered to be a paraphyletic group ( containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group 's members ) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms . In terms of ecology , the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a folivorous ( leaf @-@ eating ) diet among the ancestral adapiform population , since that would select for reduced incisors , which would serve as an exaptation ( a trait with adaptive value for something other than what it was originally selected for ) , which could then be used for personal or social grooming . However , the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions , since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss . 
 A popular hypothesis about the origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids . In some adapids , the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit , and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb . However , no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene , and the European <unk> lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms . 
 Lemuriforms are currently thought to have evolved in Africa , and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are <unk> from the early Eocene , which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro @-@ Arabian land mass in the Paleocene ( 66 to 55 mya ) . Stem lemuriforms , including Djebelemur and ' Anchomomys ' milleri , have been found in Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms . However , they lack a toothcomb . These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe . Based on large , procumbent lower teeth , Plesiopithecus , a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt , is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms . Together , Djebelemur , ‘ Anchomomys ’ milleri , and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa ( the closest relatives ) of lemuriform primates . 
 = = = Dating inconsistencies = = = 
 Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur may have been contemporaneous with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya , the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40 mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot . This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others , which predict lemur – lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90 @.@ 8 mya . 
 In 2001 , the discovery of Bugtilemur , a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially thought to be a cheirogaleid lemur , further challenged the theory of lemur origins ; however , it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur . 
 The minimum paleontological estimate for the divergence of lemurs and lorisoids nearly doubled when additional discoveries were made in northern Egypt during the 2000s of a stem <unk> ( <unk> ) and a stem or crown lorisoid ( Karanisia ) dating to 37 and 40 mya respectively . Karanisia is the oldest fossil primate to exhibit a distinct lemuriform toothcomb . This , as well as studies of other African adapiforms like ‘ Anchomomys ’ milleri , suggests a more ancient ghost lineage for lemuriforms in Africa . 
 = = = Original function of the lemuriform toothcomb = = = 
 The selective pressure that shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb has been a topic of considerable debate since the 1970s . Evidence can be seen as supporting a grooming function , food procurement function , or both . In the early 1900s , there was less debate . Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur , although prosimian primates ( strepsirrhines and tarsiers ) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate . Grooming — in the form of fur @-@ combing — is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb , and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function . 
 The hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa , such as cheirogaleid lemurs ( particularly fork @-@ marked lemurs and the hairy @-@ eared dwarf lemur ) and galagos , which demonstrate tooth @-@ scraping of plant exudates , as well as sifakas , which practice bark @-@ prising . Each of these were considered " primitive " forms among the living strepsirrhines , suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors . Also , strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized , based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct koala lemurs ( Megaladapis ) . If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior dentition , then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus <unk> ( a type of marmoset ) . 
 In contrast , the grooming hypothesis emphasized that all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming , and long , thin teeth are poorly suited for the mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding . Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding . Supporting this , reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms . Furthermore , the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing . Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role in the use of the toothcomb than food procurement . 
 = Mike Vernon ( ice hockey ) = 
 Michael " Mike " Vernon ( born February 24 , 1963 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender . He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Calgary Flames , Detroit Red Wings , San Jose Sharks and Florida Panthers . He is a two @-@ time Stanley Cup champion , with the Flames in 1989 and the Red Wings in 1997 . He appeared in five NHL All @-@ Star games , was named a second team All @-@ Star in 1989 , shared the William M. Jennings Trophy in 1996 and was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs in 1997 . Vernon won over 300 games in his NHL career . 
 Vernon was a standout goaltender in junior for the Calgary Wranglers of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . He was named both goaltender of the year and most valuable player in 1982 and 1983 . He was loaned to the Portland Winterhawks for the 1983 Memorial Cup and was named the top goaltender of the tournament in leading Portland to the championship . 
 Selected by the Flames in the second round , 56th overall in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft , Vernon began his professional career in 1982 and ended it 20 years later , also in Calgary . The Flames retired his number 30 in 2007 and he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2010 . Vernon represented Canada internationally on two occasions , winning a bronze medal at the 1983 World Junior Championship and silver at the 1991 World Championship .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 A native of Calgary , Vernon played his junior hockey in his hometown . First for the Calgary Canucks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League in 1979 – 80 , and then the Calgary Wranglers of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . He appeared in 59 games in his first WHL season , 1980 – 81 , posting a 33 – 17 – 1 record before leading the team to the WHL finals where the Wranglers lost the best @-@ of @-@ seven championship to the Victoria Cougars , 4 games to 3 . He attracted the attention of the Calgary Flames , who selected him with their third round pick , 56th overall , at the 1981 NHL Entry Draft . 
 Vernon returned to the Wranglers for the 1981 – 82 season where he posted a 22 – 14 – 3 record with three shutouts . He was named a WHL all @-@ star at goal , and was the recipient of the Del Wilson Trophy as top goaltender and named WHL most valuable player . Though the Wranglers were eliminated in the playoffs , junior rules of the time allowed the league champion to add an extra goaltender on loan for the Memorial Cup tournament . Vernon accepted an invitation to join the Portland Winter Hawks for the 1982 tournament where the team finished fourth in the four team event . Vernon made his professional debut following the tournament , appearing in one playoff game for the Central Hockey League 's Oklahoma City Stars . 
 He spent a third season with the Wranglers in 1982 – 83 , however injuries during the season to Reggie Lemelin and Don Edwards forced the Flames to recall him to the NHL . Vernon made his NHL debut on December 12 , 1982 , against the Detroit Red Wings . A poor effort by the Flames resulted in Vernon surrendering six goals in the first two periods before being pulled in a 7 – 3 loss . Vernon appeared in one additional game , also a loss , before returning to the WHL where he repeated as the league 's top goaltender and most valuable player . Vernon also played with the Canadian team at the 1982 World Junior Championship , winning two games in three appearances and helping Canada win the bronze medal . 
 Vernon again joined the Winter Hawks , for the 1983 Memorial Cup , but not without controversy . The WHL champion Lethbridge Broncos first requested he join their team for the tournament , but he was unwilling to play under the team 's coach and refused . The Broncos were upset by Vernon 's refusal , calling it " garbage " that he was allowed to join the rival Winter Hawks , who were hosting the tournament , after turning them down . Winning all three games he started , Vernon led Portland to the championship . He was named recipient of the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy as the most valuable goaltender of the tournament while the Winter Hawks became the first American team to win the Memorial Cup . 
 = = = Calgary Flames = = = 
 Turning professional in 1982 – 83 , Vernon spent most of the season with the CHL 's Colorado Flames where he was named to the league 's second all @-@ star team after posting a 30 – 13 – 2 record in 46 games . He returned to the Flames in 1983 @-@ 84 but had a loss so he returned to the CHL . Considered at that point to be Calgary 's goaltender of the future , he moved up to the Moncton Golden Flames of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) for 1984 – 85 . The season was a disappointment for Vernon as he struggled throughout the year . He won only 10 of 41 starts and posted a goals against average ( GAA ) of 3 @.@ 94 . Vernon began the 1985 – 86 season as the fourth goaltender on the Flames ' depth chart behind Lemelin , Marc D 'Amour and Rick <unk> . He split the first half of the season between Moncton in the AHL and the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the International Hockey League ( IHL ) . 
 In the midst of what was ultimately a franchise record losing streak , wishing to rest Lemelin and facing a minor injury to backup Marc D 'Amour , the Flames brought Vernon up to play an exhibition game against Soviet club Dynamo Moscow during the 1986 Super Series . Vernon was outstanding in goal , leading the Flames to a 4 – 3 victory . Following a 9 – 1 loss to the Hartford Whalers that was Calgary 's 11th consecutive defeat , Vernon was given his first regular season start on January 9 , 1986 , against the Vancouver Canucks . He led the team to a 5 – 4 overtime victory to end the streak . It was also Vernon 's first NHL win . He recorded his first career shutout , also against Vancouver , on February 26 in a 4 – 0 win during a stretch where Vernon went two months without losing in which he started . 
 Three of Vernon 's nine regular season wins came against the Winnipeg Jets , Calgary 's first round opponent in the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs . Though he had only 21 @-@ games of NHL experience , Vernon was named the starter for the series . He led the Flames to a three @-@ game sweep of Winnipeg , followed by seven @-@ game series victories over the Oilers and St. Louis Blues to lead the Flames into the Stanley Cup Final where the Flames ultimately fell to the Montreal Canadiens and their rookie goaltender Patrick Roy in five games . 
 Vernon solidified his position as the Flames ' starting goaltender in 1986 – 87 , finishing third in the NHL with 30 wins . His 39 wins the following season was second in the league , one behind Grant Fuhr . He played in the 1988 All @-@ Star Game , his first of four consecutive appearances in the event , and helped the Flames win the Presidents Trophy as the top team in the regular season . The Flames were upset by the Oilers in the playoffs , however . 
 The 1988 – 89 season was one of Vernon 's finest . He led all NHL goaltenders in wins with 37 and was second with a 2 @.@ 65 GAA . He was named to the second All @-@ Star Team and helped Calgary post the best record in the League . He finished second to Roy in voting for the Vezina Trophy as the league 's top goaltender . The Flames entered the 1989 playoffs as heavy favourites to defeat Vancouver in the opening round , but the Canucks forced Calgary to a seventh and deciding game in the series . The game went to overtime , during which Vernon was forced to make a spectacular glove save on a Stan Smyl breakaway . That save came to be a defining moment of Vernon 's career , and was later called " the save that won the Cup " . The Flames defeated Vancouver when Joel Otto scored the winner , then went on to defeat the Los Angeles Kings , Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens to win Calgary 's first Stanley Cup championship . 
 Vernon remained among the NHL leaders in wins the following seasons , finishing 6th in 1989 – 90 with 23 and 2nd in 1990 – 91 with 31 . He was voted to the starting lineup for both the 1990 and 1991 All @-@ Star Games via fan balloting . He served as the backup goaltender for Team Canada at the 1991 World Championship , and though he lost both games he appeared in , Vernon and the Canadians won the silver medal . Despite his success with the Flames , Vernon was often criticized for letting in weak goals , and was routinely booed by the fans in Calgary when he did so . Some fans chose to direct insults towards his family in the stands , causing his parents to stop attending games . Discussing his relationship with Flames fans later in his career , Vernon remarked : " You 've got to have a pretty thick skin to play goal . Fans at hockey games get very emotional . They 're very passionate . They don 't enjoy watching their team give up goals . " 
 He also battled through recurring back problems that occasionally forced him out of the lineup . Playing through it all , Vernon became the 38th goaltender in league history to win 200 games , reaching the milestone on November 14 , 1992 , against the Tampa Bay Lightning . He played in his fifth All @-@ Star Game in 1992 – 93 , and was named to play his sixth the following season but had to withdraw due to a knee injury . After nearly ten seasons with Vernon as Calgary 's starting goaltender , the Flames felt it was time to hand the starting goaltender duties to Trevor Kidd . On June 29 , 1994 , they traded Vernon to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for defenceman Steve Chiasson . The Red Wings had been pursuing a deal for Vernon since the previous season . 
 = = = Detroit , San Jose and Florida = = = 
 Detroit anticipated that the veteran Vernon would help develop their young goaltender Chris Osgood . As Detroit 's top goaltender in 1994 – 95 , Vernon posted a 19 – 6 – 4 record and helped the Red Wings win the Presidents Trophy as the top regular season team . The Red Wings reached the 1995 Stanley Cup Final – their first appearance in the championship series since 1966 – but were swept in four games by the New Jersey Devils . Vernon and the Red Wings struggled to agree on a new contract following the season . Their dispute went to arbitration after Vernon and his agent accepted an offer of a two @-@ year , US $ 5 @.@ 45 million contract that the team claimed to have withdrawn . The arbitrator sided with the Red Wings , making Vernon an unrestricted free agent . The two sides ultimately agreed on a two @-@ year contract , of which the financial terms were not released . 
 While Osgood began to establish his position as the Red Wings ' starter in 1995 – 96 , Vernon won 21 games against only 7 regulation losses as the Red Wings set an NHL record with 62 victories in the regular season . Vernon and Osgood shared the William M. Jennings Trophy as the goaltending duo on the team with the fewest goals against . Vernon was the backup goaltender to Osgood during the 1996 – 97 season , but became the 13th player in NHL history to win 300 games . He reached the milestone on March 26 , 1997 , against the Colorado Avalanche in a game in which he also fought Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy . 
 Head coach Scotty Bowman turned to the veteran Vernon as the team 's starter in the 1997 Stanley Cup Playoffs after Osgood struggled late in the regular season . He recorded a 16 – 4 record with a <unk> in the post @-@ season , and was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs as Detroit won its first Stanley Cup championship in 42 years . Placed in a position where the Red Wings had to trade a goaltender due to the waiver draft , Detroit chose to trade Vernon to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for two draft picks on August 18 , 1997 . 
 Vernon played two full seasons with the Sharks , winning 30 games in 1997 – 98 and leading the team to the post @-@ season in both 1998 and 1999 . However , he was supplanted by Steve Shields as the Sharks 's top goaltender early in the 1999 – 2000 season and on December 30 , 1999 , was traded to the Florida Panthers along with a draft pick in exchange for Radek Dvorak . Vernon appeared in 34 games with the Panthers , winning 18 , and led them to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons . Following the season , he was claimed by the Minnesota Wild in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft on June 23 , 2000 , but was immediately traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Dan Cavanaugh and an eighth round selection in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft . 
 = = = Return to Calgary = = = 
 Returning to the franchise he began his career with , the 37 @-@ year @-@ old Vernon was expected to split goaltending duties with Fred Brathwaite . He played in 41 games in 2000 – 01 , winning 12 games , losing 23 and posting a 3 @.@ 23 GAA . He appeared in 18 games in 2001 – 02 , and though his GAA improved to 2 @.@ 76 , he won only two . Vernon left the game following the season , announcing his retirement on September 13 , 2002 . Vernon retired seventh all time in regular season wins with 385 , fourth among goalies in playoff appearances at 138 and fifth in playoff wins with 77 . He played in four Stanley Cup finals , winning two championships . 
 He held virtually every Flames franchise goaltending record upon his retirement . His regular season records : games played ( 526 ) , wins ( 262 ) and minutes played ( 29 @,@ 650 ) have all subsequently been broken by Miikka Kiprusoff , but he remains the team leader in playoff games played ( 81 ) and wins ( 43 ) . The Flames honoured Vernon on February 6 , 2007 , retiring his # 30 jersey . He was the second player in franchise history , after Lanny McDonald to have his number retired . He was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2010 . Vernon returned to the ice 2011 to play in the alumni game at the Heritage Classic outdoor game . 
 Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Glenn Hall considered Vernon one of the best goaltenders of his era : " I always thought Grant Fuhr was the best goalie of his time . But I always thought <unk> was very close . " Vernon said that playing against the likes of Fuhr and Roy led him to improve at his position . He was a stand @-@ up goaltender early in his career , but learned to adopt aspects of the butterfly style after watching them play . Standing only 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) tall , he relied on speed and reflexes to be a successful goaltender in the NHL .

 Vernon was born February 24 , 1963 , in Calgary . His father Martin worked in construction and was president of the South Calgary community hockey organization where young Mike played his youth hockey .

He was always a goaltender , often joining his father for practices by the age of 4 and always focusing on the goaltenders . He considered his mother , Lorraine , his first coach and claimed his introduction to goaltending came from his family : " I had three brothers and when it came time to play hockey , they always said the same thing : ' Get Mikey , he ’ ll play net .

 = Early Netherlandish painting = 
 Early Netherlandish painting refers to the work of artists , sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives , active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th- and 16th @-@ century Northern Renaissance ; especially in the flourishing cities of Bruges , Ghent , Tournai and Brussels . Their work follows the International Gothic style and begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the early 1420s . It lasts at least until the death of Gerard David in 1523 , although many scholars extend it to the start of the Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 ( Max J. Friedländer 's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder ) . Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but is seen as an independent artistic culture , separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy . Because these painters represent the culmination of the northern European medieval artistic heritage and the incorporation of Renaissance ideals , they are sometimes categorised as belonging to both the Early Renaissance and Late Gothic . 
 The major Netherlandish painters include Campin , van Eyck , Rogier van der Weyden , Dieric Bouts , Petrus Christus , Hans Memling , Hugo van der Goes and Hieronymus Bosch . These artists made significant advances in natural representation and illusionism , and their work typically features complex iconography . Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits , with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare . Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century . The painted works are generally oil on panel , either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of diptychs , triptychs or polyptychs . The period is also noted for its sculpture , tapestries , illuminated manuscripts , stained glass and carved retables . 
 The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe , when the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe , noted for its crafts and luxury goods . Assisted by the workshop system , panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls . A majority were destroyed during waves of iconoclasm in the 16th and 17th centuries ; today only a few thousand examples survive . Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid @-@ 19th century and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid @-@ 19th century . Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions , studying iconography , and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists ' lives . Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated . 
 Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th and 20th @-@ century art history , and was a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century : Max J. Friedländer ( From Van Eyck to <unk> and Early Netherlandish Painting ) and Erwin Panofsky ( Early Netherlandish Painting ) . 
 = = Terminology and scope = = 
 The term " Early Netherlandish art " applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries in the northern European areas controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy and later the Habsburg dynasty . These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style . In this political and art @-@ historical context , the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France , Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands . 
 The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms . " Late Gothic " is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the art of the Middle Ages . In the early 20th century the artists were variously referred to in English as the " Ghent @-@ Bruges school " or the " Old Netherlandish school " . " Flemish Primitives " is a traditional art @-@ historical term borrowed from the French that became popular after 1902 and remains in use today , especially in Dutch and German . In this context , " primitive " does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication , but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting . Erwin Panofsky preferred the term ars nova ( " new art " ) , which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as Guillaume Dufay and Gilles <unk> , who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court . When the Burgundian dukes established centres of power in the Netherlands , they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook . According to Otto Pächt a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a " revolution took place in painting " ; a " new beauty " in art emerged , one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world . 
 In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality , with Jan van Eyck identified as German and van der Weyden ( born Roger de la Pasture ) as French . Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school 's genesis was in France or Germany . These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I , and following the leads of Friedländer , Panofsky , and Pächt , English @-@ language scholars now almost universally describe the period as " Early Netherlandish painting " , although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct . 
 In the 14th century , as Gothic art gave way to the International Gothic era , a number of schools developed in northern Europe . Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art , and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts . Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th @-@ century manuscript illuminators . They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior <unk> and Robert Campin , the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master , under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship . Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400 , mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois @-@ Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold , Louis I of Anjou and Jean , Duke of Berry . This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes , Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold . The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century , perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting . Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market , and prints , both engravings and woodcuts , found a new mass market , especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer . 
 Following van Eyck 's innovations , the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow , elements usually absent from 14th @-@ century illuminated manuscripts . Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism , which made their content more accessible to viewers , while individual portraits became more evocative and alive . Johan Huizinga said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine , to " fill with beauty " the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments . After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style , not least the rise of Italian art , whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510 , and overtook it some ten years later . Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift : the transporting of a marble Madonna and Child by Michelangelo to Bruges in 1506 , and the arrival of Raphael 's tapestry cartoons to Brussels in 1517 , which were widely seen while in the city . Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north , it in turn had drawn on the 15th @-@ century northern painters , with Michelangelo 's Madonna based on a type developed by Hans Memling . 
 Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of Gerard David in 1523 . A number of mid- and late @-@ 16th @-@ century artists maintained many of the conventions , and they are frequently but not always associated with the school . The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists . In the early 16th century artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions . The painting of the early @-@ 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century , with some painters , following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century , continuing to produce copies of previously painted works . Others came under the influence of Renaissance humanism , turning towards secular narrative cycles , as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes . A full break from the mid @-@ 15th @-@ century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of Northern Mannerism around 1590 . There was considerable overlap , and the early- to mid @-@ 16th @-@ century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style , including naturalistic secular portraiture , the depiction of ordinary ( as opposed to courtly ) life , and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views . 
 = = Chronology = = 
 The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period . This was first seen in manuscript illumination , which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism , perspective and skill in rendering colour , peaking with the Limbourg brothers and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G , to whom the most significant leaves of the Turin @-@ Milan Hours are usually attributed . Although his identity has not been definitively established , Hand G , who contributed c . 1420 , is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother Hubert . According to Georges Hulin de Loo , Hand G 's contributions to the Turin @-@ Milan Hours " constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book , and , for their period , the most astounding work known to the history of art . " 
 Jan van Eyck 's use of oil as a medium was a significant development , allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint . The 16th @-@ century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint ; a claim that , while exaggerated , indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique . Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity , mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly ; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments , and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden . These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters . Their influence was felt across northern Europe , from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south . 
 A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense . Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai . The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael <unk> both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style . Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens , an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471 . The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence , and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent . By the time of van Eyck 's death , his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe . Copies of his works were widely circulated , a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe . Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north . Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus , King of Hungary , who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions . 
 The first generation were literate , well educated and mostly from middle @-@ class backgrounds . Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court , with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary ; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek . A number of artists were financially successful and much sought @-@ after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe . Many artists , including David and Bouts , could afford to donate large works to the churches , monasteries and convents of their choosing . Van Eyck was a valet de chambre at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good . Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property ; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine " <unk> " ( " with the money " ) . <unk> van der <unk> invested in land . 
 The Early Netherlandish masters ' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin , both of whom , working in mid @-@ 15th @-@ century Cologne , drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts . New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up ; Ulm , Nuremberg , Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century . There was a rise in demand for printmaking ( using woodcuts or copperplate engraving ) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy . Some 16th @-@ century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century 's techniques and styles . Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies , such as his reworking of van Eyck 's Madonna in the Church . Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp , often travelling between the cities . He moved to Antwerp in 1505 , when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters ' guild , and the two became friends . 
 By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe . Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck 's precision . Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status ; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists , sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide @-@ ranging influences . Hieronymus Bosch , active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries , remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters . He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature , human existence and perspective , while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences . His better @-@ known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory , drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck 's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych . Bosch followed his own muse , tending instead towards moralism and pessimism . His paintings , especially the triptychs , are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period 
 The Reformation brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes . Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner , with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background . Pieter Bruegel the Elder , one of the few who followed Bosch 's style , is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors . His work retains many 15th @-@ century conventions , but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern . Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological , and his genre scenes were complex , with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism . 
 = = Technique and material = = 
 Campin , van Eyck and van der Weyden established naturalism as the dominant style in 15th @-@ century northern European painting . These artists sought to show the world as it actually was , and to depict people in a way that made them look more human , with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen . This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects ( according to Panofsky they painted " gold that looked like gold " ) , paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light , shadow and reflection . They moved beyond the flat perspective and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three @-@ dimensional pictorial spaces . The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time ; in the Arnolfini Portrait , Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures . Advancements in technique allowed far richer , more luminous and closely detailed representations of people , landscapes , interiors and objects . 
 Although , the use of oil as a binding agent can be traced to the 12th century , innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era . Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s , and while it produces both bright and light colours , it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows . Oil allows smooth , translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses , from fine lines to thick broad strokes . It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet . These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet @-@ on @-@ wet techniques . Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries . Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light , from shadow to bright beams , and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes . This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures ; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery , wooden floors , textiles and household objects . 
 The paintings were most often painted on wood , but sometimes on the less expensive canvas . The wood was usually oak , often imported from the Baltic region , with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp . Typically the sap was removed and the board well @-@ seasoned before use . Wood supports allow for dendrochronological dating , and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist 's location . The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship . Lorne Campbell notes that most are " beautifully made and finished objects . It can be extremely difficult to find the joins . " Many paintings ' frames were altered , repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces . Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems , crests or ancillary outline sketches . In the case of single panels , the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions , or as Campbell speculates , " done for the artist 's amusement " . Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping . Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on . 
 Glue binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil . Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived . Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys ' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine ( c . 1415 – 25 ) and Bouts ' Entombment ( c . 1440 – 55 ) . The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles . The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers , at times to blot or reduce the glaze . 
 = = Guilds and workshops = = 
 The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master 's workshop . Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city 's bounds ; they were regulated by artisan guilds to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions . Guilds protected and regulated painting , overseeing production , export trade and raw material supply ; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters , cloth painters and book illuminators . For example , the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils . Overall , panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection , with cloth painters ranking below . 
 Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers . A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region , and show proof of citizenship , which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase . Apprenticeship lasted four to five years , ending with the production of a " masterpiece " that proved his ability as a craftsman , and the payment of a substantial entrance fee . The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system . Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership , it was a self @-@ governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants . Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings , most famously in van der Weyden 's Descent from the Cross , in which Christ 's body is given the t @-@ shape of a crossbow to reflect its commission for a chapel for the Leuven guild of archers . 
 Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices . The masters usually built up inventories of pre @-@ painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale . With the former , the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting , and typically painted the focal portions , such as the faces , hands and the embroidered parts of the figure 's clothing . The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants ; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style , with the relatively weak <unk> passage in van Eyck 's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych being a better @-@ known example . Often a master 's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works , and the design of new compositions arising from commissions . In this case , the master would usually produce the underdrawing or overall composition to be painted by assistants . As a result , many surviving works that evidence first @-@ rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers . 
 = = Patronage = = 
 By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries ' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy . The early to mid @-@ century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth , leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art . Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast , the north German and Polish regions , the Iberian Peninsula , Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland . At first , masters had acted as their own dealers , attending fairs where they could also buy frames , panels and pigments . The mid @-@ century saw the development of art dealership as a profession ; the activity became purely commercially driven , dominated by the mercantile class . 
 Smaller works were not usually produced on commission . More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members . Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs , or the buyers could visit workshops , which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities . The masters were allowed to display in their front windows . This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials , clergy , guild members , doctors and merchants . 
 Less expensive cloth paintings ( <unk> ) were more common in middle @-@ class households , and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings . Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels , containing specified subject matter . Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern , to the inclusion of a donor portrait . The addition of coats @-@ of @-@ arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden 's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin , which exists in several variations . 
 Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste . Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great @-@ uncles including John , Duke of Berry by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks . The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts , gold @-@ edged tapestries and jewel @-@ bordered cups . Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s . While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals , they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art . A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the " excellent work that he does in his craft " . Jan van Eyck painted the Annunciation while in Philip 's employ , and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke 's portrait painter in the 1440s . 
 Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries . Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence . Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists , such as Bouts ' Justice for Emperor Otto III , van der Weyden 's The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald and David 's Justice of Cambyses . Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative , but they brought notice to and increased a painter 's reputation , as with Memling , whose St John Altarpiece for Bruges ' Sint @-@ <unk> brought him additional civic commissions . 
 Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants . Although first @-@ rank painters such as Petrus Christus and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility , they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges . Painters not only exported goods but also themselves ; foreign princes and nobility , striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court , hired painters away from Bruges . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references . Van Eyck pioneered , and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden , Memling and Christus . Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals . Morally the works express a fearful outlook , combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism . The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly . Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time , iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate . 
 Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps " the most important aspect of early Flemish art " . The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic . Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements , often conveying what he saw as a co @-@ existence of the spiritual and material worlds . The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively ; typically the references comprised small but key background details . The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and " was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation . " Van Eyck 's religious paintings in particular " always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality " . To him the day @-@ to @-@ day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism , such that , according to Harbison , " descriptive data were rearranged ... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth . " This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck 's belief that the " essential truth of Christian doctrine " can be found in " the marriage of secular and sacred worlds , of reality and symbol " . He depicts overly large Madonnas , whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly , but placed them in everyday settings such as churches , domestic chambers or seated with court officials . 
 Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols . A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers ( for example in the Lucca Madonna ) . More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial . Van Eyck 's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent . The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing , while much of the iconography reflects the idea that , according to John Ward , there is a " promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth " . 
 Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner , despite van Eyck 's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists . Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms ; unlike van Eyck , he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism . Campin 's symbols do not alter the sense of the real ; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography , but one the viewer would recognise and understand . Van der Weyden 's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin 's but not as dense as van Eyck 's . According to Harbison , van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully , and in such an exquisite manner , that " Neither the mystical union that results in his work , nor his reality itself for that matter , seems capable of being rationally analyzed , explained or reconstructed . " His treatment of architectural details , niches , colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that " the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly , jarringly , become symbols with religious truth . " 
 Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them . Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation , while the very wealthy could also build churches ( or extend existing ones ) , or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife . Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced , and original designs were widely copied and exported . Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century , of which the Cambrai Madonna is probably the best known . In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re @-@ developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition . 
 Marian devotion grew from the 13th century , mostly forming around the concepts of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven . In a culture that venerated the possession of relics as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine , Mary left no bodily relics , thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity . By the early 15th century , Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God . It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth . The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century , an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness . From the mid 15th century Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows . 
 Those who could afford to commissioned donor portraits . Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych , or later as a more affordable diptych . Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half @-@ length Marian portraits . These echoed the " miracle @-@ working " Byzantine icons then popular in Italy . The format became extremely popular across the north , and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych . 
 = = Formats = = 
 Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings , their output includes a variety of formats , including illuminated manuscripts , sculpture , tapestries , carved retables , stained glass , brass objects and carved tombs . According to art historian Susie Nash , by the early 16th century the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture , " with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them " . The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and metalwork , which are well recorded in surviving documentation , while demand for panel paintings is less evident – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts . Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power , whereas portraits were less favoured . According to Maryan Ainsworth , those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession , such as van der Weyden 's portrait of Charles the Bold ; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck 's lost Portrait of Isabella of Portugal . 
 Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces , for churches , hospitals , and convents , and for wealthy clerics and private donors . The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings . Artists often worked in more than one medium ; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts . Van der Weyden designed tapestries , though few survive . The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations , including the advancement of the diptych format , the conventions of donor portraits , new conventions for Marian portraits , and , through works such as van Eyck 's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and van der Weyden 's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin in the 1430s , laying the foundation for the development of landscape painting as a separate genre . 
 = = = Illuminated manuscript = = = 
 Before the mid @-@ 15th century illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting , and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth , status and taste of their owners . Manuscripts were ideally suited as diplomatic gifts or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions . From the 12th century specialist monastery @-@ based workshops ( in French <unk> ) produced books of hours ( collections of prayers to be said at canonical hours ) , psalters , prayer books and histories , as well as romance and poetry books . At the start of the 15th century Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market . Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable , single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours . These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to " include as many pictures as they could afford " , which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of indulgence . The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts ; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer , as seen in Christus ' 1450 – 60 panel Portrait of a Young Man , now in the National Gallery , which shows a small leaf with text to the Vera icon illustrated with the head of Christ . The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid @-@ 15th century by masters in Ghent , Bruges and Utrecht . English production , once of the highest quality , had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps . The French masters did not give up their position easily however , and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists . 
 The Limbourg brothers 's ornate Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination . Later the Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy explored the same mix of illusionism and realism . The <unk> ' career ended just as van Eyck 's began – by 1416 all the brothers ( none of whom had reached 30 ) and their patron Jean , Duke of Berry were dead , most likely from plague . Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed miniatures of the Turin @-@ Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G. A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David , though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers . 
 A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators . Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century , building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries , abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts . There was a strong political aspect ; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean , Duke of Berry and Philip the Good , the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death . According to Thomas Kren , Philip 's " library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince , and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority , his learning and piety " . Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations . The Burgundian book @-@ collecting tradition passed to Philip 's son and his wife , Charles the Bold and Margaret of York ; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I ; and to his son @-@ in @-@ law , Edward IV , who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts . The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library . 
 Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market , designing many works specifically for the English market . Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477 , the export market became more important . <unk> responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites , including Edward IV of England , James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of <unk> . 
 There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination ; van Eyck , van der Weyden , Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures . In addition , miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings ; Campin 's work was often used as a source in this way , for example in the " Hours of Raoul d 'Ailly " . Commissions were often shared between several masters , with junior painters or specialists assisting , especially with details such as the border decorations , these last often done by women . The masters rarely signed their work , making attribution difficult ; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost . 
 Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries ; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space . They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript : border , miniature and text . An example is the Nassau book of hours ( c . 1467 – 80 ) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy , in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects . These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted , as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures . This technique was continued by , among others , the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland ( possibly Gerard <unk> ) , known for his innovative page layout . Using various illusionistic elements , he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border , frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes . 
 During the early 19th century , the collection of 15th and 16th century Netherlandish cut @-@ out , as miniatures or parts for albums became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young <unk> , leading to the destruction of many manuscripts . Originals were highly sought after , a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century . 
 = = = Tapestry = = = 
 During the mid @-@ 15th century tapestry was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe . Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century , especially in the cities of Arras , Bruges and Tournai . The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that , in 1517 , Pope Julius II sent Raphael 's cartoons to Brussels to be woven into hangings . Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts , especially in their larger format ; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the Congress of Arras in 1435 , where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around ( tout autour ) with tapestries showing scenes of the " Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege " . At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York 's wedding the room " was hung above with draperies of wool , blue and white , and on the sides was <unk> with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece " . Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries , such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from The Romance of the Rose . For about two centuries , during the Burgundian period , master weavers produced " innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread , the like of which the world had never seen . " 
 The practical use of textiles results from their portability ; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies . Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories , in which they are typically found at the top of the record , then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring . White and gold were considered of the highest quality . Charles V of France had 57 tapestries , of which 16 were white . Jean de Berry owned 19 , while Mary of Burgundy , Isabella of Valois , Isabeau of Bavaria and Philip the Good all held substantial collections . 
 Tapestry production began with design . The designs , or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment , put together by qualified painters , then sent to weavers , often across a great distance . Because cartoons could be re @-@ used , craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old . As both paper and parchment are highly perishable , few of the original cartoons survive . Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers . <unk> were active in all the major Flemish cities , in most of the towns and in many of the villages . 
 <unk> were not controlled by the guilds . Dependent on a migrant workforce , their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs , who were usually painters . The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons , hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool , silk , and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported . The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron , and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages . This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management ; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by <unk> de Laon having earlier approved the designs , to de Laon 's – and presumably his commissioner 's – considerable embarrassment . 
 Because tapestries were designed largely by painters , their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting . This is especially true with the later generations of 16th @-@ century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell . Harbison describes how the intricate , dense and overlaid detail of Bosch 's Garden of Earthly Delights resembles , " in its precise symbolism ... a medieval tapestry " . 
 = = = Triptychs and altarpieces = = = 
 Northern triptychs and polyptychs were popular across Europe from the late 14th century , with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century . During the 15th century they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting . Preoccupied with religious subject matter , they come in two broad types : smaller , portable private devotional works , or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings . The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting , usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus . 
 <unk> were produced by the more accomplished masters . They provide greater scope for variation , and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time . That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose ; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels . The Ghent Altarpiece , completed in 1432 , had different configurations for weekdays , Sundays and church holidays . 
 The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th @-@ century Italian altarpieces . The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid . In central panels the mid @-@ ground was populated by members of the Holy Family ; early works , especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions , were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background . The wings usually contain a variety of angels , donors and saints , but there is never direct eye contact , and only rarely a narrative connection , with the central panel 's figures . Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions , but subverted them almost from the start . Van der Weyden was especially innovative , as apparent in his 1442 – 45 Miraflores Altarpiece and c . 1452 Braque Triptych . In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels , while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels . From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs , the best of which subverted existing conventions . Bosch 's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape . Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels . 
 Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s , with large @-@ scale export beginning around 1400 . Few of these very early examples survive , but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent . Till @-@ Holger Borchert describes how they bestowed a " prestige which , in the first half of the 15th century , only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving . " By the 1390s , Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges . The popularity of Brussels ' altarpieces lasted until about 1530 , when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour . This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members , a practice Borchert describes as an early form of division of labour . 
 Multi @-@ panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old @-@ fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid @-@ 16th century . Later the iconoclasm of the Reformation deemed them offensive , and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed . Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries . As secular works grew in demand , triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works , especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait . A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure , with the background over @-@ painted so that " it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well @-@ known collection of Dutch 17th @-@ century paintings . "

 Diptychs were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid @-@ 15th to the early 16th century . They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges ( or , less often , a fixed frame ) ; the panels were usually linked thematically . <unk> panels could be opened and closed like a book , allowing both an interior and exterior view , while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images . Originating from conventions in Books of Hours , diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces . Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side . They were usually near @-@ miniature in scale , and some emulated medieval " treasury art " <unk> pieces made of gold or ivory . The tracery seen in works such as van der Weyden 's Virgin and Child reflects ivory carving of the period . The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the House of Valois @-@ Burgundy , and refined by Hugo van der Goes , Hans Memling and later Jan van <unk> . 
 Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes . There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child , reflecting the Virgin 's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion . The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child . The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length , with hands clasped in prayer . The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right , reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the " place of honour " alongside the divine . 
 Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century , when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement – grew in popularity . Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small @-@ scale diptych fitted this purpose . It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany . Ainsworth says that regardless of size , whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych , Netherlandish painting is a " matter of small scale and meticulous detail " . The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the " experience of miraculous visions . "
