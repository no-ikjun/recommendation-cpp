 In 2007 , the Ben Franklin football team made the Class 3A playoffs for the first time in school history . However , the team went on to lose in the first round to Amite High School . 
 = = = Performing arts = = = 
 The music program at Ben Franklin was founded by Peter <unk> , who served as part @-@ time band director and music teacher from 1974 until 1991 . His students included trumpeter Wynton Marsalis , who enrolled concurrently at Ben Franklin and NOCCA . In 2005 , the band room and music lockers at Ben Franklin were flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , destroying the school 's collection of instruments , privately owned instruments left behind by students , and approximately $ 100 @,@ 000 of sheet music . The Tipitina 's Foundation , New Orleans Music Exchange , Mr. Holland 's Opus Foundation , and P.S. 54 Charles W Leng School were among the contributors who helped the music program continue . Student musicians in the concert band and string orchestra participate annually in the Louisiana Music Educator 's Association ( LMEA ) State Festivals , where they often collect " Superior " ratings . 
 Franklin also has a theater program . In March 2008 , Franklin theater students were able to conduct a mixed @-@ media performance of James Still 's " And Then They Came for Me : Remembering the World of Anne Frank " with Holocaust survivor / author Eva Schloss in attendance . The play was co @-@ sponsored by the National World War II Museum and coincided with Schloss ' lecture at the museum .

 Franklin also has a TV station for students known as <unk> . Ben Franklin publications include The Riverbend Review ( literary magazine ) , and The Franklin Falcon ( yearbook ) . The Riverbend Review , published since 1987 , has received numerous awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association and the American Scholastic Press Association , winning a Silver Crown and First Place classification in 2008 and a Gold Crown and First Place with Special Merit classification in 2009 . The Spring 2008 volume featured student poetry , short stories , original art , and an interview with writer Andrei Codrescu .

 The class of 2006 was the subject of an online documentary called Yearbook 2006 , created by <unk> interactive and produced by Josh Goldblum , Josh Cogan , and David Lee . The non @-@ profit Web @-@ based project features 140 minutes of raw interviews as well as photographs and other multimedia designed to capture the lives of about 30 Franklin seniors after Katrina . The project , featured in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 's Spirit of Recovery conference and USA Today , was designed to “ give a cohesive and layered forum to the fractured voices of those seniors who were displaced and those who remained in New Orleans , aiming to , above all , nurture and heal the vibrant social fabric that Katrina threatened to destroy . ” 
 = = Accusations of bias in admissions = = 
 The school 's selective admissions policies have led to accusations of bias . Before Hurricane Katrina , it was estimated that 450 of 800 applicants on average were not accepted because of insufficient grades and test scores . Compared to the rest of the city , the school has a disproportionately low percentage of African Americans . Carl <unk> , a local activist , claimed in 1996 that Franklin 's admissions tests are culturally biased against black students . Following Katrina , the school converted to a charter school and preserved its selective admissions system . The school has received praise for traditionally producing some of the " highest @-@ performing students in the entire state of Louisiana , " including an exceptional number of students awarded by the National Achievement Scholarship Program of the National Merit Scholarship Corporation , a program open only to African Americans .

 Benjamin Franklin High School has appeared in film , books , and other media . In a short play that appears in New Orleans novelist Walker Percy 's Lost in the Cosmos , the lead character attends Franklin . 
 Portions of the school 's atrium and front entrance were used in the 2004 Disney Channel movie Stuck in the Suburbs . The school was also used for portions of the 2005 Lifetime Television movie Odd Girl Out . 
 In Julie Smith 's mystery novel Louisiana Hotshot , murder victim Rhonda Bergeron is said to have graduated from Ben Franklin High School in New Orleans . In Ronald Everett Capps ' novel Off Magazine Street ( loosely adapted into the film A Love Song for Bobby Long ) , Byron Burns decides to send Hanna to Benjamin Franklin High School , a school " he had heard had a fair reputation .

 = 1922 – 23 Nelson F.C. season = 
 The 1922 – 23 season was the 42nd season in the history of Nelson F.C. and their second as a professional club in the Football League . After finishing 16th in their inaugural Third Division North campaign in 1921 – 22 , the team performed well above expectations under the guidance of player @-@ manager David Wilson and went on to win the league title . The championship was secured with a 2 – 0 win over Wrexham on 24 April 1923 . Nelson ended the season on 51 points , with a record of 24 wins , three draws and 11 defeats in 38 matches . 
 Nelson entered the FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round , in which they defeated Rochdale . However , they were knocked out by Stalybridge Celtic in the next round . A total of 19 players were used by Nelson in their 40 first @-@ team matches , only six of whom had played for the club in the previous season . Bob Hutchinson and Ernie Braidwood , both new signings , played every league and cup match . With 23 goals in 36 appearances , Joe Eddleston was the team 's top goalscorer for the second season in succession . The highest attendance of the season at the club 's Seedhill stadium was 12 @,@ 000 on two occasions , the first of these the win over Chesterfield on 10 March 1923 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1921 – 22 season , Nelson had played as a professional club in the Football League for the first time , following the restructuring of the league to introduce North and South divisions . Former Scotland international David Wilson remained player @-@ manager of the first @-@ team for the second consecutive season after guiding them to a 16th @-@ placed finish in the previous campaign . Prior to the start of the season , the team did not play any friendly matches , meaning that the team 's last competitive match was the 0 – 0 draw with Tranmere Rovers on 6 May 1921 . The only warm @-@ up for the campaign was a practice match between two teams made up of Nelson players . The Nelson Leader reported that this match was satisfying , and hoped that it could be " the precursor of fine sport in the coming season " . Before the 1922 – 23 season , Nelson 's only previous title @-@ winning campaign was their Lancashire League championship in 1895 – 96 . 
 There were a number of first @-@ team personnel changes from the previous campaign , with only six first @-@ team players staying at the club . Centre forward Joe Eddleston , Nelson 's top scorer in 1921 – 22 with 16 league goals , remained along with Clement Rigg , Sid Hoad and Bob Lilley . Scottish defenders John Steel and James Price also continued to play for Nelson . Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews , who joined Bury , and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan , who retired from professional football . Goalkeepers Harry Heyes and Robert Bruce both moved on in the close season , so Stockport County custodian Joseph Birds was signed as a replacement in June 1922 . In an attempt to improve the attacking prowess at the club , Wilson signed experienced inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme on a free transfer from Darlington in May 1922 , and Scottish forward Mike McCulloch arrived from Heart of Midlothian for a transfer fee of £ 150 . Wilson also added to the defensive ranks with the signings of his former Oldham Athletic team @-@ mate Ernie Braidwood , and of Jimmy Broadhead on a free transfer from Scunthorpe & Lindsey United .

 = = Football League Third Division North = = 
 Nelson 's league campaign started on 26 August 1922 with an away fixture at Bradford Park Avenue , who had been relegated from the Football League Second Division in the previous season . In the highest scoring match of the day , Nelson lost the match 2 – 6 before a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 who witnessed Joe Eddleston score his first goal of the season . Bradford Park Avenue were again the opponents the following week for Nelson 's first home game of the campaign and the match was won 1 – 0 by the host side courtesy of a Mike McCulloch goal . Eddleston 's second goal of the campaign secured another 1 – 0 victory , this time against Stalybridge Celtic , at Seedhill on 9 September 1922 to send the team seventh in the table after three matches . A third successive home fixture saw Nelson win 2 – 0 against Halifax Town with two goals from Eddleston . Nelson could not follow up their earlier victory over Stalybridge Celtic , falling to a 0 – 2 loss before attaining a fourth win of the campaign against Southport a week later . Another win against Southport , Nelson 's fourth since joining the league in 1921 , meant September ended as it had started with a 1 – 0 win which marked Nelson 's fifth victory and clean sheet of the month . 
 October began with a 1 – 3 defeat away at Ashington , although new signing Arthur Wolstenholme scored his first goal of the campaign , and Nelson 's first ever league goal against the Northumberland club . A 2 – 0 win in the return match with goals from Eddleston and McCulloch took Nelson to the top of the league for the first time in the season the following week , overtaking Wigan Borough at the summit . The month ended with a pair of wins over Tranmere Rovers ; the first a 2 – 0 win on 21 October , and the second a 1 – 0 success a week later thanks to John Black 's first goal in a Nelson jersey . The team failed to score for only the second time in the season in the 0 – 1 away defeat to Barrow on 4 November . Despite conceding at Seedhill for the first time in the campaign , Nelson atoned for the loss seven days later with a 2 – 1 victory as a result of strikes from Eddleston and Wolstenholme . Nelson did not play another league match for two weeks , when they faced Rochdale at home . A first Nelson goal for defender Ernie Braidwood could not prevent the side succumbing to a 1 – 2 reverse , not helped by first @-@ team regulars Wilson and Wolstenholme missing the match due to injury , forcing inexperienced inside @-@ right William Bennett to make his league debut . 
 In spite of suffering their second defeat of November , Nelson remained top of the league going into December . Their first fixture of the month was a home match against mid @-@ table Darlington on 9 December . Nelson won a close match 3 – 2 thanks to another Braidwood strike , followed by Eddleston 's 10th and 11th goals of the campaign . A hat @-@ trick from inside @-@ forward Wolstenholme gave Nelson a 3 – 0 victory against the same team on 23 December in front of a season @-@ low attendance of 3 @,@ 000 at Seedhill . Nelson started the Christmas period with an away game against Halifax Town . Braidwood and Wolstenholme both got on the scoresheet to help the team to a 2 – 2 draw in front of 18 @,@ 000 supporters at The Shay . On 26 December , Nelson faced Hartlepools United , to whom they had conceded 10 goals in two matches in the previous season . Wolstenholme netted for the third game in succession as Nelson claimed their first ever win against the club . However , in the first match of 1923 , Hartlepools United won the return fixture 5 – 1 . Nelson achieved their first win of the new year on 13 January , a 3 – 0 triumph against Rochdale courtesy of an Eddleston hat @-@ trick . Nelson lost 0 – 1 to Lincoln City the following week , the first time they had failed to score in a league fixture for over two months . January came to a conclusion with a 2 – 1 win over the same team , goals from Eddleston and McCulloch giving Nelson the victory . 
 Nelson attained a first ever win against Durham City on 3 February 1923 , and this was followed by a 4 – 0 win over the same side . The win saw Sid Hoad and Bob Hutchinson each net their first of the campaign , and striker Eddleston increase his tally for the season to 19 . A goal by Black was not enough to prevent Nelson 's winning streak come to an end on 17 February with a 1 – 3 defeat away at Wigan Borough . Nelson made up for the loss the following week , exacting a 1 – 0 win over Wigan , with new signing Dick Crawshaw scoring on his Nelson debut . At the beginning of March , Nelson achieved back @-@ to @-@ back victories against Chesterfield , the second a 4 – 0 win which saw a second goal in three games for Crawshaw and two goals from utility man Black , who was playing in an unfamiliar centre @-@ forward role . Nelson took only one point from the next two matches against Crewe Alexandra . The team failed to score in both games , the only time in the season they did so in successive matches . Entering the Easter period , Eddleston 's 20th league goal of the campaign earned Nelson a 1 – 1 draw with Grimsby Town at Seedhill on 31 March . 
 Nelson 's winless streak extended to four games when they lost 1 – 2 away to Wrexham at the start of April , although Crawshaw continued his good vein of goalscoring form , netting his third in seven games . Wolstenholme and Braidwood scored to give Nelson a 2 – 0 win over Grimsby on 7 April , before beating local rivals Accrington Stanley 2 – 1 at Seedhill . After another win against Accrington the following weekend , Nelson went into the home match against Wrexham on 24 April requiring a win to secure the Third Division North championship . Several mill @-@ owners in the town closed their factories early so that supporters could attend the match on time . Over 12 @,@ 000 spectators attended Seedhill and saw Nelson achieve a 2 – 0 victory thanks to first @-@ half strikes from Crawshaw and Eddleston . Player @-@ manager David Wilson claimed he was " the happiest man in Nelson " as his side gained promotion to the Second Division for the first time in their history . The win was followed by a team procession around the town , and the celebrations continued into the next match as the team claimed a third consecutive clean sheet with a 3 – 0 win at home to Walsall . However , the season ended disappointingly for Nelson as they suffered their heaviest defeat of the season , a 0 – 5 loss to Walsall , on 5 May 1923 .

 Statistics 
 = Vitamin = 
 A vitamin is an organic compound and a vital nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts . An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities , and it must be obtained through the diet ; thus , the term " vitamin " is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism . For example , ascorbic acid ( one form of vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans , but not for most other animal organisms . Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems , but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people . 
 By convention the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients , such as dietary minerals , essential fatty acids , or essential amino acids ( which are needed in greater amounts than vitamins ) nor the great number of other nutrients that promote health , and are required less often to maintain the health of the organism . Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present . Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity , not their structure . Thus , each " vitamin " refers to a number of <unk> compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin . Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin " generic descriptor " title , such as " vitamin A " , which includes the compounds retinal , retinol , and four known carotenoids . <unk> by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body , and are sometimes inter @-@ convertible to one another , as well . 
 Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions . Some , such as vitamin D , have hormone @-@ like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism , or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation ( such as some forms of vitamin A ) . Others function as antioxidants ( e.g. , vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C ) . The largest number of vitamins , the B complex vitamins , function as enzyme cofactors ( coenzymes ) or the precursors for them ; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism . In this role , vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups : For example , biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids . They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes , detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules . For example , folic acid may carry methyl , formyl , and methylene groups in the cell . Although these roles in assisting enzyme @-@ substrate reactions are vitamins ' best @-@ known function , the other vitamin functions are equally important . 
 Until the mid @-@ 1930s , when the first commercial yeast @-@ extract vitamin B complex and semi @-@ synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold , vitamins were obtained solely through food intake , and changes in diet ( which , for example , could occur during a particular growing season ) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested . However , vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic @-@ source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives , since the middle of the 20th century . Study of structural activity , function and their role in maintaining health is called <unk> . 
 = = List of vitamins = = 
 Each vitamin is typically used in multiple reactions , and therefore most have multiple functions . 
 = = Health effects = = 
 Vitamins are essential for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism . Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents , a fetus begins to develop , at the moment of conception , from the nutrients it absorbs . It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times . These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things , skin , bone , and muscle . If there is serious deficiency in one or more of these nutrients , a child may develop a deficiency disease . Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage . 
 For the most part , vitamins are obtained with food , but a few are obtained by other means . For example , microorganisms in the intestine — commonly known as " gut flora " — produce vitamin K and biotin , while one form of vitamin D is synthesized in the skin with the help of the natural ultraviolet wavelength of sunlight . Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume . Examples include vitamin A , produced from beta carotene , and niacin , from the amino acid tryptophan . 
 Once growth and development are completed , vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells , tissues , and organs that make up a multicellular organism ; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats , and to help process the proteins , carbohydrates , and fats required for respiration . 
 = = = Supplements = = = 
 In those who are otherwise healthy , there is little evidence that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease . Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals , but they may increase mortality , though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta @-@ carotene supplements can be harmful . While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess . 
 The European Union and other countries of Europe have regulations that define limits of vitamin ( and mineral ) dosages for their safe use as food supplements . Most vitamins that are sold as food supplements cannot exceed a maximum daily dosage . Vitamin products above these legal limits are not considered food supplements and must be registered as prescription or non @-@ prescription ( over @-@ the @-@ counter drugs ) due to their potential side effects . As a result , most of the fat @-@ soluble vitamins ( such as the vitamins A , D , E , and K ) that contain amounts above the daily allowance are drug products . The daily dosage of a vitamin supplement for example cannot exceed 300 % of the recommended daily allowance , and for vitamin A , this limit is even lower ( 200 % ) . Such regulations are applicable in most European countries . 
 Dietary supplements often contain vitamins , but may also include other ingredients , such as minerals , herbs , and botanicals . Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions . In some cases , vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects , especially if taken before surgery , with other dietary supplements or medicines , or if the person taking them has certain health conditions . They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher , and in different forms , than one may ingest through food . 
 = = = Effect of cooking = = = 
 Shown below is percentage loss of vitamins after cooking averaged for common foods such as vegetables , meat or fish . 
 It should be noted however that some vitamins may become more " bio @-@ available " – that is , usable by the body – when steamed or cooked . 
 The table below shows whether various vitamins are susceptible to loss from heat — such as heat from boiling , steaming , cooking etc . — and other agents . The effect of cutting vegetables can be seen from exposure to air and light . Water @-@ soluble vitamins such as B and C seep into the water when a vegetable is boiled . 
 = = = Deficiencies = = = 
 Humans must consume vitamins periodically but with differing schedules , to avoid deficiency . The body 's stores for different vitamins vary widely ; vitamins A , D , and B12 are stored in significant amounts , mainly in the liver , and an adult 's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years , before developing a deficiency condition . However , vitamin B3 ( niacin and <unk> ) is not stored in significant amounts , so stores may last only a couple of weeks . For vitamin C , the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely , from a month to more than six months , depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores . 
 Deficiencies of vitamins are classified as either primary or secondary . A primary deficiency occurs when an organism does not get enough of the vitamin in its food . A secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder that prevents or limits the absorption or use of the vitamin , due to a " lifestyle factor " , such as smoking , excessive alcohol consumption , or the use of medications that interfere with the absorption or use of the vitamin . People who eat a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary vitamin deficiency . In contrast , restrictive diets have the potential to cause prolonged vitamin deficits , which may result in often painful and potentially deadly diseases . 
 Well @-@ known human vitamin deficiencies involve thiamine ( beriberi ) , niacin ( pellagra ) , vitamin C ( scurvy ) , and vitamin D ( rickets ) . In much of the developed world , such deficiencies are rare ; this is due to ( 1 ) an adequate supply of food and ( 2 ) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods ( fortification ) . In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases , some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders . 
 = = = Side @-@ effects = = = 
 In large doses , some vitamins have documented side @-@ effects that tend to be more severe with a larger dosage . The likelihood of consuming too much of any vitamin from food is remote , but overdosing ( vitamin poisoning ) from vitamin supplementation does occur . At high enough dosages , some vitamins cause side @-@ effects such as nausea , diarrhea , and vomiting . When side @-@ effects emerge , recovery is often accomplished by reducing the dosage . The doses of vitamins differ because individual tolerances can vary widely and appear to be related to age and state of health . 
 In 2008 , overdose exposure to all formulations of vitamins and multivitamin @-@ mineral formulations was reported by 68 @,@ 911 individuals to the American Association of Poison Control Centers ( nearly 80 % of these exposures were in children under the age of 6 ) , leading to 8 " major " life @-@ threatening outcomes , but no deaths . 
 = = Pharmacology = = 
 Vitamins are classified as either water @-@ soluble or fat @-@ soluble . In humans there are 13 vitamins : 4 fat @-@ soluble ( A , D , E , and K ) and 9 water @-@ soluble ( 8 B vitamins and vitamin C ) . Water @-@ soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and , in general , are readily excreted from the body , to the degree that urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption . Because they are not as readily stored , more consistent intake is important . Many types of water @-@ soluble vitamins are synthesized by bacteria . Fat @-@ soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids ( fats ) . Because they are more likely to accumulate in the body , they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water @-@ soluble vitamins . Fat @-@ soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis . 
 = = History = = 
 The value of eating a certain food to maintain health was recognized long before vitamins were identified . The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver to a person would help cure night blindness , an illness now known to be caused by a vitamin A deficiency . The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables , and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships ' crews . 
 In 1747 , the Scottish surgeon James Lind discovered that citrus foods helped prevent scurvy , a particularly deadly disease in which collagen is not properly formed , causing poor wound healing , bleeding of the gums , severe pain , and death . In 1753 , Lind published his Treatise on the Scurvy , which recommended using lemons and limes to avoid scurvy , which was adopted by the British Royal Navy . This led to the nickname limey for British sailors . Lind 's discovery , however , was not widely accepted by individuals in the Royal Navy 's Arctic expeditions in the 19th century , where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene , regular exercise , and maintaining the morale of the crew while on board , rather than by a diet of fresh food . As a result , Arctic expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy and other deficiency diseases . In the early 20th century , when Robert Falcon Scott made his two expeditions to the Antarctic , the prevailing medical theory at the time was that scurvy was caused by " tainted " canned food . 
 During the late 18th and early 19th centuries , the use of deprivation studies allowed scientists to isolate and identify a number of vitamins . Lipid from fish oil was used to cure rickets in rats , and the fat @-@ soluble nutrient was called " <unk> A " . Thus , the first " vitamin " bioactivity ever isolated , which cured rickets , was initially called " vitamin A " ; however , the bioactivity of this compound is now called vitamin D. In 1881 , Russian surgeon Nikolai <unk> studied the effects of scurvy at the University of Tartu in present @-@ day Estonia . He fed mice an artificial mixture of all the separate constituents of milk known at that time , namely the proteins , fats , carbohydrates , and salts . The mice that received only the individual constituents died , while the mice fed by milk itself developed normally . He made a conclusion that " a natural food such as milk must therefore contain , besides these known principal ingredients , small quantities of unknown substances essential to life . " However , his conclusions were rejected by his advisor , Gustav von Bunge , even after other students reproduced his results . A similar result by Cornelius <unk> appeared in a Dutch medical journal in 1905 , but it was not widely reported . 
 In East Asia , where polished white rice was the common staple food of the middle class , beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic . In 1884 , Takaki <unk> , a British trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy , observed that beriberi was endemic among low @-@ ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice , but not among officers who consumed a Western @-@ style diet . With the support of the Japanese navy , he experimented using crews of two battleships ; one crew was fed only white rice , while the other was fed a diet of meat , fish , barley , rice , and beans . The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths , while the latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths . This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of beriberi , but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it . That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman , who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent beriberi in the chickens . The following year , Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained " accessory factors " — in addition to proteins , carbohydrates , fats etc . — that are necessary for the functions of the human body . Hopkins and Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for their discoveries . 
 In 1910 , the first vitamin complex was isolated by Japanese scientist <unk> Suzuki , who succeeded in extracting a water @-@ soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it <unk> acid ( later <unk> ) . He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal . When the article was translated into German , the translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient , a claim made in the original Japanese article , and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity . In 1912 Polish @-@ born biochemist Casimir Funk , working in London , isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named " vitamine " . It was later to be known as vitamin B3 ( niacin ) , though he described it as " anti @-@ beri @-@ beri @-@ factor " ( which would today be called thiamine or vitamin B1 ) . Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases , such as rickets , pellagra , coeliac disease , and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins . Max <unk> a friend and reader of Biochemistry at Bristol University reportedly suggested the " vitamine " name ( from " vital amine " ) . ) . The name soon became synonymous with Hopkins ' " accessory factors " , and , by the time it was shown that not all vitamins are amines , the word was already ubiquitous . In 1920 , Jack Cecil Drummond proposed that the final " e " be dropped to deemphasize the " amine " reference , after researchers began to suspect that not all " <unk> " ( in particular , vitamin A ) have an amine component . 
 In 1930 , Paul Karrer elucidated the correct structure for beta @-@ carotene , the main precursor of vitamin A , and identified other carotenoids . Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert Szent @-@ Györgyi 's discovery of ascorbic acid and made significant contributions to the chemistry of flavins , which led to the identification of <unk> . For their investigations on carotenoids , flavins and vitamins A and B2 , they both received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937 . 
 In 1931 , Albert Szent @-@ Györgyi and a fellow researcher Joseph <unk> suspected that " <unk> acid " was actually vitamin C , and gave a sample to Charles Glen King , who proved its anti @-@ scorbutic activity in his long @-@ established guinea pig scorbutic assay . In 1937 , Szent @-@ Györgyi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery . In 1943 , Edward Adelbert <unk> and Henrik Dam were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of vitamin K and its chemical structure . In 1967 , George Wald was awarded the Nobel Prize ( along with Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline ) for his discovery that vitamin A could participate directly in a physiological process . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The term vitamin was derived from " vitamine " , a compound word coined in 1912 by the Polish biochemist Kazimierz Funk when working at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine . The name is from vital and amine , meaning amine of life , because it was suggested in 1912 that the organic micronutrient food factors that prevent beriberi and perhaps other similar dietary @-@ deficiency diseases might be chemical amines . This was true of thiamine , but after it was found that other such micronutrients were not amines the word was shortened to vitamin in English . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Once discovered , vitamins were actively promoted in articles and advertisements in McCall 's , Good Housekeeping , and other media outlets . Marketers enthusiastically promoted cod @-@ liver oil , a source of Vitamin D , as " bottled sunshine " , and bananas as a “ natural vitality food " . They promoted foods such as yeast cakes , a source of B vitamins , on the basis of scientifically @-@ determined nutritional value , rather than taste or appearance . World War II researchers focused on the need to ensure adequate nutrition , especially in processed foods . Robert W. Yoder is credited with first using the term <unk> , in 1942 , to describe the appeal of relying on nutritional supplements rather than on obtaining vitamins from a varied diet of foods . The continuing preoccupation with a healthy lifestyle has led to an obsessive consumption of additives the beneficial effects of which are questionable . 
 = = = Governmental regulation = = = 
 Most countries place dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of foods , not drugs . As a result , the manufacturer , and not the government , has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed . Regulation of supplements varies widely by country . In the United States , a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 . There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements , and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994 . The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements . In 2007 , the US Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Title 21 , part III took effect , regulating GMP practices in the manufacturing , packaging , labeling , or holding operations for dietary supplements . Even though product registration is not required , these regulations mandate production and quality control standards ( including testing for identity , purity and adulterations ) for dietary supplements . In the European Union , the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription . For most vitamins , <unk> standards have been established . In the United States , the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) sets standards for the most commonly used vitamins and preparations thereof . Likewise , monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia ( <unk> ) regulate aspects of identity and purity for vitamins on the European market . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 The reason that the set of vitamins skips directly from E to K is that the vitamins corresponding to letters F – J were either reclassified over time , discarded as false leads , or renamed because of their relationship to vitamin B , which became a complex of vitamins . 
 The German @-@ speaking scientists who isolated and described vitamin K ( in addition to naming it as such ) did so because the vitamin is intimately involved in the coagulation of blood following wounding ( from the German word <unk> ) . At the time , most ( but not all ) of the letters from F through to J were already designated , so the use of the letter K was considered quite reasonable . The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins , as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B @-@ complex . 
 There are other missing B vitamins which were reclassified or determined not to be vitamins . For example , B9 is folic acid and five of the <unk> are in the range B11 through <unk> , forms of other vitamins already discovered , not required as a nutrient by the entire population ( like B10 , PABA for internal use ) , biologically inactive , toxic , or with unclassifiable effects in humans , or not generally recognised as vitamins by science , such as the highest @-@ numbered , which some naturopath practitioners call <unk> and <unk> . There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins ( e.g. Bm ) . There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances , which some sources of the same type number up to D7 . The controversial cancer treatment <unk> was at one point lettered as vitamin B17 . There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q , R , T , V , W , X , Y or Z , nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I , although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type . 
 = = Anti @-@ vitamins = = 
 Anti @-@ vitamins are chemical compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins . For example , avidin is a protein in egg whites that inhibits the absorption of biotin . <unk> is similar to thiamine , vitamin B1 , and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine . 
 = 2011 Team Europcar season = 
 The 2011 season for the Team Europcar cycling team began in January with La Tropicale Amissa Bongo and ended in October with Yukiya Arashiro 's performance in the Japan Cup . It was the team 's twelfth season as a professional cycling team , although its second as a UCI Professional Continental team . Unlike fellow former UCI ProTeams Cofidis , FDJ , and Geox – TMC , they did not seek the status for 2011 , thus in order to compete in any UCI World Tour event , the team had to be invited in advance , by race organizers . 
 The season was one of the best in the team 's history , with 20 victories and a Tour de France with multiple noteworthy performances . Team leader Thomas Voeckler wore the yellow jersey as race leader for ten days ; the second such occurrence of his career , after also leading for ten days in 2004 . Unlike that race , however , Voeckler poised himself as a serious overall contender and took fourth place overall ; the best result by a French rider since 2000 . While he spent most of the Tour riding in Voeckler 's service , Pierre Rolland won one of the marquee stages , up Alpe d 'Huez , eventually finishing 11th overall and winning the young rider classification . 
 Voeckler was one of the more prolific winners of the early season , tallying eight victories in 2011 , the last of them obtained on May 8 . The veteran Frenchman won five stages at four stage races , plus the overall crowns at the Tour du Haut Var and the Four Days of Dunkirk along with the single @-@ day Cholet @-@ Pays de Loire .

 The team had a solid showing at the traditional opener to the French cycling season , the Grand Prix d 'Ouverture La Marseillaise . While FDJ 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway , Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing near the front of the peloton two and a half minutes behind . At Kuurne – Brussels – Kuurne , one of the early @-@ season Belgian races , Chavanel also turned in a sixth place , in a large field sprint . That same day , Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche , coming third in a selective 12 @-@ rider sprint at the front of the race . Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn , coming across the line 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway . 
 On the same weekend as the more prestigious Milan – San Remo , to which the team was not invited , they picked up two wins in single @-@ day races . Veilleux won La <unk> <unk> beating Saur – Sojasun 's Anthony Delaplace in a two @-@ up sprint five seconds ahead of the main field . Chavanel led the field across the line , giving Europcar two out of the three podium spots . That same day , team leader Voeckler won Cholet @-@ Pays de Loire by foiling a field sprint . With 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) left in the race , Voeckler went on the attack . He opened up a ten @-@ second time gap very quickly and just held on to win , having no appreciable gap over the peloton at the finish . Since Cholet @-@ Pays de Loire is a UCI Europe Tour race , Voeckler had to wear the all @-@ white jersey of Europe Tour leader and not the French national champion 's jersey , something which spectators expecting to see the tricolor jersey found absurd . While Voeckler was nonetheless happy to come away with a win , he stressed after the race that it was not Milan – San Remo , and that the victory should be viewed with the proper perspective . 
 In April , Jérôme won <unk> @-@ Bro Léon . He credited the win to advice from teammate Quemeneur , who hails from the area where the race was won , about the roads on which it was run . Also working in Jérôme 's favor was a timely puncture from teammate Hurel . After Hurel got a wheel change , Jérôme had bridged up to him , so Hurel went to work for Jérôme . Jérôme and Will Routley then broke away from two FDJ riders for the final sprint , which Jérôme won with a time gap . Voeckler just missed out on the podium at the Tour du Finistère , finishing in second position of the peloton behind two late attackers for fourth place on the day . In late May , the team had a very strong showing at the Boucles de l <unk> . While Vacansoleil – DCM 's Martijn Keizer rode off with the victory , Team Europcar placed three riders in the top ten and four in the top twelve – Charteau on the podium in third , Gautier in fifth , Gène in seventh , and Veilleux in twelfth . 
 The team also sent squads to Omloop Het Nieuwsblad , Dwars door Vlaanderen , E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke , Gent – Wevelgem , the Route Adélie de Vitré , the Tour of Flanders , the Flèche d <unk> , the Scheldeprijs , Paris – Roubaix , Paris – Camembert , the Brabantse Pijl , the Grand Prix de Denain , and the Grand Prix de <unk> @-@ Morbihan , but finished no higher than 11th in any of these races .

 Cousin took ninth at the <unk> , in fourth position from the peloton behind five breakaway riders . <unk> took fifth in a field sprint at the Châteauroux Classic , behind Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Anthony <unk> . Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest @-@ France . Lampre – ISD 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race , and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him . Though everyone in the peloton had the same time at the finish , Bole , Gerrans , and Voeckler finished just ahead of the main field , in that order to round out the podium . Voeckler also turned in the team 's best ride at the Tour de la Somme , finishing ninth in the field sprint . At the Tour de Vendée , which took place not far from the team 's headquarters , they had two riders take top @-@ ten placings , Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh . 
 The team also sent squads to the Tour du Doubs , the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec , Paris – Brussels , the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal , the Grand Prix de Wallonie , the Grand Prix d 'Isbergues , Binche – Tournai – Binche , Paris – Bourges , Paris – Tours , the Giro del Piemonte , the Giro di Lombardia , and the Japan Cup , but finished no higher than 11th in any of these races .

 Just as they had been in 2010 under their former guise as Bbox Bouygues Telecom – when the team won two stages and the overall classification with Charteau – the team was very successful at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo in Africa . Gène took the team 's first win of the year ( and accordingly , first under their new name ) in stage 2 , the only stage that finished outside the race 's primary host nation of Gabon , winning a field sprint in <unk> in Cameroon . In stage 4 , the event 's defending champion Charteau figured into a winning breakaway . Though he finished 24 seconds back on stage winner Daniel <unk> , he assumed the race leadership . He had a lead of four seconds over the man in second place and seven seconds over the man in third , but a good two minutes over the man in fourth , meaning it was virtually certain that he would at the very least finish on the podium . The next day , Gène added a second sprint win , as most of the field finished together and Charteau retained his advantage in the overall . While the final stage had the potential to shake up the overall standings , with three large groups finishing four seconds after one another , Charteau held on to win the race overall for the second straight year by finishing in the first of these groups . In February , at the Étoile de Bessèges , <unk> won the sprint finish to the race 's titular stage finishing in Bessèges . Later in February , Voeckler won the first stage of the Tour Méditerranéen . He had instigated the morning breakaway with four others , and they stayed away by a margin of three seconds over the fast @-@ charging peloton . Voeckler won the two @-@ day Tour du Haut Var later in February . He finished one second down on Samuel Dumoulin in stage 1 , but in the hillier second stage , he finished 29 seconds clear of any other riders , along with breakaway companion Julien <unk> . He allowed <unk> to take the stage win , knowing that he had the race overall won . The team entered another African race in February , the Tour of South Africa . After winning La Tropicale Amissa Bongo , Charteau was expected to be a top contender for victory , but he broke his collarbone after a stage 1 crash and had to leave the race . The squad did pick up a win , with Gène taking stage 3 from a breakaway sprint , but their best @-@ placed overall finisher was Quemeneur over two minutes down on race champion Kristian House . 
 Voeckler entered Paris – Nice optimistic for results , but with the realization that the stage 6 individual time trial would limit any chances he had on the overall crown . After finishing in the peloton for the first three stages , Voeckler figured into a winning breakaway in stage 4 . He and recently ousted race leader Thomas De Gendt , with two others , broke away just 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) into the stage and stayed away by a margin of 13 seconds over the peloton at the finish . Voeckler won the four @-@ man sprint at the end and took the stage win , as De Gendt had spent all his energies drilling the group to the line in order to get the time gap he needed to retake the race leadership . It was Voeckler 's first career Paris – Nice stage win , after having competed in the race since 2003 . Voeckler lost two minutes in the mountains the next day and any chance at the overall , but he rebounded to win stage 8 from another breakaway . Again joining the morning escape , Voeckler was one of relatively few riders who chose to complete the race by riding a slippery descent of the Col d 'Eze , and stayed out front by 23 seconds over Lampre – ISD 's Diego Ulissi and one minute , 22 seconds over the peloton . He finished the race in 21st place overall . He added a sixth win on the season at the Giro del Trentino . Breaking away with Michele Scarponi on the climb to <unk> <unk> which closed out stage two , Voeckler defeated the Italian in the sprint 25 seconds ahead of the peloton . Upon seeing Scarponi make the juncture to him , he had been careful not to expend too much effort and leave himself fresh for the eventual sprint . Voeckler added further success at the Four Days of Dunkirk . While German sprinter Marcel Kittel won four of the race 's five stages , Voeckler took the one that mattered as far as the overall classification was concerned . He put in a winning attack 20 km ( 12 mi ) from the end of the hilly fourth stage , as the chase group he had been in caught the day 's morning breakaway . He finished safely in the peloton in the final stage the next day , comfortably maintaining his minute @-@ plus lead to win the race overall . 
 The team was successful in stage @-@ hunting at events later in the season . Chavanel took his first win since rejoining the team , and first in three years , at the Circuit de Lorraine , winning a nearly full field sprint . Kern took a strong win at the Critérium du Dauphiné , finishing alone 9 seconds clear of the main field full of some of the best climbers in the world , atop the short , steep climb at Les Gets . The team had been very active in the finale , with Rolland and Voeckler launching attacks in the run into the finish before Kern got clear . The team 's performances on the race 's last day got them the victory in the race 's teams classification as well . Later in June , Turgot won the prologue time trial at the Boucles de la Mayenne , besting Endura Racing 's Alexander Wetterhall by less than a second . The squad won the team award at this race as well . Charteau showed his climbing prowess and cunning in stage 2 at the Route du Sud , outpacing Movistar Team 's Vasil Kiryienka to win alone on a <unk> hilltop in Cauterets . The team did not win any stage at the Tour du Poitou @-@ Charentes , but they did win two jersey classifications , with <unk> taking the mountains classification and Gaudin the sprints . 
 The team also sent squads to the Tour de Langkawi , the <unk> van West @-@ Vlaanderen , the Circuit de la Sarthe , the Tour de Romandie , the Rhône @-@ Alpes Isère Tour , Bayern @-@ Rundfahrt , the Tour de Luxembourg , Paris – Corrèze , the Danmark <unk> , the Tour du Limousin , and the Tour of Britain , but did not achieve a stage win , classification win , or podium finish in any of them .

 As a Professional Continental team , Europcar needed to be selected by the organizers of any of the Grand Tours in order to participate . They were selected to ride the Tour de France , but not the Giro d 'Italia , nor the Vuelta a España . 
 = = = Tour de France = = = 
 The Amaury Sport Organisation announced the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January , much earlier than in past years . Team Europcar had among their number French national champion Voeckler , though he lost that title shortly before the Tour , a de facto national hero after he wore the yellow jersey for ten days in the 2004 Tour de France . Confident of their inclusion , they were indeed among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend . Voeckler was named as the squad leader , with Charteau and Kern his top support riders . Gène was also named to the squad , the first black rider in the Tour 's history . The team started quietly , with no rider finishing near the front of the race on stage 1 at the Mont des Alouettes and 13th of 22 teams in the stage 2 team time trial . The team did not really figure into the sprint finishes that happened early in the Tour , having left their best sprinter Chavanel off the squad for the Tour . Turgot 's eighth place in stage 7 was their highest such finish . 
 Stage 9 was the Tour 's toughest stage to that point , with seven climbs during the 208 km ( 129 @.@ 2 mi ) parcours . Voeckler , who entered the day in 19th place a minute and 29 seconds down in the overall classification , made a high @-@ powered breakaway with Luis León Sánchez , Sandy Casar , Juan Antonio Flecha ( all of them stage winners in one or more previous Tours ) and Johnny Hoogerland . Some 36 km ( 22 mi ) from the finish line , a car from France <unk> sideswiped Flecha and Hoogerland , the two front riders at the time , sending both off their bicycles and Hoogerland crashing into a barbed @-@ wire fence . After a few uncertain minutes while he appeared to want to wait for Flecha and Hoogerland to rejoin them , Voeckler then drove the breakaway hard . With prior race leader Thor Hushovd well back , the yellow jersey was bound to change hands , and Voeckler 's time gap over the main field at the time of Flecha and Hoogerland 's crash made him very likely to be the rider to take it . Voeckler 's efforts left him unable to sprint at the end of the stage , and Sánchez won , but his near four @-@ minute time gap over the peloton gave him the yellow jersey by a minute and 49 seconds over Sánchez and two minutes and 26 seconds against the best @-@ placed overall favorite , Cadel Evans in third place . 
 The overall standings did not change until stage 12 , on Bastille Day , which ended with the hors catégorie climb to Luz <unk> . Voeckler finished ninth on the day , ceding 20 seconds to most of the race 's top overall riders , but still had sufficient time in hand to remain race leader by nearly two minutes . Rolland finished at his side for tenth on the day . Voeckler had said the night before that he expected to lose the jersey on this stage . After the peloton mostly stayed together in stage 13 , popular expectation for stage 14 , including two first @-@ category climbs on course and another hors catégorie climb at the finish ( Plateau de Beille ) , again was for Voeckler to lose the jersey . But he not only retained the jersey , he also finished with the main group of overall favorites , losing time to only three riders and actually putting time into other riders such as Damiano Cunego and Tom Danielson . Voeckler himself again expressed his surprise at his successes , saying " I was very surprised to be with the best riders up the Plateau de Beille climb . I don 't know how far I can go . " Stage 16 ended with a lengthy descent , from the second @-@ category Col de Manse . Voeckler lost time to nearly all the race 's top riders , and expressed after the stage his certainty that he could not win the Tour , but he remained race leader . 
 Stage 18 was undoubtedly the most difficult in the Tour , incorporating three hors catégorie climbs , including the Col du Galibier at the finish ; as such , race organisers defined the stage as the race 's queen stage . When Andy Schleck , who began the day two minutes and 36 seconds behind Voeckler , surged away from the race 's top riders 60 km ( 37 mi ) from the finish and quickly made it to the morning breakaway , it seemed all but certain that he would become the new race leader . While Schleck easily won the stage , Voeckler followed Evans as the Australian made a strenuous pull at the end of the stage to limit his time losses . At the very end , Voeckler lost Evans ' wheel and fell to fifth on the day , two minutes and 21 seconds behind Schleck . Visibly so spent that he could not sit upright on his bicycle after crossing the finish line , Voeckler had retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds . He said afterwards that while he had expected to lose the jersey earlier in the Tour , on this day all the team 's efforts were put into retaining it . Post @-@ race analyses called Voeckler a " survivor " and " astonishing . " 
 With Voeckler having visibly given it everything he had in stage 18 , and another hors catégorie finish looming ( at Alpe d 'Huez ) in stage 19 , he was no longer the favourite to keep the yellow jersey to Paris , as Evans and the Schleck brothers held an advantage over him in the high mountain stages . Though stage 19 was also the Tour 's shortest , Voeckler was indeed dropped between the Col du Galibier ( visited again in stage 19 ) and Alpe d 'Huez , finally ceding the jersey to Schleck . However , the day was still a very good one for the team . On the ascent of the Galibier , Voeckler told Rolland not to work for him any further and to ride his own race , and Rolland rode at or near the front of the race the rest of the day . Together with Spaniards Alberto Contador and Samuel Sánchez as the leading group on Alpe d 'Huez , Rolland rode away from them with 2 @.@ 5 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) to race and took the day 's honors , the first and only stage win for a French rider in this Tour . He also claimed the best young rider white jersey by finishing two minutes the better of Cofidis ' Rein Taaramäe , who had begun the day in the lead in that classification . Voeckler finished 20th on the stage , losing three minutes to most of the other top riders , but this dropped him only to fourth place overall . 
 The stage 20 individual time trial was to be the Tour 's final competitive stage , since its final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial and only competitive at the sprint finish . Voeckler 's position was likely secure , being a minute and 13 seconds behind Evans and a minute and 21 seconds ahead of Damiano Cunego , both time gaps unlikely to be recouped due to Voeckler 's and Cunego 's limited time trial skills . However , Rolland 's position as best young rider remained in play due to his minute and 33 seconds advantage over Taaramäe , and Taaramäe 's time trial abilities well superior to Rolland 's . Rolland rode one of the best time trials of his career to finish 21st . Taaramäe finished tenth , and took back 47 seconds , but it was insufficient to take back the white jersey . Eight of the nine Team Europcar riders completed the Tour , with the lone exception being Kern who had crashed out of stage 5 . Voeckler finished fourth overall and Rolland tenth as the best young rider .

 Midway through the 2010 season , Bouygues Telecom announced that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team , and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad . This was on the proviso that team manager Jean @-@ René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute € 1 million to the team 's budget , but the rest of its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor . At this point in time , the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011 . Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec , Voeckler was complacent about his team 's future , believing his team manager Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor . Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point , but that deadlines were working against him in order for the team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards . 
 After talks with an organisation in Paris , which later turned out to be French multinational oil company Total , Bernaudeau set his sights on another company , a banking group , and at best , rated his team 's chances of survival as " 6 out of 10 " . Voeckler was equally pessimistic about the team 's chances of survival , having stated that the team could not have done any better , than they had in 2010 . Voeckler had also received offers from rival French squads Cofidis and Saur – Sojasun about joining their respective teams , if in the worst @-@ case scenario that Bbox Bouygues Telecom folded . Bernaudeau obtained an extension from the Union Cycliste Internationale , in relation to the registration records for the team , which had to be submitted before 1 October . 
 Ultimately , Voeckler signed a contract with Cofidis on 1 October , which would have only become official if Bbox Bouygues Telecom folded . Voeckler announced a complete U @-@ turn on his move a day later , with preliminary reports from France stating that the team had indeed found a sponsor – on a three @-@ year deal from the 2011 season onwards – and that it was car rental company Europcar that had joined the team as sponsor on the proviso that Voeckler , the French national champion , was part of the team 's roster . The deal was officially confirmed later that day , but the team were no longer eligible to apply for a ProTeam licence due to the delay in finding a sponsor . Bernaudeau sent the team 's dossier to the Union Cycliste Internationale on 4 October , requesting Professional Continental status for another year ; this status was granted in November .

 Lutz Tavern is a bar in the Woodstock neighborhood of Portland , Oregon , in the United States . It was established by the Lutz family in 1947 , who maintained ownership until the business was purchased by the Barisich family in 1954 . Working @-@ class locals and Reed College students frequent the bar , which is known for popularizing the beer Pabst Blue Ribbon .

 = = Description and history = = 
 Lutz Tavern , established in 1947 , is located at <unk> Southeast Woodstock Boulevard in Portland 's Woodstock neighborhood . The Lutz family owned the bar until 1954 , when it was purchased by the Barisich family . Lilias Barisich , who shared ownership with her brothers after their parents handed it over to them , said of the bar and her mother 's operating style : " It 's always been a homey place because my mom would kick people out if they acted different . She 'd tell them they wouldn 't act that way if they were invited to our home for dinner , so there was no call to act like that at the Lutz . " 
 For many years , Lutz attracted a mixture of working @-@ class men and Reed College students . The Portland Mercury said the bar served " cheap swill to blue @-@ collar folks and Reed kids that didn 't mind walking those extra few blocks . " Barisich recalled that " at one time , it was a favorite of concrete workers , city crews and the like . You couldn 't keep the floor clean on a Friday afternoon . Every muddy <unk> in the city was here . " It served beer only , accepted cash only , and offered the " bare minimum of food that the OLCC required " . 
 The crowd became steadily younger over time . In the 1990s , when her parents still operated the bar , Barisich asked if she could sell a case of what was then considered premium beer . She recalled , " I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken 's , which at that time sold for unheard @-@ of price of a buck a bottle . My dad said that people would never pay that much for a bottle of beer , and they 'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn 't sell . " Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful . Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz @-@ Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment . 
 In 1999 , Lutz reportedly served <unk> IPA , Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Widmer Hop Jack and <unk> for $ 2 @.@ 60 per pint , but still offered Blitz and Pabst Blue Ribbon for $ 1 per can . The Oregonian 's John Foyston said of the bar then , " The floor stays cleaner , but the decor remains minimal : beer signs , a pool table , handwritten signs advertising the famous hot pickles ( 60 cents ) and ham sandwiches ( $ 2 ) . " Willamette Week called Lutz a " true dive , but one with outsize influence among bike messengers and other curators of cool " . 
 = = = Pabst Blue Ribbon = = = 
 Though the claim is disputed , Lutz is known nationally for being the origin of Pabst Blue Ribbon 's recent popularity . In 2015 , Willamette Week 's Matthew Singer invited representatives from Lutz and EJ 's , the former bar , strip club , and music venue in northeast Portland which also claims to have re @-@ introduced Pabst , to explain their competing claims . Layne Martin , who managed Lutz from 1994 to 2000 , said : 
 There was this absolute scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs . We were one of the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go , so we could sell them at a really good deal . So we started the PBR dollar @-@ can special . I 'd say it was around 1997 or 1998 . At one point , I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state , if not the country . We got written up in The New York Times about it . We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week . 
 Mike Thrasher , EJ 's talent buyer from 1995 to 1999 , recalled : 
 I started working at EJ 's when it was a strip club in about October 1994 . A couple of the key staff and I convinced the owner we would do better as a rock- ' n ' -roll bar , and decided to launch the new format on Jan. 1 , 1995 . As a future rock club , we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to suit that clientele . While comparing the prices of the domestic beers , we found that Pabst was cheapest at $ 33 per keg . The club gained popularity , and Pabst became the drink of choice . On Tuesdays , Pabst was sold at the full price of $ 1 @.@ 75 , but there was no cover to see the bands . Things kept getting busier . It was suggested that Thursdays become a ' beer bust , ' where a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm , when the room was cleared for the show . By this time , perhaps mid @-@ 1996 , EJ 's had achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of national talent , which again increased sales . During busy months , we were getting three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month . Years later , Pabst became known as the ' hipster ' beer of Portland . There is no way for me to warrant that EJ 's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this impact , but I have done so nonetheless , for years . 
 Matt <unk> , the field marketing manager for Pabst 's Pacific region , weighed in on the debate as well , saying : 
 We 've always thought Lutz was the first one to sell it . But it 's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain 's 100 @-@ point game or were at Woodstock . The landscape is littered with salesmen who say , ' Oh yeah , I was the first one to bring that in . ' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club , this really old @-@ school punk @-@ rock bar on Killingsworth . As far as the very first ones , there was the Lutz and EJ 's , and it 's always been our thought that Lutz was first .

 In September 2010 , after operating Lutz for 56 years , the owners held a " farewell bash " and closed its doors after deciding that they could no longer borrow money to stay open . However , the bar was re @-@ opened in 2011 by the staff of the Portland establishments Clinton Street Pub and Crow Bar . Willamette Week reported that Lutz began serving liquor , eight taps of " good Northwest <unk> , and a real kitchen that makes a kick @-@ ass burger " as the result of new management . 
 The Woodstock Neighborhood Association ( WNA ) originally made plans to paint Woodstock Mural on the east exterior of Lutz . In August 2012 , the Regional Arts & Culture Council ( RACC ) confirmed funding of $ 6 @,@ 000 for the 60 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ foot ( 18 @.@ 3 m × 4 @.@ 6 m ) painting . The mural 's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall 's three sections . RACC published an image of artist Mike Lawrence 's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to " highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride " . The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013 . Efforts stalled , but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the nearby Red Fox Vintage building . 
 In 2013 , Lutz earned top honors in the Dill Pickle Club 's annual " Perfect Pickle " competition , in which nine restaurants competed . 
 In 2014 , The Oregonian reported that Robert Kowalski was the owner of Lutz and several other local establishments , including Crow Bar and Clinton Street Pub .

 In Willamette Week 's 2014 " Bar Guide " , Matthew <unk> described Lutz as an " old @-@ school , diner @-@ countered , deep @-@ <unk> drinking hole " serving " <unk> , old rockers and rank @-@ and @-@ file preservers of the AFL @-@ CIO to equal satisfaction " .

 = Virginia State Route 175 = 
 State Route 175 ( SR 175 ) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia . Known as Chincoteague Road , the state highway runs 10 @.@ 49 miles ( 16 @.@ 88 km ) from U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) at Nash Corner east to Main Street in Chincoteague . SR 175 passes through the northeastern corner of Accomack County , providing the primary access to NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility and both Chincoteague Island and the Virginia portion of Assateague Island . The route travels between the mainland and Chincoteague Island along the John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway . 
 In 1928 , SR 520 was designated to run from US 13 in Oak Hall east toward Chincoteague Island , being extended onto the island in 1930 . The route was extended south along US 13 and west to a railroad crossing west of Oak Hall in 1930 . SR 520 became SR 175 in the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering . SR 175 was extended south on Main Street in Chincoteague a year later and east on Beebe Road the following year , at which time a spur route known as SR 175Y was designated onto the northern portion of Main Street . The western terminus was moved to its current location in 1947 , with the section west of US 13 becoming part of SR 703 . SR 175 was routed to bypass Wallops Station to the south in 1954 . In 1992 , the section of SR 175 in Chincoteague , along with all of SR 175Y , was transferred to the secondary system . SR 175 was rerouted to bypass Marsh Island and a swing bridge over Chincoteague Channel with a new bascule bridge further north in 2010 , tying into Main Street at Maddox Boulevard . The former swing bridge was demolished and a spur off the new bridge was built to serve Marsh Island .

 Virginia State Route 175 ( SR 175 ) begins at an intersection with US 13 ( Lankford Highway ) at Nash Corner 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of the Maryland state line . The state highway heads east as a two @-@ lane undivided road through a mix of farmland and woodland . Upon reaching the community of <unk> , the highway intersects SR 679 ( Fleming Road ) and SR 798 ( Mill Dam Road ) . The road crosses over Wallops Pond , an impoundment of <unk> Branch of Mosquito Creek , onto Wallops Island . SR 175 heads east , intersecting SR 798 ( Atlantic Avenue ) again , then curves north through Wallops Island National Wildlife Refuge and around NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility , a rocket launch site operated as a subsidiary of Goddard Space Flight Center . While heading north parallel to one of the flight facility 's runways , the state highway passes the NASA Visitor Center . SR 175 curves to the east as it passes the main entrance to the flight facility . 
 SR 175 heads east onto the John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway between the mainland and Chincoteague Island . The causeway passes over marshland adjacent to the southern end of Chincoteague Bay and includes bridges over Mosquito Creek , Cockle Creek , Queen Sound Channel , and Wire Narrows . A fifth bridge curves to the north and then east around the northern end of Marsh Island to cross Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel onto Chincoteague Island . The bridge has a bascule span over Chincoteague Channel and lands on Chincoteague Island north of the downtown area . Marsh Island is served by a connector bridge that meets SR 175 over Black Narrows . SR 175 reaches its eastern terminus at Main Street in the town of Chincoteague . The roadway continues east as Maddox Boulevard toward Assateague Island .

 A causeway linking Chincoteague Island to the mainland was proposed by John B. Whealton , who formed the Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company in 1919 . On November 15 , 1922 , the causeway to Chincoteague Island was completed . Tolls were collected on the causeway until 1930 . The road between US 13 in Oak Hall and Chincoteague Island became a part of the state highway system as SR 520 in August 1928 . The route was extended onto Chincoteague Island in June 1930 . In December of that year , SR 520 was extended south on US 13 and west along CR 107 to a railroad crossing west of Oak Hall . In the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering , SR 520 was replaced with SR 175 . In August 1934 , SR 175 was extended south along Main Street in Chincoteague on the former SR 717 . A year later , the route was extended east along Beebe Road to the boundary of Chincoteague . The western terminus of SR 175 was cut back to its current location at US 13 in June 1947 , with an extension of SR 703 replacing the small section of the route that extended west from US 13 . SR 175 was rerouted to bypass the Wallops Station facility to the south in May 1954 ; SR 798 was assigned to part of the former alignment . The SR 175 designation was removed from Main Street and Beebe Road in June 1992 when that stretch of road was transferred to the secondary system , leaving the eastern terminus at Main Street just east of the causeway onto the island . 
 In January 2007 , construction began to build a new bridge to Chincoteague Island for SR 175 . This new crossing was built as the old bridges were narrow and deteriorating , in addition to reducing traffic congestion in downtown Chincoteague and providing a more direct route to the island 's main commercial district and Assateague Island . The project constructed a bascule bridge over Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel that would enter the island and terminate at Main Street and Maddox Boulevard , replacing the previous crossing by way of Marsh Island that consisted of a swing bridge over the Chincoteague Channel . A connector bridge was built to serve Marsh Island . SR 175 was relocated to the new bridge in October 2010 . The old bridge over Black Narrows and the swing bridge over Chincoteague Channel were demolished following the completion of the new bridge .

 = Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom = 
 Resurrectionists were commonly employed by anatomists in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries to exhume the bodies of the recently dead . Between 1506 and 1752 only a very few cadavers were available each year for anatomical research . The supply was increased when , in an attempt to intensify the deterrent effect of the death penalty , Parliament passed the Murder Act 1752 . By allowing judges to substitute the public display of executed criminals with dissection ( a fate generally viewed with horror ) , the new law significantly increased the number of bodies anatomists could legally access . This proved insufficient to meet the needs of the hospitals and teaching centres that opened during the 18th century . Corpses and their component parts became a commodity , but although the practice of disinterment was hated by the general public , bodies were not legally anyone 's property . The resurrectionists therefore operated in a legal grey area . 
 Nevertheless , resurrectionists caught plying their trade ran the risk of physical attack . Measures taken to stop them included the use of increased security at graveyards . Night watches patrolled grave sites , the rich placed their dead in secure coffins , and physical barriers such as <unk> and heavy stone slabs made extraction of corpses more difficult . Body snatchers were not the only people to come under attack ; in the public 's view , the 1752 Act made anatomists agents of the law , enforcers of the death penalty . Riots at execution sites , from where anatomists collected legal corpses , were commonplace . 
 Matters came to a head following the Burke and Hare murders of 1828 . Parliament responded by setting up the 1828 Select Committee on anatomy , whose report emphasised the importance of anatomical science and recommended that the bodies of paupers be given over for dissection . In response to the discovery in 1831 of a gang known as the London Burkers , who apparently modelled their activities on those of Burke and Hare , Parliament debated a bill submitted by Henry Warburton , author of the Select Committee 's report . Although it did not make body snatching illegal , the resulting Act of Parliament effectively put an end to the work of the resurrectionists by allowing anatomists access to the workhouse dead . 
 = = Legal background = = 
 Human cadavers have been dissected by physicians since at least the 3rd century BC , but throughout history , prevailing religious views on the desecration of corpses often meant that such work was performed in secrecy . The Christian church forbade human dissection until the 14th century , when the first recorded <unk> of a cadaver took place in Bologna . Until then , anatomical research was limited to the dissection of animals . In Britain , human dissection was proscribed by law until 1506 , when King James IV of Scotland gave royal patronage to the Barber @-@ Surgeons of Edinburgh , allowing them to dissect the " bodies of certain executed criminals " . England followed in 1540 , when Henry VIII gave patronage to the Company of Barber @-@ Surgeons , allowing them access to four executed felons each year ( Charles II later increased this to six felons each year ) . Elizabeth I granted the College of Physicians the right to <unk> four felons annually in 1564 . 
 Several major hospitals and teaching centres were established in Britain during the 18th century , but with only a very few corpses legally available for dissection , these institutions suffered from severe shortages . Some local authorities had already attempted to alleviate the problem , with limited success ; in 1694 , Edinburgh allowed anatomists to dissect corpses " found dead in the streets , and the bodies of such as die violent deaths ... who shall have nobody to own them " . Suicide victims were given over , as were infants who had died while being born and also the unclaimed bodies of abandoned children . But even though they were supported by the common law , anatomists occasionally found it difficult to collect what was granted to them . Fuelled by resentment of how readily the death penalty was used , and imbued with superstitious beliefs , crowds sometimes sought to keep the bodies of executed felons away from the authorities . Riots at execution sites were commonplace ; worried about possible disorder , in 1749 the Sheriff of London ignored the surgeons and gave the dead to their relatives . 
 These problems , together with a desire to enhance the deterrent effect of the death penalty , resulted in the passage of the Murder Act 1752 . It required that " every murderer shall , after execution , either be dissected or hung in chains " . Dissection was generally viewed as " a fate worse than death " ; giving judges the ability to substitute <unk> with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror . While the Act gave anatomists statutory access to many more cadavers than were previously available , it proved insufficient . Attempting to bolster the supply , some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners , while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows , sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Documented cases of grave robbery for medical purposes can be found as far back as 1319 . The 15th @-@ century polymath Leonardo da Vinci may have secretly dissected around 30 corpses , although their provenance remains unknown . In Britain , the practice appears to have been common early in the 17th century . For example , William Shakespeare 's epitaph reads " Good friend , for Jesus ' sake forbear , To dig the dust enclosed here . Blessed be the man that spares these stones , And cursed be he that moves my bones " and in 1678 , anatomists were suspected of being involved in the disappearance of an executed gypsy 's body . Contracts issued in 1721 by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons include a clause directing students not to become involved in exhumation , suggesting , according to historian Ruth Richardson , that students had already done the exact opposite . Pupils accompanied professional body snatchers as observers , and were reported to have obtained and paid for their studies with human corpses , perhaps indicating that their tutors were complicit . The unauthorised removal of bodies from London graveyards became commonplace and by the 1720s , probably as a direct result of the lack of legally available bodies for anatomical research , fresh corpses had likely undergone commodification . 
 Corpses and parts thereof were traded like any other merchandise : packed into suitable containers , salted and preserved , stored in cellars and quays and transported in carts , waggons and boats . Encouraged by fierce competition , anatomy schools usually paid more promptly than their peers , who included individual surgeons , artists and others with an interest in human anatomy . As one body snatcher testified , " a man may make a good living at it , if he is a sober man , and acts with judgement , and supplies the schools " . 
 In London , late 18th @-@ century anatomists may have delegated their grave @-@ robbing almost entirely to body snatchers , or , as they were commonly known , resurrectionists . A fifteen @-@ strong gang of such men , exposed in Lambeth in 1795 , supplied " eight surgeons of public repute , and a man who calls himself an <unk> " . The report into their activities lists a price of two guineas and a crown for a dead body , six shillings for the first foot , and nine pence per inch " for all it measures more in length " . These prices were by no means fixed ; the black market value of corpses varied considerably . Giving evidence to the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy , the surgeon Astley Cooper testified that in 1828 the price for a corpse was about eight guineas , but also that he had paid anything from two to fourteen guineas previously ; others claimed they had paid up to twenty guineas per corpse . Compared to the five shillings an East End silk weaver could earn each week , or the single guinea a manservant to a wealthy household was paid , these were considerable sums of money and body snatching was therefore a highly profitable business . Surgeons at the Royal College in Edinburgh complained that resurrectionists were profiteering , particularly when local shortages forced prices up . One surgeon told the Select Committee that he thought the body snatchers were manipulating the market for their own benefit , though no criticism was made of the " Anatomy Club " , an attempt by anatomists to control the price of corpses for their benefit . 
 Prices also varied depending on what type of corpse was for sale . With greater opportunity for the study of musculature , males were preferable to females , while freaks were more highly valued . The body of Charles Byrne , the so @-@ called " Irish Giant " , fetched about £ 500 when it was bought by John Hunter . Byrne 's skeleton remains on display at the Royal College of Surgeons of England . Children 's bodies were also traded , as " big smalls " , " smalls " or foetuses . Parts of corpses , such as a scalp with long hair attached , or good quality teeth , also fetched good prices — not because they held any intrinsic value to the anatomist , but rather because they were used to refurbish the living . 
 With no reliable figures for the number of dissections that took place in 18th @-@ century Britain , the true scale of body snatching can only be estimated . Richardson suggests that nationally , several thousand bodies were robbed each year . The 1828 Select Committee reported that in 1826 , 592 bodies were dissected by 701 students . In 1831 , only 52 of 1 @,@ 601 death penalties handed down were enacted , a number far too small to meet demand . Since corpses were not viewed as property and could neither be owned nor stolen , body snatching remained quasi @-@ legal , the crime being committed against the grave rather than the body . On the rare occasions they were caught , resurrectionists might have received a public whipping , or a sentence for crimes against public mores , but generally the practice was treated by the authorities as an open secret and ignored . A notable exception occurred in Great Yarmouth in 1827 , with the capture of three resurrectionists . At a time when thieves were regularly transported for theft , two of the body snatchers were discharged and the third , sent to London for trial , was imprisoned for only six months . Resurrectionists were also aided by the corpse 's <unk> ; since the process also destroyed the evidence , a successful prosecution was unlikely . 
 = = Resurrection = = 
 = = = Method = = = 
 Resurrectionists usually found corpses through a network of informers . <unk> , gravediggers , undertakers , local officials ; each connived to take a cut of the proceeds . Working mostly in small gangs at night with a " dark <unk> " , their modus operandi was to dig a hole — sometimes using a quieter , wooden spade — down to one end of the coffin . To disguise this activity , the spoil was sometimes thrown onto a piece of canvas at the side of the grave . A sound @-@ deadening sack was placed over the lid , which was then lifted . The weight of soil on the remainder of the lid snapped the wood , enabling the robbers to hoist the body out . The corpse was then stripped of its clothing , tied up , and placed into a sack . The entire process could be completed within 30 minutes . Moving the corpse of a pauper was less troublesome , as their bodies were often kept in mass graves , left open to the environment until filled — which often took weeks . 
 If caught in the act , body snatchers could find themselves at the mercy of the local population . A violent confrontation took place in a Dublin churchyard in 1828 , when a party of mourners confronted a group of resurrectionists . The would @-@ be body snatchers withdrew , only to return several hours later with more men . The mourners had also added to their number , and both groups had brought firearms . A " volley of bullets , slugs , and swan @-@ shot from the resurrectionists " prompted a " discharge of fire @-@ arms from the defenders " . Close @-@ quarters fighting included the use of pick axes , until the resurrectionists retreated . In the same city , a man caught removing a corpse from a graveyard in Hollywood was shot and killed in 1832 . In the same year , three men were apprehended while transporting the bodies of two elderly men , near Deptford in London . As rumours spread that the two corpses were murder victims , a large crowd assembled outside the station house . When the suspects were brought out to be transported to the local magistrates , the approximately 40 @-@ strong force of police officers found it difficult to " prevent their prisoners being sacrificed by the indignant multitude , which was most anxious to inflict such punishment upon them as it thought they deserved . " 
 = = = Gangs = = = 
 As many as seven gangs of resurrectionists may have been at work in 1831 . The 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy believed that there were about 200 London resurrectionists , most of them working part @-@ time . The London Borough Gang , which operated from about 1802 to 1825 , at its peak consisted of at least six men , led first by a former hospital porter named Ben Crouch , and later by a man called Patrick Murphy . Under the protection of Astley Cooper , Crouch 's gang supplied some of London 's biggest anatomical schools , but relations were not always amicable . In 1816 the gang cut off supplies to the St Thomas Hospital School , demanding an increase of two guineas per corpse . When the school responded by using freelancers , members of the gang burst into the dissecting rooms , threatened the students and attacked the corpses . The police were called , but worried about adverse publicity , the school paid their attackers ' bail and opened negotiations . The gang also attempted to put rivals out of business , sometimes by desecrating a graveyard ( thereby rendering it unsafe to rob graves from for weeks thereafter ) and other times by reporting freelance resurrectionists to the police , recruiting them once freed from prison . Joshua Naples , who wrote The Diary of a <unk> , a list of his activities from 1811 – 1812 , was one such individual . Among entries detailing the graveyards he plundered , the institutions he delivered to , how much he was paid and his drunkenness , Naples diary mentions his gang 's inability to work under a full Moon , being unable to sell a body deemed " putrid " , and leaving a body thought to be infected with smallpox . 
 Violent mobs were not the only problems body snatchers faced . Naples also wrote of how he met " patrols " and how " dogs flew at us " , references to some of the measures taken to secure graves against his ilk . The aristocracy and very rich placed their dead in triple coffins , vaults and private chapels , sometimes guarded by servants . For the less wealthy , double coffins were available , buried on private land in deep graves . More basic defences included the placing of heavy weights over the coffin , or simply filling the grave with stones rather than soil . Such deterrents were sometimes deployed in vain ; at least one London graveyard was owned by an anatomist who , it was reported , " obtained a famous supply [ of cadavers ] ... and he could charge pretty handsomely for burying a body there , and afterwards get from his pupils from eight to twelve guineas for taking it up again ! " Ever more elaborate creations included The Patent Coffin , an iron contraption with concealed springs to prevent any levering of its lid . Corpses were sometimes secured inside their caskets by iron straps , while other designs used special screws to reinforce metal bands placed around the coffin . In Scotland , iron cages called <unk> either encased buried coffins , or were set in a concrete foundation and covered the whole grave . Some covered more than one coffin , while others took the form of iron lattices fixed beneath large stone slabs , buried with the coffin . They may not have been secure enough ; as one 20th @-@ century writer observed , an empty coffin found beneath a buried <unk> in Aberlour had probably been " opened during the night succeeding the funeral , and carefully closed again , so that the disturbance of the soil had escaped notice or had been attributed to the original burial . " 
 = = = Other methods = = = 
 Occasionally , resurrectionists paid women to pose as grieving relatives , so that they might claim a body from a workhouse . Some parishes did little to stop this practice , as it reduced their funeral expenditure . Bodies were also taken from dead houses ; Astley Cooper 's servant was once forced to return three bodies , worth £ 34 2s , to a dead house in Newington parish . <unk> were also paid , usually to servants of recently deceased employers then lying in state , although this method carried its own risks as corpses were often placed on public display before they were buried . Some were taken from private homes ; in 1831 The Times reported that " a party of resurrectionists " burst into a house in Bow Lane and took the body of an elderly woman , who was being " ' waked ' by her friends and neighbours " . The thieves apparently " acted with the most revolting indecency , dragging the corpse in its death clothes after them through the mud in the street " . Bodies were even removed — with no legal authority — from prisons and naval and military hospitals . 
 While some surgeons eschewed human cadavers in favour of artificial facsimiles , plaster casts , wax models and animals , bodies were also taken from hospital burial grounds . Recent excavations at the Royal London Hospital appear to support claims made almost 200 years earlier that the hospital 's school was " entirely supplied by subjects , which have been their own patients " .

 = = = Public view = = = 
 The moving in 1783 of London 's executions , from Tyburn to Newgate Prison , reduced the likelihood of public interference and strengthened the authorities ' hold over felons . However , society 's view of dissection remained unequivocal ; most preferred <unk> to the laying open of a corpse . Martin Gray , sentenced to death in 1721 for returning early from transportation , was " greatly <unk> , least his Body should be cut , and torn , and mangled after Death , and had sent his Wife to his Uncle to obtain some money to prevent it . " Vincent Davis , convicted in 1725 of murdering his wife , said he would rather be " hang 'd in Chains " than " <unk> 'd " , and to that effect had " sent many Letters to all his former Friends and <unk> to form a Company , and prevent the Surgeons in their Designs upon his Body " . There are cases of criminals who survived the short drop , but dissecting the body removed any hope of escape from death 's embrace . Anatomists were popularly thought to be interested in dissection only as enactors of the law , a relationship first established by kings James IV and Henry VIII . Thomas <unk> , editor of The Lancet , wrote that this lowered " the character of the profession in the public mind . " It was also thought that the anatomists ' work made the body 's owner unrecognisable in the afterlife . Therefore , while less hated than the resurrectionists they employed , anatomists remained at risk of attack . Relatives of a man executed in 1820 killed one anatomist and shot another in the face , while in 1831 , following the discovery of buried human flesh and three dissected bodies , a mob burnt down an anatomy theatre in Aberdeen . The theatre 's proprietor , Andrew Moir , escaped through a window , while two of his students were chased through the streets . 
 Some aspects of the popular view of dissection were exemplified by the final panel of William Hogarth 's The Four Stages of Cruelty , a series of engravings that depict a felon 's journey to the anatomical theatre . The chief surgeon ( John Freke ) appears as a magistrate , watching over the examination of the murderer Tom Nero 's body by the Company of Surgeons . According to author Fiona Haslam , the scene reflects a popular view that surgeons were " on the whole , disreputable , insensitive to human suffering and prone to <unk> [ ing ] people in the same way that criminals victimised their prey . " Another popular belief alluded to by Hogarth was that surgeons were so ignorant of the respect due to their subjects , that they allowed the remains to become offal . In reality , the rough treatment exacted by body snatchers on corpses continued on the premises they delivered to . Joshua Brookes once admitted that he had kicked a corpse in a sack down a flight of stairs , while Robert Christison complained of the " shocking indecency without any qualifying wit " demonstrated by a male lecturer who dissected a woman . Pranks were also common ; a London student who jokingly dropped an amputated leg down a household chimney , into a housewife 's stewpot , caused a riot .

The presiding judge 's comment , that " the disinterment of bodies for dissection was an offence liable to punishment " , prompted Parliament to establish the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy . The committee took evidence from 40 witnesses : 25 members of the medical profession , 12 public servants and 3 resurrectionists , who remained anonymous . Discussed were the importance of anatomy , the supply of subjects for dissection and the relationship between anatomists and resurrectionists . The committee concluded that dissection was essential to the study of human anatomy and recommended that anatomists be allowed to appropriate the bodies of paupers . 
 The first bill was presented to Parliament in 1829 by Henry Warburton , author of the Select Committee 's report . Following a spirited defence of the poor by peers in the House of Lords , it was withdrawn , but almost two years later Warburton introduced a second bill , shortly after the execution of John Bishop and Thomas Williams . The London Burkers , as the two men were known , were inspired by a series of murders committed by William Burke and William Hare , two Irishmen who sold their victims ' bodies to Robert Knox , a Scottish surgeon . Even though Burke and Hare never robbed graves , their case lowered the public 's view of resurrectionists from <unk> to potential murderers . The resulting wave of social anxiety helped speed Warburton 's bill through Parliament , and despite much public opprobrium , with little Parliamentary opposition the Anatomy Act 1832 became law on 1 August 1832 . It abolished that part of the 1752 Act that allowed murderers to be dissected , ending the centuries @-@ old tradition of <unk> felons , although it neither discouraged nor prohibited body snatching , or the sale of corpses ( whose legal status remained uncertain ) . Another clause allowed a person 's body to be given up for " anatomical examination " , provided that the person concerned had not objected . As the poor were often barely literate and therefore unable to leave written directions in the event of their death , this meant that masters of charitable institutions such as workhouses decided who went to the anatomist 's table . A stipulation that witnesses could intervene was also abused , as such witnesses might be fellow inmates who were powerless to object , or workhouse staff who stood to gain money through wilful ignorance . 
 Despite the passage of the Anatomy Act , resurrection remained commonplace , the supply of unclaimed paupers ' bodies at first proving inadequate to fulfil the demand . Reports of body snatching persisted for some years ; in 1838 , Poor Law Commissioners reported on two dead resurrectionists who had contracted an illness from a putrid corpse they had unearthed . By 1844 , the trade no longer existed . 
 = Leoš Janáček = 
 Leoš Janáček ( Czech pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ͡ <unk> ] , baptised Leo Eugen Janáček ; 3 July 1854 – 12 August 1928 ) was a Czech composer , musical theorist , folklorist , publicist and teacher . He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic folk music to create an original , modern musical style . 
 Until 1895 he devoted himself mainly to <unk> research and his early musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Antonín Dvořák . His later , mature works incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music in a modern , highly original synthesis , first evident in the opera Jenůfa , which was premiered in 1904 in Brno . The success of Jenůfa ( often called the " Moravian national opera " ) at Prague in 1916 gave Janáček access to the world 's great opera stages . Janáček 's later works are his most celebrated . They include operas such as Káťa Kabanová and The Cunning Little Vixen , the Sinfonietta , the Glagolitic Mass , the rhapsody Taras Bulba , two string quartets , and other chamber works . Along with Antonín Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana , he is considered one of the most important Czech composers . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Leoš Janáček , son of schoolmaster Jiří ( 1815 – 1866 ) and Amalie ( née <unk> ) <unk> ( 1819 – 1884 ) , was born in <unk> , Moravia ( then part of the Austrian Empire ) . He was a gifted child in a family of limited means , and showed an early musical talent in choral singing . His father wanted him to follow the family tradition , and become a teacher , but deferred to Janáček 's obvious musical abilities . In 1865 young Janáček enrolled as a ward of the foundation of the Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno , where he took part in choral singing under Pavel Křížkovský and occasionally played the organ . One of his classmates , František Neumann , later described Janáček as an " excellent pianist , who played Beethoven symphonies perfectly in a piano duet with a classmate , under Křížkovský 's supervision " . Křížkovský found him a problematic and wayward student but recommended his entry to the Prague Organ School . Janáček later remembered Křížkovský as a great conductor and teacher . 
 Janáček originally intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition . He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan 's Association ( 1873 – 76 ) . In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school , under František Skuherský and František Blažek . His student days in Prague were impoverished ; with no piano in his room , he had to make do with a keyboard drawn on his tabletop . His criticism of Skuherský 's performance of the Gregorian mass was published in the March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented , and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class . On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher , and conducted various amateur choirs . From 1876 he taught music at Brno 's Teachers Institute . Among his pupils there was Zdenka <unk> , daughter of Emilian Schulz , the Institute director . She was later to be Janáček 's wife . In 1876 he also became a piano student of <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , with whom he co @-@ organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years . In February 1876 , he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda <unk> Philharmonic Society . Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881 , he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888 . 
 From October 1879 to February 1880 he studied piano , organ , and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory . While there , he composed Thema con <unk> for piano in B flat , subtitled Zdenka 's Variations . Dissatisfied with his teachers ( among them Oscar Paul and Leo Grill ) , and denied a studentship with Camille Saint @-@ Saëns in Paris , Janáček moved on to the Vienna Conservatory , where from April to June 1880 he studied composition with Franz Krenn . He concealed his opposition to Krenn 's neo @-@ romanticism , but he quit Josef <unk> 's classes and further piano study when he was criticised for his piano style and technique . He submitted a violin sonata ( now lost ) to a Vienna Conservatory competition , but the judges rejected it as " too academic " . Janáček left the conservatory in June 1880 , disappointed despite Franz Krenn 's very complimentary personal report . He returned to Brno where on 13 July 1881 , he married his young pupil Zdenka <unk> . 
 In 1881 , Janáček founded and was appointed director of the organ school , and held this post until 1919 , when the school became the Brno Conservatory . In the mid @-@ 1880s Janáček began composing more systematically . Among other works , he created the Four male @-@ voice choruses ( 1886 ) , dedicated to Antonín Dvořák , and his first opera , Šárka ( 1887 – 88 ) . During this period he began to collect and study folk music , songs and dances . In the early months of 1887 he sharply criticized the comic opera The Bridegrooms , by Czech composer Karel Kovařovic , in a Hudební listy journal review : " Which melody stuck in your mind ? Which motif ? Is this dramatic opera ? No , I would write on the poster : ' Comedy performed together with music ' , since the music and the libretto aren 't connected to each other " . Janáček 's review apparently led to mutual dislike and later professional difficulties when Kovařovic , as director of the National Theatre in Prague , refused to stage Janáček 's opera Jenůfa . 
 From the early 1890s , Janáček led the mainstream of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia , using a repertoire of folksongs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements . Most of his achievements in this field were published in 1899 – 1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong . His compositional work was still influenced by the declamatory , dramatic style of Smetana and Dvořák . He expressed very negative opinions on German neo @-@ classicism and especially on Wagner in the Hudební listy journal , which he founded in 1884 . The death of his second child , Vladimír , in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera , Beginning of the Romance ( 1891 ) and the cantata <unk> ( 1897 ) . 
 = = = Later years and masterworks = = = 
 In the first decade of the 20th century Janáček composed choral church music including <unk> ( Our Father , 1901 ) , <unk> ( 1903 ) and Ave Maria ( 1904 ) . In 1901 the first part of his piano cycle On an Overgrown Path was published , and gradually became one of his most frequently performed works . In 1902 Janáček visited Russia twice . On the first occasion he took his daughter Olga to <unk> , where she stayed to study Russian . Only three months later , he returned to St. Petersburg with his wife because Olga was very ill . They took her back to Brno , but her health was worsening . Janáček expressed his painful feelings for his daughter in a new work , his opera Jenůfa , in which the suffering of his daughter became Jenůfa 's . When Olga died in February 1903 , Janáček dedicated Jenůfa to her memory . The opera was performed in Brno in 1904 , with reasonable success , but Janáček felt this was no more than a provincial achievement . He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera , but Jenůfa was refused there ( twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague ) . Dejected and emotionally exhausted , Janáček went to <unk> spa to recover . There he met Kamila <unk> , whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera , <unk> ( Destiny ) . 
 In 1905 Janáček attended a demonstration in support of a Czech university in Brno , where the violent death of František <unk> ( a young joiner ) at the hands of the police inspired his 1 . X. 1905 piano sonata . The incident led him to further promote the anti @-@ German and anti @-@ Austrian ethos of the Russian Circle , which he had co @-@ founded in 1897 and which would be officially banned by the Austrian police in 1915 . In 1906 he approached the Czech poet Petr Bezruč , with whom he later collaborated , composing several choral works based on Bezruč 's poetry . These included Kantor <unk> ( 1906 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1908 ) , and <unk> <unk> ( 1909 ) . Janáček 's life in the first decade of the 20th century was complicated by personal and professional difficulties . He still yearned for artistic recognition from Prague . He destroyed some of his works – others remained unfinished . Nevertheless , he continued composing , and would create several remarkable choral , chamber , orchestral and operatic works , the most notable being the 1914 Cantata <unk> <unk> ( The Eternal Gospel ) , <unk> ( Fairy tale ) for cello and piano ( 1910 ) , the 1912 piano cycle V <unk> ( In the Mist ) and his first symphonic poem <unk> <unk> ( A Fiddler 's Child ) . His fifth opera , <unk> <unk> <unk> do <unk> , composed from 1908 to 1917 , has been characterized as the most " purely Czech in subject and treatment " of all of Janáček 's operas . 
 In 1916 he started a long professional and personal relationship with theatre critic , dramatist and translator Max Brod . In the same year Jenůfa , revised by Kovařovic , was finally accepted by the National Theatre ; its performance in Prague ( 1916 ) was a great success , and brought Janáček his first acclaim . He was 62 . Following the Prague première , he began a relationship with singer Gabriela <unk> , which led to his wife Zdenka 's attempted suicide and their " informal " divorce . A year later ( 1917 ) he met Kamila Stösslová , a young married woman 38 years his junior , who was to inspire him for the remaining years of his life . He conducted an obsessive and ( on his side at least ) passionate correspondence with her , of nearly 730 letters . From 1917 to 1919 , deeply inspired by Stösslová , he composed The Diary of One Who Disappeared . As he completed its final revision , he began his next ' Kamila ' work , the opera Káťa Kabanová . 
 In 1920 Janáček retired from his post as director of the Brno Conservatory , but continued to teach until 1925 . In 1921 he attended a lecture by the Indian philosopher @-@ poet Rabindranath Tagore , and used a Tagore poem as the basis for the chorus The Wandering Madman ( 1922 ) . At the same time he encountered the microtonal works of Alois <unk> . In the early 1920s Janáček completed his opera The Cunning Little Vixen , which had been inspired by a serialized novella in the newspaper <unk> noviny . 
 In Janáček 's 70th year ( 1924 ) his biography was published by Max Brod , and he was interviewed by Olin Downes for The New York Times . In 1925 he retired from teaching , but continued composing and was awarded the first honorary doctorate to be given by Masaryk University in Brno . In the spring of 1926 he created his Sinfonietta , a monumental orchestral work , which rapidly gained wide critical acclaim . In the same year he went to England at the invitation of Rosa Newmarch . A number of his works were performed in London , including his first string quartet , the wind sextet Youth , and his violin sonata . Shortly after , and still in 1926 , he started to compose a setting to an Old Church Slavonic text . The result was the large @-@ scale orchestral Glagolitic Mass . Janáček was an atheist , and critical of the organised Church , but religious themes appear frequently in his work . The Glagolitic Mass was partly inspired by the suggestion by a clerical friend , and partly by Janáček 's wish to celebrate the anniversary of Czechoslovak independence . 
 In 1927 – the year of the Sinfonietta 's first performances in New York , Berlin and Brno – he began to compose his final operatic work , From the House of the Dead , the third Act of which was found on his desk after his death . In January 1928 he began his second string quartet , the Intimate Letters , his " manifesto on love " . Meanwhile , the Sinfonietta was performed in London , Vienna and Dresden . In his later years , Janáček became an international celebrity . He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1927 , along with Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith . His operas and other works were finally performed at the world stages . In August 1928 he took an excursion to <unk> with Kamila Stösslová and her son Otto , but caught a chill , which developed into pneumonia . He died on 12 August 1928 in Ostrava , at the sanatorium of Dr. L. Klein . He was given a large public funeral that included music from the last scene of his Cunning Little Vixen , and was buried in the Field of Honour at the Central Cemetery , Brno . 
 = = Personality = = 
 Janáček worked tirelessly throughout his life . He led the organ school , was a Professor at the teachers institute and gymnasium in Brno , collected his " speech tunes " and was composing . From an early age he presented himself as an individualist and his firmly formulated opinions often led to conflict . He unhesitatingly criticized his teachers , who considered him a defiant and anti @-@ authoritarian student . His own students found him strict and uncompromising . Vilém <unk> , one of his pupils , described his encounters with Janáček as somewhat distressing for someone unused to his personality , and noted that Janáček 's characteristically staccato speech rhythms were reproduced in some of his operatic characters . In 1881 , Janáček gave up his leading role with the Beseda <unk> , as a response to criticism , but a rapid decline in Beseda 's performance quality led to his recall in 1882 . 
 His married life , settled and calm in its early years , became increasingly tense and difficult following the death of his daughter , Olga , in 1903 . Years of effort in obscurity took their toll , and almost ended his ambitions as a composer : " I was beaten down " , he wrote later , " My own students gave me advice – how to compose , how to speak through the orchestra " . Success in 1916 – when Karel Kovařovic finally decided to perform Jenůfa in Prague – brought its own problems . Janáček grudgingly resigned himself to the changes forced upon his work . Its success brought him into Prague 's music scene and the attentions of soprano Gabriela <unk> , who guided him through Prague society . Janáček was enchanted by her . On his return to Brno , he appears not to have concealed his new passion from Zdenka , who responded by attempting suicide . Janáček was furious with Zdenka and tried to instigate a divorce , but lost interest in <unk> . Zdenka , anxious to avoid the public scandal of formal divorce , persuaded him to settle for an " informal " divorce . From then on , until Janáček 's death , they lived separate lives in the same household . 
 In 1917 he began his lifelong , inspirational and unrequited passion for Kamila Stösslová , who neither sought nor rejected his devotion . Janáček pleaded for first @-@ name terms in their correspondence . In 1927 she finally agreed and signed herself " <unk> Kamila " ( Your Kamila ) in a letter , which Zdenka found . This revelation provoked a furious quarrel between Zdenka and Janáček , though their living arrangements did not change – Janáček seems to have persuaded her to stay . In 1928 , the year of his death , Janáček confessed his intention to publicise his feelings for Stösslová . Max Brod had to dissuade him . Janáček 's contemporaries and collaborators described him as mistrustful and reserved , but capable of obsessive passion for those he loved . His overwhelming passion for Stösslová was sincere but verged upon self @-@ destruction . Their letters remain an important source for Janáček 's artistic intentions and inspiration . His letters to his long @-@ suffering wife are , by contrast , <unk> descriptive . Zdenka seems to have destroyed all hers to Janáček . Only a few postcards survive . 
 = = Style = = 
 In 1874 Janáček became friends with Antonín Dvořák , and began composing in a relatively traditional romantic style . After his opera Šárka ( 1887 – 1888 ) , his style absorbed elements of Moravian and Slovak folk music . 
 His musical assimilation of the rhythm , pitch contour and inflections of normal Czech speech ( Moravian dialect ) helped create the very distinctive vocal melodies of his opera Jenůfa ( 1904 ) , whose 1916 success in Prague was to be the turning point in his career . In Jenůfa , Janáček developed and applied the concept of " speech tunes " to build a unique musical and dramatic style quite independent of " Wagnerian " dramatic method . He studied the circumstances in which " speech tunes " changed , the psychology and temperament of speakers and the coherence within speech , all of which helped render the dramatically truthful roles of his mature operas , and became one of the most significant markers of his style . Janáček took these stylistic principles much farther in his vocal writing than Modest Mussorgsky , and thus anticipates the later work of Béla Bartók . The stylistic basis for his later works originates in the period of 1904 – 1918 , but Janáček composed the majority of his output – and his best known works – in the last decade of his life . 
 Much of Janáček 's work displays great originality and individuality . It employs a vastly expanded view of tonality , uses unorthodox chord spacings and structures , and often , modality : " there is no music without key . <unk> abolishes definite key , and thus tonal modulation .... Folksong knows of no atonality . " Janáček features accompaniment figures and patterns , with ( according to Jim Samson ) " the on @-@ going movement of his music ... similarly achieved by unorthodox means ; often a discourse of short , ' unfinished ' phrases comprising constant repetitions of short motifs which gather momentum in a cumulative manner . " Janáček named these motifs " <unk> " in his theoretical works . " <unk> " has no strict English equivalent , but John Tyrrell , a leading specialist on Janáček 's music , describes it as " a little flash of time , almost a kind of musical capsule , which Janáček often used in slow music as tiny swift motifs with remarkably characteristic rhythms that are supposed to pepper the musical flow . " Janáček 's use of these repeated motifs demonstrates a remote similarity to minimalist composers ( Sir Charles Mackerras called Janáček " the first minimalist composer " ) . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Janáček belongs to a wave of twentieth @-@ century composers who sought greater realism and greater connection with everyday life , combined with a more all @-@ encompassing use of musical resources . His operas in particular demonstrate the use of " speech " <unk> melodic lines , folk and traditional material , and complex modal musical argument . Janáček 's works are still regularly performed around the world , and are generally considered popular with audiences . He would also inspire later composers in his homeland , as well as music theorists , among them Jaroslav <unk> , to place modal development alongside harmony of importance in music . 
 The operas of his mature period , Jenůfa ( 1904 ) , Káťa Kabanová ( 1921 ) , The Cunning Little Vixen ( 1924 ) , The <unk> Affair ( 1926 ) and From the House of the Dead ( after a novel by Dostoyevsky and premièred posthumously in 1930 ) are considered his finest works . The Australian conductor Sir Charles Mackerras became very closely associated with Janáček 's operas . 
 Janáček 's chamber music , while not especially voluminous , includes works which are widely considered twentieth @-@ century classics , particularly his two string quartets : Quartet No. 1 , " The Kreutzer Sonata " inspired by the Tolstoy novel , and the Quartet No. 2 , " Intimate Letters " . Milan Kundera called these compositions the peak of Janáček 's output . 
 The world première of Janáček 's lyrical Concertino for piano , two violins , viola , clarinet , French horn and bassoon took place in Brno on 16 February 1926 . It was also performed at the Frankfurt Festival of Modern Music in 1927 by Ilona <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 A comparable chamber work for an even more unusual set of instruments , the Capriccio for piano left hand , flute , two trumpets , three trombones and tenor tuba , was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann , who lost the use of his right hand during World War I. After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928 , the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world . 
 Other well known pieces by Janáček include the Sinfonietta , the Glagolitic Mass ( the text written in Old Church Slavonic ) , and the rhapsody Taras Bulba . These pieces and the above @-@ mentioned five late operas were all written in the last decade of Janáček 's life . 
 Janáček established a school of composition in Brno . Among his notable pupils were Jan <unk> , Václav <unk> , Vilém <unk> , Jaroslav Kvapil , Osvald <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Pavel Haas . Most of his students neither imitated nor developed Janáček 's style , which left him no direct stylistic descendants . According to Milan Kundera , Janáček developed a personal , modern style in relative isolation from contemporary modernist movements but was in close contact with developments in modern European music . His path towards the innovative " modernism " of his later years was long and solitary , and he achieved true individuation as a composer around his 50th year . 
 Sir Charles Mackerras , the Australian conductor who helped promote Janáček 's works on the world 's opera stages , described his style as " ... completely new and original , different from anything else ... and impossible to pin down to any one style " . According to Mackerras , Janáček 's use of whole @-@ tone scale differs from that of Debussy , his folk music inspiration is absolutely dissimilar from Dvořák 's and Smetana 's , and his characteristically complex rhythms differ from the techniques of the young Stravinsky . 
 The French conductor and composer Pierre Boulez , who interpreted Janáček 's operas and orchestral works , called his music surprisingly modern and fresh : " Its repetitive pulse varies through changes in rhythm , tone and direction . " He described his opera From the House of the Dead as " primitive , in the best sense , but also extremely strong , like the paintings of Léger , where the rudimentary character allows a very vigorous kind of expression " . 
 Janáček 's life has featured in several films . In 1974 Eva Marie <unk> made a short documentary <unk> a <unk> ( The Photographer and the Music ) about the Czech photographer Josef <unk> and his relationship to Janáček 's work . In 1983 the Brothers Quay produced a stop motion animated film , Leoš Janáček : Intimate Excursions , about Janáček 's life and work , and in 1986 the Czech director <unk> <unk> made Lev s <unk> <unk> ( Lion with the White Mane ) , which showed the amorous inspiration behind Janáček 's works . In Search of Janáček is a Czech documentary directed in 2004 by Petr <unk> , made to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Janáček 's birth . An animated cartoon version of The Cunning Little Vixen was made in 2003 by the BBC , with music performed by the Deutsches Symphonie @-@ Orchester Berlin and conducted by Kent Nagano . A rearrangement of the opening of the Sinfonietta was used by the progressive rock band Emerson , Lake & Palmer for the song " Knife @-@ Edge " on their 1970 debut album . 
 The Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra was established in 1954 . Today the 116 @-@ piece ensemble is associated with mostly contemporary music but also regularly performs works from the classical repertoire . The orchestra is resident at the House of Culture Vítkovice ( <unk> kultury Vítkovice ) in Ostrava , Czech Republic . The orchestra tours extensively and has performed in Europe , the U.S. , Australia , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan . Its current music director is Theodore Kuchar . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Czech musicology at the beginning of the 20th century was strongly influenced by Romanticism , in particular by the styles of Wagner and Smetana . Performance practises were conservative , and actively resistant to stylistic innovation . During his lifetime , Janáček reluctantly conceded to Karel Kovařovic 's instrumental rearrangement of Jenůfa , most noticeably in the finale , in which Kovařovic added a more ' festive ' sound of trumpets and French horns , and doubled some instruments to support Janáček 's " poor " instrumentation . The score of Jenůfa was later restored by Charles Mackerras , and is now performed according to Janáček 's original intentions . 
 Another important Czech musicologist , Zdeněk Nejedlý , a great admirer of Smetana and later a communist Minister of Culture , condemned Janáček as an author who could accumulate a lot of material , but was unable to do anything with it . He called Janáček 's style " <unk> " , and his operatic duets " only speech melodies " , without polyphonic strength . Nejedlý considered Janáček rather an amateurish composer , whose music did not conform to the style of Smetana . According to Charles Mackerras , he tried to professionally destroy Janáček . Josef Bartoš , the Czech aesthetician and music critic , called Janáček a " musical eccentric " who clung tenaciously to an imperfect , improvising style , but Bartoš appreciated some elements of Janáček 's works and judged him more positively than Nejedlý . 
 Janáček 's friend and collaborator Václav Talich , former chief @-@ conductor of the Czech Philharmonic , sometimes adjusted Janáček 's scores , mainly for their instrumentation and dynamics ; some critics sharply attacked him for doing so . Talich re @-@ orchestrated Taras Bulba and the Suite from Cunning Little Vixen justifying the latter with the claim that " it was not possible to perform it in the Prague National Theatre unless it was entirely re @-@ orchestrated " . Talich 's rearrangement rather emasculated the specific sounds and contrasts of Janáček 's original , but was the standard version for many years . Charles Mackerras started to research Janáček 's music in the 1960s , and gradually restored the composer 's distinctive scoring . The critical edition of Janáček 's scores is published by the Czech Editio Janáček . 
 = = Inspiration = = 
 Janáček 's style draws on several sources . 
 = = = Folklore = = = 
 Janáček was deeply influenced by folklore , and by Moravian folk music in particular , but not by the pervasive , idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant . He took a realistic , descriptive and analytic approach to the material . Moravian folk songs , compared with their Bohemian counterparts , are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure , and more varied in their melodic intervals . In his study of Moravian modes , Janáček found that the peasant musicians did not know the names of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them . He considered their Moravian modulation , as he called it , a general characteristic of this region 's folk music . 
 Janáček partly composed the original piano accompaniments to more than 150 folk songs , respectful of their original function and context , and partly used folk inspiration in his own works , especially in his mature compositions . His work in this area was not stylistically imitative ; instead , he developed a new and original musical aesthetic based on a deep study of the fundamentals of folk music . Through his systematic notation of folk songs as he heard them , Janáček developed an exceptional sensitivity to the melodies and rhythms of speech , from which he compiled a collection of distinctive segments he called " speech tunes " . He used these " essences " of spoken language in his vocal and instrumental works . The roots of his style , marked by the <unk> of human speech , emerge from the world of folk music . 
 = = = Russia = = = 
 Janáček 's deep and lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture represents another important element of his musical inspiration . In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky 's music , and met the older composer . Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky , and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought in connection with the use of Russian folk motifs . Janáček 's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber , symphonic and operatic output . He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years , and in 1896 , following his first visit of Russia , he founded a Russian Circle in Brno . Janáček read Russian authors in their original language . Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration , though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society . He was twenty @-@ two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme : a melodrama , Death , set to Lermontov 's poem . In his later works , he often used literary models with sharply contoured plots . In 1910 Zhukovsky 's Tale of Tsar <unk> inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano . He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba ( 1918 ) to Gogol 's short story , and five years later , in 1923 , completed his first string quartet , inspired by Tolstoy 's Kreutzer Sonata . Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes : Káťa Kabanová , composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky 's play , The Storm : and his last work , From the House of the Dead , which transformed Dostoyevsky 's vision of the world into an exciting collective drama . 
 = = = Other composers = = = 
 Janáček always deeply admired Antonín Dvořák , to whom he dedicated some of his works . He rearranged part of Dvořák 's Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment . In the early years of the 20th century , Janáček became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers . His opera Destiny was a response to another significant and famous work in contemporary Bohemia – Louise , by the French composer Gustave Charpentier . The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Janáček 's later works , for example in his opera Káťa Kabanová . Although he carefully observed developments in European music , his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes . 
 = = Music theorist = = 
 = = = Musicology = = = 
 Janáček created his music theory works , essays and articles over a period of fifty years , from 1877 to 1927 . He wrote and edited the Hudební listy journal , and contributed to many specialist music journals , such as <unk> , <unk> and Dalibor . He also completed several extensive studies , as <unk> nauka o <unk> ( The Complete Harmony Theory ) , O <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> ( On the Construction of Chords and Their Connections ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Basics of Musical <unk> ) . In his essays and books , Janáček examined various musical topics , forms , melody and harmony theories , dyad and triad chords , counterpoint ( or " <unk> " , meaning " support " ) and devoted himself to the study of the mental composition . His theoretical works stress the Czech term " <unk> " , Janáček 's specific word for rhythm , which has relation to time ( " <unk> " in Czech ) , and the handling of time in music composition . He distinguished several types of rhythm ( <unk> ) : " <unk> " ( sounding ) – meaning any rhythm , " <unk> " ( counting ) – meaning smaller units measuring the course of rhythm ; and " <unk> " ( summing ) – a long value comprising the length of a rhythmical unit . Janáček used the combination of their mutual action widely in his own works .

 Leoš Janáček 's literary legacy represents an important illustration of his life , public work and art between 1875 and 1928 . He contributed not only to music journals , but wrote essays , reports , reviews , <unk> , articles and books . His work in this area comprises around 380 individual items . His writing changed over time , and appeared in many genres . Nevertheless , the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest .

 Janáček came from a region characterized by its deeply rooted folk culture , which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský . His meeting with the folklorist and <unk> František Bartoš ( 1837 – 1906 ) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer , and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs . Janáček became an important collector in his own right , especially of <unk> , Moravian Slovakian , Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs . From 1879 , his collections included transcribed speech intonations . He was one of the organizers of the Czech @-@ Slavic Folklore Exhibition , an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century . From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia , a branch of the Austrian institute Das <unk> in Österreich ( Folksong in Austria ) , which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition . Janáček was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia . In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and became one of the first to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool . Several of these recording sessions have been preserved , and were reissued in 1998 .

 = Washington Square Park ( Chicago ) = 
 Washington Square , also known as Washington Square Park , is a park in Chicago , Illinois . A registered historic landmark that is better known by its nickname Bughouse Square ( derived from the slang of bughouse referring to mental health facilities ) , it was the most celebrated open air free @-@ speech center in the country as well as a popular Chicago tourist attraction . It is located across Walton Street from Newberry Library at 901 N. Clark Street in the Near North Side community area of Chicago , Illinois , USA . It is Chicago 's oldest existing small park . It is one of four Chicago Park District parks named after persons surnamed Washington ( the others being Washington Park , Harold Washington Park , and Dinah Washington Park ) . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 20 , 1991 . 
 = = Origin = = 
 On September 4 , 1842 , the city received a 3 @-@ acre ( 12 @,@ 000 m2 ) parcel that was donated by the members of the American Land Company for use as a public park . The property had once been a cow path with a well for farmers to water their cattle . The donors stipulated the name Washington Square . Between 1869 and the 1890s , the city improved Washington Square with lawn , trees , bisecting diagonal walks , limestone coping , picket fencing , and an attractive Victorian fountain . By the time Alderman McCormick became President of Drainage Board in 1906 , the fountain had been razed and the park had deteriorated . Alderman McCormick devoted his aldermanic salary to improving the park . He donated a $ 600 fountain , and the city allocated an additional $ 10 @,@ 000 to rehabilitate the park . By the 1910s , the neighborhood surrounding Washington Square had become more diverse . 
 = = History = = 
 The original purpose of the neighborhood park was as a place of assembly to discuss community issues . Chicago has a long storied history of public speeches both for entertainment and educational purposes . The Haymarket Riot first started as an anarchist workers rally . Daniel Burnham ’ s March 27 , 1897 lecture for the Commercial Club of Chicago inspired the club to provide $ 80 @,@ 000 to publish the Burnham Plan . 
 Washington Square Park has been the geographic center of Chicago public speeches . By the 1890s the park acquired its Bughouse Square moniker . Soapbox orators waxed on topics ranging from gender relations to Communism . It served as a home for soapbox orators on warm @-@ weather evenings from the 1910s to the mid @-@ 1960s . Like Speakers ' Corner in London 's Hyde Park , Washington Square became a popular spot for soap box orators . Artists , writers , political radicals , and hobos <unk> , lectured , recited poetry , ranted , and raved . A group of regulars formed " The Dil Pickle Club , " devoted to free expression . For years Washington Square orators appointed their own honorary " king . " In its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s , revolutionary left <unk> were occasionally joined by poets , religionists , and cranks . In 1959 , the city transferred Washington Square to the Chicago Park District . In 1964 , Life featured an article saying that it was a meeting place for cottaging among homosexuals . Six years later , it played host to Chicago 's first Gay Pride March .

 Washington Square Historic District is a historic district in Chicago , Illinois that includes Washington Square Park , Chicago . The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 21 , 2003 . The Washington Square District was declared a Chicago Landmark on May 16 , 1990 . The original 1990 Washington Square Park District Chicago Landmark designation included the park , Newberry Library , 60 West Walton Street and 915 to 929 North Dearborn Street .

 = Brand X ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Brand X " is the eighteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on April 16 , 2000 . It was written by Steven Maeda and Greg Walker and directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Brand X " earned a Nielsen household rating of 6 @.@ 8 , being watched by 10 @.@ 81 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) is horrified when the witness who was due to testify against the Morley cigarette company dies mysteriously . After being called into assist , Mulder and Scully soon discover that a new brand of cigarette has a dangerous secret . 
 Inspired by the 1999 film The Insider , " Brand X " was written by Maeda and Walker to be an exploration of the corporate evil inside the cigarette industry . The scenes featuring shots of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors . In one particular scene , over 3 @,@ 000 live insects were used . Those scenes took up to a full day to film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) is charged with guarding the life of Dr. James Scobie , a former researcher who is testifying against his former employer , the Morley tobacco corporation . Prior to his trial , Scobie develops a cough , but shrugs it off . In the morning , Skinner and Scobie 's wife find his body on the bathroom floor , with his face ripped away . 
 Morley has created a form of " super @-@ tobacco " , which is inhabited by a genetically engineered tobacco beetle whose eggs can survive the process of cigarette manufacturing and are released in the smoke of the cigarettes . The cigarettes were tested on a range of subjects by Scobie and his colleague , Dr. Peter Voss . Of the four human test subjects , chain smoker Darryl Weaver is the only surviving participant . Prior to his death , Scobie agreed to give Weaver an unlimited supply of cigarettes in exchange for his silence ; he subsequently pressures Voss into honoring his " arrangement " with Scobie . 
 A chain of victims soon succumb to the eggs contained in the toxic smoke , all of whom are found with their bodies covered in the tobacco beetles . While interviewing Weaver , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) is exposed to the smoke , later coughing up blood and needing his lungs invasively cleared as the beetles begin to hatch . 
 Voss , who had until now been hiding behind his legal advisor , has a change of heart upon hearing of Mulder ’ s condition and tells Skinner of the aforementioned testing . Skinner goes to Weaver ’ s apartment after getting his name from Dr. Voss and finds a man tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth . When Skinner removes the gauze wrapper around the man ’ s mouth , the man chokes and beetles begin crawling from his mouth . At the hospital , Mulder is in grave danger due to the beetle eggs now hatching in his lungs , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) attempts to find a way to save him , because he is now " too weak for thoracic surgery . " 
 Meanwhile , Darryl Weaver attempts to browbeat Skinner , threatening to light one of the toxic cigarettes . As Weaver attempts to leave the building , Skinner shoots Weaver 's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him , leaving him injured and covered in glass . He drops his cigarette to the floor and Skinner dramatically <unk> it out with his shoe . Back at the hospital , Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder ’ s life . She is correct in her solution , noting that Weaver ’ s nicotine tolerance didn ’ t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs . Scully administers nicotine to Mulder , who in turn recovers , albeit with a sore throat , as well as a minor addiction to nicotine , which drove him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself . However , upon some chiding by Scully , he throws them out , but then stares at them pensively after she leaves .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 Originally , the premise of the episode was supposed to be about " the horrifying aspects of over @-@ eating " . However , since an earlier episode , " Hungry " , had dealt with similar themes , the writing staff decided to take the conceit in a different direction and examine the " corporate evil that populates the cigarette industry " . The episode 's writers , Steven Maeda and Greg Walker , were both admitted fans of the The Insider , a 1999 film that examines the tobacco industry , and so the two decided to create an episode with a similar feel . Marc Shapiro , in his book All Things : The Official Guide to the X @-@ Files Volume 6 , noted that the episode was " literally , torn from the headlines " — a rare occurrence for an X @-@ Files episode . 
 Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were busy adding the finishing touches to their own episodes — " Hollywood A.D. " and " All Things " , respectively — the writers struggled with a way to create a convincing story , but not force Mulder and Scully to be in every scene . The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to get sick in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode . Walker noted , " Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time . It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be in a lot of different locations . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In order to match the episode 's theme of smoking , production designer Corey Kaplan was tasked with creating an overall yellow and brown color scheme for the episode . In this manner , each scene was given " a perpetually smoky look " . Kaplan , who had worked together with episode director Kim Manners , had the idea to " enhance " Morley Cigarette 's corporate offices with " long hallways and sets heavy on texture and grit " in order to compliment the aforementioned color scheme . 
 The scenes featuring shots of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors . In particular , during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead , over 3 @,@ 000 live bugs were shot crawling on the body of Mike Hungerford , the portraying actor . Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because " bugs don 't take directions very well , so you pretty much have to wait until they decided to get it right . " Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode , the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect . The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley 's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and " dummy bugs " .

 = Monifieth = 
 Monifieth / <unk> / is a town and former police burgh in the council area of Angus , Scotland . It is situated on the north bank of the Firth of Tay on the east coast . In 2008 , the population of Monifieth was estimated at 8 @,@ 220 , making it the fifth largest town in Angus . 
 The presence of a number of class II and III Pictish stones points to Monifieth having had some importance as an ecclesiastical centre in the early medieval period . The lands were a possession of the Céli Dé monastic order until they were granted to the Tironensian monks of Arbroath Abbey in the early 13th century . Until the early 19th century , Monifieth remained a small village but grew rapidly due to the expansion of the local textile industry . 
 Monifieth is considered a commuter town for its closest city , Dundee , which it is physically attached to . Politically , Monifieth can be seen to be a stronghold of the Scottish National Party , being represented at local , national and European levels by SNP politicians . The town falls within the boundaries of Angus Council but was part of Dundee City Council from 1975 to 1996 . The local constituency boundary and whether Monifieth should fall within Angus or Dundee council areas continues to be a source of debate . 
 Public transport consists mainly of bus services operated by Stagecoach Buses . While the town is notionally served by Monifieth railway station , the station presently operates only a token service . Its nearest major road is the A92 and the town is connected to Dundee by the A930 .

 The name " Monifieth " is generally taken to derive from the Gaelic <unk> Feith , ' Hill of the deer ' . An alternative etymology <unk> <unk> , ' Monks ' Land ' has been suggested , which holds some appeal due to Monifieth 's early status as a possession of the Céli Dé monastic order . 
 <unk> ' has been given various spellings over the years , including ' <unk> ' / ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , and ' <unk> ' , before becoming standardised as ' Monifieth ' on publication of the first edition of the Ordnance Survey maps . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The earliest evidence for occupation of the area surrounding Monifieth dates to the Mesolithic period . Midden pits of that age have been found nearby at <unk> , and worked flints apparently of that age have been found at Balmossie . More tangible evidence for settlement can be found from the Neolithic period , for example with the <unk> monument , identified from cropmarks near Woodhill , between Monifieth and Carnoustie . This cursus is of a similar scale to the well characterised , mid 4th century BC enclosure found nearby at <unk> near Friockheim . Numerous stones incised with cup and ring marks have also been found in the surrounding area . 
 Approximately 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the north of Monifieth lies Laws hill , on which lies the Iron age ruins of a broch and vitrified fort . These ruins are much reduced as the stone from their walls has been used on the estate for construction of dykes and drains , well into the 19th century , and while very little remains of the structure today , tradition recorded in 1842 attests to the walls being 5 foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) tall at the beginning of the 19th century . Artefacts found at and around the site include a quantity of gold coins , iron spear heads and a stone lamp . 
 One artefact found near Laws Hill ( but now lost and only known from an illustration ) is that of a Pictish crescent plate , found in a cist grave which incorporated a later Norse Younger Futhark runic inscription ( <unk> : THA [ ... ] ) . This find is particularly intriguing in light of the paucity of Viking archaeology in this part of Scotland . 
 Domestic remains from the late Prehistoric period can also be found in abundance in the area . Perhaps most well known are the souterrains at <unk> and Ardestie , but cropmarks point to other settlements of that age , for instance at Woodhill . 
 = = = Medieval history = = = 
 Prior to the thirteenth century , the church and lands of Monifieth were possessions of the Céli Dé monastic order . The church was endowed to the recently founded Tironensian abbey of Arbroath by Gille <unk> , Mormaer of Angus , around 1201 @-@ 1207 , and the lands to the south of the Church ( now much reduced in size due to erosion ) in 1242 @-@ 1243 by Matilda , Countess of Angus . A hoard of 700 coins dating to the reigns of Edward I and Edward II were found in this area in 1854 . 
 The present building of St Rule 's Church ( built 1812 ) originally incorporated three Class II and Class III Pictish / Early Medieval sculpted stones , recycled as building stones , including one that had previously been used in the pre @-@ reformation building it replaced . These stones were removed in the mid 19th century and , along with a fourth stone found in an adjoining garden , were donated to the National Museums of Scotland in 1871 . They represent some of the latest Pictish era monuments and can be confidently dated to the late 9th / early 10th centuries . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 Monifieth remained a small village , comprising a number of turf huts until the early 19th century . In the eighteenth century , the economy of the parish was mainly dependent on agriculture . Other industries included quarrying , weaving within the home and the start of manufacturing of linseed oil at a water @-@ powered mill by the Dighty burn , supporting a small community , ' Milltown ' , later named as ' Milton of Monifieth ' . Although Monifieth had no harbour , cargo was off @-@ loaded from vessels on Monifieth Sands ( in the relatively sheltered Firth of Tay ) at low tide and horse @-@ drawn vehicles would move the cargo to nearby destinations . 
 During the 19th century , the village gradually expanded following the introduction of larger scale industries to the area , including manufacture of machinery for flax mills in 1811 . James Low and Robert Fairweather had set up their foundry in the village at the start of the nineteenth century and in 1815 developed the first carding machine for flax tow in the area . With the growth of the textile industry in Dundee and Angus the business grew rapidly , and , by the late nineteenth century , James F Low & Co Ltd was producing a wide range of machines used for the processing and spinning of jute , flax and similar fibres . As well as building machinery for local use , the firm attracted orders from across the world and by the 1880s the Monifieth Foundry employed about 300 workers . The expansion of Monifieth 's industrial economy was aided by the opening of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on 6 October 1838 . This railway , which was originally intended only as a local line , was constructed with an unusual gauge of 5 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 676 mm ) ( shared only with the Arbroath and Forfar Railway ) , later being converted to standard gauge when it was incorporated into the national Rail system . Between 1861 and 1901 , Monifieth 's population more than tripled ; from 558 to 2 @,@ 134 and in 1895 , Monifieth was registered at Forfar Sheriff Court as a burgh . 
 A tramway service was introduced in 1905 , with cars journeying into Dundee City centre at regular intervals . This service was welcomed by the many who travelled daily either from the Burgh into the City on business , or the many hundreds who commuted daily to work in the factories and mills . 
 In 1905 Monifieth gained a Cottage Hospital via a provision made in the will of the Reverend James Gerard Young DD . The Reverend Young had been Minister of Monifieth Parish Church from 1855 until his death in 1899 . The funds he left were used to establish the Gerard Trust which managed the Gerard Cottage Hospital from its opening until it passed into the control of the new National Health Service in 1948 . The hospital closed in 1969 and subsequently became Mary 's Residential Home for the elderly . 
 In the First World War , Monifieth was the cite of a Red Cross Hospital . During the Second World War the Monifieth Foundry was used for the production of war supplies including bombs and aircraft parts .

 Monifieth is represented within Angus Council by the Monifieth & Sidlaw Ward , from which four councillors are elected . The members elected from this ward are , as of 2012 : Craig Fotheringham ( Scottish Conservative and Unionist ) , Sheila Hands ( Scottish National Party ) , Rob Murray ( Scottish National Party ) and Margaret Thomson ( Labour Party ) . 
 The town is part of the Dundee East constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which returns a Member of Parliament ( MP ) to the House of Commons , at Westminster . The constituency 's MP is currently Stewart <unk> of the Scottish National Party . 
 Monifieth is also part of the Angus South constituency of the Scottish Parliament , which has significantly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency . The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) to Holyrood directly , and is part of the North East Scotland electoral region with regards to additional Members of the Scottish Parliament . The constituency 's MSP is currently Graeme Dey of the Scottish National Party . 
 Monifieth 's status in Angus Council has long been the subject of debate , with Dundee City councillors arguing that it should be part of Dundee Council in order to rebalance Dundee City Council Tax revenues . Initial moves were made by the council of Dundee to annex the burgh into Dundee 's boundaries nearly a hundred years ago . In 1913 a petition signed by the residents of Monifieth was presented before Parliament in London and successfully retained Monifieth 's independence . The Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1973 redrew the council boundaries and Monifieth became part of Dundee City Council in 1975 . In 1996 , after Local government reorganisation , Monifieth became part of the Angus council area , after being part of Dundee District in the Tayside region for 21 years .

 Monifieth occupies a position on the north bank of the Firth of Tay on the east coast of Scotland , on land immediately to the west of the Buddon Ness , 6 miles ( 10 km ) E of Dundee , 10 @.@ 3 miles ( 17 km ) WSW of Arbroath , and 11 @.@ 3 miles ( 18 km ) S of Forfar . The town lies 38 @.@ 4 miles ( 62 km ) NNE of Edinburgh , and 360 @.@ 3 miles ( 580 km ) NNW of London . The built @-@ up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape 1 @.@ 2 miles ( 2 km ) long by 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 km ) wide , aligned in an ENE direction . The land is relatively flat , rising gradually to around 50m elevation to the North of the town at South Grange . 
 The town occupies the southern part of the Parish of Monifieth , at the South Western most corner of the county of Angus , and incorporates a number of former villages and Hamlets , including Ashludie , Milton and South Grange . Contiguous to the town , on the West side of the county boundary , is Barnhill and <unk> Village and the Dundee conurbation . To the East is a 2 @.@ 7 miles ( 4 km ) expanse of rural land between the town and the village of Barry and town of Carnoustie . This rural area includes a number of farmsteads and hamlets , including Lucknow , West <unk> , Ardestie , <unk> and Woodhill , as well as the Monifieth golf courses and Panmure golf course . 
 To the south of this , on the southern side of the railway , is the peninsula of the Buddon Ness , on which lies the Ministry of Defence owned Barry Buddon training camp . This land is classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation . 
 The Buddon Ness is a triangle of land around 11 km2 . Its position at the estuary of the River Tay makes it prone to erosion , and the position of both the West and East facing shores have changed considerably over the years . Comparison of Ordnance Survey maps from the mid @-@ 19th century with present @-@ day maps show the shoreline retreating on the West shore and advancing on the East shore . 
 To the north of the town runs the A92 , between Dundee and Arbroath . Beyond this lies the farms of North Grange , Balmossie and <unk> and Ethiebeaton retail and leisure park , as well as Roman Hill , Gallow Hill and Laws Hill . The Edinburgh to Aberdeen railway line runs along the South of the town , separating the built @-@ up area from the Blue Seaway leisure area and the two caravan sites . The A930 runs through the town east to west from Barry to Barnhill . 
 The western political boundary of the town is marked by West Grange Road , leading south from the West Grange roundabout on the A92 , the cycle track that goes from West Grange Road over the Seven Arches viaduct over the Dighty Burn ( once part of the Dundee to Forfar Railway ) , around Monifieth High School grounds , between Inchkeith Avenue and Balmossie Place , and down North and South Balmossie Street to the river bank . 
 = = Demography = = 
 Accurate demographic information for Monifieth is complicated by the town 's inclusion in the Dundee locality in the 2001 census . Estimates from 2008 put the population at 8 @,@ 220 . 
 Almost 2 @,@ 400 Monifieth residents ( approximately 29 % of the population ) travel to work or study in Dundee . Assuming that the figure of 73 % in Angus being between the ages of 16 and 65 , holds for Monifieth then this represents a figure of 40 % of people of working age . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Monifieth 's proximity to Dundee is a key feature of its economy . Approximately 40 % of working age residents commute to Dundee for work or to study . 
 Monifieth has a small retail and leisure complex to the north of the town at Ethiebeaton , which comprises a garden centre , a gym and a department store which sells local produce . There is also a shopping area centred around the high street , which has a variety of businesses . 
 Tourism plays a small but significant role in Monifieth 's economy and has benefited from the area 's associations with golf .

 To the west side of the town there is the Dighty Water . It begins in the Sidlaw Hills and runs 15 miles east @-@ southeast where it meets the Firth of Tay . At least two mills are known to have existed beside the burn : the Milton Mill and the Balmossie Mill . The Milton Mill , which opened in 1788 as a flax spinning mill , was part of the Milton industrial area . It is the oldest water @-@ powered flax mill in Angus . The mill , which is a category B listed building , suffered significant fire damage in June 2006 . Initially , the mill was not permitted to be demolished but , in April 2010 , it was agreed by the Angus Development Standards Committee that the building was " beyond saving " and demolition was permitted . Demolition of surrounding buildings was already under way , clearing the way for a housing development . 
 The Balmossie Mill , the smaller of the two mills , was a water mill . Remains of a water wheel and machinery is evident . The exact date of the building is unknown but in 1692 two local men were recorded by local newspapers for poaching . The Balmossie Mill is a category B listed building . 
 Continuing eastwards from the Milton Mill , along Ferry Road and Maule Street towards the town centre , Monifieth 's war memorial is situated . The memorial was dedicated in 1921 and was built by Charles Soutar . The design includes a sculpture of an angel warrior figure with a sword and laurel wreath .

 Paro Taktsang ( Dzongkha : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ spa <unk> stag tshang / spa <unk> stag tshang ) is the popular name of Taktsang <unk> Monastery ( also known as Tiger 's Nest ) , a prominent Himalayan Buddhist sacred site and temple complex , located in the cliffside of the upper Paro valley , in Bhutan . A temple complex was first built in 1692 , around the Taktsang Senge <unk> ( stag tshang seng ge <unk> grub ) cave where Guru Padmasambhava is said to have meditated for three years , three months , three weeks , three days and three hours in the 8th century . Padmasambhava is credited with introducing Buddhism to Bhutan and is the tutelary deity of the country . Today , Paro Taktsang is the best known of the thirteen <unk> or " tiger lair " caves in which he meditated . 
 The Guru <unk> @-@ brgyad Lhakhang , the temple devoted to Padmasambhava ( also known as Gu @-@ ru <unk> @-@ brgyad Lhakhang , " the Temple of the Guru with Eight Names " ) is an elegant structure built around the cave in 1692 by <unk> Tenzin Rabgye ; and has become the cultural icon of Bhutan . A popular festival , known as the <unk> , held in honor of Padmasambhava , is celebrated in the Paro valley sometime during March or April . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background and legends = = = 
 According to the legend related to this Taktsang ( which in Tibetan language is spelt ( stag tshang ) which literally means " Tiger 's lair " , it is believed that Padmasambhava ( Guru Rinpoche ) flew to this location from Tibet on the back of a tigress from <unk> . This place was consecrated to tame the Tiger demon . 
 An alternative legend holds that a former wife of an emperor , known as Yeshe <unk> , willingly became a disciple of Guru Rinpoche ( Padmasambahva ) in Tibet . She transformed herself into a tigress and carried the Guru on her back from Tibet to the present location of the Taktsang in Bhutan . In one of the caves here , the Guru then performed meditation and emerged in eight incarnated forms ( manifestations ) and the place became holy . Subsequently , the place came to be known as the “ Tiger 's Nest ” . 
 The popular legend of the Taktsang monastery is further embellished with the story of Tenzin Rabgye , who built the temple here in 1692 . It has been mentioned by authors that the 8th century guru <unk> had reincarnated again in the form of Tenzin Rabgye . The corroborative proofs mooted are : that Tenzin Rabgye was seen ( by his friends ) concurrently inside and outside his cave ; even a small quantity of food was adequate to feed all visitors ; no one was injured during worship ( in spite of the approach track to the monastery being dangerous and slippery ) ; and the people of the Paro valley saw in the sky various animal forms and religious symbols including a shower of flowers that appeared and also vanished in the air without touching the earth . 
 = = = Establishment as a meditation site = = = 
 As noted before , the monastery was built around the Taktsang Senge <unk> ( stag tshang seng ge <unk> grub ) cave , where custom holds that the Indian Guru Padmasambahva meditated in the 8th century . He flew to this place from Tibet on the back of Yeshe <unk> , whom he transformed into a flying tigress for the purpose and landed at the cliff , which he " anointed " as the place for building a monastery . He established Buddhism and the Nyingmapa school of Mahayana Buddhism in Bhutan , and has been considered the “ protector saint of Bhutan ” . Later , <unk> visited Bumthang district to subdue a powerful deity offended by a local king . Padmasambhava 's body imprint is stated to be imprinted on the wall of a cave near <unk> Lhakhang temple . In 853 , <unk> <unk> Singye came to the cave to meditate and gave his name of <unk> to the cave , " <unk> 's cave " . After he died later in Nepal , his body was said to have been miraculously returned to the monastery by the grace of the deity Dorje <unk> ; it is now said to be sealed in a <unk> in a room to the left at the top of the entrance stairway . The <unk> was restored in 1982 @-@ 83 and again in 2004 . 
 From the 11th century , many Tibetan saints and eminent figures came to Taktsang to meditate , including <unk> ( 1040 – 1123 ) , Pha <unk> Sangye ( died 1117 ) , the Tibetan yogini <unk> <unk> ( 1055 – 1145 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1385 – 1464 ) . In the latter part of the 12th century , the Lapa School was established in Paro . Between 12th and 17th centuries , many Lamas who came from Tibet established their monasteries in Bhutan . The first sanctuary to be built in the area dates to the 14th century when Sonam <unk> , a Nyingmapa lama of the <unk> branch came from Tibet . The paintings he brought can still be faintly discerned on a rock above the principal building although there is no trace of the original one . The Taktsang Ugyen Tsemo complex , which was rebuilt after a fire in 1958 is said to date back to 1408 . Taktsang remained under the authority of the <unk> lamas for centuries until the mid 17th century .

 In the 17th century the well @-@ known <unk> Pema Lingpa of Bumthang , who founded many monasteries in various parts of Bhutan , was also instrumental in creating religious and secular dance forms from his conception of the ' <unk> <unk> ' ( the Copper Colored mountain ) , which was the abode of the Guru Padmasambahva ( which is the same place as the Paro Taktsang or Tiger 's nest ) . This dance is performed in Paro as the <unk> festival . But it was during the time of Ngawang Namgyal of the Drukpa subsect , who fled Tibet to escape persecution by the opposing sect of the Gelugpa order ( which dominated Tibet under the Dalai Lamas ) , that an administrative mechanism was established in Bhutan . 
 In due time , he established himself in Bhutan as a ' model of rulership ' and was known as the " Shabdrung " with full authority . He wanted to establish an edifice at the Taktsang Pel Phuk site . It was during a Tibetan invasion of Bhutan in 1644 @-@ 46 that Shabdrung and his Tibetan Nyingmapa teacher <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> @-@ po had invoked Padmasambhava and the protective deities at Taktsang to give them success over the invaders . He performed the <unk> ’ brgyad <unk> ’ <unk> rituals associated with the celebrations of Tshechu . Bhutan won the war against Tibet However , Shabdrung was not able to build a temple at <unk> to celebrate the event , even though he very much wanted to do so . 
 The wish of Shabdrung to build a temple here , however , was fulfilled during the 4th Druk Desi Tenzin Rabgye ( 1638 – 96 ) , the first , and only successor of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ dbang <unk> @-@ rgyal ) , " a distant cousin from a collateral line descending from the 15th century ‘ crazy saint ’ Drukpa <unk> " . During his visit to the sacred cave of Taktsang Pel Phuk during the Tshechu season of 1692 he laid the foundation for building the temple dedicated to Guru Rinpoche called the ‘ Temple of the Guru with Eight Names ’ ( ’ gu ru mtshan brgyad lha @-@ khang ) . It was a decision taken by Tenzin Rabgye while standing at the cave overlooking the Paro valley . At this time , he was leading the Tshechu festival of religious dances . At that time the only temples reported to be in existence , at higher elevations , were the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and Ugyen Tsemo ( Urgyan <unk> @-@ mo ) . 
 = = = Fire Destruction = = = 
 On April 19 , 1998 , a fire broke out in the main building of the monastery complex , which contained valuable paintings , artifacts and statues . The fire is believed to have been caused by electrical short @-@ circuiting or flickering butter lamps lighting the hanging tapestries . A monk also died during the fire . The restoration works were undertaken at an estimated cost of 135 million <unk> . The Government of Bhutan and the then King of Bhutan , Jigme Singye Wangchuck , oversaw the restoration of the damaged monastery and its contents in 2005 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The monastery is located 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to the north of Paro and hangs on a precipitous cliff at 3 @,@ 120 metres ( 10 @,@ 240 ft ) , about 900 metres ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) above the Paro valley , on the right side of the Paro Chu ( ‘ chu ’ Bhutanese means ” river or water ” . ] ) . The rock slopes are very steep ( almost vertical ) and the monastery buildings are built into the rock face . Though it looks formidable , the monastery complex has access from several directions , such as the northwest path through the forest , from the south along the path used by devotees , and from the north ( access over the rocky plateau , which is called the “ Hundred Thousand Fairies ” known as <unk> ( <unk> @-@ brag ) . A mule track leading to it passes through pine forest that is colorfully festooned with moss and prayer flags . On many days , clouds shroud the monastery and give an eerie feeling of remoteness . 
 On the approach path to the monastery , there is a Lakhang ( village level monastery ) and a temple of Urgyan Tsemo ( " U @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ mo " ) which , like the main monastery , is located on a rocky plateau with a precipitous projection of several hundred feet over the valley . From this location , the monastery ’ s buildings are on the opposite ravine , which is known by the name “ Copper @-@ Colored Mountain Paradise of Padmasambhava ” . This is the view point for visitors and there is a cafeteria to provide refreshments . The trek beyond this point is very scenic with the sound of the water fall breaking the silence . Along the trek route blue pine trees , prayer flags and kiosks selling paraphernalia for worship ( such as prayer wheels , temple bells and skulls ) are seen . The route is scattered with number of temples . On this path , a large water fall , which drops by 60 metres ( 200 ft ) into a sacred pool , is forded over by a bridge . The track terminates at the main monastery where colorful paintings are displayed . Guru Rinpoche 's cave where he meditated is also seen . This cave is opened for public viewing only once a year .

 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The monastery buildings consist of four main temples and residential shelters ideally designed by adapting to the rock ( granite ) ledges , the caves and the rocky terrain . Out of the eight caves , four are comparatively easy to access . The cave where <unk> first entered , riding the Tiger , is known as ' <unk> Phuk ' and the original cave where he resided and did meditation is known as the ' Pel Phuk ' . He directed the spiritually enlightened monks to build the monastery here . The monastery is so precariously perched that it is said : " it clings to the side of the mountain like a gecko " . The main cave is entered through a narrow passage . The dark cave houses a dozen images of Bodhisattvas and butter lamps flicker in front of these idols . An elegant image of <unk> ( <unk> ) is also deified here . In an adjoining small cell , the sacred scripture is placed ; the importance of this scripture is that it has been scripted with gold dust and the crushed bone powder of a divine Lama . It is also said that the monks who practice Vajrayana Buddhism ( the formal State Religion of Bhutan ) at this cave monastery live here for three years and seldom go down to the Paro valley . 
 All the buildings are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks . There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over . The temple at the highest level has a frieze of Buddha . Each building has a balcony , which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below . The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks , as hermitages .

The present caretaker of the place is said to be an old nun supported by a young trainee . 
 Another important place near the shrine is the Urgyan Tsemo , the “ Peak of Urgyan ” which has a small Mani Lakhang . The prayer wheel , turned by an old monk , resounds with chimes that are heard every day at 4 am . Above the Urgyan is the holy cave temple known as ' <unk> Lakhang ' ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ khang ) , which is the main shrine of the Taktshang .

 The “ Copper @-@ Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva ” ( <unk> ) is vividly displayed in a heart shape on every <unk> and also painted on the walls of the monastery as a constant reminder of the legend . The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis ( <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ma ) , and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma . The paintings also depict <unk> ( Naga ) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent , which are said to reside in lakes ( said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures ) . Allegorically , they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings . The paintings also show what is termed as “ Walkers in the Sky ” ( <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ma ) . 
 The holy hill is drawn in the backdrop with four faces painted with different colors – the east face is in crystal white color , the south face is yellow , the west is in red color and the north has green color . The palace has four sides and eight corners with its lower and upper tiers adorned with jewels . The courtyard with four enclosures is said to represent four kinds of conduct . The walls are built with bricks , balconies have been bejewelled with religious symbols . The ambience is shown in the form of wishing trees , fountains of the water of life , rain bows in five colors with cloud formations and light emanating from lotus flowers . The palace is also shown with a throne with eight corners fully and curiously bejewelled . <unk> is shown sitting on a pure stalk of lotus emitting divine energy appearing “ divine , charitable , powerful , or fierce ” . 
 Further detailing depicted on the four faces and eight corners , are five kinds of Buddhas suppressing the vicious demons ( performing four pious deeds ) and placed on thrones that are mounted over the stooping demons . The demons and <unk> are depicted adorned and seated on four petalled and four faced thrones “ adorned with <unk> attributes ” enjoying a good time ; the <unk> are seen on the four @-@ sided courtyard of the palace and also on all side walls . 
 The scene is further embellished around the Guru Rinpoche ( <unk> ) image and also in the palace , with gods and goddesses in the heavens , with gate keepers at the four gates with an army of messengers and servants ; all trying to crush the demons to dust . The supporting staff shown are said to represent the Himalayan tribes of pre @-@ Buddhist periods . <unk> ( 2008 ) describes his trek to this unbelievable location .

 = = Development = = 
 Star Wars Jedi Knight : Mysteries of the Sith was developed and published by LucasArts as an expansion to Star Wars Jedi Knight : Dark Forces II . Mysteries of the Sith 's development team was led by Stephen Shaw , the lead programmer for LucasArts titles Full Throttle and Outlaws . Development commenced immediately after Outlaws 's completion in 1997 , which ensured the game 's quick release following that of Dark Forces II . 
 Being an expansion to Dark Forces II , Mysteries of the Sith requires the Dark Forces II CD @-@ ROM the first time the player starts the game . LucasArts has made improvements to the 3D engine used in Dark Forces II by including colored lighting . The full motion video cut scenes that were used between levels in Dark Forces II have been replaced with cinematics rendered by the 3D engine . 
 The artificial intelligence has been developed further to produce more realistic actions from the NPCs . The hostile and non @-@ hostile NPCs can fight amongst each other with little or no input from the player . Another improvement is that if a player were to use " Force pull " to take weapons away from enemies in Dark Forces II , the enemies would walk around doing nothing ; by contrast , in Mysteries of the Sith the enemies attempt to defeat the player by punching them . 
 According to Stephen Shaw , most of Mysteries of the Sith 's content was inspired by Timothy Zahn 's <unk> trilogy of books ; one of the game 's protagonists , Mara Jade , was drawn directly from the novels . Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game , new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Sith 's scenario , including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II . Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese , a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi and elsewhere in the Star Wars universe . The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Mysteries of the Sith was well received by critics . It holds an aggregate score of 75 @.@ 60 % on GameRankings , based on five reviews . The game has been described as a good quality expansion pack and a " worthy addition " to the world of Jedi Knight , but with room for improvement in some areas . 
 The gameplay of the single @-@ player mode received mixed reactions . Paul Mallinson of PC Zone stated that " Mysteries Of The Sith starts off brilliantly and gets better and better and better the further you get into it . The progressive nature of the constantly evolving storyline sees to that . " In contrast , Michael E. Ryan of GameSpot stated that the game is uneven and the challenging levels are only at the end . This adversely affects the gameplay by creating a steep change in how the game must be played . General aspects of the gameplay were seen as improvements , such as the artificial intelligence . 
 The multiplayer side of Mysteries of the Sith was received positively , but did not completely escape criticism . Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that were present in the single @-@ player mode . One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single @-@ player level but is not in any multiplayer maps . 
 The development of the graphics in Mysteries of the Sith was seen as an improvement with particular praise for the new colored lighting effects . However , not all new graphical developments were well received and some reviews highlighted that smoke effects from the carbonite weapon are particularly poor . Ryan criticized the whole graphical implementation of the weapon : " The <unk> gun was a long awaited weapon , but the effects and the resulting graphic for frozen foes are really quite bad . " 
 Mysteries of the Sith received praise for its use of sound . Heidi Shannon was described as an " excellent choice " for the voice of Mara Jade . The musical soundtrack by John Williams received specific commendation for its quality . Pagliarulo stated that its use is executed very well within the game : " Mysteries of the Sith manages to use the right piece [ of music ] at just the right moment . " 
 = Brother 's Little Helper = 
 " Brother 's Little Helper " is the second episode of The Simpsons ' 11th season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 3 , 1999 . In the episode , Bart floods the school gymnasium , which prompts the school 's principal Seymour Skinner to diagnose Bart with ADHD . Bart is prescribed a psychostimulant drug called Focusyn ( a parody of Ritalin ) , and initially starts paying more attention to his studies . After a while however , Bart starts turning psychotic and is convinced that Major League Baseball is watching over the people of Springfield . 
 The episode was directed by director Mark Kirkland and was the first episode staff writer George Meyer received a sole writing credit for since the season 5 episode " Bart 's Inner Child " . Meyer , who was facing some psychological difficulties while writing the episode , felt so dissatisfied with the episode 's first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym . The episode satirizes the perceived misdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children , which was a controversial topic at the time the episode was written . The episode 's title is a parody of The Rolling Stones song " Mother 's Little Helper " , which was also written on the topic of psychological medication . 
 The episode features former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire as himself . Finishing in 51st place , ratings for " Brother 's Little Helper " were considered disappointing by Deseret News , although the episode became the most watched program on the network that night . Following its broadcast , the episode was positively received by critics . In response to the episode , five months after the episode originally aired , United States president Bill Clinton held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health .

 Principal Skinner introduces a fire safety skit to the students . When Ned Flanders catches on fire , the fire department tries to extinguish him by rolling . This only spreads the flames further , and when they attempt to use the fire hose to put it out , they discover Bart has used it to flood the school gymnasium . Eventually a tidal wave of water bursts from the gym , drenching the school yard and putting out Flanders . Skinner has Homer and Marge come to the school , where they learn Bart has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) . Principal Skinner tells Marge and Homer that Bart must take a radical , untested new behavioral medicine called Focusyn or Skinner will have to expel him . 
 After several failed attempts by Homer ( including naming several celebrities on drugs , such as Mötley Crüe 's Tommy Lee , sitcom actress Brett Butler , and actor / comedian Andy Dick , and offering Bart taffy laced with several Focusyn pills sticking out ) , Marge convinces Bart to take the medication . His behavior immediately improves . He begins paying attention in school and being respectful to his parents ( even tutoring a Navajo boy in his spare time ) . However , Bart begins to suffer from drug psychosis and he starts to develop Paranoia , claiming that Major League Baseball is spying on the town using satellites . The doctors recommend that Bart go off Focusyn , but he refuses . Before anyone can stop him , he swallows several handfuls of Focusyn and runs away . 
 Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army base and manages to hijack a tank . He cuts a swath of destruction through the town , until he eventually stops at the school . There , he points the tank 's cannon into the sky and shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite ; inside are detailed documents on everybody 's behaviors . Mark McGwire appears , but instead of explaining the bizarre situation , he distracts the townspeople by asking “ Do you want to know the terrifying truth , or do you want to see me sock a few <unk> ? ” ( the latter choice being selected by everybody present ) ; he accommodates them , and then hides the evidence under his cap . Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on " hugs , fresh air , and good old @-@ fashioned Ritalin " . Major League Baseball , however , is still able to spy on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart , with which he hit his 70th home run of the 1998 Major League Baseball season , which contains equipment that notes down every detail of the Simpsons ' house at 742 Evergreen Terrace .

 " Brother 's Little Helper " , which was originally called " Bart a Go Go " , was written by staff writer George Meyer and directed by director Mark Kirkland . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 3 , 1999 . After the season 5 episode " Bart 's Inner Child " , Meyer got " a little burned out on writing scripts " , so he wrote " Brother 's Little Helper " in order to " try [ his ] hand again " . While writing the episode , Meyer was going through " some psychological problems " and found the episode very difficult to write . He was initially so dissatisfied with the first draft that he turned it in with a pseudonym ; Vance Jericho . Co @-@ producer Tim Long jokingly commented that the script was " literally moist with contempt " but went on to say that it was in fact " an amazing draft " . The writers discussed what sort of rampage Bart would go on during the second act , and writer Matt Selman suggested that Bart obtain a tank . In the DVD audio commentary for the episode , Selman stated that he got the idea from watching a news report about " a guy " who had died while " [ going ] nuts with a tank " . 
 To show the side effects Focusyn had on Bart , the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed . It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading " The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre @-@ teens " : a cheek line is added just under his eyes to suggest that he is starting to change . In another scene , Bart can be seen speed reading and later on , the animators drew him with " mini @-@ pupils " . The staff discussed whether Bart 's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug . The writers settled on smaller pupils and , according to Kirkland , " several model sheets were going back and forth over the fax machines " until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart 's pupils while influenced by the drug . In fact , psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger ( dilated ) . 
 In the scene where he escapes the laboratory , Bart can be seen swallowing a handful of pills on his way out . Originally , Bart was supposed to " upend " an entire jar of Focusyn , but , according to Meyer , the censors wouldn 't allow it . The scientists who prescribe Focusyn to Bart are based on one of The Simpsons ' staff members and his wife . They were voiced by Hank Azaria and Tress MacNeille , respectively . Azaria also voiced Sir <unk> , one of the clowns in Krusty 's car , as well as one of the marine soldiers . Former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire guest starred as himself in the episode . Mike Scully , an executive producer and the show runner for the episode , commented that McGwire was " probably the biggest man [ he 'd ] ever seen " and that he " did a great job for [ them ] " .

 According to Genevieve Koski , Josh Modell , Noel Murray , Sean O 'Neal , Kyle Ryan , and Scott Tobias of The A.V Club , the ' 90s saw a " dramatic increase " in diagnoses of behavioral disorders , such as ADHD , in children , and debates over whether or not to medicate children with concentration difficulties were heated . Meyer , inspired by the debates , decided to write the episode to be about the subject . The episode criticizes how children with school issues are being misdiagnosed as having ADHD , as well as the prescription of psychostimulants to children in general . This in particular is shown in a scene in the Springfield Elementary schoolyard . In the scene , it is revealed that the general populace of the school is medicated for various misdiagnosed behavior disorders . Meyer himself was not entirely sure about his stance on the issue , however . He stated that " for all I know , the drugs help [ the children ] and help the world . " However , he went on to say that " I just have a feeling they 're gonna be a disaster . Down the line . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Focusyn , the fictional psychoactive drug that is prominently featured throughout the episode , is based on the real @-@ life medicine Ritalin , which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD . Hosey the Bear , which can be seen in the beginning of the episode , is a reference to the United States Forest Service 's mascot Smokey Bear . After Bart has flooded the school gym , Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy . The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind @-@ altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson , a man infamous for a similar , albeit serious , incident . A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen . The scene is a reference to Tank Man , the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro @-@ democracy protesters from Beijing 's Tiananmen Square . 
 Other things referenced include the film Showgirls ( 1995 ) , which Homer and Marge go to see . Homer says that , since taking Focusyn , Bart has gone " from <unk> to Gallant " , a reference to the characters <unk> and Gallant from the children 's magazine Highlights . When Lou sketches Bart based on Homer and Marge 's description he ends up drawing Dennis from the comic strip Dennis the Menace . A shirt at the military base Fort <unk> reads " I Went to the Persian Gulf and All I Got Was This <unk> Syndrome " , a reference to Gulf War syndrome .

 In its original American broadcast on October 3 , 1999 , " Brother 's Little Helper " finished at no . 51 in the ratings , according to Nielsen Media Research , making it the most watched television program on Fox that night . Despite being the most watched program of the network , the ratings were considered disappointing by the Deseret News . On October 7 , 2008 , the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Eleventh Season DVD box set . Mike Scully , George Meyer , Mark Kirkland , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , Matt Selman and Tim Long participated in the DVD audio commentary of the episode . 
 Following its broadcast , " Brother 's Little Helper " received positive reviews from critics . About nine years after its original broadcast , Robert Canning of IGN posted a " flashback review " of " Brother 's Little Helper " . Canning , calling the episode " funny " and " a standout episode in this later season , " was particularly fond of the episode 's opening . However , he was less impressed with the third act of the episode , calling it " lackluster . " He felt that the part involving Mark McGwire was " a silly cop out " and that it wasn 't as funny as what was leading up to it . He also stated that he was put off by the writers wanting to come across a message . " It 's not that I necessarily disagreed with this sentiment , " Canning wrote , " but at the time , I didn 't think I needed to be taught a lesson while I watched The Simpsons . I still don 't . " He did , however , " love " the " tag back " to the volunteer fire department seen in the beginning of the episode , and " the fact that they can 't find how to fight a satellite fire in their handbook . " 
 In his review of The Simpsons - The Complete Eleventh Season , Brian Tallerico of The Deadbolt considered " Brother 's Little Helper " to be one of the season 's best episodes . Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was favorable as well , calling the episode " pretty good " and that it " provides some good laughs . " He especially liked seeing Bart well @-@ behaved . He also appreciated the episode 's message , writing that " the show offers a clever spotlight on [ the ] issue . " He did , however , dislike the characterization of Bart. He wrote that Bart is normally " not particularly overactive or distractible , " and that the writers " trie [ d ] to make [ Bart ] seem more hyper than normal . " He concluded by saying that " Bart 's a behavior problem but not ADHD . " 
 Five months after the episode aired , Bill Clinton , who served as president of the United States at the time , held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health . Scripps Howard News Service columnist Deroy Murdock mentioned the timeliness of the conference in connection with the episode as being an instance of The Simpsons " <unk> predict [ ing ] the news . " In 2007 , the fictional word " exorcism tongs " appeared in Cracked.com 's list " From Cromulent to <unk> : The Top 12 Simpsons Created Words " , ranking in at number 10 . The word is used in a scene in which Homer eats a mixture of taffy and Focusyn , which puts him in a " mildly hallucinogenic state . " Seeing this , Todd Flanders asks his father , Ned , " Does Mr. Simpson have a demon , daddy ? " To which Ned replies , " Looks like it . Run and get daddy 's exorcism tongs . " About the word , Mark Peters and Daniel O ' Brien of Cracked.com wrote " We 'd be lying if we said we didn 't go out to every Christian @-@ themed general store in the country hoping to acquire our very own set of exorcism tongs the day this episode aired .

 Tomb Raider is an action @-@ adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix . Tomb Raider is the tenth title in the Tomb Raider franchise , and operates as a reboot that emphasises the reconstructed origins of Lara Croft . Tomb Raider was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , and on 23 January 2014 for OS X , and on 27 April 2016 for Linux . 
 Crystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider : Underworld in 2008 . Rather than a sequel , the team decided to completely reboot the series , establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time , following Tomb Raider : Legend . Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai , an island from which Lara , who is untested and not yet the battle @-@ hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series , must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult . Gameplay elements focus more on survival , although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs . It is also the first game in the series to have multiplayer and the first game to be published by Square Enix , after the latter 's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009 . Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010 , replacing Keeley Hawes . 
 After a delayed release from late 2012 to March 2013 , Tomb Raider received much anticipation and hype . Upon release , the game was well received , with critics praising the graphics , the gameplay , Luddington 's performance as Lara , and Lara 's characterization and development , although the addition of the multiplayer mode was not well received . Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release , and has sold more than 8 @.@ 5 million copies as of April 2015 , making it the best @-@ selling Tomb Raider title to date . An updated version , Tomb Raider : Definitive Edition , was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC . A sequel , Rise of the Tomb Raider , was released in November 2015 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Tomb Raider is presented in third @-@ person perspective . Players take control of the series lead character Lara Croft . The game uses an interconnected hub @-@ and @-@ spoke model that combines action @-@ adventure , exploration , and survival mechanics . Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths , improvised or already @-@ available ziplines and climbable tracks . Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics , with some tweaks added , such as incorporating elements of stealth gameplay . Quick Time Events are scattered at regular intervals throughout the game , often appearing at crucial or fast @-@ moving points in the game 's plot , such as extracting a shard of metal , and escaping a collapsing cave . 
 The combat of the game borrows multiple elements from Naughty Dog 's Uncharted series , with players having the ability to free @-@ aim Lara 's bow and the guns she salvages , engage in close @-@ quarter combat and perform stealth kills . Players can also use Survival Instinct , an ability in which enemies , collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players . The game also incorporates RPG elements : as players progress through the game , they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in @-@ game challenges linked with hunting , exploring and combat : this enables players ' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways , such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition . Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island . There is also a character progression mechanic in the game : better items , weapons and equipment are gained as players progress , though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story . In addition to the main story , players can complete multiple side quests , explore the island , revisit locations , and search for challenge tombs . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Alongside the single @-@ player mode is an online multiplayer mode , which allows players to compete in several maps . In each multiplayer match , there are two enemy teams : four survivors and four scavengers , and there are three types of games for multiplayer to compete in , played in five different maps : the modes are Team Deathmatch , Private Rescue and Cry for Help . The first mode is a simple PvP combat scenario , with teams pitted against each other , and the winning team being the one to kill the opposing team in three separate matches . In the second mode , the " survivors " team must take medical supplies to a specific point on the map , while the " scavengers " must reach a certain number of kills , both within a ten @-@ minute time limit . The third mode , Cry for Help , involves the " survivors " exploring the maps and retrieving batteries for defended radio beacons while being hunted by the " scavengers " . Across all three modes , weapons and <unk> environments from the single @-@ player campaign are carried over .

 The game is set on Yamatai , a fictional lost island in the Dragon 's Triangle off the coast of Japan . The island — and the kingdom that once existed there — is shrouded in mystery , given its reputation for fearsome storms and shipwrecks that litter its coastline . Yamatai was once ruled by a queen named Himiko , known by her honorific title of " Sun Queen " , who according to legend was blessed with shamanistic powers that enabled her to control the weather . Very little is known about Yamatai 's history in the time since Himiko 's death , other than that the island 's infamy was established shortly thereafter . In exploring the island , the player may find evidence that — among others — Portuguese traders , United States Marines and a Japanese military project were all stranded on Yamatai at various points throughout history . At the start of the game , the island is populated exclusively by the Solarii Brotherhood , a violent cult of criminals , mercenaries and shipwreck survivors . The Solarii Brotherhood has established its own society based on the worship of Himiko , complete with a social structure and laws , with their exact purpose and intentions being explored over the course of the story . 
 The player takes on the role of Lara , who is a young and ambitious archaeology graduate whose theories on the location of the lost kingdom of Yamatai have convinced the Nishimura family — descendants from the people of Yamatai themselves — to fund an expedition in search of the kingdom . The expedition is led by Dr. James Whitman , a celebrity archaeologist who has fallen on hard times and is desperate to avoid bankruptcy , and is accompanied by Conrad Roth , a Royal Marine turned adventurer and close friend of the Croft family who serves as mentor to Lara ; Samantha " Sam " Nishimura , Lara 's friend and a representative of the Nishimura family who films the expedition for a documentary ; Joslyn Reyes , a skeptical and temperamental mechanic and single mother ; Jonah Maiava , an imposing and placid fisherman who is willing to believe in the existence of the paranormal and esoteric ; Angus " Grim " Grimaldi , the gruff Glaswegian helmsman of the Endurance ; and Alex Weiss , a goofy and bespectacled electronics specialist .

 The game begins with Lara setting out on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance , with the intention of finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai . By her suggestion and against Whitman 's advice , the expedition ventures into the Dragon 's Triangle , east of Japan . The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked , leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island . Lara is separated from the others and captured by a strange , savage man . She manages to escape while her captor is killed as the cave collapses due to her actions . 
 As Lara tries to locate the other survivors , she finds more evidence that the island is inhabited , such as strange carvings , dead bodies , and animal sacrifices . She eventually finds her friend Sam and a man called Mathias , who claims to be a teacher who was shipwrecked on the island . As Sam tells Mathias the legends of Himiko , Lara passes out ; when she wakes , Mathias and Sam are nowhere in sight . 
 When Lara regroups with the other survivors , Whitman decides to go with Lara and search for the still @-@ missing Roth , while the rest of the group ( Reyes , Jonah , Alex , and Grim ) set out to find Sam and Mathias . As Lara and Whitman explore , they discover that the island 's inhabitants worship Himiko , confirming that the island is Yamatai . Upon discovering a shrine erected in Himiko 's name , they are captured by the islanders and taken to a settlement along with several other survivors from the Endurance . When the survivors attempt an escape , the captors turn on them . Lara is separated from Whitman and tries to hide , but is found by one of the islanders and forced to kill him . She fights off the remainder of the attackers and reunites with Roth , saving him from a wolf attack . 
 Lara manages to activate a radio tower and calls for help , but the plane that answers the call is struck by a freak storm , and Lara hears a mysterious voice saying " No one leaves " in Japanese . Unable to save the surviving pilots , Lara is contacted by Alex and Reyes , who reveal that Sam has been kidnapped by the islanders , a violent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood . Lara tries to rescue her , but is stopped by Mathias , leader of the Solarii , and ordered killed : she is saved by an attack from samurai @-@ like Oni . Escaping the ancient monastery where she is taken by the Oni , she hears from Sam that Mathias is going to put her through the " Ascension " , a " fire ritual " to find the next Sun Queen that will burn her to death if it is unsuccessful . 
 Lara follows them to the Solarii fortress and is aided by Grim . The Solarii take Grim hostage , but he sacrifices himself so Lara can escape . With Roth 's aid , Lara infiltrates the fortress and sees the ritual begin . She tries to stop the ritual , but gets captured and weapons taken . When the fires are lit , a great wind blows them out , showing Sam to be the next Sun Queen . Lara escapes again with just a bow and arrows and reunites with her friends ( Reyes , Jonah , and Alex ) , forming a plan to rescue Sam and escape . 
 Aided by Whitman — who has managed to negotiate some degree of freedom with the Solarii — Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out . Lara succeeds , but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the helicopter approaches . As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to land , they are brought down , with Lara nearly dying . Roth revives Lara , then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for Lara . 
 While mourning Roth , Lara accepts that the storms are not natural , but are somehow connected to the Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island . She meets up with her friends ( Reyes , Jonah , Alex , and Sam ) , who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island , provided that it can be repaired . They are joined by Whitman , who claims to have escaped , though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists . Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance . She finds Alex injured and stuck under some rubble . They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion , sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools . 
 Finding an account of a World War II @-@ era Japanese military and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon , Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb , where she finds the remains of a samurai general who committed seppuku . It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen 's <unk> , the Oni that defend the monastery , and that the Queen 's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen 's power . Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen , but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen 's soul into a new body ; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl 's body each time she grew old . The last priestess ' suicide had interrupted the ritual , and left the Queen 's soul trapped in her old decaying body , and Himiko 's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since . Her rage is what 's causing the storms on the island . As a descendant of Yamatai , Sam is a viable candidate , and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom . Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam 's body , the storm will subside . 
 Lara returns to the survivors on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them , abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias . Lara , Jonah , and Reyes give chase , heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery , with Lara arriving just in time to see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to <unk> : the <unk> kill Whitman . After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the <unk> , Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual . Lara fights her way to the central platform , and after a struggle , shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual @-@ wielding style . Despite Mathias ' death , the ritual is already underway , with Himiko 's soul starting to pour into Sam , but Lara then destroys Himiko 's ancient remains , saving Sam and dispersing the storms . 
 Lara , Sam , Reyes and Jonah then leave the island and are picked up by a cargo ship : as they sail home , Lara realizes that the mythical stories her father told her were more than stories , deciding not to return home just yet , and the screen fades to white with a proclamation of " A Survivor is Born . "

 Following Tomb Raider : Underworld , Crystal Dynamics was split into two teams ; the first beginning work on the next sequential pillar of the Tomb Raider franchise , while the second focusing on the newly created spin @-@ off Lara Croft series ( debuting with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light in 2010 ) . Following pre @-@ announcement media hype while the game 's title was under embargo , in November 2010 , Square Enix filed for trademark of the slogan for the new Tomb Raider game ; " A Survivor is Born " . On 6 December 2010 , Square Enix announced Tomb Raider had been in production for nearly 2 years ; " Square Enix Ltd. is excited today to announce Tomb Raider , the new game from Redwood City based studio Crystal Dynamics " . Studio head Darrell Gallagher said , " Forget everything you knew about Tomb Raider , this is an origins story that creates Lara Croft and takes her on a character defining journey like no other " . Game Informer website and magazine ran a world exclusive cover reveal in its January 2011 issue , as well as exclusive coverage of emerging details directly from Crystal Dynamics from 12 December 2010 . Tomb Raider was the first game in the series to receive a M rating in the United States . 
 In January 2012 , when asked if the game would be available on Nintendo 's Wii U console , Crystal Dynamics global brand director Karl Stewart responded there are no plans to have the game available on that platform . According to Stewart , the reason for this is that " it would not be right " for the game to simply be ported , as the developers built the game to be platform @-@ specific before the Wii U was announced , and goes on to mention that if they started building the game for the platform " [ they ] would build it very differently and [ they ] would build it with unique functionality . " The multiplayer mode was created by Canadian video game development studio Eidos Montreal , known for making Deus Ex : Human Revolution . In May 2012 , it was announced by Darrell Gallagher , the studio head of Crystal Dynamics , that the game has been delayed and would be due for release in the first quarter of 2013 . He said : " We 're doing things that are completely new to Tomb Raider in this game , and the additional development time will allow us to put the finishing touches into the game and polish it to a level that you deserve . We believe this is the right choice , and I guarantee it will be worth the wait . " The Definitive Edition framerate is unlocked on PlayStation 4 , varying from 32 to <unk> ( averaging <unk> ) . The Xbox One version is locked to <unk> ( averaging <unk> ) ; both versions of the game have a resolution of 1080p .

The Tomb Raider : Original Soundtrack was released on 5 March 2013 , alongside the game 's worldwide release . The album was released to critical acclaim , with multiple sites including Forbes and the magazine Film Score Monthly giving it high praise . 
 A podcast was released by Game Informer on 21 December 2010 , featuring a " sneak peek at a track from the game itself " composed by Aleksandar Dimitrijevic . Tweets from Crystal Dynamics Global Brand Director , Karl Stewart , clarified Game Informer 's statement ; confirming that " Alex Dimitrijevic is scoring the trailer . We officially haven 't announced the composer for the game " . On 8 June 2011 , after the trailer 's première , Stewart stated in regard to the final Turning Point score that " ... this piece is not a piece that [ Alex Dimitrijevic ] ' s worked on " . On 7 June 2011 , Meagan Marie , community manager at Crystal Dynamics , expressed on the official Tomb Raider blog that " Our goal [ is ] to make sure that we release a soundtrack " . Stewart added " this is a completely new composer and somebody who we 've brought in to work on the game as well as this [ trailer ] piece " and that " we 're going to make a bigger announcement later in the year " . 
 In the Making of Turning Point , sound designer Alex Wilmer explained that the unannounced composer had remotely directed an in @-@ house concert violinist to perform the " very intimate " piece . In the fourth Crystal Habit podcast which premiered at the Tomb Raider blog on 17 October 2011 , Marie spoke to Wilmer and lead sound designer Jack Grillo about their collaboration ( s ) with the unannounced composer . Grillo stated that " We 're doing this overture ... where we 're taking an outline of the narrative structure and having our composer create different themes and textures that would span the entire game " while Wilmer emphasised that the composer 's music will dynamically adapt in @-@ game ; scored " ... emotionally so that it reacts instantly to what happens " . 
 In an episode of The Final Hours of Tomb Raider on YouTube , the composer was revealed as Jason Graves . Apart from his trademark orchestral style , Graves wished to create a signature sound that would impress on players and stand out when heard . Along with using objects like mallets to create odd musical sounds , Graves , with the help of neighbouring architect Matt McConnell , created a special percussion instrument that would create a variety of odd signature sounds to mix in with the rest of the orchestral score . Although the location was set in the locale of Japan , Graves did not want Japanese instrumentation : instead , he chose sounds and themes that would be indicative of the scavengers on the island , who came from multiple regions of the globe . Using different percussion instruments in different ways , he was able to create the feeling of " founds sounds " .

 Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed . In a ' world exclusive ' review , GamesMaster magazine gave the game a score of 90 % , as well as the " GamesMaster Gold award " ( awarded to games that manage a score of 90 % or above ) . The editor regarded the quality of the visuals , the length and depth of the gameplay , and the " spectacular " last third of the game as the highlights . The summary said " sitting back exhausted we were left with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws . How on earth are they going to top this in the sequel ? Because of one thing there can be no doubt . Lara is back . " IGN 's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively , stating that they felt the game was " exciting " and " beautifully presented " , included " great characterization " and " more depth than you would expect " . They gave the game an overall score of 9 @.@ 1 out of 10 , the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996 's Tomb Raider , describing it as " amazing " and concluding that the game " did justice " to both the character and franchise . Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location 's setting and environment , and expressed that " not one area ever feels like a rehash of another " . Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing , and that it is " unrivaled by any other game in the genre " . Furthermore , the reviewer considered Lara 's character development as " an integral part " of the whole game 's experience , and concluded that Tomb Raider " is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming 's original treasure seekers " . Australian TV show Good Game praised the game : it was rated 10 / 10 by both hosts , becoming the eighth game in the show 's seven @-@ year run to do so . Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five , stating that " Tomb Raider 's tone is somewhat at odds with its action , but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career " . 
 One of the major criticisms of the game stemmed from a disparity between the emotional thrust of the story and the actions of the player , with GameTrailers ' Justin Speer pointing out that while the story attempted to characterise Lara Croft as vulnerable and uncomfortable with killing , the player was encouraged to engage enemies aggressively and use brutal tactics to earn more experience points . Speer felt that this paradoxical approach ultimately let the game down as it undermined Lara 's character to the point where he found it difficult to identify with her at all . IGN 's Keza MacDonald also highlighted the issue , but was less critical of it than Speer , pointing out that both Lara and the player had to adapt quickly to killing in order to survive . However , Game Informer 's Matt Miller noted that the game offered the player several options for progressing through its combat situations , and that the player could avoid open conflict entirely if they chose to do so . He also praised the behaviour and presence of the enemies for the way they felt like they had actual tasks to perform on the island , rather than being clusters of polygons whose only function was to be killed by the player in order for them to progress . While on the subject of character development , GamesRadar 's Ryan Taljonick expressed that the supporting characters were underdeveloped relative to Lara Croft , describing them as " pretty generic characters who , while rarely annoying , just aren 't memorable " . 
 While many reviews applauded the single @-@ player campaign , the multiplayer mode bore the brunt of the game 's criticism , with MacDonald , Speer and Miller all finding fault with it , describing it as lackluster and stating that the difference between the developer 's vision for the game mode and the finished product made it difficult to enjoy . 
 Tomb Raider : Definitive Edition received positive reviews . Game Informer 's Matt Helgeson considered the updated graphics at native 1080p resolution as a good addition to the core Tomb Raider experience . He cited mostly negligible differences between the two versions , but noted a smoother frame @-@ rate on the PS4 version . The Escapist 's Jim Sterling was less receptive to the Definitive Edition ; he praised the visual improvements , but felt that nominal content additions to the single @-@ player experience and the game 's price point made it difficult to recommend to players outside of those who had not played the original version . GameZone 's Matt Liebl gave Tomb Raider : Definitive Edition a 9 / 10 , stating " Tomb Raider : Definitive Edition was my first time playing Crystal Dynamics ' reboot , so I can definitely recommend it for newcomers . As for whether or not it 's worth paying full price for the same game with upgraded graphics , well that 's something you need to decide . " 
 Prior to the game 's release , news of an attempted rape plot element drew ire and led to multiple op @-@ ed pieces . A developer interview described an early cutscene as an attempted " rape " that proves formative in Croft 's genesis story , but the developer later reiterated that sexual assault was not a theme of the game and that the executive producer had misspoken . Sexual assault and women had already been a volatile topic in games journalism . Tomb Raider 's lead writer later reflected that the controversy was the result of misinformation .

 = Tropical Storm Ana ( 2003 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Ana was the only tropical cyclone on record in the North Atlantic basin to exist in the month of April . The first tropical cyclone of the 2003 season , it developed as a subtropical cyclone from a non @-@ tropical low on April 20 to the west of Bermuda . It tracked east @-@ southeastward and organized , and on April 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Tropical Storm Ana turned east @-@ northeastward , steadily weakening due to wind shear and an approaching cold front , and on April 24 it became an extratropical cyclone . The storm brushed Bermuda with light rain , and the remnants produced precipitation in the Azores and the United Kingdom . Swells generated by the storm capsized a boat along the Florida coastline , causing two fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A non @-@ tropical low pressure area developed about 240 miles ( 390 km ) south @-@ southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper @-@ level trough and a surface frontal trough . The surface trough , which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola , brought a plume of moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation , which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico . The non @-@ tropical low tracked generally northward , with a ridge to its east and west , and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center ; early that day , satellite imagery indicated the presence of a tight inner core of winds . After turning to the northwest , it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system , due to the deepening of the upper @-@ level trough over the system . Convection became better organized over the center , and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250 miles ( 400 km ) west of Bermuda . Operationally , the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21 hours later . 
 The subtropical storm tracked east @-@ southeastward and continued to organize , and by late on April 20 an upper @-@ level warm core was present over the system . Based on its organization , Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000 UTC on April 21 . Upon becoming a tropical storm , Ana attained a peak intensity of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , which was based on estimates from the Hebert @-@ Poteat technique and data from QuikSCAT . Shortly thereafter , it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda , when it passed about 130 miles ( 210 km ) southwest of the island . Operationally , the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane Center around this time , when it was considered a subtropical cyclone . Strong upper @-@ level wind shear removed much of the convection , though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center . The storm became completely separated from the upper @-@ level system , and the cyclone re @-@ organized , developing an eye feature late on April 21 . Embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north , Ana continued eastward , and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center . Convection waxed and waned throughout the day , and by April 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization . After turning to the northeast , the circulation center merged with an approaching cold front on April 24 , and Tropical Storm Ana completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone . The extratropical storm accelerated east @-@ northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on April 27 southeast of the Azores . 
 = = Impact , records , and naming = = 
 Prior to the development of Ana , the government of Bermuda issued a gale warning for the island . Upon its classification by the National Hurricane Center , a tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda . Meandering near the island for several days while developing , the storm dropped 2 @.@ 63 inches ( 67 mm ) of precipitation in a six @-@ day period at the Bermuda International Airport . Winds on the island did not reach tropical storm force . Swells from the storm impacted the coast of Florida . The combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet on April 20 ; two of its occupants drowned , and the other two were rescued . As an extratropical storm , the remnants of Ana dropped 0 @.@ 87 inches ( 22 mm ) of precipitation in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores . Moisture from the remnants of Ana also produced beneficial rainfall in the United Kingdom . Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with Ana ; the Atlantic Forest recorded 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) and a pressure of 998 mbar on April 22 , and the Rosa Delmas reported winds of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) on April 23 . 
 On April 20 , Ana became the second subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in the month of April , after a subtropical storm in 1992 . After attaining tropical characteristics , it became the first tropical storm on record in the month of April and was among the earliest forming tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin .

Sepinwall also called the Ron Swanson subplot " simply fantastic in both concept and execution " . Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called " Road Trip " a very funny episode and strong pay @-@ off to the romance between Leslie and Ben that had been building all season . Joel Keller of TV Squad said the Know Ya Boo story felt simply like an excuse to include Andy and April in the show , but that Ron 's subplot with the little girl was " classic Ron Swanson " . Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the plot felt " admittedly , a little more sitcom @-@ y than I like " but was very funny and progressed the Leslie and Ben story arc without letting the show " jump the shark " . 
 Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he was glad to see Ben and Leslie come together the way they did , particularly because he feared the no @-@ dating rule would become an " artificial barrier " that dragged out the romance subplot . Porter also praised Rob Lowe 's performance , and said it made the character likeable even as he kept Leslie and Ben apart . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a " stellar " episode that was " loose , silly , rich with details and heart " . While he said the episode included good " outrageous comedy " , he said the script strives on the more subtle scenes about Leslie and Ben coming together , along with Chris ' constant interruptions . Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic was underwhelmed by the Know Ya Boo story , but strongly praised Leslie and Ben 's scenes , which he said were both touching and very funny . He particularly praised the way scene when Ben describes his feelings for Leslie through his description to the baseball tournament panel about why he loves Pawnee . 
 Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode , and said the kiss between Leslie and Ben was emotionally effective . He said Chris ' obliviousness to the sexual tension between Leslie and Ben seemed unusual , but wrote , " Maybe this is just another case of a show hitting so many perfect notes that the slightest deviation seems off @-@ key . " Matt Fowler of IGN said " Road Trip " was less funny than " The Fight " , and that the Know Ya Boo subplot " fizzled a bit " . But he called it a " sweet episode " for its developments with Leslie and Ben , and said Ron and Chris were especially funny in their scenes . Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said " Road Trip " was " pretty great " but less funny than the previous episode , " The Fight " . She praised the Ron subplot , but said Tom 's game show was " much more predictable and rote " . 
 = Meth mouth = 
 Meth mouth is severe tooth decay and loss of teeth , as well as tooth fracture , acid erosion , and other oral problems potentially symptomatic of extended use of the drug methamphetamine ( colloquially termed " meth " , " crystal meth " and many other names ) . 
 The condition is thought to be caused by a combination of side effects of the drug ( clenching and grinding of teeth , dry mouth ) and lifestyle factors ( infrequent oral hygiene , frequent consumption of sugary drinks ) , which may be present in long term users . 
 However , the legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique condition has been questioned because of the similar effects of some other drugs on teeth . Images of diseased mouths are often used in anti @-@ drug campaigns . 
 The condition is difficult to treat , and may involve fillings , fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth , as well as oral hygiene instruction . It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Methamphetamine ( meth ) , a highly addictive drug that produces a dramatic increase in energy and euphoria , can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems . As of 2012 , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature . 
 The most notable effect of long @-@ term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries ( tooth decay ) ; the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating . <unk> often occur in the cervical regions of teeth , where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root . It is usually found on the buccal ( cheek ) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines ; eventually , the coronal tooth area , near the crown , can be affected by the decay and erosion . The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly , perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices . The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain . In some cases , teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed . Along with malnutrition and weight loss , the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users . The effects of meth mouth are similar to those of Sjögren 's syndrome , an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva , which results in tooth decay . 
 Methamphetamine users sometimes experience soreness in the joint of the jaw and dental attrition ( tooth wear ) , owing to bruxism ( grinding of the teeth ) caused by the drug . This bruxism can occur continuously . Chronic use of the drug might also cause <unk> , the inability to open the jaw . Long @-@ term users often experience xerostomia ( dry mouth ) . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The hypothesized causes of meth mouth are a combination of MA side effects and lifestyle factors which may be present in users : 
 Dry mouth ( xerostomia ) 
 Clenching and grinding of the teeth ( bruxism ) 
 Infrequent oral hygiene 
 Frequent consumption of sugary , fizzy drinks 
 Caustic nature of methamphetamine 
 The dental effects of long @-@ term methamphetamine use are often attributed to its effects on saliva . The reduction in saliva increases the likelihood of dental caries , enamel erosion , and periodontal disease . Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva , the mechanism by which it does so is unclear . One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction ( narrowing of the blood vessels ) in salivary glands , decreasing salivary flow . This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha @-@ adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine , the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use . These factors can be compounded by dehydration , which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug @-@ induced increases in metabolism . The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug , which includes high protein content , may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth . 
 Long @-@ term methamphetamine use can cause <unk> habits , routine actions of a body part that are different than their common use , which can result in tooth wear and exacerbate periodontal diseases . One such habit that may affect the development of meth mouth is bruxism , particularly as the drug 's effects wane and stereotypy occurs , a phase that is often referred to as " tweaking " . This bruxism may be due to a drug @-@ induced increase in monoamines . Other behaviors of long @-@ term methamphetamine users that may cause or accelerate the symptoms of meth mouth are the failure to pay attention to oral hygiene and excessive food intake during binges , especially sugary foods ; the drug 's users often report strong cravings for sugar and consume large amounts of high @-@ sugar beverages . The altered mental state that accompanies methamphetamine use lasts longer than that of some other common drugs , increasing the amount of time the user engages in drug @-@ induced behavior . 
 Hydrochloric acid is used in methamphetamine 's manufacturing process , but academic reviews have not supported the idea that the acid contributes to dental decay . Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users ' mouths is also unsupported . Meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject the drug , rather than those who smoke , ingest or inhale it .
