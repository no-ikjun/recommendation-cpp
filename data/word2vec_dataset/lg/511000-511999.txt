 = = History = = 
 The region of the southern Levant has a varied past and as such , its cuisine has contributions from various cultures . After the area was conquered by the Muslims , it became part of a Bilad al @-@ Sham under the name Jund Filastin . Therefore , many aspects of Palestinian cuisine are similar to the cuisine of Syria — especially in the Galilee . Modern Syrian @-@ Palestinian dishes have been generally influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups : the Arabs , the Persian @-@ influenced Arabs ( Iraqis ) and the Turks . 
 The Arabs that conquered Syria and Palestine initially had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice , lamb , yogurt and dates . This cuisine did not advance for centuries until the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate , that established Baghdad as its capital and integrated elements of Persian cuisine into the existing Arab cuisine . The Arab geographer al @-@ Muqaddasi said this of Palestine 's foods : 
 From Palestine comes olives , dried figs , raisins , the carob fruit ... from Jerusalem comes cheeses and the celebrated raisins of the species known as <unk> and <unk> , excellent apples ... also pine nuts of the kind called ' <unk> @-@ bite ' , and their equal is not found elsewhere ... from <unk> and Baysan come dates , the treacle called <unk> . 
 The cuisine of the Ottoman Empire — which incorporated Palestine in 1516 — was partially made up of what had become , by then a " rich " Arab cuisine . After the Crimean War , in 1855 , many other communities including Bosnians , Greeks , French and Italians began settling in the area especially in urban centers such as Jerusalem , Jaffa and Bethlehem . These communities ' cuisines contributed to the character of Palestinian cuisine , especially communities from the Balkans . Until around the 1950s @-@ 60s , the main ingredients for rural Palestinian cuisine was olive oil , oregano and bread baked in a simple oven called a taboon . Author G. Robinson Lees , writing in 1905 , observed that " The oven is not in the house , it has a building of its own , the joint property of several families whose duty is to keep it always hot . " 
 = = Regional cuisines = = 
 There are three primary culinary regions of Palestine — the Galilee , Gaza and the West Bank ( which has its own culinary subregions ranging from north to south ) . In the Galilee , bulgur and meat ( beef or lamb ) are primary ingredients that are often combined to form several variations of dishes ranging from a family @-@ sized meal to a side dish . However , in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , the populations have a cooking style of their own . In the West Bank , meals are particularly heavy and contrast from the foods of the northern Levant . Main dishes involve rice , <unk> and roasted meats . The staple food of the inhabitants in the Gaza Strip is fish due to its location on the Mediterranean seacoast . Their cuisine is similar to that of the Levant 's ; however , other spices are used more frequently . These generally include chili peppers , dill seed , garlic , and chard to flavor many of Gaza 's meals . Although the cuisine is diverse , generally Palestinians are not restricted to the foods of their specific region and there is constant culinary diffusion amongst them . Although , because of Gaza 's isolation from other Palestinian and Levantine Arab areas , their cooking styles are less known in the region . 
 = = = Galilee = = = 
 The cuisine of the Galilee is very similar to Lebanese cuisine , due to the extensive communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel . The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur , spices and meat , known as <unk> by Arabs . Kubbi bi @-@ <unk> is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper , allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust , then baked . Kubbi bi @-@ <unk> could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch . Kubbi <unk> is a variation of <unk> , that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices . It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat . Since the dish is raw , whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried <unk> balls . 
 A special occasion meal in the Galilee consists of Roasted Lamb or any other type of meat complemented by a mixture of rice with chopped lamb and flavored with an assortment of spices , usually garnished with chopped parsley and toasted <unk> shish kebab or <unk> <unk> and shish taouk are grilled meats on skewers and are commonly eaten after an array of appetizers known as the <unk> .

It consists of a roasted chicken over a taboon bread that has been topped with pieces of fried sweet onions , sumac , allspice and pine nuts . Maqluba is an upside @-@ down rice and baked eggplant casserole mixed with cooked cauliflowers , carrots and chicken or lamb . The meal is known throughout the Levant but among Palestinians especially . It dates back to the 13th century . 
 Mansaf is a traditional meal in the central West Bank and <unk> region in the southern West Bank , having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia . It is mostly cooked on occasions such as , during holidays , weddings or a large gathering . Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb on top of a taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice . A type of thick and dried <unk> yogurt from goat 's milk , called <unk> , is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste . The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds . The classic form of eating <unk> is using the right hand as a utensil . For politeness , participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them . 
 In addition to meals , the West Bank 's many subregions have their own fruit @-@ based jams . In the Hebron area , the primary crops are grapes . Families living in the area harvest the grapes in the spring and summer to produce a variety of products ranging from raisins , jams and a molasses known as <unk> . The Bethlehem area , Beit Jala in particular , and the village of Jifna are known regionally for their apricots and apricot jam as is the Tulkarm area for its olives and olive oil . 
 = = = Gaza = = = 
 The Gaza Strip 's cooking style is similar to culinary styles adopted by the rest of the Levant countries , and is also influenced by the Mediterranean coast . The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish . Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro , garlic , red peppers and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander , red peppers , cumin , and chopped lemons . Besides fish , as well as other types of seafood , <unk> , is a clay pot dish that consists of shrimp baked in a stew of olive oil , garlic , hot peppers , and peeled tomatoes . Crabs are cooked and then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called <unk> .

The album was recorded in several locations over two years , 1995 and 1997 , featuring two songs dating from 1992 . The album featured several of McCartney 's family members and friends , most notably McCartney 's son , James McCartney . In Flaming Pie 's liner notes , McCartney said : " [ The Beatles Anthology ] reminded me of The Beatles ' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs . So in a way it was a refresher course that set the framework for this album . " 
 Flaming Pie peaked at number two in both the UK and US and was certified gold . The album , which was well received by critics , also reached the top 20 in many other countries . From its release up to mid @-@ 2007 , the album sold over 1 @.@ 5 million copies .

 " Calico Skies " , which Paul McCartney had written when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991 , and " Great Day " , which features backing vocal from his wife Linda McCartney , hailed from a 1992 session , recorded even before Off the Ground had come out . Starting from the mid @-@ 1990s for four years , McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology , a documentary on the history of the Beatles . The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road , named after McCartney 's song of the same name . During 1995 , as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two @-@ year period , EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime . McCartney said that he " was almost insulted at first " before then realising that " it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of the Beatles . So I fell in with the idea and thought , ' Great , I don 't even have to think about an album . ' " McCartney was occupied with working on Standing Stone in the interim .

 Beginning in February 1995 , McCartney teamed up with Jeff Lynne , Electric Light Orchestra lead singer and guitarist , an ardent Beatles fan . Lynne had previously worked with former Beatle George Harrison on his 1987 album Cloud Nine and in the Traveling Wilburys , and also co @-@ produced " Free as a Bird " and " Real Love " for the Anthology project . Intending to produce something pure and easy – and without elaborate productions – McCartney sporadically recorded the entire album in a space of two years , working not only with Lynne , but with Steve Miller , George Martin , Ringo Starr and his own son , James McCartney , who plays lead guitar on " Heaven on a Sunday " . McCartney wrote the song " Young Boy " while his wife Linda was making lunch for a New York Times feature on 18 August 1994 . McCartney and Miller started recording " Young Boy " on 22 February 1995 in Sun Valley , Idaho . They reconvened a few months afterwards in May at McCartney 's home studio , The Mill , recording – a song described as a " road song " – " If You Wanna " and the jam track " Used to Be Bad " in the process . 
 The duo also recorded the B @-@ side " <unk> " and three unreleased tracks : " ( Sweet Home ) Country Girl " , " Soul Boy " , and an untitled song . Also in May , McCartney , by himself , recorded the unreleased tracks " Stella May Day " , for his daughter Stella McCartney , which would be used playing over loudspeakers at her fashion shows , and " Whole Life " with Dave Stewart . " Somedays " , which was written while McCartney was escorting Linda to Kent for a photo shoot , features an orchestration score by George Martin . " The Song We Were Singing " , which was about the times McCartney and his former @-@ songwriting partner John Lennon were at 20 Forthlin Road , was recorded in 3 / 4 time . " Little Willow " was written for the children of Starr 's first wife , Maureen Starkey <unk> , who had recently died of cancer . " Souvenir " features the sound of a 78 rpm record towards the end of the track . The title track , recorded in a four @-@ hour session , is in similar style to the Beatles ' " Lady Madonna " . 
 In May 1996 , Starr and McCartney were working on a track that McCartney had started a decade previously , " Beautiful Night " , which featured vocals from Starr . Lynne showed up the next day and the trio , with McCartney on bass , Starr on drums , and Lynne on guitar , jammed , with the finished results being the track " Really Love You " , the first track credited to McCartney – Starkey . McCartney and Starr also recorded the B @-@ side " Looking for You " and an untitled song . " Heaven on a Sunday " , which was written while McCartney was in the US sailing on holiday , was recorded on 16 September 1996 , and features backing vocals by both Linda and James . Martin added orchestration to " Beautiful Night " , on 14 February 1997 at Abbey Road Studios . An unreleased song was recorded with Lynne producing , titled " Cello in the Ruins " , had its copyright registered in 1994 , despite work on the song only getting started a year later , in May 1995 . The track was nearly issued as a single for War Child 's The Help Album in 1995 , but ultimately shelved . This album was the last McCartney studio album to feature vocals and participation from Linda , who died of breast cancer in 1998 .

 Upon its 1997 release , on 5 May in the UK on Parlophone and on 20 May in the US on Capitol , the critical reaction to Flaming Pie was strong , with McCartney achieving his best reviews since 1982 's Tug of War . With fresh credibility , even with young fans who had been introduced to him through the Anthology project , it debuted at number 2 in the UK in May , giving McCartney his best new entry since Flowers in the Dirt eight years before . It was kept off the top spot by the Spice Girls ' album Spice . Flaming Pie was also received positively in the United States , where it became McCartney 's first top 10 album since Tug of War . Flaming Pie debuted at number 2 , with 121 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week , behind Spice , which sold just 16 @,@ 500 more copies that week . 
 In both the UK and the US , Flaming Pie was the most commercially successful new entry , and was certified gold in both countries . It was also certified gold in Norway . According to Nielsen SoundScan , the album had sold over 1 @.@ 5 million copies worldwide up to June 2007 . The singles " Young Boy " , " The World Tonight " and " Beautiful Night " , all of which were released as picture discs , became UK hits , all making the top 40 in the sales charts . The only single in the US from the album was " The World Tonight " , released on 17 April 1997 , a top 30 entry on the Billboard mainstream rock listing . The album was also released on vinyl . To promote the album , McCartney held an online chat party , and the event entered the Guinness Book of World Records for the most people in an online chatroom at once . 
 In the World Tonight , a film about the making of the album , was broadcast in the UK on ITV , and on VH1 in the US , around the release of the album . Also broadcast was an hour @-@ long radio show about the album on 5 May 1997 on BBC Radio 2 . It received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year , although Bob Dylan won the award with his back @-@ to @-@ form album Time Out of Mind . " Young Boy " and " The World Tonight " appeared in the 1997 Ivan Reitman comedy Fathers ' Day . The title Flaming Pie ( also given to one of the album 's songs ) is a reference to a humorous story John Lennon told in a story in Mersey Beat in 1961 on the origin of the Beatles ' name : " It came in a vision – a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them , ' from this day on you are Beatles with an A. ' "

 = Lurgan = 
 Lurgan ( from Irish : an Lorgain , meaning " the shin @-@ shaped hill " ) is a town in County Armagh , Northern Ireland . The town is near the southern shore of Lough Neagh and in the north @-@ eastern corner of the county . Formerly part of the Craigavon Borough Council area until it was merged in 2015 into the larger Armagh , Banbridge and Craigavon , Lurgan is about 18 miles ( 29 km ) south @-@ west of Belfast and is linked to the city by both the M1 motorway and the Belfast – Dublin railway line . It had a population of about 23 @,@ 000 at the 2001 Census . 
 Lurgan is characteristic of many Plantation of Ulster settlements , with its straight , wide planned streets and rows of cottages . It is the site of a number of historic listed buildings including Brownlow House and the former town hall . 
 Historically the town was known as a major centre for the production of textiles ( mainly linen ) after the industrial revolution and it continued to be a major producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s . The development of the ' new city ' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area . The expansion of Craigavon 's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town 's retail trade further . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Lurgan is an Anglicisation of the Irish name an Lorgain . This literally means " the shin " , but in placenames betokens a shin @-@ shaped hill or ridge ( i.e. one that is long , low and narrow ) . Earlier names of Lurgan include Lorgain Chlann <unk> ( Anglicised <unk> , meaning " shin @-@ shaped hill of <unk> " ) and Lorgain <unk> Mhic Cana ( Anglicised <unk> [ an ] <unk> , meaning " shin @-@ shaped hill of McCann 's settlement " ) . The McCanns were a sept of the O 'Neills and Lords of <unk> before the Plantation of Ulster period in the early 17th century . 
 About 1610 , during the Plantation and at a time when the area was sparsely populated by Gaelic peoples , the lands of Lurgan were given to the English lord William Brownlow and his family . Initially the Brownlow family settled near the lough at <unk> , but by 1619 , on a nearby ridge , they had established a castle and bawn for their own accommodation , and " a fair Town , consisting of 42 Houses , all of which are inhabited with English Families , and the streets all paved clean through also to water Mills , and a Wind Mill , all for corn . " 
 Brownlow became MP for Armagh in the Irish Parliament in 1639 . During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , Brownlow 's castle and bawn were destroyed , and he and his wife and family were taken prisoner and brought to Armagh and then to Dungannon in County Tyrone . The land was then passed to the McCanns and the O <unk> . In 1642 , Brownlow and his family were released by the forces of Lord Conway , and as the rebellion ended they returned to their estate in Lurgan . William Brownlow died in 1660 , but the family went on to contribute to the development of the linen industry which peaked in the town in the late 17th century . 
 = = = An <unk> Mór / The Great Hunger = = = 
 A workhouse was built in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the increasing numbers of destitute poor . In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2 @,@ 715 , this increased to 4 @,@ 677 by 1841 . There were a couple of reasons for this large growth in population . Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment . Secondly the ever @-@ expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House . 
 The large numbers of poor workers migrating to the town inevitably resulted in over @-@ crowding and a very low standard of living . When the potato crop failed for a second time in 1846 the resulting starvation led to a quickly overcrowded workhouse which by the end of 1846 exceeded its 800 capacity . In an attempt to alleviate the problem a relief committee was established in Lurgan as they were in other towns . The relief committees raised money by subscription from local landowners , gentry and members of the clergy and were matched by funds from Dublin . With these monies food was bought and distributed to the ever @-@ increasing numbers of starving people at soup kitchens . In an attempt to provide employment and thereby give the destitute the means to buy food , Lord Lurgan devised a scheme of land- drainage on his estate . 
 The so @-@ called ' famine roads ' were not built in Lurgan to the same extent as the rest of Ireland , although land owners also provided outdoor relief by employing labourers to lower hills and repair existing road . During the period 1846 to 1849 the famine claimed 2 @,@ 933 lives in the Lurgan Union alone . The Lurgan workhouse was situated in the grounds of what is now Lurgan Hospital and a commemorative mural can be seen along the adjacent <unk> Road . 
 = = = New city = = = 
 The town grew steadily over the centuries as an industrial market town , and in the 1960s , when the UK government was developing a programme of new towns in Great Britain to deal with population growth , the Northern Ireland government also planned a new town to deal with the projected growth of Belfast and to prevent an undue concentration of population in the city . Craigavon was designated as a new town in 1965 , intended to be a linear city incorporating the neighbouring towns of Lurgan and Portadown . The plan largely failed , and today , ' Craigavon ' locally refers to the rump of the residential area between the two towns . The Craigavon development , however , did affect Lurgan in a number of ways . The sort of dedicated bicycle and pedestrian paths that were built in Craigavon were also incorporated into newer housing areas in Lurgan , additional land in and around the town was zoned for industrial development , neighbouring rural settlements such as <unk> and Aghagallon were developed as housing areas , and there was an increase in the town 's population , although not on the scale that had been forecast . 
 The textile industry remained a main employer in the town until the late twentieth century , with the advent of access to cheaper labour in the developing world leading to a decline in the manufacture of clothing in Lurgan . 
 = = = The Troubles = = = 
 Lurgan and the associated towns of Portadown and Craigavon made up part of what was known as the " murder triangle " ; an area known for a significant number of incidents and fatalities during The Troubles . Today the town is one of the few areas in Northern Ireland where so @-@ called dissident republicans have a significant level of support . The legacy of the Troubles is continued tension between Roman Catholics and Protestants , which has occasionally erupted into violence at flashpoint ' interface areas ' . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Lurgan sits in a relatively flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh . The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by the shore of the lough , and a mass of basalt farther back . The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough . When the land was handed to the Brownlow family , they initially settled near the lough at <unk> , but later settled where the town was eventually built . The oldest part of the town , the main street , is built on a long ridge in the townland ( baile <unk> ) of Lurgan . A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House , which overlooks Lurgan Park . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Like the rest of Ireland , the Lurgan area has long been divided into townlands , whose names mostly come from the Irish language . Lurgan sprang up in the townland of the same name . Over time , the surrounding townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates . The following is a list of townlands within Lurgan 's urban area , alongside their likely etymologies : 
 Shankill parish : 
 <unk> ( from Irish Achadh na <unk> , meaning " field of the stone " ) 
 <unk> ( from Baile <unk> meaning " flowery townland " ) 
 <unk> ( from Baile <unk> meaning " greyish townland " ) 
 <unk> ( an English name – this townland was carved out of Drumnamoe and others ) 
 Derry ( from <unk> meaning " oak grove " ) 
 Dougher or <unk> ( from <unk> meaning " black round hill " and <unk> meaning " small black round hill " ) 
 Drumnamoe ( from Druim na mBó meaning " ridge of the cows " or Druim na <unk> meaning " ridge of the thickets " ) 
 Knocknashane ( formerly <unk> , from Cnoc na <unk> meaning " hill of the ants " ) 
 Shankill ( from <unk> meaning " old church " or <unk> meaning " old wood " ) 
 Taghnevan ( formerly <unk> , from Teach <unk> meaning " Naomhán 's house " ) 
 Tannaghmore North & Tannaghmore South ( from an <unk> Mór meaning " the big grassland " ) 
 <unk> ( from Tobar <unk> / Tobar <unk> / Tobar <unk> meaning " Friday well / <unk> 's well / Sweeny 's well " ) 
 <unk> parish : 
 <unk> ( from Achadh <unk> meaning " hurling field " ) 
 <unk> ( from Baile na Móna meaning " townland of the bog " ) 
 Silverwood ( an English name – formerly called <unk> , from Coill an <unk> meaning " wood of the silver " ) 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Lurgan has a temperate climate in common with inland areas in Ireland . Summer temperatures can reach the 20s ° C and it is rare for them to go higher than 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) . The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20s ° C ( 80 – 85 ° F ) , more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Lurgan is part of the Upper Bann constituency for the purpose of elections to the UK Parliament at Westminster . This has long been a safe unionist seat and the current MP is David Simpson of the Democratic Unionist Party . 
 Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont are elected from six @-@ member constituencies using proportional representation and using the same constituencies as for Westminster . 
 Lurgan town commissioners were first elected in 1855 , and they were replaced by Lurgan Urban District Council following the Local Government ( Ireland ) Act 1898 . This effectively ended landlord control of local government in Ireland . The town council was abolished when local government was reformed in Northern Ireland in 1973 under the Local Government ( Boundaries ) Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1971 and the Local Government Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1972 . These abolished the two @-@ tier system of town and county councils replacing it with the single @-@ tier system . Lurgan was placed under the jurisdiction of Craigavon Borough Council , and remained so until a new act streamlined and merged the various districts in 2015 . Today Lurgan forms part of the new Armagh , Banbridge and Craigavon District . The Lurgan area contains the following wards : Church , <unk> , Knocknashane , <unk> , Mourneview , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Lurgan Town Hall is owned by the new District Council but has not been used to conduct Council business since the Town Council was abolished in 1972 . 
 = = Demography = = 
 For census purposes , Lurgan is not treated as a separate entity by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency ( <unk> ) . Instead , it is combined with Craigavon , Portadown and <unk> to form the " Craigavon Urban Area " . A fairly accurate population count can be found by combining the data of the electoral wards that make up the Lurgan urban area . These are Church , Court , Drumnamoe , Knocknashane , Mourneview , <unk> , Taghnevan and Woodville . 
 On the day of the last census ( 27 March 2011 ) the combined population of these wards was 25 @,@ 093 
 Of this population : 
 15 @,@ 607 ( 62 @.@ 2 % ) were Catholic or from a Catholic background 
 8 @,@ 460 ( 33 @.@ 7 % ) were Protestant or from a Protestant background 
 1 @,@ 026 ( 4 @.@ 1 % ) were of other religious backgrounds or no religious background . 
 The town is divided along political / sectarian lines with entire housing areas being almost exclusively Catholic / nationalist or almost exclusively Protestant / unionist . The north end of the town centre is considered Catholic , the south end is considered Protestant , with the " invisible dividing line " crossing Market Street at Castle Lane and Carnegie Street . In the 1980s there were two Protestant enclaves in the north end of the town , <unk> and Wakehurst . They have both since changed to become Catholic areas as Protestants gradually moved out .

 Lurgan has historically been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated as a source of employment during the Industrial Revolution , and is said to have employed as many as 18 @,@ 000 handloom weavers at the end of the 19th century , a figure significantly higher than the town 's resident population at the time . That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed , but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries . 
 The large Goodyear fan @-@ belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was a product of the Craigavon development when large tracts of land in Lurgan , Portadown , and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use . The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit , resulting in the loss of 750 jobs . The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics . Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms . Other industrial areas in the town are <unk> and Halfpenny Valley ( Portadown Road ) industrial estates ; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough . 
 A key component of the Craigavon development was a central business district halfway between Lurgan and Portadown that would serve as the city centre for the whole of the new city . What was built was an office building , a court house , a civic building , and a small shopping centre alongside several acres of parkland that were developed around the newly created balancing lakes that also serve as part of the area 's drainage system . In the 1690s , the shopping centre was significantly expanded to form what is now Rushmere Retail Park , containing many major retail stores . This has had a detrimental effect on the retail trade in Lurgan in the same way that out @-@ of @-@ town shopping developments in other parts of Northern Ireland have damaged other traditional town centres . The town 's Chamber of Commerce is not functioning and has remained dormant despite numerous attempts to revive it .

 There is a figure of speech used in Northern Ireland – to have a face as long as a Lurgan spade – meaning " to look miserable " . The origins of this expression are disputed . One theory is that a " Lurgan spade " was an under @-@ paid workman digging what is now the Lurgan Park lake . Another theory is that it could be from the Irish language <unk> <unk> meaning the shaft ( literally " shin " ) of a spade . 
 The ballad Master McGrath concerns a greyhound of that name from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero . The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family , and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow , referred to in the lyrics as Lord Lurgan . Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868 , 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high profile sport . A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size . He is remembered all over the town , including in its coat of arms . The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care . A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993 , over 120 years after his last glory in 1871 . A festival is also held yearly in his honour . A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath , although it has been renamed in recent years .

 Lurgan Park , a few hundred yards from the main street , is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland and the second @-@ largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park , Dublin . It used to be part of the estate of Brownlow House , a 19th @-@ century Elizabethan @-@ style manor house . In 1893 , the land was purchased by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen , Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain . Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan Agricultural Show , and the Lurgan Park Rally , noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally . Mount Zion House in Edward St , formerly the St Joseph 's Convent , is now a cross @-@ community centre run by the Shankill Lurgan Community Association / Community Projects . It is funded by the Department for Social Development , the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation , and the Physical and Social Environment Programme .

 Lurgan town centre is distinctive for its wide main street , Market Street , one of the widest in Ireland , which is dominated at one end by Shankill Church in Church Place . A grey granite hexagonal temple @-@ shaped war memorial sits at the entrance to Church Place , topped by a bronze @-@ winged statue representing the spirit of Victorious Peace . A marble pillar at the centre displays the names of over 400 men from the town who lost their lives in the First World War . 
 The rows of buildings on either side of Market Street are punctuated periodically by large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings , gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through . The town 's straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns , and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since been modified for modern use . 
 At the junction of Market Street and Union Street is the former Lurgan Town Hall , a listed building erected in 1868 . It was the first site of the town 's library in 1891 , was temporarily used as a police station in 1972 when it was handed to the Police Authority , and is today owned by the Mechanics ' Institute and is available for conferences and community functions . 
 Brownlow House , known locally as ' Lurgan Castle ' , is a distinctive mansion built in 1833 with Scottish sandstone in an Elizabethan style with a lantern @-@ shaped tower and prominent array of chimney pots . It was originally owned by the Brownlow family , and today is owned by the Lurgan Loyal Orange District Lodge . The adjacent Lurgan Park , now a public park owned by Craigavon Borough Council , used to be part of the same estate . The park is the venue for the Lurgan Park Rally . 
 = = = Religious sites = = = 
 The site of what is now Shankill cemetery served as a place of worship over the centuries . It began in ancient times as a simple double ring fort , the outline of which is still noticeable , and is today an historic burial site holding the remains of people who lived in the earliest days of the town 's existence , including the Brownlow family . Dougher cemetery is another old graveyard that was donated to the Catholic people by the Brownlows following passage of the Catholic Relief Act . 
 The two most prominent modern places of worship are Shankill Parish Church in Church Place and St Peter 's Church in North Street , the steeples of which are visible from far outside the town . 
 Shankill Parish Church belongs to the Church of Ireland . The original church was established at Oxford Island on the shore of Lough Neagh in 1411 , but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area . It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town , and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the ' Green of Lurgan ' , now known as Church Place , where it stands to this day . It is believed to be the largest parish church in Ireland . 
 Following passage of the Catholic Relief Act , Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O 'Brien in 1829 for the construction of a church on Distillery Hill , now known as lower North Street . It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter 's Church . In 1966 , another Catholic church , St Paul 's , was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street . This was a radical departure from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish , copper roof , slim spire , hexagonal angles and modern design throughout . Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul 's School . It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates . 
 The Lurgan Museum houses one of the largest collections of items relating to Irish History in the North of Ireland . The Museum has many photographs and artefacts connected with Lurgan life over the past 150 years . It houses an extensive collection relating to the periods known as " The Troubles " , " Operation Harvest " 1956 @-@ 62 , and " The 1916 Easter Rising " . This collection also has a popular section covering the social history of the area . 
 The first Methodist church was built in Nettleton 's Court , Queen Street in 1778 . It was found to be too small and a new church was built on High Street in 1802 , and replaced by a newer building in front of it in 1826 . This was extensively renovated in 1910 and stands to this day sporting a simple facade . 
 = = Education = = 
 It was the late 19th century that saw the development of formal education in Lurgan and a significant move away from the less organised hedge schools of before . 
 Today , schools in Lurgan operate under the Dickson Plan , a transfer system in north Armagh that allows pupils at age 11 the option of taking the Eleven Plus exam to enter grammar schools , with pupils in comprehensive junior high schools being sorted into grammar and non @-@ grammar streams . Pupils can get promoted to or demoted from the grammar stream during their time in those schools depending on the development of their academic performance , and at age 14 can take subject @-@ based exams across the syllabus to qualify for entry into a dedicated grammar school to pursue GCSEs and A @-@ levels . 
 As is common in Northern Ireland , most of the schools in Lurgan are attended mainly by children from one or other of the two main religious blocs reflecting the existence of deep @-@ seated sectarian and political divisions in society . Some schools are in the Catholic ' maintained ' sector , i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools , and others are controlled directly by the state . Directly @-@ controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake .

 At primary level , schools attended by the Protestant / unionist community are Carrick Primary School , Dickson Primary School , and King 's Park Primary School . 
 The Model School was part of the national schools programme proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to other national schools in the area and as a teacher training establishment ( although teacher training did not take place at this particular school ) . Initially it had a multi @-@ denominational intake , offered such services as night classes and industry @-@ relevant vocational courses , and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town . It was undermined , however , by church interests , which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control , and criticism of the efficiency of its management , hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town . Over the years , the intake of Catholic / nationalist students steadily increased , due mainly to being situated in the Catholic side of Lurgan . The student body is now almost 100 % Catholic , with the last recorded Protestant pupil having left the school in 1999 . 
 Other Catholic primary schools are Carrick Primary School , <unk> Naomh <unk> , St. Francis ' Primary School , St Teresa 's Primary School , St Anthony 's Primary School , Tannaghmore Primary School , and <unk> Primary School .

 At secondary level , schools attended by the Protestant community are Lurgan College , and Lurgan Junior High School ( formerly part of Lurgan College of Further Education ) . 
 Lurgan College , now a co @-@ ed 14 – 18 grammar school , was established in 1873 as an all @-@ boys school to provide what was known as ' classical education ' as opposed to the more practical vocational education on offer at the Model School . Its initial charter included a provision that " no person being in Holy Orders , or a minister of any religious denomination shall at any time interfere in the management of the said school , or be appointed to serve as master " and that no religious instruction was to take place during school hours . 
 Secondary schools attended by the Catholic / nationalist community were previously St Mary 's Junior High School , St Paul 's Junior High School , and St Michael 's Grammar School , which have emerged to become one school spanning the 3 sites , St Ronan 's College . 
 St Mary 's Intermediate School was built on Kitchen Hill after land was acquired from the Sisters of Mercy in 1955 and was opened in 1959 as an all @-@ girls school . The nearby all @-@ boys St Paul 's Intermediate School was opened in 1962 , and both of these schools are now known as junior high schools . Pupils attend these schools from age 11 to 13 , at which time they have the option of transferring to St Michael 's if they qualify . Those who do not qualify may stay on at St Paul 's and St Mary 's until minimum school leaving age at 16 and where the option of taking GCSE exams is available . 
 A significant number of people from Lurgan also attend the Catholic maintained Lismore Comprehensive School in Craigavon . 
 Lurgan Technical College was renamed Lurgan College of Further Education , and subsequently merged with Portadown CFE and Banbridge CFE into the larger Upper Bann Institute of Further and Higher Education ( <unk> ) . Further education in the region was consolidated further when this institution was merged with other FE colleges in Armagh , Newry and <unk> to form the Southern Regional College .

 Cirque du Soleil ( pronounced : [ <unk> dy <unk> ] , " Circus of the Sun " ) is a Canadian entertainment company . It is the largest theatrical producer in the world . Based in Montreal , Quebec , Canada , and located in the inner @-@ city area of Saint @-@ Michel , it was founded in Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul in 1984 by two former street performers , Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste @-@ Croix . 
 Initially named Les Échassiers ( [ lez ‿ <unk> ] , " The Waders " ) , they toured Quebec in 1980 as a performing troupe . Their initial financial hardship was relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the Canada Council for the Arts , as part of the 450th anniversary celebrations of Jacques Cartier 's voyage to Canada . Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success in 1984 , and after securing a second year of funding , Laliberté hired Guy Caron from the National Circus School to re @-@ create it as a " proper circus " . Its theatrical , character @-@ driven approach and the absence of performing animals helped define Cirque du Soleil as the contemporary circus ( " nouveau cirque " ) that it remains today . 
 Each show is a synthesis of circus styles from around the world , with its own central theme and storyline . Shows employ continuous live music , with performers rather than stagehands changing the props . After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s , Nouvelle <unk> was created – with the direction of Franco <unk> – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990 , but allowed it to create new shows . 
 Cirque du Soleil expanded rapidly through the 1990s and 2000s , going from one show to 19 shows in over 271 cities on every continent except Antarctica . The shows employ approximately 4 @,@ 000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceeding US $ 810 million . The multiple permanent Las Vegas shows alone play to more than 9 @,@ 000 people a night , 5 % of the city 's visitors , adding to the 90 million people who have experienced Cirque du Soleil 's shows worldwide . 
 In 2000 , Laliberté bought out Gauthier , and with 95 % ownership , has continued to expand the brand . In 2008 , Laliberté split 20 % of his share equally between two investment groups <unk> World and <unk> of Dubai , in order to further finance the company 's goals . In partnership with these two groups , Cirque du Soleil had planned to build a residency show in the United Arab Emirates in 2012 directed by Guy Caron ( Dralion ) and Michael Curry . But since Dubai 's financial problems in 2010 caused by the 2008 recession , it was stated by Laliberté that the project has been " put on ice " for the time being and may be looking for another financial partner to bankroll the company 's future plans , even willing to give up another 10 % of his share . Several more shows are in development around the world , along with a television deal , women 's clothing line and the possible venture into other mediums such as spas , restaurants and nightclubs . Cirque du Soleil also produces a small number of private and corporate events each year ( past clients have been the royal family of Dubai and the 2007 Super Bowl ) . 
 The company 's creations have received numerous prizes and distinctions , including a Bambi Award in 1997 , a Rose d 'Or in 1989 , three Drama Desk Awards in 1991 , 1998 and 2013 , three Gemini Awards , four Primetime Emmy Awards , and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . In 2000 , Cirque du Soleil was awarded the National Arts Centre Award , a companion award of the Governor General 's Performing Arts Awards . In 2002 , Cirque du Soleil was inducted into Canada 's Walk of Fame . 
 In 2015 , TPG Capital , <unk> Capital Group and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec purchased 90 % of Cirque du Soleil . The sale received regulatory approval from the Government of Canada on 30 June 2015 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 At age 18 , interested in pursuing some kind of performing career , Guy Laliberté quit college and left home . He toured Europe as a folk musician and busker . By the time he returned home to Canada in 1979 , he had learned the art of fire breathing . Although he became " employed " at a hydroelectric power plant in James Bay , his job ended after only three days due to a labour strike . He decided not to look for another job , instead supporting himself on his unemployment insurance . He helped organize a summer fair in Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul with the help of a pair of friends named Daniel Gauthier and Gilles Ste @-@ Croix . 
 Gauthier and Ste @-@ Croix were managing a youth hostel for performing artists named Le Balcon Vert at that time . By the summer of 1979 , Ste @-@ Croix had been developing the idea of turning the Balcon Vert , and the talented performers who lived there , into an organized performing troupe . As part of a publicity stunt to convince the Quebec government to help fund his production , Ste @-@ Croix walked the 56 miles ( 90 km ) from Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul to Quebec City on stilts . The ploy worked , giving the three men the money to create Les Échassiers de Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul . Employing many of the people who would later make up Cirque du Soleil , Les Échassiers toured Quebec during the summer of 1980 . 
 Although well received by audiences and critics alike , Les Échassiers was a financial failure . Laliberté spent that winter in Hawaii plying his trade while Ste @-@ Croix stayed in Quebec to set up a nonprofit holding company named " The High @-@ Heeled Club " to mitigate the losses of the previous summer . In 1981 , they met with better results . By that fall , Les Échassiers de Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul had broken even . The success inspired Laliberté and Ste @-@ Croix to organize a summer fair in their hometown of Baie @-@ Saint @-@ Paul . 
 This touring festival , called " La Fête Foraine " , first took place in July 1982 . La Fête Foraine featured workshops to teach the circus arts to the public , after which those who participated could take part in a performance . Ironically , the festival was barred from its own hosting town after complaints from local citizens . Laliberté managed and produced the fair over the next couple years , nurturing it into a moderate financial success . But it was in 1983 that the government of Quebec gave him a $ 1 @.@ 5 million grant to host a production the following year as part of Quebec 's 450th anniversary celebration of the French explorer Jacques Cartier 's discovery of Canada . Laliberté named his creation " Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil " . 
 = = Shows = = 
 The duration of each touring show was traditionally split into two acts of an hour each separated by a 30 @-@ minute interval ; however , as of 2014 , due to cost cutting issues , the shows have now been reduced to a shorter 55 @-@ minute first act followed by a 50 @-@ minute second act , still including a 30 @-@ minute interval . Permanent shows are usually 90 minutes in length without any intermission . This excludes <unk> ( the permanent show in Riviera Maya , Mexico ) , which is only 70 minutes in length . Typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week . Touring shows usually have one ' dark day ' ( with no performances ) while resident shows have two . 
 = = = Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil = = = 
 Originally intended to only be a one @-@ year project , Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec over the course of 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine . The first shows were riddled with difficulty , starting with the collapse of the big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap . Working with a borrowed tent , Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers . They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus 's inexperience that they had , at one point , sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated . 
 The problems were only transient , however , and by the time 1984 had come to a close , Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success . Having only $ 60 @,@ 000 left in the bank , Laliberté went back to the Canadian government to secure funding for a second year . While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic , the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the idea . It was not until Quebec 's premier , René Lévesque , intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented . The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune <unk> , a 1930s @-@ style carnival that is home to the Cirque Maroc acrobats . 
 = = = La Magie Continue = = = 
 After securing funding from the Canadian government for a second year , Laliberté took steps to renovate Cirque du Soleil from a group of street performers into a " proper circus " . To accomplish this he hired the head of the National Circus School , Guy Caron , as Cirque du Soleil 's artistic director . The influences that Laliberté and Caron had in reshaping their circus were extensive . They wanted strong emotional music that was played from beginning to end by musicians . They wanted to emulate the Moscow Circus ' method of having the acts tell a story . Performers , rather than a technical crew , move equipment and props on and off stage so that it did not disrupt the momentum of the " storyline " . Most importantly , their vision was to create a circus with neither a ring nor animals . The rationale was that the lack of both of these things draws the audience more into the performance . 
 To help design the next major show , Laliberté and Caron hired Franco <unk> , another instructor from the National Circus School who had been working in Belgium . When he joined the troupe in 1985 , he brought with him his experience in commedia dell 'arte techniques , which he imparted to the performers . Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints , he would go on to direct every show up to , but not including Dralion . 
 By 1986 , the company was once again in serious financial trouble . During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response . In Toronto they performed in front of a 25 % capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show . Gilles Ste @-@ Croix , dressed in a monkey suit , walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt . A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic . 
 Several factors prevented the company from going bankrupt that year . The Desjardins Group , which was Cirque du Soleil 's financial institution at the time , covered about $ 200 @,@ 000 of bad checks . Also , a financier named Daniel <unk> , who worked for one of the largest public relations firms in Quebec , represented the company for free , knowing that they didn 't have the money to pay his fee . The Quebec government itself also came through again , granting Laliberté enough money to stay solvent for another year . 
 = = = Le Cirque <unk> = = = 
 In 1987 , after Laliberté re @-@ privatized Cirque du Soleil , it was invited to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival . Although they continued to be plagued by financial difficulties , Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles , despite only having enough money to make a one @-@ way trip . Had the show been a failure , the company would not have had enough money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal . 
 The festival turned out to be a huge success , both critically and financially . The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives , including Columbia Pictures , which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil . Laliberté was unhappy with the deal , claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia , which was attempting to secure all rights to the production . Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded , and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remains independent and privately owned today . 
 In 1988 , Guy Caron left the company due to artistic differences over what to do with the money generated by Cirque du Soleil 's first financially successful tour . Laliberté wanted to use it to expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved , with a portion going back to the National Circus School . An agreement was never met and Caron , along with a large number of artists loyal to him , departed . This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show . 
 Laliberté sought out Gilles Ste @-@ Croix as replacement for the artistic director position . Ste @-@ Croix , who had been away from the company since 1985 , agreed to return . The company went through more internal troubles , including a failed attempt to add Normand Latourelle as a third man to the partnership . This triumvirate lasted only six months before internal disagreements prompted Gauthier and Laliberté to buy out Latourelle . By the end of 1989 , Cirque du Soleil was once again in a deficit . 
 = = = Fascination = = = 
 With <unk> finished and touring in the United States and Canada , Cirque du Soleil toured Japan in the summer of 1992 at the behest of the Fuji Television Network . Taking acts from Nouvelle <unk> and Cirque <unk> , they created a show for this tour , titled Fascination . Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan , it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top . It was also the first that Cirque du Soleil performed outside of North America .

 Also in 1992 , Cirque du Soleil made its first collaboration with Switzerland 's Circus Knie in a production named Knie Presents Cirque du Soleil that toured for nine months from 20 March to 29 November 1992 through 60 cities in Switzerland , opening in Rapperswil and closing in Bellinzona . The production merged Circus Knie 's animal acts with Cirque du Soleil 's acrobatic acts . The stage resembled that of Cirque du Soleil 's previous shows La Magie Continue and Le Cirque <unk> , but was modified to accommodate Circus Knie 's animals .

 As of October 2015 , Cirque du Soleil renounced its intention to be involved in Las Vegas nightclubs and has since dissociated itself from all lounges and clubs listed below . These lounges are no longer affiliated with Cirque du Soleil . 
 Revolution is a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 500 m2 ) lounge concept designed for The Mirage resort in Las Vegas , in which cast members perform to the music of The Beatles . Cirque du Soleil drew inspiration from the Beatles ' lyrics to design some of the lounge 's features .

The VIP tables use infrared technology that allows guests to create artwork , which is then projected onto <unk> columns . 
 Cirque du Soleil 's second lounge was the Gold Lounge , which is located in the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and is 3 @,@ 756 square feet ( 349 m2 ) .

 Cirque du Soleil shows normally tour under a grand chapiteau ( i.e. big top ) for an extended period of time until they are modified , if necessary , for touring in arenas and other venues . The company 's grands <unk> are easily recognizable by their blue and yellow coloring .

 In November 2003 , a US federal discrimination complaint was filed against Cirque du Soleil by Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on behalf of gymnast Matthew Cusick . The allegation was that in April 2002 , they fired Cusick because he tested HIV positive . Cusick had not yet performed , but had completed his training and was scheduled to begin working at Mystère just a few days after he was terminated . Even though company doctors had already cleared him as healthy enough to perform , Cirque du Soleil alleged that due to the nature of Cusick 's disease coupled with his job 's high risk of injury , there was a significant risk of his infecting other performers , crew or audience members . Cirque du Soleil said that they had several HIV @-@ positive employees , but in the case of Cusick , the risk of him spreading his infection while performing was too high to take the risk . A boycott ensued and Just Out ran a story on it with the headline " Flipping off the Cirque " . 
 An additional complaint was filed on Cusick 's behalf by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission . Their complaint stemmed from the issue that the City of San Francisco bans contracts ( or in this case land leases ) to discriminatory employers . 
 Although Cirque du Soleil 's position remains that this was a safety issue , not a discrimination issue , they settled with Cusick on 22 April 2004 . The terms of the settlement include that the company would initiate a <unk> anti @-@ discrimination training program and alter its employment practices pertaining to HIV @-@ positive applicants . In addition , Matthew Cusick received $ 60 @,@ 000 in lost wages , $ 200 @,@ 000 in front pay , $ 300 @,@ 000 in compensatory damages and Lambda Legal received $ 40 @,@ 000 in attorney fees .

Instrumentation featured in " Superstar " includes guitars and drum machines . Lyrically , Madonna compares her boyfriend with famous men , such as John Travolta , Abraham Lincoln , Al Capone , among others and claims to be his " biggest fan " . 
 The accompanying artwork for the single was created by Brazilian graffiti artist Simone Sapienza , who won a contest sponsored by Johnnie Walker 's Keep Walking Project in Brazil . She was chosen by Madonna from ten finalists of the contest . " Superstar " received mixed to positive reviews from music critics , most of whom felt it would be a potential single and praised the production , while others dismissed the lyrical content . A music video for the track was shot , however it was controversial since Madonna wanted to dress as a " Terror Bride " , a combination of an Iraqi bridal veil and a US soldier 's uniform . Subsequently , the video was never released . " Superstar " was used in a television campaign for US TV channel Bravo , supporting its " Summer by Bravo " promotion including stars from its original programming .

 " Superstar " was written and produced by Madonna , Hardy " Indigo " Muanza and Michael Malih and was recorded at MSR Studios in New York City . After the completion of MDNA , critics around the world were invited to Abbey Road Studios for an initial review of the album . Many critics noted that Madonna 's daughter Lourdes ' vocals appeared in " Superstar " , which was subsequently confirmed by the singer herself . When Madonna was talking to The Sun about her daughter 's collaboration , she said : " [ Lola ] just came over to the studio that day . Then I said , ' Oh , can you sing this part ? ' and she agreed to . " Further explanation about Lourdes ' singing on the track was given : 
 She has a very good voice . She 's quite shy about it and won 't admit it . Lots of people are knocking on my door to meet her about everything , movies , what @-@ not . But she 's not really interested in any of it . She just wants to go to school . She says to me , ' Mum , I just want to be a normal kid . I 'm not ready for any of that . ' I respect that , and if she ever wants to work with me on any level , I welcome it . But otherwise , I leave her to homework and school . 
 Musically , " Superstar " is an uptempo dance @-@ pop song , that features influences of electronic and pop music . The track was mixed by Demacio ' Demo ' Castellon for The Demolition Crew , and recorded by Angie Teo . Editing for the track was completed by Stephen ' The Koz ' Kozmeniuk for The Demolition Crew . The song makes references to historical figures including Marlon Brando , James Dean , Al Capone , Bruce Lee , Julius Caesar , Abraham Lincoln and John Travolta . Billboard 's Keith Caulfied noted dubstep influences during the bridge , and like other songs on MDNA , " Superstar " takes time to change the composition into a fast @-@ paced track . According to Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph , the composition features a " shimmering ambiance built up from a ringing guitar loop and echoing tom @-@ tom pattern that might have been constructed from Beatles ' drum fills . " Along with the looping music , the lyrics are simple and obtuse in nature , which McCormick believed was done deliberately like " You can have the password to my phone / I 'll give you a massage when you get home " . There are also references to her older songs like " Into the Groove " ( 1985 ) with the line , " You 're Travolta getting into your groove " .

Dean Piper from the Daily Mirror felt the song was not one he was " immediately keen on – but the one that 's in my head . It 's lyrically very simple [ ... ] It 's a little rockier than the others and more conventional . " Sharing the same view , The Sun 's Gordon Smart called the song a " stand @-@ out " on MDNA . Priya Elan from NME was very positive towards the song , and described it , along with " Girl Gone Wild " , as " accomplishments " and " sound better than they have any right to . " While reviewing the album , Robert Copsey from Digital Spy noted that " Superstar " was the most " relaxed [ sounding ] song " compared to the rest of the track which he described as kind of " in @-@ yer @-@ face . " Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph described the song as " sweet and summery " . Writing for Popjustice , Brad O <unk> rated the song 9 out of 10 and explained in detail : 
 The lyrical reference points in [ ' Superstar ' ] are all quite interesting — if you consider the youth @-@ obsessed reference collaborators of the first two singles and how uncomfortable it all feels . ' Superstar ' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin . All the reference points will mean very little to your average 17 @-@ year @-@ old . We suppose the idea is that they 're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it 's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song . The lyrics about being in love are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes . 
 Michael Roffman from Consequence of Sound was more critical towards the lyrical content , describing the song itself as " infantile " and her lyrics like they were " stripped from a fifth grader 's notebook at the history fair . " Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani gave it a mixed review , calling its lyrical content a " faux pas " . Another mixed reception came from writers of Virgin Media , who awarded it three stars out of five , and called it a " passable slice of electro @-@ hued chart @-@ pop . " Enio Chiola from PopMatters gave it a poor review for its lyrical content by calling it " badly written " , but stated that songs like " ' Superstar ' and ' Masterpiece ' indicates that Madonna isn 't just a <unk> mess of bitterness . " In his review of MDNA for Pitchfork Media , Matthew Perpetua said that the track , along with " B @-@ Day Song " from the album , are " mesmerizingly dumb lyrics " and are as " spiteful trolling rather than vapid pandering .

 = Cyclone Elita = 
 Cyclone Elita was an unusual tropical cyclone that made landfall on Madagascar three times . The fifth named storm of the 2003 – 04 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season , Elita developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 24 , 2004 . It strengthened to become a tropical cyclone before striking northwestern Madagascar on January 28 . Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island , and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean , it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern Madagascar on January 31 . After once again crossing the island , the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re @-@ intensified . Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern Madagascar . Two days later , it underwent an extratropical transition ; the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13 . 
 Elita dropped heavy rainfall of more than 200 mm ( 8 inches ) , which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar . Over 50 @,@ 000 people were left homeless , primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces . Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450 km ² ( 170 sq mi ) of agricultural land , including important crops for food . Across the island , the cyclone caused 33 deaths , with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later . Elsewhere , Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi , and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in Seychelles , Mauritius , and Réunion . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 An area of thunderstorms developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 25 , 2004 , about 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Madagascar . Deep convection developed and organized around a mid- to low @-@ level circulation , and at 0600 UTC on January 26 , Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 06 , about 105 km ( 65 mi ) west of Maintirano , Madagascar . Six hours later , it was upgraded to Tropical Depression 06 , and later that day the depression was named Elita . At the same time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began issuing advisories on the cyclone . Strengthening at first was slow , due to moderate wind shear limiting the convection to the northern portion of the cyclone . Initially , the storm tracked in an unusual northward motion toward the equator , which was caused by a ridge to its west . 
 Early on January 27 , Elita was upgraded to a moderate tropical storm , though later that day it weakened to tropical depression status . However , it quickly re @-@ attained tropical storm status early on January 28 , with convection increasing further . Elita turned east @-@ southeastward due to a ridge to its north , quickly intensifying as it approached land and developing a well @-@ defined eye on visible satellite imagery . It intensified to tropical cyclone status , or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane , at 1200 UTC on January 28 . Three hours later , Elita made landfall on <unk> Bay in northwestern Madagascar with wind gusts of over 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) . The storm rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land , though as it crossed the island convection re @-@ developed over the waters east of Madagascar . Elita reached the southwest Indian Ocean by January 30 , and its convection quickly organized into rainbands . It drifted southward a short distance offshore , slowly intensifying before attaining tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on January 31 . About six hours later , after turning to the west , Elita moved ashore near Mananjary with winds of about 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) , as reported by MFR . 
 The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it tracked westward across Madagascar , and late on January 31 it emerged into the Mozambique Channel . Deep convection increased as it reached open waters , with outflow improving . A strengthening ridge to its north caused Elita to decelerate before turning to the east @-@ southeast . Late on February 2 , the JTWC assessed Elita with peak winds of 120 km / h ( 75 km / h ) , and shortly thereafter MFR reported the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) . Early on February 3 , Elita moved ashore near Morondava at peak intensity . Weakening rapidly while crossing the island for a third time , the cyclone emerged into the southwest Indian Ocean as a tropical depression by 0000 UTC on February 4 . Despite initial forecasts of re @-@ intensification , Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection , leaving its center exposed under the influence of a strong upper @-@ level trough . By February 5 , it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and its motion had halted due to weak steering currents . For about a week , the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar before dissipating on February 13 . 
 Elita 's crossing of Madagascar three times is unusual , but not unprecedented ; Severe Tropical Storm Felicia in January 1970 and Storm Justine in March 1982 accomplished the same feat . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The Mozambique National Institute of Meteorology advised people living in Nampula , Zambezia , Sofala , and Inhambane Provinces to make preparations for strong winds and rainfall . In Nampula province , over 2000 buildings were destroyed . The most severe damage was to generally poorly built houses in <unk> , Nacala @-@ a @-@ Velha , <unk> , and Nampula city . In the latter city , an Islamic school was badly damaged , and in <unk> @-@ a @-@ Velha survivors had to spend the night of January 29 in the open . All in all , Elita impacted four provinces of Mozambique . Much of the impact was along the coast from Inhambane to Nampula . The inflow of the storm brought moisture from the Intertropical Convergence Zone through Malawi , which produced heavy rainfall of over 150 mm ( 6 in ) ; the rainfall destroyed more than 80 houses and a clinic in Karonga district . The storm brought rough seas , gusty winds , and some precipitation to the southwestern islands in Seychelles . 
 Upon making its first landfall on Madagascar , Elita dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 715 mm ( 28 @.@ 1 in ) including a 24 ‑ hour total of 222 mm ( 8 @.@ 74 in ) in <unk> . Wind gusts reached over 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) in Mahajanga . The passage of the cyclone left 5 @,@ 000 people homeless in the vicinity of its first landfall , with 90 percent of the buildings in northwestern Mahajanga Province damaged by the storm . At least two people were killed in the region . Throughout the country , Cyclone Elita destroyed or severely damaged 12 @,@ 408 homes , which left 55 @,@ 983 people homeless , primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara . This forced around 7 @,@ 000 people to seek shelter in either stadiums or in the remaining standing buildings . Additionally , a total of 510 schools and hospitals received major damage . The cyclone affected five of the six provinces of Madagascar , with roads and power being severely disrupted in some areas ; at least 39 bridges were damaged or destroyed . The cities of Maintirano and <unk> were both severely damaged . In Midongy <unk> , heavy rainfall flooded 80 % of the town 's rice crop , and the corn and manioc crops were both similarly affected . These represent the staple foods of the population , and across the nation the storm damaged more than 450 km2 ( 170 sq mi ) of agricultural land . Throughout Madagascar , the cyclone killed at least 33 people and injured 129 others . 
 The extratropical remnants of Elita produced rough seas and strong winds on Mauritius and Réunion island , which caused one ship to sink .

 On February 13 , 2004 , officials in Madagascar issued an appeal for international aid . By a month after the storm , the governments of France , the United States , Germany , and Japan sent a total of $ 287 @,@ 000 ( 2004 USD ) in assistance . The government of France sent a plane with food , medicine , and other equipment to the affected areas . The government of Germany sent aid to be used for foods and medicines . On February 27 , the government of Japan sent aid to the country , including tents , generators , and plastic sheets . 
 Officials distributed emergency relief items to the affected areas , including rice , sugar , soap , candles , matches and water purification tablets . In Morondava in Toliara Province , the government distributed 4 tons of rice seed , while in Ambatolampy in Antananarivo Province , the government sent 10 tons of rice ; additionally , the World Food Programme sent 80 tons of flour to the nation .

 = Finnegans Wake = 
 Finnegans Wake is a novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It is significant for its experimental style and reputation as one of the most difficult works of fiction in the English language . Written in Paris over a period of seventeen years , and published in 1939 , two years before the author 's death , Finnegans Wake was Joyce 's final work . The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language , consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and <unk> multilingual puns and portmanteau words , which many critics believe were attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams . Owing to the work 's expansive linguistic experiments , stream of consciousness writing style , literary allusions , free dream associations , and abandonment of narrative conventions , Finnegans Wake remains largely unread by the general public . 
 Despite the obstacles , readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book 's central cast of characters and , to a lesser degree , its plot . However , a number of key details remain elusive . The book discusses , in an unorthodox fashion , the Earwicker family , comprising the father HCE , the mother ALP , and their three children Shem the Penman , Shaun the Postman , and Issy . Following an unspecified rumour about HCE , the book , in a nonlinear dream narrative , follows his wife 's attempts to exonerate him with a letter , his sons ' struggle to replace him , Shaun 's rise to prominence , and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn . The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book 's unfinished closing line , making the work a never @-@ ending cycle . Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip <unk> link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico 's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ( " The New Science " ) , upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured . 
 Joyce began working on Finnegans Wake shortly after the 1922 publication of Ulysses . By 1924 installments of Joyce 's new avant @-@ garde work began to appear , in serialized form , in Parisian literary journals transatlantic review and transition , under the title " fragments from Work in Progress " . The actual title of the work remained a secret until the book was published in its entirety , on 4 May 1939 . Initial reaction to Finnegans Wake , both in its serialized and final published form , was largely negative , ranging from bafflement at its radical reworking of the English language to open hostility towards its lack of respect for the conventions of the novel . 
 The work has since , however , come to assume a preeminent place in English literature , despite its numerous detractors . Anthony Burgess has lauded Finnegans Wake as " a great comic vision , one of the few books of the world that can make us laugh aloud on nearly every page . " The prominent literary academic Harold Bloom has called it Joyce 's masterpiece , and wrote that " [ if ] aesthetic merit were ever again to center the canon [ Finnegans Wake ] would be as close as our chaos could come to the heights of Shakespeare and Dante . " In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked Finnegans Wake 77th on its list of the 100 best English @-@ language novels of the 20th century . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 Having completed work on Ulysses , Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year . On 10 March 1923 he wrote a letter to his patron , Harriet Weaver : " Yesterday I wrote two pages — the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses . Having found a pen , with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of <unk> so that I could read them . " This is the earliest reference to what would become Finnegans Wake . 
 The two pages in question consisted of the short sketch " Roderick O 'Conor " , concerning the historic last king of Ireland cleaning up after guests by drinking the dregs of their dirty glasses . Joyce completed another four short sketches in July and August 1923 , while holidaying in Bognor . The sketches , which dealt with different aspects of Irish history , are commonly known as " Tristan and Isolde " , " Saint Patrick and the Druid , " " Kevin 's <unk> " and " Mamalujo " . While these sketches would eventually be incorporated into Finnegans Wake in one form or another , they did not contain any of the main characters or plot points which would later come to constitute the backbone of the book . The first signs of what would eventually become Finnegans Wake came in August 1923 when Joyce wrote the sketch " Here Comes Everybody " , which dealt for the first time with the book 's protagonist HCE . 
 Over the next few years , Joyce 's method became one of " increasingly obsessional concern with note @-@ taking , since [ he ] obviously felt that any word he wrote had first to have been recorded in some notebook . " As Joyce continued to incorporate these notes into his work , the text became increasingly dense and obscure . 
 By 1926 Joyce had largely completed both Books I and III . Geert <unk> asserts that Book I had , at this early stage , " a real focus that had developed out of the HCE [ " Here Comes Everybody " ] sketch : the story of HCE , of his wife and children . There were the adventures of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker himself and the rumours about them in chapters 2 – 4 , a description of his wife ALP 's letter in chapter 5 , a denunciation of his son Shem in chapter 7 , and a dialogue about ALP in chapter 8 . These texts [ ... ] formed a unity . " In the same year Joyce met Maria and Eugène Jolas in Paris , just as his new work was generating an increasingly negative reaction from readers and critics , culminating in The Dial 's refusal to publish the four chapters of Book III in September 1926 . The Jolases gave Joyce valuable encouragement and material support throughout the long process of writing Finnegans Wake , and published sections of the book in serial form in their literary magazine transition , under the title Work In Progress . For the next few years Joyce worked rapidly on the book , adding what would become chapters I.1 and <unk> , and revising the already written segments to make them more lexically complex . 
 However , by this time some early supporters of Joyce 's work , such as Ezra Pound and the author 's brother Stanislaus Joyce , had grown increasingly unsympathetic to his new writing . In order to create a more favourable critical climate , a group of Joyce 's supporters ( including Samuel Beckett , William Carlos Williams , Rebecca West and others ) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work . It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress . In July 1929 , increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving , Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of his completing the book . Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had " explained to [ Stephens ] all about the book , at least a great deal , and he promised me that if I found it madness to continue , in my condition , and saw no other way out , that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it , that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth . " Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds , as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce , exactly one week later , and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter @-@ ego Stephen Dedalus . In the end , Stephens was not asked to finish the book . 
 In the 1930s , as he was writing Books II and IV , Joyce 's progress slowed considerably . This was due to a number of factors including the death of his father John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931 ; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia ; and his own health problems , chiefly his failing eyesight . 
 Finnegans Wake was published in book form , after seventeen years of composition , on 4 May 1939 . Joyce died two years later in Zürich , on 13 January 1941 .

 Finnegans Wake comprises seventeen chapters , divided into four Books . Book I contains eight chapters , Books II and III each contain four , and Book IV consists of only one short chapter . The chapters appear without titles , and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had done for Ulysses , he did title various sections published separately ( see Publication history below ) . The standard critical practice , however , is to indicate book number in Roman numerals , and chapter title in Arabic , so that <unk> , for example , indicates the second chapter of the third book . 
 Given the book 's fluid and changeable approach to plot and characters , a definitive , critically agreed @-@ upon plot synopsis remains elusive ( see Critical response and themes : Difficulties of plot summary below ) . Therefore , the following synopsis attempts to summarise events in the book which find general , although inevitably not universal , consensus among critics . 
 = = = Book I = = = 
 The entire work forms a cycle : the last sentence — a fragment — <unk> to the beginning sentence : " a way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun , past Eve and Adam 's , from swerve of shore to bend of bay , brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs . " Joyce himself revealed that the book " ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence . " The introductory chapter ( I.1 ) establishes the book 's setting as " Howth Castle and Environs " ( i.e. the Dublin area ) , and introduces Dublin hod carrier " Finnegan " , who falls to his death from a ladder while constructing a wall . Finnegan 's wife Annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake , but he vanishes before they can eat him . A series of episodic vignettes follows , loosely related to the dead Finnegan , most commonly referred to as " The Willingdone Museyroom " , " Mutt and Jute " , and " The <unk> " . At the chapter 's close a fight breaks out , whiskey splashes on Finnegan 's corpse , and “ the dead Finnegan rises from his coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners put him back to rest ” , persuading him that he is better off where he is . The chapter ends with the image of the HCE character sailing into Dublin Bay to take a central role in the story . 
 I.2 opens with an account of " Harold or Humphrey " Chimpden receiving the nickname " Earwicker " from the Sailor King , who encounters him attempting to catch earwigs with an inverted flowerpot on a stick while manning a tollgate through which the King is passing . This name helps Chimpden , now known by his initials HCE , to rise to prominence in Dublin society as " Here Comes Everybody " . He is then brought low by a rumour that begins to spread across Dublin , apparently concerning a sexual trespass involving two girls in the Phoenix Park , although details of HCE 's transgression change with each retelling of events . 
 Chapters I.2 through I.4 follow the progress of this rumor , starting with HCE 's encounter with " a cad with a pipe " in Phoenix Park . The cad greets HCE in Gaelic and asks the time , but HCE misunderstands the question as an accusation , and incriminates himself by denying rumours the cad has not yet heard . These rumours quickly spread across Dublin , gathering momentum until they are turned into a song penned by the character <unk> called " The Ballad of Persse O 'Reilly " . As a result , HCE goes into hiding , where he is besieged at the closed gate of his pub by a visiting American looking for drink after hours . However HCE remains silent – not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse – dreams , is buried in a coffin at the bottom of Lough Neagh , and is finally brought to trial , under the name <unk> King . He is eventually freed , and goes once more into hiding . An important piece of evidence during the trial – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for so that it can be examined in closer detail . 
 ALP 's Letter becomes the focal point as it is analysed in detail in <unk> This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem , a writer , and entrusted to her other son Shaun , a postman , for delivery . The letter never reaches its intended destination , ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy . Chapter <unk> digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail , in the form of twelve riddles and answers . 
 In the final two chapters of Book I we learn more about the letter 's writer Shem the Penman ( <unk> ) and its original author , his mother ALP ( I.8 ) . The Shem chapter consists of " Shaun 's character assassination of his brother Shem " , describing the hermetic artist as a forger and a " sham " , before " Shem is protected by his mother [ ALP ] , who appears at the end to come and defend her son . " The following chapter concerning Shem 's mother , known as " Anna Livia Plurabelle " , is interwoven with thousands of river names from all over the globe , and is widely considered the book 's most celebrated passage . The chapter was described by Joyce in 1924 as " a chattering dialogue across the river by two washerwomen who as night falls become a tree and a stone . " These two washerwomen gossip about ALP 's response to the allegations laid against her husband HCE , as they wash clothes in the Liffey . ALP is said to have written a letter declaring herself tired of her mate . Their gossip then digresses to her youthful affairs and sexual encounters , before returning to the publication of HCE 's guilt in the morning newspaper , and his wife 's revenge on his enemies : borrowing a " <unk> " from her son Shaun the Post , she delivers presents to her 111 children . At the chapter 's close the washerwomen try to pick up the thread of the story , but their conversation is increasingly difficult as they are on opposite sides of the widening Liffey , and it is getting dark . Finally , as they turn into a tree and a stone , they ask to be told a Tale of Shem or Shaun . 
 = = = Book II = = = 
 While Book I of Finnegans Wake deals mostly with the parents HCE and ALP , Book II shifts that focus onto their children , Shem , Shaun and Issy . 
 <unk> opens with a pantomime programme , which outlines , in relatively clear language , the identities and attributes of the book 's main characters . The chapter then concerns a guessing game among the children , in which Shem is challenged three times to guess by " <unk> " the colour which the girls have chosen . Unable to answer due to his poor eyesight , Shem goes into exile in disgrace , and Shaun wins the affection of the girls . Finally HCE emerges from the pub and in a thunder @-@ like voice calls the children inside . 
 Chapter <unk> follows Shem , Shaun and Issy studying upstairs in the pub , after having been called inside in the previous chapter . The chapter depicts " [ Shem ] coaching [ Shaun ] how to do Euclid Bk I , 1 " , structured as " a reproduction of a schoolboys ' ( and schoolgirls ' ) old <unk> complete with marginalia by the twins , who change sides at half time , and footnotes by the girl ( who doesn 't ) " . Once Shem ( here called Dolph ) has helped Shaun ( here called Kev ) to draw the Euclid diagram , the latter realises that he has drawn a diagram of ALP 's genitalia , and " Kev finally realises the significance of the triangles [ .. and .. ] strikes Dolph . " After this " Dolph forgives Kev " and the children are given " [ e ] <unk> assignments on 52 famous men . " The chapter ends with the children 's " <unk> " to HCE and ALP , in which they are " apparently united in a desire to overcome their parents . " 
 II.3 moves to HCE working in the pub below the studying children . As HCE serves his customers , two narratives are broadcast via the bar 's radio and television sets , namely " The Norwegian Captain and the Tailor 's Daughter " , and " How Buckley Shot the Russian General " . The first portrays HCE as a Norwegian Captain succumbing to domestication through his marriage to the Tailor 's Daughter . The latter , told by Shem and Shaun ciphers Butt and Taff , casts HCE as a Russian General who is shot by the soldier Buckley . Earwicker has been absent throughout the latter tale , having been summoned upstairs by ALP . He returns and is reviled by his customers , who see Buckley 's shooting of the General as symbolic of Shem and Shaun 's supplanting their father . This condemnation of his character forces HCE to deliver a general confession of his crimes , including an incestuous desire for young girls . Finally a policeman arrives to send the drunken customers home , the pub is closed up , and the customers disappear singing into the night as a drunken HCE , clearing up the bar and swallowing the dregs of the glasses left behind , morphs into ancient Irish high king Rory O 'Connor , and passes out . 
 <unk> , ostensibly portraying the drunken and sleeping Earwicker 's dream , chronicles the spying of four old men ( Matthew , Mark , Luke and John ) on Tristan and Iseult 's journey . The short chapter portrays " an old man like King Mark being rejected and abandoned by young lovers who sail off into a future without him " , while the four old men observe Tristan and Isolde , and offer four intertwining commentaries on the lovers and themselves which are " always repeating themselves " . 
 = = = Book III = = = 
 Book III concerns itself almost exclusively with Shaun , in his role as postman , having to deliver ALP 's letter , which was referred to in Book I , but never seen . 
 <unk> opens with the Four Masters ' ass narrating how he thought , as he was " dropping asleep " , he had heard and seen an apparition of Shaun the Post . As a result , Shaun re @-@ awakens , and , floating down the Liffey in a barrel , is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance and content of the letter he is carrying . However , Shaun , " apprehensive about being slighted , is on his guard , and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him . " Shaun 's answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter 's author – his artist brother Shem . After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrator 's earshot , before disappearing completely from view . 
 In <unk> Shaun re @-@ appears as " Jaunty <unk> " and delivers a lengthy and sexually suggestive sermon to his sister Issy , and her twenty @-@ eight schoolmates from St. Brigid 's School . Throughout this book Shaun is continually regressing , changing from an old man to an overgrown baby lying on his back , and eventually , in III.3 , into a vessel through which the voice of HCE speaks again by means of a spiritual medium . This leads to HCE 's defence of his life in the passage " Haveth Childers Everywhere " . Book III ends in the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Porter as they attempt to copulate while their children , Jerry , Kevin and Isobel Porter , are sleeping upstairs and the dawn is rising outside ( <unk> ) . Jerry awakes from a nightmare of a scary father figure , and Mrs. Porter interrupts the coitus to go comfort him with the words " You were <unk> , dear . The <unk> ? The <unk> ? Shoe ! Hear are no <unk> in the room at all , <unk> . No bad bold <unk> , dear one . " She returns to bed , and the rooster crows at the conclusion of their coitus at the Book 's culmination . 
 = = = Book IV = = = 
 Book IV consists of only one chapter , which , like the book 's opening chapter , is mostly composed of a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes . After an opening call for dawn to break , the remainder of the chapter consists of the vignettes " Saint Kevin " , " Berkely and Patrick " and " The Revered Letter " . ALP is given the final word , as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue , in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband , declaring " Rise up , man of the <unk> , you have slept so long ! " , and remembers a walk they once took , and hopes for its re @-@ occurrence . At the close of her monologue , ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean . The book 's last words are a fragment , but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book : 
 A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun , past Eve and Adam 's , from swerve of shore to bend of bay , brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs . 
 = = Critical response and themes = = 
 = = = Difficulties of plot summary = = = 
 Commentators who have summarised the plot of Finnegans Wake include Joseph Campbell , John Gordon , Anthony Burgess , William York Tindall , and Philip Kitcher . While no two summaries interpret the plot in the same way , there are a number of central " plot points " upon which they find general agreement . However , a number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text . As Bernard Benstock highlights , " in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations , any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete . " David Hayman has suggested that " For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake , it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold . " The book 's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes , prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of " boiling down " Finnegans Wake into " insipid pap , and leaving the lazy reader with a <unk> mess of generalizations and catchphrases . " Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses , saying " we have some traditional summaries , also some put in circulation by Joyce himself . I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful , they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know . I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest . " 
 The challenge of compiling a definitive synopsis of Finnegans Wake lies not only in the opacity of the book 's language , but also in the radical approach to plot which Joyce employed . Joyce acknowledged this when he wrote to Eugène Jolas that : 
 " I might easily have written this story in the traditional manner [ ... ] Every novelist knows the recipe [ ... ] It is not very difficult to follow a simple , chronological scheme which the critics will understand [ ... ] But I , after all , am trying to tell the story of this <unk> family in a new way . 
 This " new way " of telling a story in Finnegans Wake takes the form of a discontinuous dream @-@ narrative , with abrupt changes to characters , character names , locations and plot details resulting in the absence of a discernible linear narrative , causing Herring to argue that the plot of Finnegans Wake " is unstable in that there is no one plot from beginning to end , but rather many recognizable stories and plot types with familiar and unfamiliar twists , told from varying perspectives . " Patrick A. McCarthy expands on this idea of a non @-@ linear , digressive narrative with the contention that " throughout much of Finnegans Wake , what appears to be an attempt to tell a story is often diverted , interrupted , or reshaped into something else , for example a commentary on a narrative with conflicting or unverifiable details . " In other words , while crucial plot points – such as HCE 's crime or ALP 's letter – are endlessly discussed , the reader never encounters or experiences them first hand , and as the details are constantly changing , they remain unknown and perhaps unknowable . Suzette Henke has accordingly described Finnegans Wake as an <unk> . Joyce himself tacitly acknowledged this radically different approach to language and plot in a 1926 letter to Harriet Weaver , outlining his intentions for the book : " One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of <unk> language , <unk> grammar and <unk> plot . " Critics have seen a precedent for the book 's plot presentation in Laurence Sterne 's famously digressive The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy , Gentleman , with Thomas Keymer stating that " Tristram Shandy was a natural touchstone for James Joyce as he explained his attempt " to build many planes of narrative with a single esthetic purpose " in Finnegans Wake " . 
 Book II is usually considered the book 's most opaque section , and hence the most difficult to <unk> . William York Tindall said of Book II 's four chapters " Than this [ ... ] nothing is denser . " Similarly , Patrick Parrinder has described Book II as the " worst and most disorienting quagmire [ .. ] in the Wake . " 
 Despite Joyce 's revolutionary techniques , the author repeatedly emphasized that the book was neither random nor meaningless ; with Ellmann quoting the author as having stated : " I can justify every line of my book . " To Sisley Huddleston he stated " critics who were most appreciative of Ulysses are complaining about my new work . They cannot understand it . Therefore they say it is meaningless . Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought , without pains , without erudition ; but I assure you that these 20 pages now before us [ i.e. chapter I.8 ] cost me twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit . " When the editor of Vanity Fair asked Joyce if the sketches in Work in Progress were consecutive and interrelated , Joyce replied " It is all consecutive and interrelated . " 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Fargnoli and Gillespie suggest that the book 's opening chapter " introduces [ the ] major themes and concerns of the book " , and enumerate these as " Finnegan 's fall , the promise of his resurrection , the cyclical structure of time and history ( dissolution and renewal ) , tragic love as embodied in the story of Tristan and Iseult , the motif of the warring brothers , the personification of the landscape and the question of Earwicker 's crime in the park , the precise nature of which is left uncertain throughout the Wake . " Such a view finds general critical consensus , viewing the vignettes as allegorical appropriations of the book 's characters and themes ; for example , Schwartz argues that " The Willingdone Museyroom " episode represents the book 's " archetypal family drama in military @-@ historical terms . " Joyce himself referred to the chapter as a " prelude " , and as an " air photograph of Irish history , a celebration of the dim past of Dublin . " Riquelme finds that " passages near the book 's beginning and its ending echo and complement one another " , and Fargnoli and Gillespie <unk> argue that the book 's cyclical structure echoes the themes inherent within , that " the typologies of human experience that Joyce identifies [ in Finnegans Wake ] are [ .. ] essentially cyclical , that is , patterned and recurrent ; in particular , the experiences of birth , guilt , judgment , sexuality , family , social ritual and death recur throughout the Wake . In a similar enumeration of themes , Tindall argues that " rise and fall and rise again , sleeping and waking , death and resurrection , sin and redemption , conflict and appeasement , and , above all , time itself [ ... ] are the matter of Joyce 's essay on man . " 
 <unk> and <unk> generally summarise the critical consensus when they argue that , between the thematically indicative opening and closing chapters , the book concerns " two big questions " which are never resolved : what is the nature of protagonist HCE ’ s secret sin , and what was the letter , written by his wife ALP , about ? HCE 's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man 's original sin as a result of the Fall of Man . Anthony Burgess sees HCE , through his dream , trying " to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him " and to this end " HCE has , so deep in his sleep , sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man . " Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined , " Earwicker 's alleged crime in the Park " appears to have been of a " voyeuristic , sexual , or scatological nature " . ALP 's letter appears a number of times throughout the book , in a number of different forms , and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated , it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE , and an indictment of his sin . Herring argues that " [ t ] he effect of ALP 's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [ ... ] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter , the more scandal attaches to him . " Patrick A. McCarthy argues that " it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey , representing Anna Livia , are washing away the evidence of Earwicker 's sins as [ the washerwomen speak , in chapter I.8 ] for ( they tell us ) she takes on her husband 's guilt and redeems him ; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice " . 
 = = = A reconstruction of nocturnal life = = = 
 Throughout the book 's seventeen @-@ year gestation , Joyce stated that with Finnegans Wake he was attempting to " reconstruct the nocturnal life " , and that the book was his " experiment in interpreting ' the dark night of the soul ' . " According to Ellmann , Joyce stated to Edmond <unk> that Finnegans Wake would be written " to suit the esthetic of the dream , where the forms prolong and multiply themselves " , and once informed a friend that " he conceived of his book as the dream of old Finn , lying in death beside the river Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world – past and future – flow through his mind like flotsam on the river of life . " While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said : 
 I can 't understand some of my critics , like Pound or Miss Weaver , for instance . They say it 's obscure . They compare it , of course , with Ulysses . But the action of Ulysses was chiefly during the daytime , and the action of my new work takes place chiefly at night . It 's natural things should not be so clear at night , isn 't it now ? 
 Joyce 's claims to be representing the night and dreams have been accepted and questioned with greater and lesser credulity . Supporters of the claim have pointed to Book IV as providing its strongest evidence , as when the narrator asks “ You mean to see we have been <unk> a sound night ’ s sleep ? ” , and later concludes that what has gone before has been “ a long , very long , a dark , very dark [ ... ] scarce endurable [ ... ] night . ” Tindall refers to Book IV as " a chapter of resurrection and waking up " , and McHugh finds that the chapter contains " particular awareness of events going on offstage , connected with the arrival of dawn and the waking process which terminates the sleeping process of [ Finnegans Wake ] . " 
 However , this <unk> of the Wake as a dream is a point of contention for some . Harry Burrell , representative of this view , argues that " one of the most overworked ideas is that Finnegans Wake is about a dream . It is not , and there is no dreamer . " Burrell argues that the theory is an easy way out for " critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search for some kind of understanding of it . " However , the point upon which a number of critics fail to concur with Burrell 's argument is its dismissal of the testimony of the book 's author on the matter as " misleading ... publicity efforts " . Parrinder however , equally skeptical of the concept of the Wake as a dream , argues that Joyce came up with the idea of representing his linguistic experiments as a language of the night around 1927 as a means of battling his many critics , further arguing that " since it cannot be said that neologism is a major feature of the dreaming process , such a justification for the language of Finnegans Wake smacks dangerously of expediency . " 
 While many , if not all , agree that there is at least some sense in which the book can be said to be a " dream " , few agree on who the possible dreamer of such a dream might be . Edmund Wilson 's early analysis of the book , The Dream of H. C. Earwicker , made the assumption that Earwicker himself is the dreamer of the dream , an assumption which continued to carry weight with <unk> scholars Harry Levin , Hugh Kenner , and William Troy . Joseph Campbell , in A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake , also believed Earwicker to be the dreamer , but considered the narrative to be the observances of , and a running commentary by , an anonymous pedant on Earwicker 's dream in progress , who would interrupt the flow with his own digressions . 
 Ruth von Phul was the first to argue that Earwicker was not the dreamer , which triggered a number of similarly @-@ minded views on the matter , although her assertion that Shem was the dreamer has found less support . 
 The assertion that the dream was that of Mr. Porter , whose dream personality personified itself as HCE , came from the critical idea that the dreamer partially wakes during chapter <unk> , in which he and his family are referred to by the name Porter . Anthony Burgess <unk> summarized this conception of the " dream " thus : " Mr. Porter and his family are asleep for the greater part of the book [ ... ] Mr. Porter dreams hard , and we are permitted to share his dream [ ... ] Sleeping , he becomes a remarkable mixture of guilty man , beast , and crawling thing , and he even takes on a new and dreamily appropriate name – Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker . " 
 Harriet Weaver was among the first to suggest that the dream was not that of any one dreamer , but was rather an analysis of the process of dreaming itself . In a letter to J.S. Atherton she wrote : 
 In particular their ascription of the whole thing to a dream of HCE seems to me nonsensical . My view is that Mr. Joyce did not intend the book to be looked upon as the dream of any one character , but that he regarded the dream form with its <unk> and changes and chances as a convenient device , allowing the freest scope to introduce any material he wished — and suited to a night @-@ piece . 
 Bernard Benstock also argued that " The Dreamer in the Wake is more than just a single individual , even if one assumes that on the literal level we are viewing the dream of publican H.C. Earwicker . " 
 Other critics have been more skeptical of the concept of identifying the dreamer of the book 's narrative . Clive Hart argues that " [ w ] hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer , and no matter how many varied caricatures of him we may find projected into the dream , it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book , and should be left there . Speculation about the ' real person ' behind the guises of the dream @-@ surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless , for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream @-@ figures living within the book itself . " 
 John Bishop has been the most vocal supporter of treating Finnegans Wake absolutely , in every sense , as a description of a dream , the dreamer , and of the night itself ; arguing that the book not only represents a dream in an abstract conception , but is fully a literary representation of sleep . On the subject Bishop writes : 
 The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Finnegans Wake [ ... has been ... ] the failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what he said when he spoke of the book as a " reconstruction of the nocturnal life " and an " imitation of the dream @-@ state " ; and as a consequence readers have perhaps too easily exercised on the text an unyielding literalism bent on finding a kind of meaning in every way antithetical to the kind of meaning purveyed in dreams 
 Bishop has also somewhat brought back into fashion the theory that the Wake is about a single sleeper ; arguing that it is not " the ' universal dream ' of some disembodied global everyman , but a reconstruction of the night – and a single night – as experienced by ' one stable somebody ' whose ' <unk> ' on the real world is coherently chronological . " Bishop has laid the path for critics such as Eric Rosenbloom , who has proposed that the book " elaborates the fragmentation and reunification of identity during sleep . The masculine [ ... ] mind of the day has been overtaken by the feminine night mind . [ ... ] The characters live in the transformation and flux of a dream , embodying the sleeper ’ s mind . " 
 = = Characters = = 
 Critics disagree on whether discernible characters exist in Finnegans Wake . For example , Grace <unk> argues that <unk> characters are distinct from each other , and defends this with explaining the dual narrators , the " us " of the first paragraph , as well as Shem @-@ Shaun distinctions while Margot Norris argues that the " [ c ] <unk> are fluid and interchangeable " . Supporting the latter stance , Van Hulle finds that the " characters " in Finnegans Wake are rather " archetypes or character amalgams , taking different shapes " , and Riquelme similarly refers to the book 's cast of mutable characters as " protean " . As early as in 1934 , in response to the recently published excerpt " The <unk> and the <unk> " , Ronald <unk> argued that " the characters in Work in Progress , in keeping with the space @-@ time chaos in which they live , change identity at will . At one time they are persons , at another rivers or stones or trees , at another personifications of an idea , at another they are lost and hidden in the actual texture of the prose , with an ingenuity far surpassing that of crossword puzzles . " Such concealment of character identity has resulted in some disparity as to how critics identify the book 's main protagonists ; for example , while most find consensus that <unk> King , who appears on trial in I.4 , is a HCE type , not all analysts agree on this – for example Anthony Burgess believes him to be Shaun . 
 However , while characters are in a constant state of flux — constantly changing names , occupations , and physical attributes — a recurring set of core characters , or character types ( what Norris dubs " ciphers " ) , are discernible . During the composition of Finnegans Wake , Joyce used signs , or so @-@ called “ sigla ” , rather than names to designate these character amalgams or types . In a letter to his Maecenas , Harriet Shaw Weaver ( March 1924 ) , Joyce made a list of these sigla . For those who argue for the existence of distinguishable characters , the book focuses on the Earwicker family , which consists of father , mother , twin sons and a daughter . 
 = = = Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker ( HCE ) = = = 
 Kitcher argues for the father HCE as the book 's main protagonist , stating that he is " the dominant figure throughout [ ... ] . His guilt , his shortcomings , his failures pervade the entire book " . Bishop states that while the constant flux of HCE 's character and attributes may lead us to consider him as an " <unk> , " he argues that " the sheer density of certain repeated details and concerns allows us to know that he is a particular , real Dubliner . " The common critical consensus of HCE 's fixed character is summarised by Bishop as being " an older Protestant male , of Scandinavian lineage , connected with the <unk> business somewhere in the neighbourhood of <unk> , who has a wife , a daughter , and two sons . " 
 HCE is referred to by literally thousands of names throughout the book ; leading Terence Killeen to argue that in Finnegans Wake " naming is [ .. ] a fluid and provisional process " . HCE is at first referred to as " Harold or Humphrey Chimpden " ; a conflation of these names as " <unk> " , and as a consequence of his initials " Here Comes Everybody " . These initials lend themselves to phrase after phrase throughout the book ; for example , appearing in the book 's opening sentence as " Howth Castle and Environs " . As the work progresses the names by which he may be referred to become increasingly abstract ( such as " Finn MacCool " , " Mr. <unk> Gone " , or " Mr. Porter " ) . 
 Some Wake critics , such as Finn Fordham , argue that HCE 's initials come from the initials of the portly politician Hugh Childers ( 1827 – 96 ) , who had been nicknamed " Here Comes Everybody " for his size . 
 Many critics see Finnegan , whose death , wake and resurrection are the subject of the opening chapter , as either a prototype of HCE , or as another of his manifestations . One of the reasons for this close identification is that Finnegan is called a " man of hod , cement and edifices " and " like Haroun Childeric <unk> " , identifying him with the initials HCE . Parrinder for example states that " <unk> Finnegan [ ... ] is HCE " , and finds that his fall and resurrection foreshadows " the fall of HCE early in Book I [ which is ] paralleled by his resurrection towards the end of III.3 , in the section originally called " Haveth Childers Everywhere " , when [ HCE 's ] ghost speaks forth in the middle of a seance . " 
 = = = Anna Livia Plurabelle ( ALP ) = = = 
 Patrick McCarthy describes HCE 's wife ALP as " the river @-@ woman whose presence is implied in the " riverrun " with which Finnegans Wake opens and whose monologue closes the book . For over six hundred pages , however , Joyce presents Anna Livia to us almost exclusively through other characters , much as in Ulysses we hear what Molly Bloom has to say about herself only in the last chapter . " The most extensive discussion of ALP comes in chapter I.8 , in which hundreds of names of rivers are woven into the tale of ALP 's life , as told by two gossiping washerwomen . Similarly hundreds of city names are woven into " Haveth Childers Everywhere " , the corresponding passage at the end of III.3 which focuses on HCE . As a result , it is generally contended that HCE personifies the Viking @-@ founded city of Dublin , and his wife ALP personifies the river Liffey , on whose banks the city was built . 
 = = = The children : Shem , Shaun and Issy = = = 
 ALP and HCE have a daughter , Issy – whose personality is often split ( represented by her mirror @-@ twin ) . Parrinder argues that " as daughter and sister , she is an object of secret and repressed desire both to her father [ ... ] and to her two brothers . " These twin sons of HCE and ALP consist of a writer called Shem the Penman and a postman by the name of Shaun the Post , who are rivals for replacing their father and for their sister Issy 's affection . Shaun is portrayed as a dull postman , conforming to society 's expectations , while Shem is a bright artist and sinister experimenter , often perceived as Joyce 's alter @-@ ego in the book . Hugh Staples finds that Shaun " wants to be thought of as a man @-@ about @-@ town , a snappy dresser , a glutton and a gourmet ... He is possessed of a musical voice and is a braggart . He is not happy in his work , which is that of a messenger or a postman ; he would rather be a priest . " Shaun 's sudden and somewhat unexpected promotion to the book 's central character in Book III is explained by Tindall with the assertion that " having disposed of old HCE , Shaun is becoming the new HCE . " 
 Like their father , Shem and Shaun are referred to by different names throughout the book , such as " Caddy and <unk> " ; " <unk> " and " <unk> " ; " Dolph and Kevin " ; and " Jerry and Kevin " . These twins are contrasted in the book by allusions to sets of opposing twins and enemies in literature , mythology and history ; such as Set and Horus of the Osiris story ; the biblical pairs Jacob and Esau , Cain and Abel , and Saint Michael and the Devil – equating Shaun with " Mick " and Shem with " Nick " – as well as Romulus and Remus .

 The book is also populated by a number of minor characters , such as the Four Masters , the twelve customers , the <unk> ' cleaning staff Kate and Joe , as well as more obscure characters such as " McGrath " , Lily Kinsella , and the bell @-@ ringer " Fox Goodman " . 
 The most commonly recurring characters outside of the Earwicker family are the four old men known collectively as " Mamalujo " ( a conflation of their names : Matt Gregory , Marcus Lyons , Luke <unk> and Johnny Mac Dougall ) . These four most commonly serve as narrators , but they also play a number of active roles in the text , such as when they serve as the judges in the court case of I.4 , or as the inquisitors who question <unk> in <unk> Tindall summarises the roles that these old men play as those of the Four Masters , the Four Evangelists , and the four Provinces of Ireland ( " Matthew , from the north , is Ulster ; Mark , from the south , is Munster ; Luke , from the east , is Leinster ; and John , from the west , is Connaught " ) . According to Finn Fordham , Joyce related to his daughter @-@ in @-@ law Helen Fleischmann that " Mamalujo " also represented Joyce 's own family , namely his wife Nora ( mama ) , daughter Lucia ( lu ) , and son Giorgio ( jo ) . 
 In addition to the four old men , there are a group of twelve unnamed men who always appear together , and serve as the customers in Earwicker 's pub , <unk> about his sins , jurors at his trial and mourners at his wake . The Earwicker household also includes two cleaning staff : Kate , the maid , and Joe , who is by turns handyman and barman in Earwicker 's pub . These characters are seen by most critics as older versions of ALP and HCE . Kate often plays the role of museum curator , as in the " Willingdone Museyroom " episode of 1 @.@ 1 , and is recognisable by her repeated motif " Tip ! Tip ! " Joe is often also referred to by the name " <unk> " , and Kitcher describes him as " a figure sometimes playing the role of policeman , sometimes [ ... ] a squalid derelict , and most frequently the odd @-@ job man of HCE 's inn , Kate 's male counterpart , who can ambiguously indicate an older version of HCE . " 
 = = Language and style = = 
 Joyce invented a unique polyglot @-@ language or <unk> solely for the purpose of this work . This language is composed of composite words from some sixty to seventy world languages , combined to form puns , or portmanteau words and phrases intended to convey several layers of meaning at once . Senn has labelled Finnegans Wake 's language as " <unk> " , and Tindall as an " Arabesque " . Norris describes it as a language which " like poetry , uses words and images which can mean several , often contradictory , things at once " An early review of the book argued that Joyce was attempting " to employ language as a new medium , breaking down all grammatical usages , all time space values , all ordinary conceptions of context [ ... the theme is the language and the language the theme , and a language where every association of sound and free association is exploited . " <unk> this analysis of the book 's emphasis on form over content , Paul Rosenfeld reviewed Finnegans Wake in 1939 with the suggestion that " the writing is not so much about something as it is that something itself [ .. ] in Finnegans Wake the style , the essential qualities and movement of the words , their rhythmic and melodic sequences , and the emotional color of the page are the main representatives of the author 's thought and feeling . The accepted significations of the words are secondary . " 
 While commentators emphasize how this manner of writing can communicate multiple levels of meaning simultaneously , Hayman and Norris contend that its purpose is as much to obscure and disable meaning as to expand it . Hayman writes that access to the work 's " tenuous narratives " may only be achieved through " the dense weave of a language designed as much to shield as to reveal them . " Norris argues that Joyce 's language is " devious " and that it " conceals and reveals secrets . " Allen B. Ruch has dubbed Joyce 's new language " <unk> , " and describes it as " a language that is basically English , but extremely malleable and all @-@ inclusive , rich with portmanteau words , stylistic parodies , and complex puns . " Although much has been made of the numerous world languages employed in the book 's composite language , most of the more obscure languages appear only seldom in small clusters , and most agree with Ruch that the latent sense of the language , however manifestly obscure , is " basically English " . Burrell also finds that Joyce 's thousands of neologisms are " based on the same etymological principles as standard English . " However , the Wake 's language is not entirely unique in literature ; for example critics have seen its use of portmanteaus and neologisms as an extension of Lewis Carroll 's Jabberwocky . 
 Although Joyce died shortly after the publication of Finnegans Wake , during the work 's composition the author made a number of statements concerning his intentions in writing in such an original manner . In a letter to Max Eastman , for example , Joyce suggested that his decision to employ such a unique and complex language was a direct result from his attempts to represent the night : 
 In writing of the night I really could not , I felt I could not , use words in their ordinary connections . Used that way they do not express how things are in the night , in the different stages – the conscious , then semi @-@ conscious , then unconscious . I found that it could not be done with words in their ordinary relations and connections . When morning comes of course everything will be clear again [ ... ] I 'll give them back their English language . I 'm not destroying it for good . 
 Joyce is also reported as having told Arthur Power that " what is clear and concise can 't deal with reality , for to be real is to be surrounded by mystery . " On the subject of the vast number of puns employed in the work Joyce argued to Frank <unk> that " after all , the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church was built on a pun . It ought to be good enough for me " , and to the objection of triviality he replied " Yes . Some of the means I use are trivial – and some are <unk> . " A great many of the book 's puns are etymological in nature . Sources tell us that Joyce relished delving into the history and the changing meanings of words , his primary source being An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language by the Rev. Walter W. Skeat ( Oxford , at the Clarendon Press ; 1879 ) . For example , one of the very first entries in Skeat is for the letter A , which begins : " ... ( 1 ) <unk> ; ( 2 ) afoot ; ( 3 ) along ; ( 4 ) arise ; ( 5 ) achieve ; ( 6 ) avert ; ( 7 ) amend ; ( 8 ) alas ; ( 9 ) abyss ... " Further in the entry , Skeat writes : " These prefixes are discussed at greater length under the headings Of , On , Along , Arise ... Alas , Aware , Avast ... " It seems likely that these strings of words prompted Joyce to finish the Wake with a sentence fragment that included the words : " ... a way a lone a last a loved a long ... " Samuel Beckett collated words from foreign languages on cards for Joyce to use , and , as Joyce 's eyesight worsened , wrote down the text from his dictation . Beckett described and defended the writing style of Finnegans Wake thus : 
 This writing that you find so obscure is a quintessential extraction of language and painting and gesture , with all the inevitable clarity of the old <unk> . Here is the savage economy of hieroglyphics . 
 Faced with the obstacles to be surmounted in " understanding " Joyce 's text , a handful of critics have suggested readers focus on the rhythm and sound of the language , rather than solely on " meaning . " As early as 1929 , Eugène Jolas stressed the importance of the aural and musical dimensions of the work . In his contribution to Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress , Jolas wrote : 
 Those who have heard Mr. Joyce read aloud from Work in Progress know the immense rhythmic beauty of his technique . It has a musical flow that flatters the ear , that has the organic structure of works of nature , that transmits painstakingly every vowel and consonant formed by his ear . 
 The Canadian critic , historian and novelist Patrick Watson has also argued this point , writing that 
 Those people who say the book is unreadable have not tried reading it aloud . This is the secret . If you even mouth the words silently , suddenly what seemed incomprehensible ( Hubert Butler called it " Joyce 's learned gibberish , " ) leaps into referential meaning , by its sound , since page after page is rich in allusion to familiar phrases , parables , sayings of all kinds – and the joyous and totally brilliant wordplay , over and over again <unk> until you actually listen to it – transforms what was an <unk> agony into an adventure . 
 = = = Allusions to other works = = = 
 Finnegans Wake incorporates a high number of intertextual allusions and references to other texts ; Parrinder refers to it as " a remarkable example of intertextuality " containing a " wealth of literary reference . " Among the most prominent are the Irish ballad " Finnegan 's Wake " from which the book takes its name , Italian philosopher Giovanni Battista Vico 's La Scienza Nuova , the Egyptian Book of the Dead , the plays of Shakespeare , and religious texts such as the Bible and Qur 'an . These allusions , rather than directly quoting or referencing a source , normally enter the text in a contorted fashion , often through humorous plays on words . For example , Hamlet Prince of Denmark becomes " Camelot , prince of <unk> " and the Epistle to the Hebrews becomes a " <unk> <unk> to the <unk> " . 
 The book begins with one such allusion to Vico 's New Science : 
 riverrun , past Eve and Adam 's , from swerve of shore to bend of bay , brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs . 
 " <unk> vicus " refers to Giambattista Vico ( 1668 – 1744 ) , who proposed a theory of cyclical history in his work " La Scienza Nuova " ( The New Science ) . Vico argued that the world was coming to the end of the last of three ages , these being the age of gods , the age of heroes , and the age of humans . These ideas recur throughout Finnegans Wake , informing the book 's four @-@ part structure . Vico 's name appears a number of times throughout the Wake , indicating the work 's debt to his theories , such as “ The Vico road goes round and round to meet where terms begin . ” That a reference to Vico 's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening sentence which is a continuation of the book 's closing sentence – thus making the work cyclical in itself – creates the relevance of such an allusion . 
 One of the sources Joyce drew from is the Ancient Egyptian story of Osiris , and the Egyptian Book of the Dead , a collection of spells and invocations . Bishop asserts that " it is impossible to overlook the vital presence of the Book of the Dead in Finnegans Wake , which refers to ancient Egypt in countless tags and allusions . " At one of their last meetings , Joyce suggested to Frank Budgen that he write an article about Finnegans Wake , entitling it " James Joyce 's Book of the Dead " . Budgen followed Joyce 's advice with his paper " Joyce 's Chapters of Going Forth by Day " , highlighting many of the allusions to Egyptian mythology in the book . 
 The Tristan and Iseult legend – a tragic love triangle between the Irish princess Iseult , the Cornish knight Tristan and his uncle King Mark – is also oft alluded to in the work , particularly in Book II chapter 4 . Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that " various themes and motifs throughout Finnegans Wake , such as the cuckoldry of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker ( a King Mark figure ) and Shaun 's attempts at seducing Issy , relate directly to Tristan and Isolde [ ... ] other motifs relating to Earwicker 's loss of authority , such as the forces usurping his parental status , are also based on Tristan and Isolde . " 
 The book also alludes heavily to Irish mythology , with HCE sometimes corresponding to Fionn mac <unk> , Issy and ALP to <unk> , and Shem / Shaun to Dermot ( Diarmaid ) . Not only Irish mythology , but also notable real @-@ life Irish figures are alluded to throughout the text . For example , HCE is often identified with Charles Stewart Parnell , and Shem 's attack on his father in this way mirrors the attempt of forger Richard Pigott to incriminate Parnell in the Phoenix Park Murders of 1882 by means of false letters . But , given the flexibility of allusion in Finnegans Wake HCE assumes the character of Pigott as well , for just as HCE betrays himself to the cad , Pigott betrayed himself at the inquiry into admitting the forgery by his spelling of the word " hesitancy " as " <unk> " ; and this misspelling appears frequently in the Wake . 
 Finnegans Wake also makes a great number of allusions to religious texts . When HCE is first introduced in chapter I.2 , the narrator relates how " in the beginning " he was a " grand old gardener " , thus equating him with Adam in the Garden of Eden . Spinks further highlights this allusion by highlighting that like HCE 's unspecified crime in the park , Adam also " commits a crime in a garden " . 
 = = = Norwegian influence = = = 
 With Dublin , an early Viking settlement , as the setting for Finnegans Wake , it is perhaps not surprising that Joyce incorporated a number of Norwegian linguistic and cultural elements into the work ( notably Riksmål references for the most part ) . For example , one of the main tales of chapter II.3 concerns a Norwegian tailor , and a number of Norwegian words such as <unk> , Knut <unk> and <unk> Finnegan ( the latter a reference to Ibsen 's <unk> <unk> ) are used throughout . Indeed , most of Ibsen 's works , many of his characters and also some quotations are referenced in the Wake . While Joyce was working on Finnegans Wake , he wanted to insert references to Scandinavian languages and literature , hiring five teachers of Norwegian . The first one turned out to be the poet Olaf Bull . Joyce wanted to read Norwegian works in the original language , including Peter Andreas Munch 's <unk> <unk> og <unk> ( Norse tales of gods and heroes ) . He was looking for puns and unusual associations across the barriers of language , a practice Bull well understood . Lines from Bull 's poems echo through Finnegans Wake , and Bull himself materializes under the name " <unk> the Oxman " , a pun on his surname . 
 = = Literary significance and criticism = = 
 The value of Finnegans Wake as a work of literature has been a point of contention since the time of its appearance , in serial form , in literary reviews of the 1920s . Initial response , to both its serialised and final published forms , was almost universally negative . Even close friends and family were disapproving of Joyce 's seemingly impenetrable text , with Joyce 's brother Stanislaus " <unk> [ ing ] him for writing an incomprehensible night @-@ book " , and former friend Oliver Gogarty believing the book to be a joke , pulled by Joyce on the literary community , referring to it as " the most colossal leg pull in literature since Macpherson 's Ossian " . When Ezra Pound , a former champion of Joyce 's and admirer of Ulysses , was asked his opinion on the text , he wrote " Nothing so far as I make out , nothing short of divine vision or a new cure for the clap can possibly be worth all the <unk> <unk> . " H.G. Wells , in a personal letter to Joyce , argued that " you have turned your back on common men , on their elementary needs and their restricted time and intelligence [ ... ] I ask : who the hell is this Joyce who demands so many waking hours of the few thousands I have still to live for a proper appreciation of his quirks and fancies and flashes of rendering ? " Even Joyce 's patron Harriett Weaver wrote to him in 1927 to inform him of her misgivings regarding his new work , stating " I am made in such a way that I do not care much for the output from your Wholesale Safety Pun Factory nor for the <unk> and <unk> of your deliberately entangled language system . It seems to me you are wasting your genius . " 
 The wider literary community were equally disparaging , with D. H. Lawrence declaring , in reaction to the sections of the Wake being published individually as " Work in Progress " , " My God , what a clumsy olla <unk> James Joyce is ! Nothing but old fags and cabbage @-@ stumps of quotations from the Bible and the rest , stewed in the juice of deliberate journalistic dirty @-@ mindedness – what old and hard @-@ worked staleness , masquerading as the all @-@ new ! " Vladimir Nabokov , who had also admired Ulysses , described Finnegans Wake as " nothing but a formless and dull mass of phony folklore , a cold pudding of a book , a persistent snore in the next room [ ... ] and only the infrequent snatches of heavenly intonations redeem it from utter <unk> . " In response to such criticisms , Transition published essays throughout the late 1920s , defending and explaining Joyce 's work . In 1929 , these essays ( along with a few others written for the occasion ) were collected under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress and published by Shakespeare and Company . This collection featured Samuel Beckett 's first commissioned work , the essay " Dante ... Bruno . Vico .. Joyce " , along with contributions by William Carlos Williams , Stuart Gilbert , Marcel Brion , Eugene Jolas and others . As Margot Norris highlights , the agenda of this first generation of Wake critics and defenders was " to assimilate Joyce 's experimental text to an already increasingly established and institutionalized literary avant @-@ garde " and " to foreground Joyce 's last work as spearhead of a philosophical avant @-@ garde bent on the revolution of language " . 
 Upon its publication in 1939 , Finnegans Wake received a series of mixed , but mostly negative reviews . Louise Bogan , writing for Nation , surmised that while " the book 's great beauties , its wonderful passages of wit , its variety , its mark of genius and immense learning are undeniable [ ... ] , to read the book over a long period of time gives one the impression of watching intemperance become addiction , become debauch " and argued that " Joyce 's delight in reducing man 's learning , passion , and religion to a hash is also disturbing . " Edwin Muir , reviewing in Listener wrote that " as a whole the book is so elusive that there is no judging it ; I cannot tell whether it is winding into deeper and deeper worlds of meaning or lapsing into meaningless " , although he too acknowledged that " there are occasional flashes of a kind of poetry which is difficult to define but is of unquestioned power . " B. Ifor Evans , writing in the Manchester Guardian , similarly argued that , due to its difficulties , the book " does not admit of review " , and argued that , perhaps " in twenty years ' time , with sufficient study and with the aid of the commentary that will doubtless arise , one might be ready for an attempt to appraise it . " Taking a swipe at many of the negative reviews circulating at the time , Evans writes : " The easiest way to deal with the book would be [ ... ] to write off Mr. Joyce 's latest volume as the work of a charlatan . But the author of Dubliners , A Portrait of the Artist and Ulysses is not a charlatan , but an artist of very considerable proportions . I prefer to suspend judgement ... " 
 In the time since Joyce 's death , the book 's admirers have struggled against public perception of the work to make exactly this argument for Finnegans Wake . One of the book 's early champions was Thornton Wilder , who wrote to Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas in August 1939 , a few months after the book 's publication : " One of my absorptions [ ... ] has been James Joyce 's new novel , digging out its buried keys and resolving that unbroken chain of erudite puzzles and finally coming on lots of wit , and lots of beautiful things has been my midnight recuperation . A lot of thanks to him " . The publication in 1944 of the first in @-@ depth study and analysis of Joyce 's final text — A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake by mythologist Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson — tried to prove to a skeptical public that if the hidden key or " <unk> " could be found , then the book could be read as a novel with characters , plot , and an internal coherence . As a result , from the 1940s @-@ 1960s critical emphasis moved away from positioning the Wake as a " revolution of the word " and towards readings that stressed its " internal logical coherence " , as " the avant @-@ gardism of Finnegans Wake was put on hold [ and ] deferred while the text was rerouted through the formalistic requirements of an American criticism inspired by New Critical dicta that demanded a poetic intelligibility , a formal logic , of texts . " Slowly the book 's critical capital began to rise to the point that , in 1957 , Northrop Frye described Finnegans Wake as the “ chief ironic epic of our time ” and Anthony Burgess lauded the book as " a great comic vision , one of the few books of the world that can make us laugh aloud on nearly every page . " 
 In 1962 , Clive Hart wrote the first major book @-@ length study of the work since Campbell 's Skeleton Key , Structure and Motif in " Finnegans Wake " which approached the work from the increasingly influential field of structuralism . However through the 1960s it was to be French post @-@ structuralist theory that was to exert the most influence over readings of Finnegans Wake , <unk> critical attention back to the work 's radical linguistic experiments and their philosophical consequences . Jacques Derrida developed his ideas of literary " deconstruction " largely inspired by Finnegans Wake ( as detailed in the essay " Two Words for Joyce " ) , and as a result literary theory — in particular post @-@ structuralism — has embraced Joyce 's innovation and ambition in Finnegans Wake . Derrida tells an anecdote about the two books ' importance for his own thought ; in a bookstore in Tokyo , 
 an American tourist of the most typical variety leaned over my shoulder and sighed : " So many books ! What is the definitive one ? Is there any ? " It was an extremely small book shop , a news agency . I almost replied , " Yes , there are two of them , Ulysses and Finnegans Wake . 
 The text 's influence on other writers has grown since its initial shunning , and contemporary American author Tom Robbins is among the writers working today to have expressed his admiration for Joyce 's complex last work : 
 the language in it is incredible . There 's so many layers of puns and references to mythology and history . But it 's the most realistic novel ever written . Which is exactly why it 's so unreadable . He wrote that book the way that the human mind works . An intelligent , inquiring mind . And that 's just the way consciousness is . It 's not linear . It 's just one thing piled on another . And all kinds of cross references . And he just takes that to an extreme . There 's never been a book like it and I don 't think there ever will be another book like it . And it 's absolutely a monumental human achievement . But it 's very hard to read . 
 More recently , Finnegans Wake has become an increasingly accepted part of the critical literary canon , although detractors still remain . As an example , John Bishop described the book 's legacy as that of " the single most intentionally crafted literary artifact that our culture has produced [ ... ] and , certainly , one of the great monuments of twentieth @-@ century experimental letters . " The section of the book to have received the most praise throughout its critical history has been " Anna Livia Plurabelle " ( Book I , chapter 8 ) , which Parrinder describes as being " widely recognized as one of the most beautiful prose @-@ poems in English . " In 1994 , in The Western Canon , Harold Bloom wrote of Finnegans Wake : " [ if ] aesthetic merit were ever again to center the canon [ it ] would be as close as our chaos could come to the heights of Shakespeare and Dante , " and in 1998 the Modern Library placed Finnegans Wake seventy @-@ seventh amongst its list of " Top 100 English @-@ language novels of the twentieth century . " 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Throughout the seventeen years that Joyce wrote the book , Finnegans Wake was published in short excerpts in a number of literary magazines , most prominently in the Parisian literary journals Transatlantic Review and Eugene Jolas 's transition . It has been argued that " Finnegans Wake , much more so than Ulysses , was very much directly shaped by the tangled history of its serial publication . " In late October 1923 in Ezra Pound 's Paris flat , Ford Madox Ford convinced Joyce to contribute some of his new sketches to the Transatlantic Review , a new journal that Ford was editing . 
 The eight page " Mamalujo " sketch became the first fragment from the book to be published in its own right , in Transatlantic Review 1 @.@ 4 in April 1924 . The sketch appeared under the title " From Work in Progress " , a term applied to works by Ernest Hemingway and Tristan Tzara published in the same issue , and the one by which Joyce would refer to his final work until its publication as Finnegans Wake in 1939 . The sketch appeared in the final published text , in radically altered form , as chapter 2 @.@ 4 . 
 In 1925 four sketches from the developing work were published . " Here Comes Everybody " was published as " From Work in Progress " in the Contact Collection of Contemporary Writers , edited by Robert McAlmon . " The Letter " was published as " Fragment of an Unpublished Work " in Criterion 3 @.@ 12 ( July 1925 ) , and as " A New Unnamed Work " in Two Worlds 1 @.@ 1 . ( September 1925 ) . The first published draft of " Anna Livia Plurabelle " appeared in Le <unk> d 'Argent 1 in October , and the first published draft of " Shem the Penman " appeared in the Autumn – Winter edition of This Quarter . 
 In 1925 @-@ 6 Two Worlds began to publish redrafted versions of previously published fragments , starting with " Here Comes Everybody " in December 1925 , and then " Anna Livia Plurabelle " ( March 1926 ) , " Shem the Penman " ( June 1926 ) , and " Mamalujo " ( September 1925 ) , all under the title " A New Unnamed Work " . 
 Eugene Jolas befriended Joyce in 1927 , and as a result serially published revised fragments from Book I in his transition literary journal . This began with the debut of the book 's opening chapter , under the title " Opening Pages of a Work in Progress " , in April 1927 . By November chapters I.2 through I.8 had all been published in the journal , in their correct sequence , under the title " Continuation of a Work in Progress " . From 1928 Book 's II and III slowly began to emerge in transition , with a brief excerpt of <unk> ( " The Triangle " ) published in February 1928 , and Book III 's four chapters between March 1928 and November 1929 . 
 At this point , Joyce started publishing individual books of chapters from Work in Progress . In 1929 , Harry and Caresse Crosby , owners of the Black Sun Press , contacted James Joyce through bookstore owner Sylvia Beach and arranged to print three short fables about the novel 's three children Shem , Shaun and Issy that had already appeared in translation . These were " The <unk> and the <unk> " , " The Triangle " , and " The <unk> and the <unk> " . The Black Sun Press named the new book Tales Told of Shem and Shaun for which they paid Joyce US $ 2 @,@ 000 for 600 copies , unusually good pay for Joyce at that time . Their printer Roger <unk> erred when setting the type , leaving the final page with only two lines . Rather than reset the entire book , he suggested to the Crosby 's that they ask Joyce to write an additional eight lines to fill in the remainder of the page . Caresse refused , insisting that a literary master would never alter his work to fix a printer 's error . <unk> appealed directly to Joyce , who promptly wrote the eight lines requested . The first 100 copies of Joyce 's book were printed on Japanese velum and signed by the author . It was hand @-@ set in Caslon type and included an abstract portrait of Joyce by Constantin Brâncuși , a pioneer of modernist abstract sculpture . Brâncuși 's drawings of Joyce became among the most popular images of him . 
 Faber and Faber published book editions of " Anna Livia Plurabelle " ( 1930 ) , and " Haveth Childers Everywhere " ( 1931 ) , HCE 's long defence of his life which would eventually close chapter <unk> A year later they published Two Tales of Shem and Shaun , which dropped " The Triangle " from the previous Black Sun Press edition . Book 2 was published serially in transition between February 1933 and May 1938 , and a final individual book publication , <unk> as She Is <unk> , was published by Corvinus Press in 1937 , made up of sections from what would become chapter <unk> 
 By 1938 virtually all of Finnegans Book was in print in the transition serialisation and in the booklets , with the exception of Book IV . However , Joyce continued to revise all previously published sections until Finnegans Wake 's final published form , resulting in the text existing in a number of different forms , to the point that critics can speak of Finnegans Wake being a different entity to Work in Progress . The book was finally published by Faber and Faber on 4 May 1939 , after seventeen years of composition . 
 In March 2010 , a new " critically emended edition " was published in a limited edition of 1 @,@ 000 copies by <unk> Press in conjunction with Penguin . This edition was published in a trade edition in 2012 . Edited by Danis Rose and John O 'Hanlon , is the " summation of thirty years ’ intense engagement by textual scholars Danis Rose and John O ’ Hanlon verifying , codifying , collating and clarifying the 20 @,@ 000 pages of notes , drafts , typescripts and proofs . " In the publisher 's words the new edition " incorporates some 9 @,@ 000 minor yet crucial corrections and amendments , covering punctuation marks , font choice , spacing , misspellings , misplaced phrases and ruptured syntax . " According to the publisher , " Although individually minor , these changes are nonetheless crucial in that they facilitate a smooth reading of the book ’ s allusive density and essential fabric . " An attempt to identify these " 9 @,@ 000 minor yet crucial corrections and amendments " is under way at the Finnegans Wake Extensible <unk> Treasury ( <unk> ) .

 Despite its linguistic complexity , Finnegans Wake has been translated into other languages : French , German , Chinese , Japanese , Dutch , Korean , Portuguese , Polish , Greek and Turkish . 
 A musical play , The Coach with the Six <unk> by Jean Erdman , based on the character Anna Livia Plurabelle , was performed in New York in 1962 . Parts of the book were adapted for the stage by Mary Manning as Passages from Finnegans Wake , which was in turn used as the basis for a film of the novel by Mary Ellen Bute . Danish visual artists Michael <unk> and Christian <unk> created a multimedia project called " the Wake " , an 8 hour long silent movie based on the book . A version adapted by Barbara Vann with music by Chris <unk> was produced by The Medicine Show Theater in April 2005 and received a favorable review in the 11 April 2005 edition of The New York Times . 
 André <unk> composed a jazz cantata on Anna Plurabelle ( 1966 ) . John Cage 's <unk> : an Irish circus on Finnegans Wake combines a collage of sounds mentioned in Finnegans Wake , with Irish jigs and Cage reading his Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake , one of a series of five writings based on the Wake . The work also sets textual passages from the book as songs , including The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs and <unk> upon Nacht . Phil Minton set passages of the Wake to music , on his 1998 album <unk> of Ecstasy . In recent years Olwen <unk> 's play riverrun , based on the theme of rivers in Finnegans Wake has received critical accolades around the world . Adam Harvey has also adapted Finnegans Wake for the stage , including collaborating with Martin Pearlman and the Boston Baroque .

 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Finnegans Wake is a difficult text , and it has been noted that Joyce did not aim it at the general reader ; however , certain aspects of the work have made an impact on popular culture beyond the awareness of it being difficult . In the academic field , physicist Murray Gell @-@ Mann named a type of subatomic particle as a quark , after the phrase " Three quarks for Muster Mark " on page 383 of Finnegans Wake , as he already had the sound " kwork " . Similarly , the comparative mythology term monomyth , as described by Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces , was taken from a passage in Finnegans Wake . The work of Marshall McLuhan was greatly inspired by James Joyce , especially referencing Finnegans Wake throughout the collage book War and Peace in the Global Village . The novel also was the source of the title of Clay Shirky 's book Here Comes Everybody .

Jones attended Louisiana State University on a scholarship for a year before being transferred to Tulane University in New Orleans as part of a World War II @-@ era U.S. Navy training program . He played football at Tulane for two seasons before joining the Miami Seahawks of the new AAFC in 1946 . 
 The Seahawks traded Jones at the end of the 1946 season to the AAFC 's Brooklyn Dodgers , who subsequently sent him to the Browns before the 1948 season . That year , the Browns won all of their games and the AAFC championship . The team repeated as champions in 1949 , but the AAFC dissolved at the end of the year and the Browns joined the NFL . A tall flanker back who was both a running and receiving threat , Jones was a key part of Browns teams that won NFL championships in 1950 , 1954 and 1955 . He was twice named to the Pro Bowl , the NFL 's all @-@ star game , including in 1951 , when he set his touchdown record . 
 Jones retired after the 1955 season , but returned to the Browns as an assistant coach in 1963 . The Browns won the NFL championship the following year . Jones left football for good in 1968 and went back to Ruston , where he worked with one of his sons in a general contracting business . Jones is a member of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame and the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life and college = = 
 Jones was born in Arcadia , Louisiana , but moved with his mother and three brothers to nearby Ruston , Louisiana after his father died when he was three years old . He played Little League Baseball as a child and went to watch boxing matches and baseball and football games at the nearby Louisiana Tech University . 
 Jones attended Ruston High School starting in 1938 , and played football under head coach L.J. " Hoss " Garrett . He was small in stature and did not make the first team until his senior year in 1941 . Ruston 's Bearcats football team won its first @-@ ever state championship that year , with Jones playing left halfback and tailback . Jones also played baseball and basketball and boxed in high school . 
 After graduating , Jones got a scholarship to attend Louisiana State University ( LSU ) in Baton Rouge , where one of his brothers played football . He stayed there for a year before joining the U.S. Navy as American involvement in World War II intensified . The Navy transferred him to a V @-@ 12 training program at Tulane University in New Orleans , where he played as a halfback and a safety in 1943 and 1944 . 
 Jones carried the football for a total of 700 yards of rushing and scored four touchdowns in 1944 , his junior year , and was named an All @-@ American and an All @-@ Southeastern Conference player by sportswriters . He trained as a fireman aboard submarines while in the Navy , and in 1945 he played football for a military team at the Naval Submarine Base New London in New London , Connecticut . Before beginning his professional career , he played in the 1946 Chicago College All @-@ Star Game , a now @-@ defunct annual contest between the National Football League champion and a squad of the country 's best college players . Led by quarterback and future teammate Otto Graham , the college players beat the Los Angeles Rams 16 – 0 that year . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Jones was selected by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League ( NFL ) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft , but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies . When the Miami Seahawks of the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) offered him a $ 12 @,@ 000 contract , however , he accepted it and joined the team . The Seahawks won just three games in 1946 , the AAFC 's first season of play , and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers , another AAFC team , in December . The Seahawks , meanwhile , folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances . Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers in the last three games of the 1946 season , rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries . 
 The Dodgers traded for Jones in part to replace Glenn Dobbs – a star tailback in Brooklyn 's single @-@ wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries . Jones himself was hurt early in the 1947 season , however , when he was hit by Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns . Injuries to his knee , hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks . He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense for the rest of the season . 
 Paul Brown , the head coach of the Browns , was impressed with Jones 's defensive play for Brooklyn , and traded away the rights to University of Michigan star Bob Chappuis to acquire him in June 1948 . Jones began his career with the Browns as a defensive back , but was switched to halfback early in the 1948 season because his performance on defense wasn 't up to Brown 's standards . Jones played on offense alongside Graham , the team 's quarterback , and star fullback Marion Motley as the Browns won all of their games in 1948 and beat the Buffalo Bills for their third straight AAFC championship . He ended the year with 149 rushing yards on 33 carries . 
 Over the next two seasons , Jones developed into a star flanker , a position he helped invent . He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well @-@ suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns ' two main ends , Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie . Jones often went in motion behind the line of scrimmage before the snap at a time when few players did so , causing confusion and mismatches on defense . He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949 , when the Browns won another AAFC championship . 
 Jones came into his own in the 1950 season , when the Browns joined the NFL following the dissolution of the AAFC . Cleveland won the NFL championship against the Rams that year , helped by Jones 's skill receiving short passes underneath opponents ' coverage . Jones had 31 receptions and 11 rushing and receiving touchdowns in 1950 . 
 Jones continued to excel in 1951 , scoring 12 touchdowns and amassing a career @-@ high 1 @,@ 062 yards from scrimmage . He tied an NFL record in a November 25 game against the Chicago Bears by scoring six touchdowns in a single game , a record he shares with Ernie Nevers ( 1929 ) and Gale Sayers ( 1965 ) . The Browns finished the season with an 11 – 1 win @-@ loss record and advanced to the championship game , but lost this time to the Rams . Jones came in second in the NFL in touchdowns scored and was named to the Pro Bowl , the league 's all @-@ star game . He was also selected by sportswriters as a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro . " Dub has the speed , the guts and the know @-@ how of a great player , " Paul Brown said at the time , calling him " the most underrated player in the league . " 
 Jones made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 , when he had 952 total yards and six touchdowns . Cleveland advanced to the NFL championship for the third time in a row that year , losing 17 – 7 to the Detroit Lions . In 1953 , Jones 's production declined : he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns , and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game . He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason , but Brown asked him to return in 1954 , saying the team needed him . Jones played for two more years , winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good . He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season , an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season . 
 = = Later life and coaching career = = 
 Jones spent seven years working at his business in Ruston after leaving the Browns . He worked briefly as a special instructor for the Houston Oilers and an occasional advisor to college programs in Louisiana , but otherwise was out of football . He returned to the Browns as an assistant coach , however , in March 1963 after Paul Brown was fired by team owner Art Modell . Blanton Collier , Brown 's long @-@ time deputy , became head coach and put Jones in charge of the receivers . Jones and Collier had been close during his playing days , and Collier considered him an astute student of the game . 
 Under Collier , Jones supervised the offensive backfield and the ends , but was also the Browns ' offensive play @-@ caller . He directed the team from the press box on Collier 's behalf because Collier was hard of hearing and could not do so himself . The Browns won their first six games at the beginning of Jones 's coaching career in the 1963 season , although a late slump cost them a spot in the championship game . The team regrouped the following year , ending with a 10 – 3 – 1 win @-@ loss @-@ tie record and winning the NFL 's eastern division . Cleveland went on to win the championship game against the Baltimore Colts in 1964 . The Browns advanced to the championship game again the following year , but lost to the Green Bay Packers . During his tenure as a coach , Jones was the primary position coach for running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly , both of whom are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame . He also coached receiver Paul Warfield , another hall of fame member who helped propel the Browns to the 1964 championship . 
 Jones stayed with the Browns until early 1968 , when he quit and was replaced by Nick Skorich . The Browns had offered him a part @-@ time coaching job but made clear that he could not stay on as offensive coordinator ; Jones declined the reduced role . After leaving the Browns , Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University . He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling 's football team . Later in life , he worked for his son Tom 's general contracting business in Ruston . 
 Jones was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in 1984 . He is the father of former NFL quarterback Bert Jones , who played 10 seasons in the 1970s and 1980s for the Baltimore Colts and Los Angeles Rams and won the NFL 's most valuable player award in 1976 . Jones and his wife , <unk> , have seven children , including four sons who played college football . 
 = Rudolf Wolters = 
 Rudolf Wolters ( August 3 , 1903 – January 7 , 1983 ) was a German architect and government official , known for his longtime association with fellow architect and Third Reich official Albert Speer . A friend and subordinate of Speer , Wolters received the many papers which were smuggled out of Spandau Prison for Speer while he was imprisoned there , and kept them for him until Speer was released in 1966 . After Speer 's release , the friendship slowly collapsed , Wolters objecting strongly to Speer 's blaming of Hitler and other Nazis for the Jewish Holocaust and World War II , and they saw nothing of each other in the decade before Speer 's death in 1981 . 
 Wolters , who was born to a Catholic middle @-@ class family in the northern German town of Coesfeld , obtained his degree and doctorate in architecture from the Technical University of Berlin , forging a close friendship with Speer while a student . After receiving his doctorate , he had difficulty finding employment prior to the Nazi rise to power . From 1933 to 1937 , he worked for the Reichsbahn . In 1937 , Speer hired him as a department head , and Wolters soon took major responsibility for Hitler 's plan for the large scale reconstruction of Berlin . When Speer became Minister of Armaments and War Production in 1942 , Wolters moved to his department , remaining his close associate . 
 After Speer 's indictment and imprisonment for war crimes , Wolters stood by him . In addition to receiving and organizing Speer 's clandestine notes from Spandau , which later served as the basis of his best @-@ selling books of memoirs , Wolters quietly raised money for Speer . These funds were used to support Speer 's family and for other purposes , according to directions which Wolters received from his former superior . Following Speer 's release in 1966 , their friendship gradually deteriorated , until the two men became so embittered that Wolters allowed papers demonstrating Speer 's knowledge of the persecution of the Jews to become public in 1980 . 
 Wolters was involved in the reconstruction of West Germany following World War II , rebuilding his hometown of Coesfeld among many other projects . Wolters wrote several architectural books during the war , as well as a biography of Speer . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wolters was born into a Catholic family in Coesfeld , Germany on August 3 , 1903 , the son of an architect who had married the daughter of a master carpenter in the shipbuilding trade . In his privately published memoirs , Segments of a Life , Wolters described his father as " a serious , conscientious and diligent man , always concerned about the future " . Wolters regarded his mother as " a highly practical woman , full of zest for life , who in hard times thought nothing of serving a delicious roast without letting on it was horsemeat " . Wolters passed a generally happy childhood , punctuated by the chaos of the war years , and by a childhood illness that resulted in his being taught at home for a year by two priests . 
 After passing his Abitur , or secondary school examination , he began his architectural studies at the Technical University of Munich in 1923 . Wolters noted the politicized atmosphere of his student days , stating , " My academic freedom began , one might say , to the sound of drums : the Hitler Putsch and its consequences to us students , most of whom were in agreement with it . " Wolters , by his own admission , was in broad sympathy with Nazi aims , though he never saw a need to join the Party . 
 In 1924 , Wolters met Albert Speer , who was a year behind him . Wolters transferred to the Technical University of Berlin later that year , followed by Speer in 1925 . Wolters sought to study under Professor Hans Poelzig , but there was no room in the course for the transfer student . Instead , Wolters studied under Heinrich Tessenow , as did Speer . Wolters obtained his degree in 1927 , and earned his doctorate at the school two years later . In class prize competition , Wolters generally finished second to Speer . 
 Wolters ' graduation coincided with the start of the Great Depression , and he had great difficulty finding a job , eventually settling for an unpaid position at Reichsbahn headquarters in Berlin in 1930 . Upon losing that position the following year , Wolters accepted a position with the Trans @-@ Siberian Railway 's urban planning division in Novosibirsk . 
 = = Nazi era = = 
 In 1933 , Wolters returned to Berlin , where he briefly worked as an assistant in Speer 's office before returning to the Reichsbahn , this time getting paid for his work . Speer had forged a close relationship with Hitler , and in late 1936 , Speer informed Wolters that the dictator would soon appoint Speer as <unk> ( GBI ) or General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital , and suggested that Wolters resign his post with the railway and come work for him again . Wolters did so , beginning work at the GBI office in January 1937 as a Head of Department in the Planning Bureau . Wolters was one of a number of young , well @-@ paid assistants of Speer at the GBI , who were collectively nicknamed " Speer 's Kindergarten " . Most of the <unk> were not Nazi Party members , since Speer found that Party duties interfered with working time , and the Kindergarten was expected to work long hours . Speer had Hitler 's permission to hire non @-@ Nazis , so the GBI became something of a political sanctuary . 
 Wolters later wrote of his views at this time : 
 I had viewed Hitler and his movement with some skepticism , but when the abolition of the multi @-@ party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment , and the first 1 @,@ 000 kilometers of autobahns opened up a new era of mobility , I too saw the light : this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril , and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage . 
 Much of Wolters ' work at the GBI was connected to Hitler 's plan for the large scale reconstruction of Berlin . The dictator had placed Speer in charge of this plan . The centerpiece of the scheme was a grand boulevard , 4 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) long , dubbed by Speer as the Prachtstrasse ( Street of Magnificence ) or " North – South Axis " , for which the main design responsibility was delegated to Wolters . Wolters was also responsible for transport rings in the new Berlin , for museums , and for the GBI 's press office . In 1939 , Wolters became responsible for the architecture portion of the magazine , Die Kunst im Deutschen Reich ( Art in the German Reich ) . 
 Wolters made several trips abroad in connection with his duties for the GBI . He visited the United States to study advanced transport systems , and Paris for the 1937 international exposition there . In 1939 , Joseph Goebbels appointed him Exhibition Commissioner . Wolters took charge of organizing German architectural exhibits presented in other countries . Until 1943 , Wolters traveled to other European capitals , and in addition to his duties as commissioner , gathered political intelligence . On his return , Wolters passed along his insights to Speer and some of these thoughts reached Hitler 's ears . 
 In 1940 , Wolters , a longtime diarist , suggested to Speer that he begin keeping a Chronik , or chronicle of the GBI 's activities . Speer agreed , and instructed department heads to send Wolters raw material for the Chronik on a regular basis . Among other matters , the Chronik detailed the GBI 's responsibility for administering a 1939 amendment to the Nuremberg Laws which allowed Aryan landlords to evict Jewish tenants with virtually no notice . For example , the entry for August 1941 included this information : " According to a Speer directive a further action for the clearing of some five thousand Jewish flats is being started . " The November entry noted that " roughly 4 @,@ 500 Jews were evacuated " . The dispossessed Jews were sent to the occupied territories , with the newspapers reporting , as directed by Goebbels : " Over the past few days many Jews have hurriedly left Germany , leaving debts behind them . " 
 Wolters was given the additional task in 1941 of setting up a special section of the government publishing house which specialized in works of architecture . Wolters wrote several books on the Third Reich 's architectural works during the war years . He rejected the notion that Nazi architecture was an imitation of classical models : " Those who speak of neo @-@ classicism have not understood the spirit of our buildings . " 
 In February 1942 , following the death of Fritz Todt , Hitler appointed Speer as Minister of Armaments and War Production . Wolters followed Speer to his new ministry , becoming head of the Department of Culture , Media , and Propaganda of the Organization Todt . Wolters continued his Chronik in the new position . 
 In December 1943 , Speer put Wolters in charge of planning for the reconstruction of bombed German cities . Wolters organized a working group of about twenty architects and city planners , mostly from northern Germany . The work of this group , known as the Arbeitsstab <unk> ( Task Force for Reconstruction Planning ) , would form the basis for the actual postwar reconstruction of Germany . Speer , who authorized the group , saw an opportunity to make German cities more habitable in the age of the automobile . The group sought solutions which would use the existing street system , rather than the grand ceremonial boulevards common in Nazi city planning . In addition , the Arbeitsstab issued extensive guidelines , ranging from the width of avenues that carried streetcar lines to the ratio of theatre seats to inhabitants . 
 Wolters rarely met Hitler , and only in the company of other members of Speer 's office . He later recorded , 
 Of course , from these few experiences , I cannot judge Hitler 's personality , but having shared with Speer his virtually daily contacts with him , and being familiar with Hitler 's ideas , for example , on town planning , I think that commentators are making it easy for themselves now when , as they frequently do , they resort in their descriptions to simplistic epitaphs such as " buck private " , " wall painter " , " petit @-@ bourgeois philistine " , or " history 's greatest criminal " . 
 Wolters ' longtime secretary , Marion Riesser , was half @-@ Jewish , and Wolters protected her throughout the war . In late 1944 , word reached them that those with Jewish ancestry who remained free would be called up and used for cannon fodder . Wolters met with Riesser and the three other half @-@ Jews in the Speer organizations , telling them if it became necessary ( which it did not ) , the four would be transferred to essential war factories where they would be safe . Wolters told them , " With Albert Speer 's help one can do anything . " 
 In February 1945 , as the Nazi regime collapsed , Speer instructed Wolters to take other high @-@ ranking officials in his department , including Heinrich Lübke , and set up architectural offices in the north of Germany to work on large @-@ scale prefabricated housing . Speer expected to join them , but not then , as he anticipated that the Allies would want to use his expertise towards the reconstruction of Germany . This did not come to pass ; Speer was arrested and charged with war crimes .

 = = = Architectural work = = = 
 As Speer had instructed , Wolters set up a small office in the North German town of <unk> with Lübke , who knew the town 's mayor . The new office was soon commissioned to rebuild a bridge which had been destroyed , contrary to Speer 's instructions to preserve infrastructure . Later in 1945 , the office was dissolved , and Wolters returned to his hometown of Coesfeld where he had been commissioned to rebuild the ruined city . Lübke instead turned to politics , rising quickly through the political ranks of postwar Germany . In 1959 , Lübke became President of the Federal Republic of Germany , a position in which he served almost ten years before he resigned over questions about what he may have known about forced labor while working in Speer 's department . 
 Wolters was forced to rebuild in Coesfeld almost from scratch . With the widespread destruction , he had to lay out lots and rebuild streets , all without delay . He built a road through the grounds of the local castle , and converted the building into a hotel and conference center . The versatility he showed in the rebuilding of Coesfeld led to other commissions from German cities , including Rheine , <unk> and Anholt . 
 In 1947 and 1949 , Wolters organized meetings of the former Arbeitsstab members , many of whom were intensively involved in the postwar reconstruction efforts . In 1950 , Wolters won a competition to design the new police headquarters in Dortmund The Hotel <unk> in Bonn , rebuilt by Wolters , had previously been the leading hotel in the city . It reopened by hosting the President of Italy in 1956 on his state visit , and again became the leading hotel in the then @-@ capital of the Federal Republic , hosting heads of states ( including U.S. Presidents Kennedy , Nixon , and Reagan ) , state dinners , and events hosted by the Chancellor of Germany . 
 Wolters received so many commissions from the government of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia that he opened an additional office in Düsseldorf . In 1955 , Wolters won a competition to design the Industrie @-@ <unk> building in Düsseldorf . Two years later , he was again successful in that city in a competition to design the <unk> Conzen . Wolters was awarded a prize for his design to reconstruct Düsseldorf 's <unk> ( Old City ) . His son , Fritz Wolters , also an architect , described him as a man who fought uncompromisingly for what he saw as the " whole " in urban planning , and once ended a discussion with a local committee with the remark that they had " rented his head , not his pencil " . Wolters also considered himself to be a " functionalist " , designing a number of concrete , flat roofed , modern hospitals . 
 In the 1960s , Wolters and his son shared an office until their architectural differences separated them , Fritz Wolters being more interested in the small details rather than in what he described as " epoch @-@ making " solutions . However , their personal relationship survived this professional separation . In 1978 , Wolters published a book on the town centre of Berlin , but despite suggestions from his son , he declined to include his views about Nazi architecture , and never did set forth such views to his colleagues .

 Wolters did not attend the Nuremberg trial ( he later described it as a " victor 's court " and as a " show trial " ) but wrote to Speer in January 1946 , during the trial : " I stand by you in misfortune as in the good days . I believe as before in your lucky star . " On August 10 , as the trial approached its conclusion , Speer , anticipating the likelihood of a death sentence , wrote to Wolters asking him to " collect my work together for later ages and to recount much of my life . I think it will be honored one day . " Despite his forebodings , Speer did not receive the death sentence , but on October 1 , 1946 , was given a sentence of twenty years in prison , and on July 18 , 1947 , was transferred to Spandau Prison to serve it . 
 Wolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf , while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau , did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife — the only written communication officially allowed Speer . Beginning in 1948 , Speer had the services of a sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail . In 1949 , Wolters opened a special bank account for Speer , the <unk> or " School Fund Account " , and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer 's activities during the war . At first the funds were used only to support Speer 's family , but as the amounts grew and Speer 's family became increasingly able to support itself , the money was used for everything from vacations for Speer 's Spandau conduit , Toni <unk> , to bribes for those who might be able to secure Speer 's release . Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund , he would often send detailed instructions about what to do with the money . Wolters raised a total of <unk> for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence . 
 In 1951 , with secret means of communications established , Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years . He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs . In January 1953 , Speer began work on his draft memoirs , and over the next year lengthy missives , sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper , made their way to Wolters ' office in Coesfeld . Marion Riesser , who had continued as Wolters ' secretary as he began private architectural practice , transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive , and the draft totalled 1 @,@ 100 pages . Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft , and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published . Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten , that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies . 
 In the mid @-@ 1950s , Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years , adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser . While Speer 's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach , this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters , even then , disagreed with Speer 's opinions . Wolters questioned Speer 's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime 's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for , though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer — but not from Kempf and Riesser . 
 Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son , Fritz , later expressed feelings of neglect . For Speer 's fiftieth birthday in March 1955 , Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer 's friends and wartime associates , and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for Speer 's birthday . Wolters gave Speer 's son Albert a summer job in his Düsseldorf office and a place to stay — in fact , Wolters hosted all six of the Speer children at one time or another . By prior arrangement , he and Speer tried to get in touch with each other by telepathy one New Year 's Eve — but both men fell asleep before midnight struck . 
 Wolters constantly sought Speer 's early release , which required the consent of the four occupying powers . He engaged Düsseldorf attorney , and later state minister , Werner Schütz to lobby high German officials to get them to advocate Speer 's release . Schütz , who refused to ask for his expenses , was unsuccessful even though Lübke , West German President for the last seven years of Speer 's incarceration , had worked under Speer . Wolters had more success fending off denazification proceedings against Speer , collecting many affidavits in Speer 's favor , including one from Tessenow whom Speer had shielded during the war . Those proceedings dragged on for years , and were eventually ended by order of Willy Brandt , a strong supporter of Speer 's . 
 As early as 1956 , Wolters feared the effect that disclosure of the GBI 's eviction of Jewish tenants might have on Speer . Wolters wrote to Kempf concerning the denazification proceedings , " I am only anxious about the matter of the clearance of Jew @-@ flats in Berlin . That could be a bullseye . And this is the point to which the defense should direct itself ... " In 1964 , Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the Chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release . Wolter 's response was to have Riesser <unk> the entire Chronik , leaving out any mention of the GBI 's involvement in the persecution of the Jews , without telling Speer what he was doing . Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes , to leave out extraneous matters , and " above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted . The Ludwigsburg Central office for ' war crimes ' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight . " 
 In April 1965 , with only eighteen months left of Speer 's sentence , Wolters wrote to him of their prospective reunion , " [ I ] t will have been twenty years since I saw you last . What will there be between us old <unk> , aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past [ ? ] ... Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar — that long cured Westphalian ham , and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar : <unk> 1937 ? Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us ? I am so happy that the moment approaches , but my heart is heavy ... " 
 According to Riesser , she thought that Wolters " was frightened of the reality of Speer " . However , Kempf thought Wolters wished Speer ill . Speer was unaware of the depth of Wolters ' feelings , and later told his biographer @-@ to @-@ be Joachim Fest that Wolters was the closest friend he had . Speer added that during the Spandau years , Wolters performed invaluable services for him and that he did not know how he would have survived Spandau without Wolters ' assistance . 
 Throughout the latter part of Speer 's imprisonment , Wolters was a faithful correspondent , writing lengthy letters to Speer at least once a month , attempting to tell Speer everything that might interest him but nothing that might hurt him . When Speer invented the concept of his " world wide walk " , imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in a long walk from Europe through Asia to North America , Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would " see " . Speer later stated , " In a manner of speaking , Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks . " As midnight struck and October 1 , 1966 began , Speer was released from Spandau Prison . His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters , in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty @-@ five kilometres south of Guadalajara , Mexico , which he had " reached " after walking 31 @,@ 936 kilometres . 
 = = = = Deterioration of relationship = = = = 
 After spending two weeks with his family , Speer came to Coesfeld to visit Wolters in October 1966 . Shortly before Speer 's visit , Annemarie Kempf had visited Wolters in Coesfeld to ask him not to allow his differences with Speer to affect their first meeting . Wolters responded that he and Speer were " too far apart " . The visit was quickly marred by Speer 's insistence on inviting industrialist Ernst Wolf Mommsen to Wolters ' home instead of allowing a one @-@ on @-@ one reunion . According to Wolters ' son Fritz , his father was furious and hurt by the perceived slight . While the actual meeting was casual and cordial ( in addition to the long @-@ promised ham and wine , Wolters turned over all of the accumulated papers from Speer , the censored copy of the Chronik and the remaining balance of <unk> in the School Fund Account ) , Wolters later wrote , " I knew that day of that first still merry reunion that the Spandau friendship was over . As he stood there , in person , I saw him suddenly quite differently than I had previously . " 
 Wolters was perturbed by an interview with Speer published in Der Spiegel in November 1966 , in which Speer , while again taking responsibility for crimes of the Nazi era , blamed Hitler , rather than Germany , for starting World War II . Wolters wrote to Speer on November 30 , describing Speer 's assignment of blame as a " dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today 's perspective ... You will surely remember that in 1939 we were all of the opinion that Hitler was Germany . Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about the war in Poland , we surely considered that the responsibility for it was to be found in the provocative conduct by the Poles , and it was the British who made of it a world war . " Wolters asked Speer to " concentrate wholly on what really happened , leaving aside what the world thinks of it now " . 
 Their relationship was further embittered by Speer 's failure to mention Wolters by name in Speer 's first book based on the Spandau material , Inside the Third Reich . Speer 's initial draft of the book , written while in Spandau , does mention his " old university friend , Dr. Rudolf Wolters , to whom was assigned the most essential task , the Prachtstrasse " in connection with the Berlin project . However , Wolters ' name appears nowhere in the published version , and no mention is made of Wolters ' help , essential to the writing and preservation of the draft memoir . Speer later told his future biographer , Gitta Sereny , that he did so to protect Wolters , since it might have been risky for Wolters to have been known to have assisted an imprisoned war criminal . Sereny notes in her biography of Speer that it would not have been in Speer 's interest to have publicized Wolter 's assistance , given the growing disagreement between them over Speer 's statements . Wolter 's son , Fritz , suggested that had Speer mentioned Wolters even once , " it would have made all the difference " , since it would have shown that Speer acknowledged the debt he owed Wolters for his efforts during his incarceration . 
 After the German edition of Inside the Third Reich was published in late 1969 , Speer proposed a visit to the embittered Wolters in Coesfeld . Wolters advised against it , sarcastically suggesting that he was surprised that the author did not " walk through life in a hair shirt , distributing his fortune among the victims of National Socialism , forswear all the vanities and pleasures of life and live on locusts and wild honey " . Nevertheless , Wolters expressed a willingness to meet , proposing ( rather pointedly ) a meeting at Wolters ' house on November 19 , <unk> und <unk> , the day of penance and prayer for German Protestants . Speer duly visited , and as the two sat down to lunch , enquired , " Where are the locusts ? " 
 With research concluded upon Inside the Third Reich , Speer had donated the edited Chronik to the German Federal Archives in Koblenz in July 1969 . David Irving compared the donated Chronik with a copy of the Chronik for 1943 in the Imperial War Museum in London , and discovered discrepancies . Irving asked the Archives and Speer the reason for the differences ( which were minor compared with previous years ) . Speer requested an explanation from Wolters , and Wolters admitted the censorship by letter in January 1970 , saying , " I wouldn 't have put it past the <unk> [ German war crimes prosecutors ] to launch an additional prosecution against you on the pretext that this charge [ of evicting the Jews ] was not included in the Nuremberg Indictment . " Speer suggested that the pages of the Chronik dealing with the Jews should not exist , and informed the Archives that the original of the Chronik , from which the copy given to the Archives had been made , had disappeared . Wolters did not destroy the original as Speer had hinted . 
 Wolters ' anger towards Speer burst into the open in 1971 after Speer did a lengthy interview for Playboy , in which he again took responsibility for Nazi crimes and blamed Hitler and his associates for the war . 
 What is the matter with you that , that even after the unending admissions of guilt in [ Inside the Third Reich ] you cannot stop representing yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was " too little " ? ... there appears to be a vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life . For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes ; I , however , know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes ... [ Y ] our accusations against your former colleagues ( Göring , Goebbels , Bormann , etc . ) who , being dead , cannot defend themselves are agony to me ... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue . 
 Wolters concluded his letter with a suggestion that they avoid seeing each other in future , a suggestion with which Speer concurred . In spite of this , Wolters ' wife Erika remained close friends with Margarete Speer , Albert Speer 's wife . The two men had Christmas presents delivered to each other every year ( Wolters sent Speer a ham , while receiving a pot of honey ) . Speer admitted that because he had had few friends , the estrangement hurt . 
 In 1975 , Wolters attempted a reconciliation , sending Speer a letter for his seventieth birthday in March . Speer responded emotionally , pledging to come visit Wolters at the slightest hint . Speer wrote again two months later , telling Wolters that " despite all inherent contradictions , I am very attached to you " . Nevertheless , the two men never met again . 
 Even in Speer 's second book of memoirs , Spandau : The Secret Diaries , Wolters ' name is not mentioned , and his hometown is changed ; the text refers to him as Speer 's " Coburg friend " . Speer sent Wolters a copy of the book anyway , though Speer stated that he thought it likely that Wolters would let it sit in his bookcase unread . Wolters responded sarcastically in a letter which he signed , " Duke of Coburg , " " I forgive you for not ' localizing ' me in the diaries after your modest restraint in [ Inside the Third Reich ] . The author of the [ Chronik ] , the temporary ' best friend ' , and the indefatigable contact for Spandau remains nonexistent . " 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Wolters bequeathed his papers to the Federal Archives , ensuring the record would be corrected one day . However , in late 1979 , Speer was approached by Matthias Schmidt , a doctoral student , who sought answers to a number of questions for use in preparing his thesis . After answering Schmidt 's questions , Speer referred Schmidt to Wolters for further information . Wolters took a liking to Schmidt , and showed him both the original Chronik and the correspondence in which Wolters had informed Speer of the censoring of the record . When confronted by Schmidt with this information , Speer both denied knowledge of the censorship and stated that the correspondence was not genuine . While Speer pledged not to take legal action against Schmidt for using the disputed papers ( after obtaining his doctorate , Schmidt published his thesis as a book , Albert Speer : The End of a Myth ) , he made no such promise regarding Wolters . Speer published a formal revocation of a power of attorney he had given Wolters while in Spandau and disputed on legal grounds Wolters ' right to the Chronik and other papers . The dispute was only ended by Speer 's sudden death in London in September 1981 . 
 Wolters died in January 1983 after a long illness . According to his son Fritz , his final word was " Albert " . He had donated many of his papers to the Archives in 1982 ; after Wolters died , Riesser , as his literary executor , donated the remainder .

 = Jack Crossland = 
 John " Jack " Crossland ( 2 April 1852 – 26 September 1903 ) was an English professional cricketer who played for Lancashire between 1878 and 1887 . A right @-@ arm fast bowler , Crossland was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in county cricket . However , he was also widely criticised for throwing , rather than bowling the ball . Were it not for this , he would have probably played for England against Australia in 1882 or 1884 . 
 Crossland was born in Nottinghamshire , but qualified to play for Lancashire due to residency . He made his first @-@ class debut for his adopted county in 1878 , but his bowling was most effective from 1881 until 1884 . His best year was 1882 , when he topped the national bowling averages , claiming 112 wickets at an average of just over ten . The presence of Crossland , and a number of other bowlers with suspect actions , in the Lancashire team resulted in some counties refusing to play fixtures against during the mid @-@ 1880s . During 1885 , a ruling from the Marylebone Cricket Club barred Crossland from playing for Lancashire as his qualification for the county had been breached by him living in Nottinghamshire during the winter . The ruling forced his retirement from county cricket , though he continued to appear in other matches for a few years following that . 
 In all , Crossland claimed 322 wickets in first @-@ class cricket at an average of 12 @.@ 48 . He claimed ten wickets in a match on six occasions . Primarily a tail @-@ end batsman , he scored 1 @,@ 172 runs with a top score of 51 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Crossland was born in Sutton @-@ in @-@ Ashfield in Nottinghamshire on 2 April 1852 . Employed as a coal miner , he was one of a number of Nottinghamshire @-@ born cricketers who sought professional contracts in Lancashire . The Lancashire cricket leagues began paying the best players to appear for them , creating an exodus of cricketing talent to the county . Crossland first gained employment as a professional cricketer in 1876 , with Enfield Cricket Club . In a single innings match against Burnley that season , he took eight wickets and conceded 88 runs ( eight for 88 ) . The following season he once again took eight wickets against the same opposition , finishing with figures of eight for 50 . Towards the end of 1877 , he was chosen to play for a " Gentlemen and Players XI " against Burnley in a benefit match for Burnley 's professional John Melling . He took five for 10 in the match from his five overs to help his side win on first innings . In early 1878 , Crossland improved upon his previous efforts , taking eight for 28 against Burnley . 
 = = Lancashire professional = = 
 Crossland 's performances for Enfield drew the attention of Lancashire County Cricket Club , for whom he was qualified on the basis of residency . He made his debut against Yorkshire in August 1878 . He was not required to bowl in the first innings , and after scoring one run , bowled eight overs without a wicket in the second innings . He took his maiden wicket in first @-@ class cricket in his second match , against Kent . In another benefit match played for Melling , Crossland took eight for 60 for " Burnley District XI " against Burnley in September 1878 . His first match for Lancashire in 1879 came in June , when he claimed four for 26 against Derbyshire ; his best bowling that season . He claimed wickets consistently through the season , and finished with fifteen wickets from his seven matches at an average of 14 @.@ 53 . He only played three times for Lancashire in 1880 , taking seven wickets at 16 @.@ 28 . He bowled with little effect in most of 1881 , but took ten wickets in a match against Surrey at the Oval . Across his other six matches that year , he only claimed three further wickets , and completed the season with thirteen wickets at an average of 7 @.@ 15 . 
 The 1882 season was Crossland 's best ; though he started with a wicket @-@ less match against the Marylebone Cricket Club . He took seven wickets against the touring Australians in early June , while in the following match , against Somerset , he took six for 7 in the second innings , to help Lancashire to an innings victory . He took five wickets in an innings on ten occasions during the season , including twice in a match against Middlesex , to claim ten wickets in the match . Playing a match for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians , he took his best bowling figures in an innings that season , claiming seven wickets for 72 . He took a pair of five @-@ wicket hauls against Surrey in late August to finish with eleven wickets in the match . His final match of the season was a further fixture against the Australians , in which he took eight wickets in the match for the North . In all , Crossland took 112 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 10 @.@ 06 in 1882 , topping the national bowling averages . Lancashire were recognised by some publications as being champion county , or more commonly as joint champions with Nottinghamshire in 1882 , and in addition to Crossland , Lancashire 's George Nash , Dick Barlow and Alexander Watson took fifty or more wickets at an average of under thirteen . In his obituary in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , it was suggested that were it not for the accusations of throwing against Crossland , he would have been selected for the sole Test match against the touring Australians at the Oval . 
 = = Throwing controversies = = 
 An article written for The Argus , an Australian daily newspaper , by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled ; " with a delivery so like a throw that I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia ; but , as we all know , throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more 's the pity . " Crossland 's delivery was the cause for much discussion throughout his most successful year of 1882 , but despite a commonly held view that he threw the ball , umpires never called a no ball against him for throwing . In 1883 , Middlesex refused to arrange matches with Lancashire due to the perceived unfair bowling of Crossland and some of his teammates . He continued to bowl effectively during 1883 , and peaked towards the end of the season , claiming seven wickets in an innings against " The Rest " while playing for a combined Lancashire and Yorkshire side , another seven in an innings for Lancashire against Surrey , and the best bowling figures of his career , eight for 57 for the North against the South . During the match against Surrey , which was held at the Oval , Crossland was heckled by the crowd , with cries of " well thrown " , and " take him off " , shouted during his bowling spell . The vehemence of the protests almost drew the Lancashire captain , A. N. Hornby to refuse to complete the match . In an end of season match for Dick Barlow 's XI against Tom Emmett 's XI ; he scored his highest first @-@ class score with the bat , reaching 51 runs in the second innings . He took 72 wickets in 1883 at an average of 12 @.@ 97 , placing him third in the national bowling averages . Lancashire 's policy of recruiting professional bowlers without much regard for their qualification to play for the county caused some bad @-@ feeling with other counties , most notably Crossland 's native Nottinghamshire . The bickering between the counties escalated and in 1883 , after receiving a provocative Christmas card from Lancashire , the Nottinghamshire committee sent an aggressive response : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> . The only rules necessary for players in the County Eleven are that they shall neither have been born in , nor reside in , Lancashire . Sutton @-@ in @-@ Ashfield men will have the preference . 
 At the end of the 1883 season , a meeting of the county secretaries at Lord 's was held , during which a proposal was made " that the undermentioned counties agree among themselves not to employ any bowler whose action is at all doubtful . " The proposal was essentially a gentlemen 's agreement to try and prevent unfair bowling , necessitated by the umpires ' refusal to intervene . The resolution was signed by representatives from Derbyshire , Kent , Middlesex , Nottinghamshire , Surrey and Yorkshire , but those from Gloucestershire and Sussex refused to sign it , along with the representative from Lancashire . As a result , Middlesex were joined by Nottinghamshire in boycotting Lancashire in 1884 . Crossland was strong again , and claimed ten wickets in a match on three occasions ; first against Oxford University in late May – early June . In his next match , for the North against the South , he claimed seven wickets in each innings to record match figures of 14 for 80 . The crowd at Lord 's followed the example set at the Oval in the previous year , heckling Crossland throughout the match . He collected seven wickets in an innings again , in a match not classified as first @-@ class against Leicestershire , and completed the ten @-@ wicket haul with four wickets in the second innings . He faced the touring Australians twice during June , taking two wickets for the North , before collecting eleven wickets for Liverpool and District . The report in The Argus once again vilified Crossland , writing that " owing principally to the successful throwing of Crossland " the Australian first innings closed for 140 . 
 Crossland was considered for selection in the first Test against Australia , which was played at Lancashire 's Old Trafford ground . An official from the home ground chose the England team for each match . Lord Harris announced that he would not participate in the Test at Old Trafford if Crossland was selected . As a result , Lord Harris was not chosen by the Lancashire official , although in the end Crossland did not play either . Lord Harris , who was both the captain of Kent and England in 1884 , led the protests against throwing . He forced the retirement of two of Kent 's bowlers , but was reasonably satisfied with Lancashire in 1884 : for their match against Kent at Old Trafford , they dropped Nash , and by the meeting of the two sides in August that year , neither Crossland nor Nash were in the side . Lord Harris had hoped that this indicated that Lancashire were making efforts to " of [ their ] own free will , and without agreement with other counties , to place [ their ] eleven in an irreproachable position . " 
 = = Termination of county cricket career = = 
 In 1885 Lancashire once again were unable to face either Middlesex or Nottinghamshire as the two sides maintained their boycott . Crossland was chosen to appear for Charles Thornton 's England XI against Cambridge University , in which he took seven wickets for 117 . In late May , he took four for 52 and three for 51 against Kent at Old Trafford . After the match , Lord Harris , unhappy with the return of Crossland and Nash to the Lancashire side , requested that the Kent committee cancel the home fixture against Lancashire . The committee agreed with his argument , and Kent became the third first @-@ class county to refuse to play against Lancashire . Crossland only played six matches for Lancashire in 1885 before the Marylebone Cricket Club ruled that he had breached his residency qualification by returning to live in Nottinghamshire during the winter period . Due to this , he was not allowed to play for Lancashire , effectively ending his first @-@ class career . Nash retired from county cricket at the end of 1885 due to criticisms about his own action , and fixtures between Lancashire and Middlesex , Nottinghamshire and Kent resumed in 1886 . He played two further first @-@ class matches , in 1886 and 1887 , both for CI Thornton 's XI against Cambridge University . 
 At his peak in 1882 , Crossland was considered one of the fastest bowlers in England , and his yorker were described as W. G. Grace as being " exceedingly difficult to play . " In his Wisden obituary , it was reported that " the majority of experts having no hesitation in describing him as a rank thrower . " Grace was scarcely kinder , noting that he was " inclined to think that he ought to have been no @-@ balled in every over . " Although the widespread opinion against his action , the umpires , themselves professional , were reluctant to no ball him . In all first @-@ class matches , Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10 @.@ 95 . He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions , and five wickets in an innings 25 times . He scored 1 @,@ 172 runs with a high score of 51 . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 Crossland remained in Lancashire after his expulsion from their county side , playing for a variety of club sides ; East Lancashire from 1885 to 1889 , Church and Oswaldtwistle in 1890 and Colne in 1891 . He died on 26 September 1903 in Blackburn . His burial was paid for by Lancashire County Cricket Club . Throwing in cricket came to a head in the early part of the twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close , most notably those of Lancashire 's Arthur Mold , Somerset 's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire 's Frederic Geeson . 
 = M @-@ 553 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 553 is a north – south state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . It connects M @-@ 35 near Gwinn with the Marquette Bypass , an expressway carrying US Highway 41 ( US 41 ) and M @-@ 28 in Marquette . M @-@ 553 connects Marquette with Sawyer International Airport at the unincorporated community of K.I. Sawyer AFB , the former site of a US Air Force base , in the Sands Plains area of Marquette County . The intersection with CR 480 in Sands Township , known locally as the Crossroads , is the site of several businesses . North of this location , M @-@ 553 runs through some hilly terrain around a local ski hill . 
 The trunkline was originally County Road 553 ( CR 553 ) in Marquette County . CR 553 dates back to the 1930s , was fully paved in the 1940s , and a segment of the roadway was relocated in the 1950s . During the early 1990s , the City of Marquette extended one of their streets , McClellan Avenue , southward to connect to CR 553 . The county road was transferred from the Marquette County Road Commission ( MCRC ) to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) on October 1 , 1998 . MDOT assigned most of the former county road the M @-@ 553 designation after the transfer was complete . One section that was less than a mile ( about 1 @.@ 4 km ) was given the M @-@ 554 designation . This related trunkline was unsigned by the state with only city street signs to indicate its existence . In 2005 , control of various roadways was exchanged between the City of Marquette and MDOT , and M @-@ 553 was extended through the city . At the same time , M @-@ 554 was turned over to the city 's jurisdiction . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 553 begins as a two @-@ lane rural highway east of Gwinn at an intersection with M @-@ 35 in the community of New Swanzy . From there it runs north through some commercial properties into the Sands Plains , a sandy area sparsely covered with Jack Pines . The highway runs through an intersection with M @-@ 94 near the west gate of the former K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base . In this area , the trunkline is parallel to a line of the Canadian National Railway which connects mines of the Marquette Iron Range to Escanaba . M @-@ 553 crosses over the rail line west of the runway at the Sawyer International Airport located at the former Air Force base . On the north side of the airport , M @-@ 553 intersects Kelly Johnson Memorial Drive , the airport access road named for Clarence " Kelly " Johnson , who was a noted aviation engineer at Lockheed who helped design the SR @-@ 71 " Blackbird " reconnaissance aircraft . The trunkline continues farther through woodlands and turns to the northwest . M @-@ 553 passes the Marquette County Fairgrounds and reaches CR 480 at the Crossroads area just north of the Sands Plains and the Blueberry Ridge ski trail ; the area around the intersection has several businesses . 
 North of the intersection , M @-@ 553 passes some residential subdivisions in the northern end of Sands Township . As the highway continues northward , the landscape transitions into hilly , wooded terrain . The trunkline descends through a series of curves , first to the northwest and then a steep downhill curve , known locally as Glass ' <unk> , northeasterly alongside the Marquette Mountain ski area . The highway enters the city of Marquette and runs past the front of the ski resort 's chalet before crossing the Carp River . North of the river , the roadway ascends part of the west side of Mount <unk> before leveling off near the intersection with Division Street . Past that intersection , M @-@ 553 follows McClellan Avenue as a four @-@ lane boulevard divided by a center turn lane through a residential area on the south side of the city . The trunkline passes between the Superior Hills Elementary School to the east and the Marquette Golf and Country Club to the west . There is a pedestrian bridge over the roadway adjacent to the school , and north of the overpass the center turn lane ends . With few exceptions , the adjacent properties in this area do not have direct access to the highway . M @-@ 553 descends one last hill and terminates at a Michigan left intersection with the US 41 / M @-@ 28 expressway ; McClellan Avenue continues north of the terminus through a business district to a residential area . 
 Like other state trunkline highways , M @-@ 553 is maintained by MDOT . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that , on average , 3 @,@ 615 vehicles between the M @-@ 35 and M @-@ 94 junctions , and 10 @,@ 021 vehicles north of Division Street , used the highway daily . No section of M @-@ 553 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 = = = County road era = = = 
 The first roadway along the route of the modern M @-@ 553 was a county road ; it was first shown on maps by 1936 . At the time , the northern half of this county road was " improved " , meaning it was gravel or stone , while the southern half was an earthen road . The southern end started in downtown Gwinn at the time . The northern half was paved during World War II ; a new road was paved immediately east of Gwinn , shifting the road out of town . The remainder of CR 553 was paved by the middle of 1946 . At the time , CR 553 ran north from New Swanzy along what is now Marshall Drive to the county airport ; the roadway continued north of the airport along the present course except through the Sands area , where it ran to the east , and ended at a terminus on the south side of Marquette at Pioneer Road and Division Street . In 1953 , the county road commission relocated CR 553 near the county airport to eliminate a rail crossing and a pair of tight turns .
