 Currently , entanglement in fishing nets and collisions with ships represent the greatest threats to the sperm whale population . Other threats include ingestion of marine debris , ocean noise , and chemical pollution . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) regards the sperm whale as being " Vulnerable " . The species is listed as endangered on the United States Endangered Species Act . 
 Sperm whales are listed on Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) . It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals , conserving or restoring the places where they live , mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them . It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co @-@ operation organised by tailored agreements . It is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea , Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ( ACCOBAMS ) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region ( Pacific Cetaceans MOU ) . 
 = = = Cultural importance = = = 
 Rope @-@ mounted teeth are important cultural objects throughout the Pacific . In New Zealand , the Māori know them as " rei <unk> " ; such whale tooth pendants were rare objects because sperm whales were not actively hunted in traditional Māori society . Whale ivory and bone were taken from beached whales . In Fiji the teeth are known as <unk> , traditionally given as gifts for atonement or esteem ( called <unk> ) , and were important in negotiations between rival chiefs . Friedrich <unk> in The History of Mankind reported in 1896 that , in Fiji , whales ' or <unk> ' teeth were the most @-@ demanded article of ornament or value . They occurred often in necklaces . Today the <unk> remains an important item in Fijian life . The teeth were originally rare in Fiji and Tonga , which exported teeth , but with the Europeans ' arrival , teeth flooded the market and this " currency " collapsed . The oversupply led in turn to the development of the European art of scrimshaw . 
 Herman Melville 's novel Moby @-@ Dick is based on a true story about a sperm whale that attacked and sank the whaleship Essex . Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible 's Leviathan . The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales ' ability to fiercely defend themselves from attacks by early whalers , occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships . 
 The sperm whale was designated as the Connecticut state animal by the CT General Assembly in 1975 . It was selected because of its specific contribution to the state 's history and because of its present @-@ day plight as an endangered species . 
 = = = Watching sperm whales = = = 
 Sperm whales are not the easiest of whales to watch , due to their long dive times and ability to travel long distances underwater . However , due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale , watching is increasingly popular . Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones to listen to the clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface . Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand 's South Island , <unk> and Tromsø in Arctic Norway ; as well as the Azores , where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore , and Dominica where a long @-@ term scientific research program , The Dominica Sperm Whale Project , has been in operation since 2005 .

 = Merced River = 
 The Merced River ( pronounced <unk> ) , in the central part of the U.S. state of California , is a 145 @-@ mile ( 233 km ) -long tributary of the San Joaquin River flowing from the Sierra Nevada into the San Joaquin Valley . It is most well known for its swift and steep course through the southern part of Yosemite National Park , and the world @-@ famous Yosemite Valley . The river 's character changes dramatically once it reaches the foothills and the lowlands , becoming a slow @-@ moving waterway meandering through irrigated fields . 
 When tectonic activity first led to the uplift of the Sierra , the river formed as a steep stream eroding into the range 's western flank , carrying sediments that would later help form the floor of the Central Valley . A rich riparian zone around the Merced once supported millions of migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway , and the river had one of the southernmost runs of salmon in North America . Indigenous people , including the Miwok and Paiute tribes , lived along the river for thousands of years , thriving on the bountiful flora and fauna supported by the river and its diverse lower course , aided by fertile soils eroded from the mountains . 
 Military expeditions during the Mexican Era history of California passed through the Merced River region in the early 19th century . The California Gold Rush brought many people into California and some settled leading to the establishment of a railroad along the river , bringing minerals and lumber to towns that had been established on the lower Merced , and later provided tourism to the now @-@ national park area . Conflicts between whites and indigenous peoples prompted wars , resulting in the expulsion of the Ahwahnechee from Yosemite Valley . In the 20th century , the river saw further development that would change its state forever . 
 Large @-@ scale irrigated agriculture was introduced to the Central Valley in the late 19th century , and led to the construction of numerous state , federal and privately owned dams . Water demand has often been higher than the river 's environment can sustain . Salmon have been blocked from migrating and riverside habitat has declined dramatically . Recent years have seen habitat conservation work , mimicking of historic streamflow patterns , and the establishment of a salmon hatchery , in the hopes that the river 's health can be protected from further damage . 
 = = Course = = 
 The headwaters of the Merced River are at 8 @,@ 017 feet ( 2 @,@ 444 m ) at the foot of the Clark Range , a subrange of the Sierra Nevada , rising at the confluence of the Triple Peak Fork and Merced Peak Fork after they cascade down glacially polished slopes from the high country in the southeastern corner of Yosemite National Park. the Merced River flows for 145 miles ( 233 km ) westward through a series of canyons , gorges and finally the flat plains of the Central Valley . From its headwaters , the river flows north for a short distance and collects the Lyell Peak Fork . The course of the Merced then turns to the north west and flows through a steep walled canyon for 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) where the river receives the Red Peak Fork and then collects into Washburn Lake at 7 @,@ 612 feet ( 2 @,@ 320 m ) elevation . The Merced continues to the northwest for 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) where collects into Merced Lake . Leaving Merced Lake , the river continues to the west northwest for 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) where the canyons open up into Echo Valley . The river then turns generally westward for another 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , where it snakes through a spectacular narrow gorge between massive , glacially resistant granite cliffs . The gorge opens up after Bunnell Point and Sugarloaf Dome confine the river to form Bunnell Cascade , before turning southward through the Lost Valley of the Merced , and then spills over an unnamed granite cascade into Little Yosemite Valley , a glacial valley that sits 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) feet above the more famous Yosemite Valley at approximately 2 / 3 scale . The Merced River then drops over Nevada Falls and Vernal Falls , receives Illilouette Creek , and passes into the main Yosemite Valley , where it meanders between pine forests that fill the valley floor . 
 Tenaya , Yosemite , Bridalveil and Pigeon Creeks join the Merced before it breaches the glacial moraine at the valley 's end . From there the river picks up Cascade Creek and turns south near El Portal , flowing through Merced River Canyon . State Route 140 follows the river out of the west entrance to the national park , a few miles before the South Fork Merced River , the largest tributary , joins from the left . The river arcs northwest to receive the North Fork , and a few miles after it enters Lake McClure , formed by New Exchequer Dam . Below New Exchequer , the river flows west through a heavily irrigated region of the Central Valley , passing through McSwain and Crocker @-@ Huffman Dams and the cities of <unk> , Delhi and Livingston . It joins the San Joaquin River at Hills Ferry , a few miles south of Turlock . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The drainage basin of the Merced River is located in the central Sierra Nevada , spreading across 1 @,@ 726 square miles ( 4 @,@ 470 km2 ) . It can be characterized as the slightly smaller southern companion of the Tuolumne River , the major Sierran river just north of the Merced . On the south , the basin borders on the headwaters of the San Joaquin River itself . The Merced River watershed includes the subwatersheds of Illilouette , Echo , Tenaya , Yosemite , Bridalveil , Cascade , and Dry Creeks , as well as the South and North forks of the river , of which the South Fork , at 43 miles ( 69 km ) long , is the largest . Tributaries to the South Fork include Bishop , Rail , Alder and <unk> Creeks . There are also many lakes in the watershed of the Merced River , including Merced Lake , Tenaya Lake , the Chain Lakes , May Lake , Lake McClure , and Lake McSwain . 
 Much of the basin of the Merced River is characterized by an alpine climate . The upper basin of the river receives heavy snowfall in the winter , which is usually enough to feed the river and its tributaries year round . However , most of the snowpack melts by the late autumn , reducing flows in the main stem and its tributaries significantly , and causing some smaller tributaries to dry up altogether . <unk> constitutes a majority of the river 's springtime and early summer flow , and provides up to 85 % of the flow above Happy Isles . The dry season depends more on groundwater to supply the river 's flow . The middle and lower basin are dominated by an arid , Mediterranean or even semi @-@ desert climate . 
 The Merced River is the third largest tributary of the San Joaquin River . Before irrigation started in the Central Valley and dams were constructed , the river 's natural flow at the mouth was much higher than the current average of 661 cubic feet per second ( 18 @.@ 7 m3 / s ) , or about 479 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 591 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) per year . Upstream on the river , at Happy Isles , the average flow is 355 cubic feet per second ( 10 @.@ 1 m3 / s ) . The United States Geological Survey has river gauges at three locations along the Merced River : at Happy Isles , above Lake McClure , and at the mouth . The first two record flows unaffected by dams and human intervention , but discharge at the mouth is chiefly controlled by New Exchequer Dam . The Lake McClure gauge , located at the former mining town of Bagby , is probably the most accurate gauge for flows overall . The average annual flow recorded there was 1 @,@ 185 cubic feet per second ( 33 @.@ 6 m3 / s ) from 1923 to 1966 . A peak of 92 @,@ 500 cubic feet per second ( 2 @,@ 620 m3 / s ) was reported there on December 23 , 1955 . For the mouth gauge , the highest flow was only 13 @,@ 600 cubic feet per second ( 390 m3 / s ) in 1950 . Finally , for the gauge at Happy Isles , the largest flow ever recorded was 10 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 290 m3 / s ) in the 1997 Yosemite floods , which destroyed many campgrounds , roads , paths , and bridges in the valley . 
 The Merced River 's primary human use is irrigation . The Merced Irrigation District ( MID ) operates most of the irrigation infrastructure , which supplies water to 154 @,@ 394 acres ( 624 @.@ 81 km2 ) of farmland . As a whole , the system includes about 4 @,@ 000 sets of control gates and 793 miles ( 1 @,@ 276 km ) of canals . Irrigation has taken most of the water out of the lower river , which now rarely reaches the sea . Water that does return to the river does so in for form of irrigation return flows , which carry pesticides , fertilizer and other pollutants . The MID is federally required to allow at least 15 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 19 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water annually to flow continually down the river , not including flooding . The water has allowed the San Joaquin River below the Merced River confluence to contain water , while above the confluence all of its water is usually diverted for irrigation . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 According to a study in 2006 , there were 37 species of fish , 127 bird species , and 140 insect and invertebrate species found in the Merced River watershed . Most of these species are divided between the upper and lower watershed , which is usually defined by Lake McClure , formed by New Exchequer Dam . 
 Of the fish , there were 26 species found in the lower Central Valley portion of the river , including Sacramento sucker , smallmouth bass , largemouth bass and carp , all but three of which are resident species , and some of which were intentionally introduced by humans . The three anadromous fish species that still use the lower Merced are the chinook salmon , Pacific lamprey and striped bass . The upper section of the river , defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters , had 11 species of fish . Historically , the range of anadromous fish extended to the head of Yosemite Valley , but by the 1950s and 1960s , except in the wettest years , not enough water flowed down the Merced and San Joaquin Rivers at all to allow them to spawn in significant numbers . New water use requirements have allowed many anadromous species to revitalize , from a low of 500 chinook salmon in the mid @-@ 20th century to a high of 30 @,@ 000 fish in 1984 . After the 1970s , the annual run was about 5 @,@ 300 fish . 
 Of the one hundred and twenty @-@ seven bird species found along the Merced River , only 35 occur along the entire length of the river . Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year , while 109 species of birds are found only in the breeding season . However , despite the more extensive modifications to the lower part of the river , there are more species of birds found in the lower watershed , due to the slow @-@ flowing nature of the river that forms marshes and riparian zones . Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby @-@ crowned kinglet , cedar waxwing , American robin , yellow @-@ rumped warbler , tree swallow and European starling , and several endangered species , including white @-@ tailed kite and Swainson 's hawk . Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove , Cassin 's finch , California quail , dark @-@ eyed junco , woodpecker , dipper , great blue heron , scrub jay , red @-@ winged blackbird , red @-@ tailed hawk , turkey vulture , cliff swallow , canyon wren , merganser , and rarely , bald eagle . Of the 140 insect and invertebrate species , which include mayflies , stoneflies and caddisflies , there are also three major exotic species : Asiatic clam , Chinese mitten crab , and New Zealand mud snail . 
 Many species of plants are found throughout the middle and upper basin , including California poppy , white alder , Oregon ash , oak , poison oak , bigleaf maple , Indian rhubarb , <unk> , willow , whiteleaf manzanita , and historically , sugar pine , before logging began in the late 19th century . Squirrels , raccoon , jackrabbits , bats , skunks , beavers , mule deer , coyote , bobcat and black bear are among the mammal species found in the middle and upper watershed . 
 One species of interest is the limestone salamander , an extremely rare amphibian whose only habitat is in the Merced Canyon downstream of Yosemite Valley . The limestone salamander depends on the granite walls of the Merced Canyon to survive . To protect the species , a 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) segment of the canyon covering 1 @,@ 600 acres ( 6 @.@ 5 km2 ) was designated in 1986 an " Area of Critical Environmental Concern " . 
 = = Geology = = 
 When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards encountered the Pacific Plate approximately 250 million years ago during the Paleozoic , the latter began to subduct under the North American continent . Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt , and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada . Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite , and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock . Over millions of years , the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock , eventually hitting the hard granite beneath . The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting , although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon . 
 Over about 80 million years , erosion caused the transportation of massive amounts of alluvial sediment to the floor of the Central Valley , where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east , forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface . The present @-@ day form of the upper Merced River watershed , however , was formed by glaciers , and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected . 
 When the last glacial period or Ice Age arrived , a series of four tremendous valley glaciers filled the upper basin of the Merced River . These glaciers rose in branches upstream of Yosemite Valley , descending from the Merced River headwaters , Tenaya Canyon and Illilouette Creek . Tenaya Canyon was actually eroded even deeper by an arm of the Tuolumne Glacier , which formed the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and Hetch Hetchy Valley on the Tuolumne River in the north . Little Yosemite Valley formed as a result of the underlying rock being harder than that below the Giant Staircase , the cliff wall containing Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall . These three branches of each glacier combined to form one large glacier about 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) thick at maximum , stretching 25 miles ( 40 km ) downstream past the mouth of Yosemite Valley , well into Merced Canyon . These glaciers formed the granite cliffs that now constitute landmarks such as Half Dome , El Capitán , and Cloud 's Rest . 
 The first and largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre @-@ Tahoe glacier , which eroded the upper Merced watershed to an extent close to its present form . Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation ; these were the Tahoe , Tenaya and Tioga stages , of which the Tioga was the smallest . The Tioga glacier left at the mouth of Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine . This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations , which include <unk> Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine . After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley . Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite , creating a broad and flat valley floor . Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then , helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley . 
 = = History = = 
 Of the many Native American tribes that have lived on the Merced River the most prominent were the Miwok ( consisting of Plains Miwok and Sierra Miwok ) , Paiute , and Ahwahnechee . Many Plains Miwok settled in the lowlands along the lower Merced River . The Sierra ( or Mountain ) Miwok lived in the upper Merced Canyon and in Yosemite Valley , and at the time the first white explorers came to the area , there were about 450 Sierra Miwok split among ten permanent villages . Paiute , of origin from the eastern Sierra near the Mono Lake area , also lived in the upper watershed of the Merced River . The Sierra Miwok and Mono Lake Paiute eventually , through cultural interaction over time , formed a new culture , the Ahwahnechee , derived from Ahwahnee , meaning " the valley shaped like a big mouth " ( referring to U @-@ shaped Yosemite Valley ) . 
 In the early 19th century , several military expeditions sent by Spanish colonists from coastal California traveled into the Central Valley . One of these trips , headed by lieutenant Gabriel Moraga , arrived on the south bank of the Merced River on September 29 , 1806 . They named the river Rio de Nuestra Señora de la Merced ( River of Our Lady of Mercy ) , who is the patron saint of Barcelona and is celebrated on September 24 . Another expedition to the Central Valley in 1805 also named the Kings River upon reaching it on January 6 , 1805 , which is the feast of the Magi or Epiphany . Moraga 's expedition was part of a series of exploratory ventures , funded by the Spanish government , to find suitable sites for missions in the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills . In 1808 and 1810 , Moraga led further expeditions along the lower Merced River below Merced Canyon , each time coming to nothing . Eventually , plans to establish a mission chain in the Valley were abandoned . In 1855 , Merced County was created , named after the Merced River . 
 Following the establishment of Merced County and the independence of California from Mexico , many settlers came to the Merced River area and established small towns on the Merced River . One of the first was Dover , established in 1844 at the confluence of the Merced River with the San Joaquin River . Dover functioned as an " inland seaport " where boats delivered supplies from the San Francisco Bay area to settlers in the San Joaquin Valley . Some towns that followed were <unk> , Snelling and Merced Falls , the latter named for a set of rapids on the Merced River near the present @-@ day site of McSwain Dam . In the late 1880s a flour mill , woolen mill and a few lumber mills were constructed at Merced Falls . The Sugar Pine Lumber Company and Yosemite Lumber Company operated lumber mills at Merced Falls for over thirty years , relying on narrow @-@ gauge railroads to ship lumber from the Sierra Nevada along the Merced River . Following the construction of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads , many of the river towns on the Merced River were deserted . Several cities that did achieve prominence , however , include Merced and Turlock , both located on the railroad . 
 The California Gold Rush in the 1850s saw gradually increasing mining in Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley . Many Native Americans in the area revolted , leading to conflicts between miners and the Ahwahnechee . In 1851 the Mariposa Battalion was formed to drive the remaining Ahwahnechee out of the valley into reservations . The Battalion fought an Ahwahnechee group led by Chief Tenaya over the South Fork of the Merced River . Eventually , they succeeded in driving most of the Indians out of the Yosemite Valley , first into a reservation near Fresno . Following the gold rush , the Ahwahnechee were allowed back into Yosemite Valley , but further incidents prompted a second battalion to drive them out , this time to the Mono Lake area . Many place names in the valley have their origin from the Mariposa Battalion . 
 Even before the establishment of Yosemite National Park , tourists began to travel into the Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley as early as 1855 . The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s . The first was <unk> Road , followed by Big Oak Flat Road , a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon . Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish Yosemite National Park in 1890 . With the creation of the national park tourism to the Valley and the Merced River increased significantly , leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed . Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed , including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest . 
 The Yosemite Valley Railroad , originally established with the discovery of mineral deposits in Yosemite Valley and Merced Canyon , continued functioning through the early 20th century carrying tourists to Yosemite Valley along the Merced River . El Portal Road , constructed through Merced Canyon in 1926 , put an end to passenger service on the railway , but operations continued until the mid @-@ 1940s , when major flooding occurred , destroying sections of the railroad . In the early 20th century , when the upper Merced River basin lay mostly protected , the lower river was the subject of dam @-@ building and irrigation diversions by the Merced Irrigation District . The District proposed the Exchequer Dam , completed in the mid @-@ 1920s and raised in the 1960s , as a water storage facility on the Merced River . 
 Irrigation with water from the Merced River continued to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river , some 120 @,@ 000 acres ( 490 km2 ) , was under cultivation . By the late 1950s and early 1960s , irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was to such an extent that many of the rivers ran dry in sections . Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin , the latter river was usually dry , only regaining flow where the Merced River enters . In the mid @-@ 20th century , the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River . In 1991 , a fish hatchery , the Merced River Hatchery , was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker @-@ Huffman Diversion Dam , the lowermost Merced River dam . Fall chinook salmon travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery 's pools , which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River . 
 Yosemite Valley saw significant amounts of damage when the river flooded the valley in 1997 .

 Despite its partial status as a National Wild and Scenic River , the Merced River has been the subject of dam @-@ building and irrigation diversions . The dams on the Merced River are New Exchequer Dam , McSwain Dam and the Crocker @-@ Huffman Diversion Dam . New Exchequer Dam is the largest dam on the river and forms Lake McClure , which holds 1 @,@ 032 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 1 @.@ 273 × 109 m3 ) . This modern structure was preceded by the old Exchequer Dam forming Exchequer Reservoir , with a capacity of 281 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 347 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) . The old concrete arch dam , completed in 1926 , has since been inundated by a new rockfill structure . 
 Many small diversion dams block the Merced River downstream , many of which were built by the Merced Irrigation District to supply water to farms in the Central Valley . The lowermost , the Crocker @-@ Huffman Diversion Dam , was built just before 1907 , and completely blocks the passage of anadromous fish up the Merced River . McSwain Dam , the other major lower dam , also serves as a forebay ( regulating dam ) for New Exchequer Dam . Aside from controlling flows in the lower river the dam also produces some hydroelectricity . Because of the nearly desiccated flow of the river as it nears the mouth , like most other rivers in the San Joaquin Valley , little water in the Merced River actually reaches the Pacific Ocean . 
 Cascades Diversion Dam was a timber crib dam built in 1917 near where the Merced River flows out of Yosemite Valley . Because of its impact on the environment and damage from floods , the dam , originally built to generate hydropower , was decommissioned in 1985 and removed in the 1990s . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation surveyed the dam site in 1997 and found that the dam was in danger of failure . Classified as a " high hazard " structure , it was originally considered for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places but was deemed too dangerous to keep . Today , the Merced to Lake McClure is completely free @-@ flowing and unobstructed by any dams . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 The Merced River and its tributaries are a popular recreational area in part because of Yosemite National Park . There are many activities within the watershed , including boating , fishing , camping and hiking . Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure . The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV , mostly upstream of El Portal . There is also boating on Lake McClure . Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds . Campgrounds along the Merced River and its tributaries include ones at Railroad Flat , McCabe Flat , Willow Placer , Merced Lake , Vogelsang Lake , Sunrise Creek , May Lake , Bridalveil Creek , and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake , the source of Bridalveil Creek . 
 The name " Railroad Flat " originates from the Yosemite Valley Railroad , which once travelled up Merced River Canyon into Yosemite Valley . The old railroad grade still exists , and is now the site of a public trail . Many other trails lead throughout the Merced River watershed , notably the John Muir Trail , which starts near Happy Isles and climbs the Giant Staircase , past Vernal and Nevada Falls , into Little Yosemite Valley and north along Sunrise Creek to join the Pacific Crest Trail near Tuolumne Meadows . Trails also follow the river through Little Yosemite Valley to the headwaters area , and along Illilouette , Bridalveil , Yosemite , Alder and <unk> Creeks , and the lower South Fork of the Merced River . There are no trails along some segments , including the lower Bridalveil Creek , upper South Fork , and specifically Tenaya Canyon , which is extremely dangerous .

 Crime and Dissonance is a 2005 compilation album of Italian composer Ennio Morricone 's film score work . Intended as a follow @-@ up to two earlier Morricone compilations assembled by <unk> , the album was put together by Alan Bishop and released by Ipecac Recordings . Crime and Dissonance features work ranging from the later 1960s to the early 1980s , and contains scores taken from films of several different genres . 
 The collection focuses on Morricone 's lesser @-@ known soundtrack work , with Ipecac founder Mike Patton consciously wishing to distance it from similar compilations . Released on October 18 , 2005 , Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics . The album has attracted comments on Morricone 's experimental and innovative compositional style , often in contrast to the spare @-@ sounding westerns he is known for .

 Crime and Dissonance , a collection of Ennio Morricone 's film scores from the 1970s , was conceived as a follow @-@ up to <unk> releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 . However , that label abandoned the project , and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead . Morricone had no input in the project ; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop . Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well . All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period , spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s , but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s . Bishop had been given a list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection ; he set about compiling the two @-@ disc set from there . However , the final song on the album , an eleven @-@ minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da <unk> , was not included in the list of available material . The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song . 
 Patton , founder of Ipecac Recordings , has described his admiration for Morricone 's writing , feeling that the composer turned " what could be banal , surface @-@ style pop into really deep , orchestrated , tense and compelling music " . Patton considers Morricone to be one of his favorite composers , and wanted the compilation to serve as a fitting tribute . He felt it was " imperative " for Crime and Dissonance to focus on Morricone 's lesser @-@ known work , as it had to compete with a large back catalogue of similar compilations . To this end , Patton and Bishop focused on Morricone 's more experimental work , which Patton has compared to the music of Brazilian tropicália group Os Mutantes . Patton has praised Bishop 's work on the project , calling him " a big Morricone scholar " , and has described Crime and Dissonance as one the Ipecac releases he is most proud of . 
 Crime and Dissonance features liner notes written by composer John Zorn , who had previously reinterpreted Morricone 's work on the album The Big <unk> . The album 's title reflects the range of genres covered by the films whose scores have been included , with the collection gathering music from " horror , suspense , mafia , and period movies " , including several pieces taken from Dario Argento 's giallo film L <unk> dalle <unk> di <unk> . However , the album itself only lists the titles of the films , omitting the context in which the music was originally presented and leaving the compositions to " speak for themselves " .

 Crime and Dissonance was released on October 18 , 2005 , through the Ipecac Recordings label , although it has previously been scheduled for release on September 6 of the same year . 
 The album has garnered mostly positive reviews from critics . Writing for Allrovi , Thom Jurek rated the collection four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , calling it " essential Morricone " . Jurek felt that the album served to present " a much wider view of Morricone not only as a composer , but as a sonic experimentalist " . Pitchfork Media 's Joe Tangari awarded the album a score of eight out of ten , describing it as " a minor revelation " . Tangari felt that the collection represented Morricone 's most innovative period of work , and praised Bishop 's compilation for its cohesion and flow . Joshua Klein of The Washington Post has described the album as featuring " bizarre soundscapes , discordant drones , proto @-@ <unk> , weird instruments , strange sounds and oddball voices " . Klein felt that the collection portrayed Morricone as a ground @-@ breaking and confident composer , eschewing his trademark spare @-@ sounding scores to freely experiment . 
 The A.V. Club 's Andy Battaglia rated the compilation an A − , noting its dissimilarity to Morricone 's more well @-@ known work . Battaglia complimented the arrangement of the tracks , feeling that they flowed into one another well , and noted the range of genres the collection represented . Danny <unk> of The Roanoke Times has commented on the wide variety of styles the collection contains , adding that it proves " Morricone always delivered something interesting " . Stylus Magazine 's Cameron Macdonald rated the album an A − , finding that the " kitsch " mass @-@ market appeal of Morricone 's better @-@ known western scores made Crime and Dissonance a more " relevant " record . However , Macdonald felt that album 's second disc was the weaker of the two , finding that the " slapstick " nature of some of its pieces seemed out of place . Dave Gurney of Tiny Mix Tapes rated Crime and Dissonance three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five , calling it " a group of Morricone 's most uncompromising works " . However , Gurney questioned the target audience of the collection , believing that it would not be likely to appeal to casual listeners while not presenting much new material for dedicated Morricone collectors . An anonymous review for The Stranger described the album as proof that " there 's much more to the maestro than his revered spaghetti @-@ western work for Sergio Leone " . The review highlighted the range of genres present in the collection , calling the end result a " deluge of otherworldly , endlessly fascinating sounds " . 
 = Men in Black : Alien Attack = 
 Men in Black : Alien Attack is an interactive dark ride located at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando , Florida . As the name suggests , the ride is themed to the 1997 film , Men in Black ( MIB ) . The ride opened in 2000 after a three @-@ year development process . The ride has generally been well received , winning an Outstanding Achievement award from the Themed Entertainment Association . 
 Riders enter a MIB training facility disguised as a pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair . After navigating through a themed queue and pre @-@ show , riders board a spinning dark ride system . Once dispatched riders are tasked to kill aliens using the supplied laser guns , and subsequently accumulate points . At the time of its opening , the ride was the biggest dark ride ever built at a Universal park , spanning 70 @,@ 000 square feet ( 6 @,@ 500 m2 ) and featuring over 125 animatronic aliens .

 After the release of the first Men in Black ( MIB ) film in 1997 , Universal Creative , the research and development division of Universal Parks & Resorts , set about developing a MIB @-@ themed shooting dark ride for Universal Studios Florida . After the ride system was finalised in mid @-@ 1998 , construction began on the ride 's large show building . By late 1998 , sources speculated that a Men in Black @-@ themed attraction would be built . Planning documents filed with Orlando City Hall in March 1999 , described an alien @-@ themed laser tag ride , supporting previous rumors . After an official announcement of the $ 70 million attraction in October 1999 @,@ 
 Men in Black : Alien Attack officially opened to the public on April 14 , 2000 , in the World Expo area of the park , replacing the Back to the Future Part III Locomotive Display which were relocated two years prior . In 2001 , a year after its opening , Men in Black : Alien Attack was awarded a Thea Award for Outstanding Achievement by the Themed Entertainment Association .

 Guests approach the building under the guise of visiting an exhibit called The Universe & You - Are We Alone ? which has been transplanted from the 1964 New York World Expo . The exterior queue is flanked by posters advertising extraterrestrial activity and microphones giving " updates " on the fair .

 Guests are then ushered into the building and into the retro @-@ modern exhibit . The 1960s narration , however , is cut short by a MIB agent terminating the false program and issuing the " recruits " into Men in Black Headquarters . One of the walls of the exhibit splits , opening up into an elevator , which travels deep into the Earth . Guests who have an Express Pass and use it for this ride takes another entrance which , instead of riding the elevator , walk up a long hallway and meets the guests with no Express Passes after they have walked through the hallway . Single riders follow a third queue .

 Upon exiting the elevator , guests enter a hallway within the secret MIB Headquarters . Traveling down the hall , they pass the film 's famous " worm guys " on break , several interactive doors to various labs , and through the alien scanners . At the end of the hallway , guests overlook the immigration and controls room , with a large video screen broadcasting the training information and alien twins , Bob and <unk> operating controls . They then move into the weapons room , and finally into the training facility , where a training vehicle awaits . Guests who use an Express Pass skip some rooms and meet the normal riders when they see the alien twins in the control rooms , then follow the normal riders but in a different path .

 Pitted against another team of players ( riding on a separate vehicle ) , the recruits board their training vehicles equipped with laser guns , called S4 <unk> ( " Jumbo Judy " ) and proceed into the training room , blasting at cardboard cutouts and crudely drawn images of aliens amid flashing red lights . Soon , however , MIB Director Zed ( played by Rip Torn ) informs the trainees that an alien prison ship has crash landed in the middle of New York City . The guns are then " set to full power " as the trainees are instantly launched into the heart of New York , attempting to score as many points as they can by shooting the aliens in their vulnerable areas ( the eyes and shoulders ) . Aliens vary from large , plain @-@ in @-@ sight creatures to small ones hiding in windows and bushes . Certain aliens will fire back causing the cart to spin out of control . 
 After a brief romp through the city , the two head @-@ to @-@ head vehicles face each other and pass on either side of a large green scanner . The scanner reveals that the opposing car is really full of aliens in disguise , thus prompting a shoot @-@ out between the two paired vehicles . Both cars race to shoot the other 's " fusion exhaust port , " a glowing red light atop their vehicle . A hit causes the opposing vehicle to wildly spin out of control , offering more time to collect points while they spin . 
 The battle between the cars comes to an end when Jay ( played by Will Smith ) appears on a giant television screen in Times Square , alerting the riders to " get their game faces on " because a " really big bug " has been found . Turning the corner , riders come face @-@ to @-@ face with Edgar , a gigantic cockroach @-@ like alien seen in the first film . The animatronic bug in the ride stands 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) tall , measures 50 feet ( 15 m ) wide , has 8 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) teeth , and 20 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) claws . The bug is immune to the weak guns ' laser fire , so Zed orders the riders to press the much @-@ dreaded red button ( which activates the Subatomic Thermonuclear Disruptor ) . There is a small window of time when the button is effective , and every rider that presses the button during this window is granted a 100 @,@ 000 point bonus ( average first time riders will score about 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 points , without the bonus , while experienced riders with good aim will already be anywhere between 500 @,@ 000 and 900 @,@ 000 points ) . Both cars enter into the bugs mouth and spin out of control amid fog and strobe flashes . 
 During the wind down , both teams have their scores averaged and Agent J appears to declare them MIB material while encouraging the losing team to try again . The two vehicles separate to view the final scene ; Losing teams are shown an alien " Coach " saying " Basically , you <unk> when you shoulda zagged ! You gotta learn when to run and gun and when to lock and load baby . Try again ! " . The winning team pulls up to an alien " Tailor " finishing a black suit and telling the riders " your suit will be ready next Wednesday " . These various combinations allow for 35 different endings . 
 Agent J <unk> both teams regardless and the vehicles re @-@ enter a retro @-@ themed atrium with the " Universe & You " logo on the wall in front of them , and the big question answered : " Are We Alone ? Of Course We Are ! " Riders then exit into the Men In Black Gift Shop .

 The production of Men in Black : Alien Attack was completed by Universal Creative . Vice president of attraction development Philip Hettema headed up the project , with Dave Cobb as the creative director . Other Universal employees included Jimmy Pickering ( production designer ) , Craig Hanna & John Murdy ( show designers for story and concept ) , Desiree Soto ( character art director ) , Mary Lamm @-@ <unk> ( show set art director ) and Joel Kagan ( ride management director ) . Will Smith and Rip Torn reprised their roles as Agent J and Z , respectively . Andy Garfield composed the music in the attraction Men in Black : Alien Attack . The lyrics for the song " The Universe and You " were written by the attraction 's Creative Director David Cobb and the attraction 's Document Control Coordinator Timothy Bernardi . 
 = = = Ride system = = = 
 At the time of Men in Black : Alien Attack 's development , Universal Creative were installing two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park . The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider @-@ Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International . It featured track @-@ mounted motion bases with six degrees of freedom that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections . The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat . This system was simpler , offering track @-@ mounted spinning platforms , with no additional degrees of freedom . The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider @-@ Man ride system ; however , when shooting tests were performed on the ride , the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score . As a result , The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction . 
 The Men in Black : Alien Attack dark ride system was manufactured by MTS , with Rod Millen Special Vehicles theming the upper half of the ride vehicles . The system consists of two tracks , allowing riders of two vehicles to be pitted against each other . Each vehicle has two onboard computers which control the motion , lighting , audio and game play , with all vehicles communicating wirelessly to a central controller . The vehicles each seat six riders in two rows of three . The ride system consists of a total of 44 vehicles , allowing for 2 @,@ 200 riders per hour . Riders must be 42 inches ( 110 cm ) or taller to ride . The infrared guns mounted on the vehicles were developed by Universal in conjunction with toy and laser tag manufacturers . A patent for the ride system was filed on July 8 , 1998 , and was granted on April 24 , 2001 . The patent credits Craig Hanna , Jennifer Sauer , and Philip Hettema as the inventors , with Universal Studios as the assignee . 
 = = = Theming design = = = 
 The initial storyline developed for the attraction would have seen riders enter a replica of the Orlando International Airport , before being ushered onto people movers taking them to the underground to the MIB training facility . However , executives were unsure of the concept and instead wanted at least one recognisable item from the 1997 film to be on the outside facade . Responding to the concern , designers chose the film 's flying saucer @-@ shaped towers , adding elements of a building from the 1964 World 's Fair , Dodgers Stadium , and the St. Louis Arch to form the facade . Other elements of the storyline also did not make the final cut . The immigration office from the film is featured in the attraction 's queue ; however , it was intended that it would feature numerous animatronics . However , due to the large animatronics budget for the ride itself , this idea was scrapped . In homage , ride employees for the first few months of the ride 's operation would take their breaks in the room , to give the effect of a working office . 
 At the time of the ride 's opening , Universal officials described Men in Black : Alien Attack as both the biggest attraction at Universal Studios Florida , and as their most ambitious use of animatronics ever . The 70 @,@ 000 square feet ( 6 @,@ 500 m2 ) show building featured 127 animatronics as interactive targets . Eighty of the animatronics were designed in @-@ house by Universal , with the remaining ones being adapted from the film . The animatronics were manufactured by Advanced <unk> , AVG , and ASI . An average of seven sensors cover each animatronic . Other special effects inside the show building include lighting and 13 fog machines — the latter using 7 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 26 @,@ 000 L ) of liquid nitrogen daily . 
 = RNA interference = 
 RNA interference ( RNAi ) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression , typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA molecules . Historically , it was known by other names , including co @-@ suppression , post @-@ transcriptional gene silencing ( PTGS ) , and quelling . Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon . Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , which they published in 1998 . Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials , it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes . RNAi is now known as precise , efficient , stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression . 
 Two types of small ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) molecules – microRNA ( miRNA ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) – are central to RNA interference . RNAs are the direct products of genes , and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity , for example by preventing an mRNA from producing a protein . RNA interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons . It also influences development . 
 The RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes , including animals , and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer , which cleaves long double @-@ stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) molecules into short double @-@ stranded fragments of ~ 20 nucleotide siRNAs . Each siRNA is unwound into two single @-@ stranded RNAs ( <unk> ) , the passenger strand and the guide strand . The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA @-@ induced silencing complex ( RISC ) . The most well @-@ studied outcome is post @-@ transcriptional gene silencing , which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by <unk> , the catalytic component of the RISC complex . In some organisms , this process spreads systemically , despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA . 
 RNAi is a valuable research tool , both in cell culture and in living organisms , because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest . RNAi may be used for large @-@ scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell , which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division . The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology , medicine and insecticides . 
 = = Cellular mechanism = = 
 RNAi is an RNA @-@ dependent gene silencing process that is controlled by the RNA @-@ induced silencing complex ( RISC ) and is initiated by short double @-@ stranded RNA molecules in a cell 's cytoplasm , where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute . When the dsRNA is exogenous ( coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations ) , the RNA is imported directly into the cytoplasm and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer . The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous ( originating in the cell ) , as in pre @-@ microRNAs expressed from RNA @-@ coding genes in the genome . The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem @-@ loop structure of pre @-@ miRNA in the nucleus , then exported to the cytoplasm . Thus , the two dsRNA pathways , exogenous and endogenous , converge at the RISC . 
 = = = dsRNA cleavage = = = 
 Endogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by activating the ribonuclease protein Dicer , which binds and cleaves double @-@ stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) to produce double @-@ stranded fragments of 20 – 25 base pairs with a 2 @-@ nucleotide overhang at the 3 ' end . Bioinformatics studies on the genomes of multiple organisms suggest this length maximizes target @-@ gene specificity and minimizes non @-@ specific effects . These short double @-@ stranded fragments are called small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) . These siRNAs are then separated into single strands and integrated into an active RISC complex . After integration into the RISC , siRNAs base @-@ pair to their target mRNA and cleave it , thereby preventing it from being used as a translation template . 
 <unk> dsRNA is detected and bound by an effector protein , known as <unk> @-@ 4 in C. elegans and <unk> in Drosophila , that stimulates dicer activity . This protein only binds long dsRNAs , but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown . This RNA @-@ binding protein then facilitates the transfer of cleaved siRNAs to the RISC complex . 
 In C. elegans this initiation response is amplified through the synthesis of a population of ' secondary ' siRNAs during which the dicer @-@ produced initiating or ' primary ' siRNAs are used as templates . These ' secondary ' siRNAs are structurally distinct from dicer @-@ produced siRNAs and appear to be produced by an RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are <unk> encoded non @-@ coding RNAs that help regulate gene expression , particularly during development . The phenomenon of RNA interference , broadly defined , includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effects of miRNAs as well as silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA . Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA , but before reaching maturity , miRNAs must first undergo extensive post @-@ transcriptional modification . A miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA @-@ coding gene as a primary transcript known as a pri @-@ miRNA which is processed , in the cell nucleus , to a 70 @-@ nucleotide stem @-@ loop structure called a pre @-@ miRNA by the microprocessor complex . This complex consists of an RNase III enzyme called <unk> and a dsRNA @-@ binding protein <unk> . The dsRNA portion of this pre @-@ miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can be integrated into the RISC complex ; thus , miRNA and siRNA share the same downstream cellular machinery . First , viral encoded miRNA was described in <unk> . Thereafter , an increasing number of microRNAs have been described in viruses . <unk> is a comprehensive catalogue covering viral microRNA , their targets and anti @-@ viral miRNAs ( see also <unk> resource : http : / / <unk> / servers / <unk> / ) . 
 siRNAs derived from long dsRNA precursors differ from miRNAs in that miRNAs , especially those in animals , typically have incomplete base pairing to a target and inhibit the translation of many different mRNAs with similar sequences . In contrast , siRNAs typically base @-@ pair perfectly and induce mRNA cleavage only in a single , specific target . In Drosophila and C. elegans , miRNA and siRNA are processed by distinct argonaute proteins and dicer enzymes . 
 = = = Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs = = = 
 Three prime untranslated regions ( <unk> ) of messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) often contain regulatory sequences that post @-@ transcriptionally cause RNA interference . Such 3 ' -UTRs often contain both binding sites for microRNAs ( miRNAs ) as well as for regulatory proteins . By binding to specific sites within the 3 ' -UTR , miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript . The 3 ' -UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA . 
 The 3 ' -UTR often contains microRNA response elements ( MREs ) . MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind . These are prevalent motifs within 3 ' -UTRs . Among all regulatory motifs within the 3 ' -UTRs ( e.g. including silencer regions ) , MREs make up about half of the motifs . 
 As of 2014 , the <unk> web site , an archive of miRNA sequences and annotations , listed 28 @,@ 645 entries in 233 biologic species . Of these , 1 @,@ 881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA <unk> miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target mRNAs ( affecting expression of several hundred genes ) . Friedman et al. estimate that > 45 @,@ 000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA <unk> are conserved above background levels , and > 60 % of human protein @-@ coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs . 
 Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs . Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins , but that this repression often is relatively mild ( less than 2 @-@ fold ) . 
 The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer . For instance , in gastrointestinal cancers , nine miRNAs have been identified as <unk> altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes . 
 The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depression , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease and autism spectrum disorders . 
 = = = RISC activation and catalysis = = = 
 The active components of an RNA @-@ induced silencing complex ( RISC ) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins , which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA . As the fragments produced by dicer are double @-@ stranded , they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA . However , only one of the two strands , which is known as the guide strand , binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing . The other anti @-@ guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation . Although it was first believed that an ATP @-@ dependent helicase separated these two strands , the process proved to be ATP @-@ independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC . However , an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis . The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5 ' end is less stably paired to its complement , but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation . Instead , the <unk> protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more @-@ stable 5 ' end of the passenger strand . 
 The structural basis for binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X @-@ ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA @-@ bound argonaute protein . Here , the phosphorylated 5 ' end of the RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation ( an atom with two positive charges ) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking ( a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth ) between the 5 ' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue . This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target . Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5 ’ or 3 ’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5 ’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA , while the 3 ’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage @-@ favorable RISC region . 
 It is not understood how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell . Although the cleavage process has been proposed to be linked to translation , translation of the mRNA target is not essential for RNAi @-@ mediated degradation . Indeed , RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated . <unk> proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P @-@ bodies ( also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies ) , which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay ; miRNA activity is also clustered in P @-@ bodies . Disruption of P @-@ bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference , suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process . 
 = = = <unk> silencing = = = 
 Components of the RNAi pathway are used in many eukaryotes in the maintenance of the organization and structure of their genomes . Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre @-@ transcriptionally ; this process is referred to as RNA @-@ induced transcriptional silencing ( RITS ) , and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex . In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute , a <unk> protein <unk> , and a protein called <unk> of unknown function . As a consequence , the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins . Indeed , deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation , causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division . In some cases , similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes . 
 The mechanism by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood . Most studies have focused on the mating @-@ type region in fission yeast , which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions / organisms . In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions , RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones , acting co @-@ transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre @-@ mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase . The formation of such a heterochromatin region , though not its maintenance , is dicer @-@ dependent , presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts . <unk> maintenance has been suggested to function as a self @-@ reinforcing feedback loop , as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes . The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating @-@ type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear , as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway . 
 = = = <unk> with RNA editing = = = 
 The type of RNA editing that is most prevalent in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into inosine in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase ( ADAR ) . It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A → I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate . Some pre @-@ miRNAs do undergo A → I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs . Furthermore , at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components . Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR @-@ null C. elegans strains indicating that A → I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes . 
 = = = Variation among organisms = = = 
 Organisms vary in their ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway . The effects of RNA interference can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans , although not in Drosophila or mammals . In plants , RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through <unk> ( channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport ) . <unk> comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi ; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell . A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs ; in plants , miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC , while animals ' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression . This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA 's <unk> tail . 
 Some eukaryotic protozoa such as Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely . Most or all of the components are also missing in some fungi , most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces <unk> and Candida albicans , further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi @-@ related proteins from S. <unk> facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae . That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages , possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function , or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches . 
 = = = Related prokaryotic systems = = = 
 Gene expression in prokaryotes is influenced by an RNA @-@ based system similar in some respects to RNAi . Here , RNA @-@ encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that <unk> to an mRNA . However these regulatory RNAs are not generally considered to be analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved . It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems , although none of the protein components are orthologous . 
 = = Biological functions = = 
 = = = Immunity = = = 
 RNA interference is a vital part of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material , especially in plants where it may also prevent the self @-@ propagation of transposons . Plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana express multiple dicer homologs that are specialized to react differently when the plant is exposed to different viruses . Even before the RNAi pathway was fully understood , it was known that induced gene silencing in plants could spread throughout the plant in a systemic effect and could be transferred from stock to scion plants via grafting . This phenomenon has since been recognized as a feature of the plant adaptive immune system and allows the entire plant to respond to a virus after an initial localized encounter . In response , many plant viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to suppress the RNAi response . These include viral proteins that bind short double @-@ stranded RNA fragments with single @-@ stranded overhang ends , such as those produced by dicer . Some plant genomes also express endogenous siRNAs in response to infection by specific types of bacteria . These effects may be part of a generalized response to pathogens that <unk> any metabolic process in the host that aids the infection process . 
 Although animals generally express fewer variants of the dicer enzyme than plants , RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response . In both juvenile and adult Drosophila , RNA interference is important in antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus . A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans , as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that <unk> components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection . 
 The role of RNA interference in mammalian innate immunity is poorly understood , and relatively little data is available . However , the existence of viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi @-@ dependent mammalian immune response , although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly substantiated . Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide evidence for the existence of a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells . Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist , such as miRNAs expressed by the herpes virus that may act as heterochromatin organization triggers to mediate viral latency . 
 = = = <unk> of genes = = = 
 <unk> expressed miRNAs , including both <unk> and intergenic miRNAs , are most important in translational repression and in the regulation of development , especially on the timing of morphogenesis and the maintenance of undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated cell types such as stem cells . The role of endogenously expressed miRNA in downregulating gene expression was first described in C. elegans in 1993 . In plants this function was discovered when the " <unk> microRNA " of Arabidopsis was shown to be involved in the regulation of several genes that control plant shape . In plants , the majority of genes regulated by miRNAs are transcription factors ; thus miRNA activity is particularly wide @-@ ranging and regulates entire gene networks during development by modulating the expression of key regulatory genes , including transcription factors as well as F @-@ box proteins . In many organisms , including humans , miRNAs are linked to the formation of tumors and dysregulation of the cell cycle . Here , miRNAs can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors . 
 = = = <unk> of genes = = = 
 RNA sequences ( siRNA and miRNA ) that are complementary to parts of a promoter can increase gene transcription , a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation . Part of the mechanism for how these RNA upregulate genes is known : dicer and argonaute are involved , possibly via histone <unk> miRNAs have been proposed to upregulate their target genes upon cell cycle arrest , via unknown mechanisms . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Based on parsimony @-@ based phylogenetic analysis , the most recent common ancestor of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway ; the absence of the pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic . This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer @-@ like protein , one argonaute , one <unk> protein , and an RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles . A large @-@ scale comparative genomics study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components , which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome . This study also suggests that the RNA @-@ binding argonaute protein family , which is shared among eukaryotes , most archaea , and at least some bacteria ( such as <unk> <unk> ) , is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system . 
 The ancestral function of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes . Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes , although other functions such as regulation of development by miRNA are thought to have evolved later . 
 RNA interference genes , as components of the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes , are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes . Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells , particularly for plant viruses . Studies of evolutionary rates in Drosophila have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong directional selection and are among the fastest @-@ evolving genes in the Drosophila genome . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Gene knockdown = = = 
 The RNA interference pathway is often exploited in experimental biology to study the function of genes in cell culture and in vivo in model organisms . Double @-@ stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism , where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway . Using this mechanism , researchers can cause a drastic decrease in the expression of a targeted gene . Studying the effects of this decrease can show the physiological role of the gene product . Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene , this technique is sometimes referred as a " knockdown " , to distinguish it from " knockout " procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated . 
 Extensive efforts in computational biology have been directed toward the design of successful dsRNA reagents that maximize gene knockdown but minimize " off @-@ target " effects . Off @-@ target effects arise when an introduced RNA has a base sequence that can pair with and thus reduce the expression of multiple genes . Such problems occur more frequently when the dsRNA contains repetitive sequences . It has been estimated from studying the genomes of humans , C. elegans and S. pombe that about 10 % of possible siRNAs have substantial off @-@ target effects . A multitude of software tools have been developed implementing algorithms for the design of general mammal @-@ specific , and virus @-@ specific siRNAs that are automatically checked for possible cross @-@ reactivity . 
 Depending on the organism and experimental system , the exogenous RNA may be a long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer , or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates . In most mammalian cells , shorter RNAs are used because long double @-@ stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response , a form of innate immunity that reacts <unk> to foreign genetic material . Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA and are therefore a common model system for studying mammalian gene @-@ knockdown effects . Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA , for example , by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed , or by more elaborate <unk> vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription , known as conditional RNAi . 
 = = = Functional genomics = = = 
 Most functional genomics applications of RNAi in animals have used C. elegans and Drosophila , as these are the common model organisms in which RNAi is most effective . C. elegans is particularly useful for RNAi research for two reasons : firstly , the effects of gene silencing are generally heritable , and secondly because delivery of the dsRNA is extremely simple . Through a mechanism whose details are poorly understood , bacteria such as E. coli that carry the desired dsRNA can be fed to the worms and will transfer their RNA payload to the worm via the intestinal tract . This " delivery by feeding " is just as effective at inducing gene silencing as more costly and time @-@ consuming delivery methods , such as soaking the worms in dsRNA solution and injecting dsRNA into the gonads . Although delivery is more difficult in most other organisms , efforts are also underway to undertake large @-@ scale genomic screening applications in cell culture with mammalian cells . 
 Approaches to the design of genome @-@ wide RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions . Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown . Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high @-@ throughput screening methods based on microarrays . However , the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned , for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes . 
 Functional genomics using RNAi is a particularly attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid , which presents substantial challenges for more traditional genetic engineering methods . For example , RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat ( which is <unk> ) as well as more common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize .

 It may be possible to exploit RNA interference in therapy . Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response , the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful . Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus . RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models . 
 = = = = Antiviral = = = = 
 Potential antiviral therapies include topical <unk> treatments that use RNAi to treat infection ( at Harvard Medical School ; in mice , so far ) by herpes simplex virus type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells , knockdown of host receptors and <unk> for HIV , the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes , silencing of influenza gene expression , and inhibition of measles viral replication . Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases have also been proposed , with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington 's disease . 
 RNA interference @-@ based applications are being developed to target persistent HIV @-@ 1 infection . Viruses like HIV @-@ 1 are particularly difficult targets for RNAi @-@ attack because they are escape @-@ prone , which requires combinatorial RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape . 
 = = = = Cancer = = = = 
 RNA interference is also a promising way to treat cancers by silencing genes differentially upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division . A key area of research in the use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method , which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy . 
 Due to safety concerns with viral vectors , nonviral delivery methods , typically employing lipid @-@ based or polymeric vectors , are also promising candidates . Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems . The model used an input bolus dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent mainly on the doubling time of the cells to which siRNA was delivered , while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose . Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed . 
 = = = = Safety = = = = 
 Despite the proliferation of promising cell culture studies for RNAi @-@ based drugs , some concern has been raised regarding the safety of RNA interference , especially the potential for " off @-@ target " effects in which a gene with a coincidentally similar sequence to the targeted gene is also repressed . A computational genomics study estimated that the error rate of off @-@ target interactions is about 10 % . One major study of liver disease in mice reported that 23 out of 49 distinct RNAi treatment protocols resulted in death . Researchers hypothesized this alarmingly high rate to be the result of " oversaturation " of the dsRNA pathway , due to the use of <unk> that have to be processed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm using an active mechanism . Such considerations are under active investigation , to reduce their impact in the potential therapeutic applications . 
 RNAi in vivo delivery to tissues still eludes science — especially to tissues deep within the body . RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract . In these instances , siRNA has been used in direct contact with the tissue for transport . The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes . When delivering siRNA to deep tissues , the siRNA must be protected from nucleases , but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty . This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached , however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported . 
 = = = Biotechnology = = = 
 RNA interference has been used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others . RNAi has developed many novel crops such as <unk> tobacco , <unk> coffee , nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops . The genetically engineered Arctic apples are near close to receive US approval . The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of <unk> ( polyphenol oxidase ) gene making apple varieties that will not undergo browning after being sliced . <unk> @-@ silenced apples are unable to convert <unk> acid into quinone product . 
 There are several opportunities for the applications of RNAi in crop science for its improvement such as stress tolerance and enhanced nutritional level . RNAi will prove its potential for inhibition of <unk> to enhance the productivity of C3 plants . This knockdown technology may be useful in inducing early flowering , delayed ripening , delayed senescence , breaking dormancy , stress @-@ free plants , overcoming self @-@ sterility , etc . 
 = = = = Foods = = = = 
 RNAi has been used to genetically engineer plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins . Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks . Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol , making them unsuitable for human consumption . RNAi has been used to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta @-@ cadinene synthase , a key enzyme in gossypol production , without affecting the enzyme 's production in other parts of the plant , where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests . Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product <unk> in cassava plants . 
 No plant products that use RNAi @-@ based genetic engineering have yet exited the experimental stage . Development efforts have successfully reduced the levels of allergens in tomato plants and fortification of plants such as tomatoes with dietary antioxidants . Previous commercial products , including the <unk> <unk> tomato and two cultivars of ringspot @-@ resistant papaya , were originally developed using antisense technology but likely exploited the RNAi pathway .

 Another effort decreased the precursors of likely carcinogens in tobacco plants . Other plant traits that have been engineered in the laboratory include the production of non @-@ narcotic natural products by the opium poppy and resistance to common plant viruses . 
 = = = = Insecticide = = = = 
 RNAi is under development as an insecticide , employing multiple approaches , including genetic engineering and topical application . Cells in the midgut of many larvae take up the molecules and help spread the signal throughout the insect 's body . 
 RNAi has varying effects in different species of Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) . Possibly because their saliva is better at breaking down RNA , the cotton <unk> , the beet <unk> and the Asiatic rice borer have so far not been proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding . 
 To develop resistance to RNAi , the western corn <unk> would have to change the genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites . Combining multiple strategies , such as engineering the protein Cry , derived from a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) , and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance . 
 = = = = = Transgenic plants = = = = = 
 Transgenic crops have been made to express small bits of RNA , carefully chosen to silence crucial genes in target pests . RNAs exist that affect only insects that have specific genetic sequences . In 2009 a study showed RNAs that could kill any one of four fruit fly species while not harming the other three . 
 In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm <unk> for $ 522 million and Monsanto paid $ 29 @.@ 2 million for the exclusive rights to intellectual property from <unk> Pharmaceuticals . The International Potato Center in Lima , Peru is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil , a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally . Other researchers are trying to silence genes in ants , caterpillars and pollen beetles . Monsanto will likely be first to market , with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn <unk> , a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone . A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth , killing them within days . In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species .

 Alternatively dsRNA can be supplied without genetic engineering . One approach is to add them to irrigation water . The molecules are absorbed into the plants ' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them . Another approach involves spraying RNA like a conventional pesticide . This would allow faster adaptation to resistance . Such approaches would require low cost sources of RNAs that do not currently exist . 
 = = = Genome @-@ scale screening = = = 
 Genome @-@ scale RNAi research relies on high @-@ throughput screening ( HTS ) technology . RNAi HTS technology allows genome @-@ wide loss @-@ of @-@ function screening and is broadly used in the identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes . This technology has been hailed as the second genomics wave , following the first genomics wave of gene expression microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery platforms . One major advantage of genome @-@ scale RNAi screening is its ability to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes . With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment , genome @-@ scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates . Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge , requiring suitable statistics / bioinformatics methods . The basic process of cell @-@ based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library , robust and stable cell types , transfection with RNAi agents , treatment / incubation , signal detection , analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets . 
 = = History = = 
 The discovery of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants , and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant scientists in the United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s . In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias , researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding <unk> synthase , a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color . The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers , but instead produced less pigmented , fully or partially white flowers , indicating that the activity of <unk> synthase had been substantially decreased ; in fact , both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers . Soon after , a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa , although it was not immediately recognized as related . Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post @-@ transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation . This phenomenon was called co @-@ suppression of gene expression , but the molecular mechanism remained unknown . 
 Not long after , plant virologists working on improving plant resistance to viral diseases observed a similar unexpected phenomenon . While it was known that plants expressing virus @-@ specific proteins showed enhanced tolerance or resistance to viral infection , it was not expected that plants carrying only short , non @-@ coding regions of viral RNA sequences would show similar levels of protection . Researchers believed that viral RNA produced by transgenes could also inhibit viral replication . The reverse experiment , in which short sequences of plant genes were introduced into viruses , showed that the targeted gene was suppressed in an infected plant . This phenomenon was labeled " virus @-@ induced gene silencing " ( <unk> ) , and the set of such phenomena were collectively called post transcriptional gene silencing . 
 After these initial observations in plants , laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms . Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire 's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans . In investigating the regulation of muscle protein production , they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections had an effect on protein production , but double @-@ stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene . As a result of this work , they coined the term RNAi . This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon . Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . 
 = Adam 's Song = 
 " Adam 's Song " is a song recorded by the American rock band Blink @-@ 182 for its second studio album , Enema of the State ( 1999 ) . It was released as the third and final single from Enema of the State on September 5 , 2000 through MCA Records . " Adam 's Song " shares writing credits between the band 's guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus , but Hoppus was the primary composer of the song . The track concerns suicide and depression . It incorporates a piano in its bridge section , and was regarded as one of the most serious songs the band had written to that point . 
 Hoppus was inspired by one of his friends that died while on tour ; while his bandmates had significant others to return home to , he was single . He was also influenced by a teen suicide letter he read in a magazine . The song takes the form of a suicide note , and contains lyrical allusions to the grunge band Nirvana . " Adam 's Song " was one of the last songs to be written and recorded for Enema of the State , and it was nearly left off the album . Though Hoppus worried the subject matter was too depressing , his bandmates were receptive to its message . The song was produced by Jerry Finn . 
 " Adam 's Song " peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart ; it was also a top 25 hit in Canada and Italy , but did not replicate its success on other charts . It received praise from music critics , who considered it a change of pace from the trio 's more lighthearted singles . The single 's music video , a hit on MTV , was directed by Liz Friedlander . Though the song was intended to inspire hope to those struggling with depression , it encountered controversy when a student of Columbine High School committed suicide with the track on repeat in 2000 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Beginning in the summer of 1997 , Blink @-@ 182 would enter an extended period of touring to support their second studio album , Dude Ranch . The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996 , a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music . However , upon Dude Ranch 's release and popularity , Blink @-@ 182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion . The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997 . " When we did our longest tour stretch , it was right when I started dating my fiancee , " recalled vocalist / guitarist Tom DeLonge . " We were all new and in love , and I had to leave . It was just , " Hey , I 'll see you in nine months . " It was really hard . " 
 Bassist Mark Hoppus penned " Adam 's Song " to vent these frustrations and the loneliness he experienced on the tour ; while the other members had longtime girlfriends to return home to , Hoppus was single . " When you ’ re on tour , you 're so lonely , " Hoppus said . " You hang out with all your bros and it ’ s a great time and everything , but everybody wants to come home and have a girlfriend . And every time we 'd fly home , Tom and [ former drummer ] Scott [ Raynor ] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport , and I didn 't . It ’ s about me being depressed and lonely out on tour , and not really having anything to come home to . " The couplet " I couldn ’ t wait til I got home / To pass the time in my room alone " originally ended " to get off the plane alone . " 
 Hoppus said the song 's inspiration came from " reading a magazine where some teenage kid had killed himself and left a letter for his family . " Untrue online rumors purported that the song was inspired by a friend from Hoppus ' high school years who committed suicide , or a play titled Adam 's Letter that has the same focus . A fictional suicide note was a part of the script for Adam 's Letter , a play that wasn 't written until two years after " Adam 's Song " came out . John <unk> , the writer behind Adam 's Letter , said : 
 " The play was written in 2001 with a different title , Final Word . It was renamed and released on the web as Adam 's Letter in around 2005 . The actual suicide note was written by me as a part of the play script . As it was written two years after the blink song , there is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the note and the writing of the song . By the same token , the naming of the central character was a coincidence . The name goes back to the original script ; I had no knowledge of Blink @-@ 182 or their music at that time . " 
 In his memoir Can I Say , drummer Travis Barker wrote that the song 's title was taken from a " sketch on Mr. Show about a band that writes a song with that name encouraging one particular fan to kill himself . " David Cross , co @-@ creator of Mr. Show , confirmed this , commenting , " They were fans of the show and that was a knowing tribute that I thought was pretty cool . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 " Adam 's Song " was among the last tracks composed and recorded for Enema of the State , and was nearly absent from the final album . The band were halfway finished with recording when Hoppus developed the idea . Though he worried it was " a bit too far and depressing for what we were trying to do , " his bandmates were receptive towards the idea : 
 " I remember the day I played [ " Adam 's Song " ] for Tom and Travis , and they were like , " Wow , that 's a pretty heavy song . It 's really good . " [ There ] was never even a question of whether or not to put it on the record , or was that a " real " Blink song , or was that the right direction for us to go . Whatever song we write , if it 's a good song , we 'll put it on the record . If we wanted to write a song about — I don 't know , people starving somewhere , we would . " 
 Although vocals would usually take many alternate takes to complete , Hoppus completed much of the vocal track for " Adam 's Song " in a single take . " It 's in a pretty high register for me , so I just blasted it out one night after dinner . That 's , like , 90 per cent of what 's on the final track , " he told Kerrang ! . The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought ; " We realized , ' Well , this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here . ' So we tried it out , and it sounded rad , " said Hoppus . The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning , Jr . , best @-@ known for his work with Beck . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Adam 's Song " was a departure from the content of the band 's previous singles , in favor of a slower tempo and more depressing lyrics . Brian Wallace of MTV wrote that Blink @-@ 182 " explores new ground on “ Adam ’ s Song , ” setting aside their normal pop @-@ punk punch for a more emo @-@ influenced approach . " The song is a pop punk and alternative rock track composed in the key of C major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 136 beats per minute . Hoppus ' vocal range spans from G3 to G4 . 
 The song begins with the narrator contemplating suicide with the lyrics " I never thought I 'd die alone . " The lyrics continue : " I 'm too depressed to go on / You 'll be sorry when I ’ m gone . " " Adam 's Song " includes a reference to " Come as You Are " by Nirvana . " Come as You Are " by Nirvana includes the lyrics " Take your time , hurry up , the choice is yours , don 't be late " . " Adam 's Song " , in turn , includes the lyrics " I took my time , I hurried up , The choice was mine , I didn 't think enough " . 
 Barker 's drum track was labeled by <unk> as " one of the most creative beats of his career , " and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses . The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat , followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two , preceding an open hi @-@ hat that rings out for a full count on beat three . " The kick , snare , and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four , followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth @-@ note triplets of beat four . " The snare is hit on beats two and four , respectively . The song " gradually builds to a powerful , piano @-@ laden crescendo , " and the song 's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world : " Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when I can still feel alive / When I can 't wait to get outside . " DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the " gigantic , sad " choruses , but upon mixing , only four were used . " The extra ones didn 't really do anything besides make it a little more unclear what was going on . "

 " Adam 's Song " was mainly a commercial success in the United States , but it also was a top 25 hit in Canada and Italy as well . In the US , it debuted on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 38 in the issue dated March 18 , 2000 . Over the following weeks , it gradually ascended the chart to a peak of number two in the issue dated April 29 . It remained at that position for seven weeks , held off the top position by " Otherside " by the Red Hot Chili Peppers , and " Kryptonite " by 3 Doors Down . On May 13 , the single peaked at number one on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart . In CMJ New Music Report , a trade magazine that contained exclusive charts of non @-@ commercial and college radio airplay and independent and trend @-@ forward retail sales , " Adam 's Song " was a number one hit on their Commercial Alternative Cuts chart in the issue dated May 15 , 2000 . The song made its sole appearance on Billboard 's Hot 100 Airplay chart on that same date , peaking at number 79 . The song 's last appearance on the Modern Rock Tracks chart came on September 9 , 2000 ; as a whole , it spent 26 weeks on the chart . In the Billboard issue for July 19 , 2003 , Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems recognized the single with the BDS Certified Award for 100 @,@ 000 radio spins . The song later made an appearance on Billboard 's Rock Digital Songs at position 38 shortly after the release of the band 's sixth album , Neighborhoods , in October 2011 . 
 In Canada , the single debuted on the Rock Report chart , compiled by RPM , on May 15 , 2000 at number 26 . Over the ensuing weeks , its position fluctuated , but it reached a peak of number 20 on June 12 , 2000 . It last appeared on the chart on July 24 at number 29 before dropping out . In Italy , the single reached a peak of number 21 and spent three weeks on the charts . In New Zealand , the song reached a peak of number 39 and spent six weeks on the chart , while in Germany , the single fared poorly , spending only one week and reaching a peak of 98 .

 " Adam 's Song " is generally considered one of the band 's more serious songs , one " that hints at the emotional maturity they 'd show on later releases , " particularly their eponymous 2003 release . Richard Harrington of The Washington Post deemed the song " a powerful exploration of exhaustion and depression . " Alex Pappademas , writing for Spin , compared the song to the music of Weezer . Katy Kroll of Billboard recognized it among her top 10 singles of 2000 , calling it " a good old @-@ fashioned depressing song with mainstream flair . " Geoff Boucher , writing for the Los Angeles Times , called it " a poignant essay on a teen mulling over suicide " ; conversely , Steve Appleford of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it a " moving if unremarkable examination . " Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette called it a " rare departure from the usual Blink fare . " 
 Writers for the The A.V. Club listed it among other suicide @-@ related songs in 2009 , describing it as " surprisingly affecting , especially when the band reaches the bombastic chorus , and when the song describes suicide 's crushing aftermath . " In a retrospective review , Chris Payne of Billboard wrote , " Stylistically , it 's also a Blink breakthrough : rather than putting their heads down and plowing through at breakneck speed , the band dials back the verses and interludes to let them breathe a bit .

 The song caused a controversy in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17 @-@ year @-@ old Greg Barnes , a teenager who attended Columbine High School and had lost one of his best friends in the massacre the previous year , hanged himself in the garage of his family 's home . Both Hoppus and DeLonge were sympathetic but stressed the song 's meaning : 
 Hoppus : " I was actually out shopping , and management called me up and told me the story of what happened , and I was like , " But that 's an anti @-@ suicide song ! " It felt awful . I mean , the things that the kid had had to go through in his life were very saddening , and then to end it that way was really depressing . But " Adam 's Song " , the heart of the song is about having hard times in your life , being depressed , and going through a difficult period , but then finding the strength to go on and finding a better place at the other side of that . " 
 DeLonge : " It affected us really strongly because that song was a song of hope . When we were writing it , we knew specifically that we did not want kids to think it was something that we thought was cool or rad . We didn 't endorse it in any way . " 
 Mark Hoppus also told interviewers he received fan mail following the song ’ s release from fans that had contemplated suicide , but decided not to go through with it after hearing the song . Rolling Stone compared the controversy to that of Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " , which similarly was playing as a teen committed suicide .

 Glover was born on 8 February 1983 in St Helens , Merseyside , England . She had a troubled childhood . She grew up partly in St Helens with her father 's family , partly in Great Yarmouth with her mother 's , and partly in foster care , which , she says , led to her being bullied and made her a very shy and quiet child . She changed homes and schools many times . At age 15 , she was released from foster care , and got her own apartment . 
 Glover had started her modelling career early , when at the age of 9 , a photographer noticed her on a shopping trip with her mother , and compared her to a young version of Lorraine Chase from the British TV show Emmerdale . Glover found she enjoyed being photographed , and planned to become a professional model from the age of 12 . She began entering modelling contests at the age of 14 , and beauty pageants , to get noticed as a model . She was a regional finalist for the beauty title Miss Great Britain at the age of 17 , and traveled to London to be a national finalist at the age of 18 , while studying Holistic Therapy at St Helens College . 
 At age 17 , in 2000 , Glover travelled to Belize with a Raleigh International project . The ten weeks in Belize had a great impact on her motivation . " It was the best thing I could have ever done at that point in my life " , she said . At age 19 , she represented Great Britain in the Miss Earth contest in the Philippines . Soon after , her modelling offers increased tenfold .

While performing the community service in 2006 , she was assaulted twice by a group of girls , one attack leaving her with a broken nose . This cost her a month of modelling work , and contributed to her depression , but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself .

 = Order of the Garter = 
 The Most Noble Order of the Garter , founded in 1348 , is the highest order of chivalry and the third most prestigious honour ( inferior only to the Victoria Cross and George Cross ) in England and the United Kingdom . It is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George , England 's patron saint . 
 It is awarded at the Sovereign 's pleasure as a personal gift on recipients from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms . Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign , the Prince of Wales , and no more than 24 members , or Companions . The order also includes supernumerary knights and ladies ( e.g. members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs ) . 
 New appointments to the Order of the Garter are always announced on St George 's Day ( 23 April ) , as Saint George is the order 's patron saint . 
 The order 's emblem is a garter with the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ( Middle French : " shame on him who thinks evil of it " ) in gold lettering . Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions . 
 = = History = = 
 King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne . The year is usually presumed to be 1348 , however , the Complete Peerage , under " The Founders of the Order of the Garter " , states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344 , listing each founding member as knighted in 1344 . The list includes Sir <unk> D <unk> , who died on 20 October 1345 . Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed . The King 's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348 . Also , its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight ( what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor ) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year . 
 The earliest written mention of the Order is found in Tirant lo Blanch , a chivalric romance written in Catalan mainly by Valencian Joanot Martorell . It was first published in 1490 . This book devotes a chapter to the description of the origin of the Order of the Garter . 
 = = = List of Founder Knights = = = 
 At the time of its foundation , the Order consisted of King Edward III , together with 25 Founder Knights , listed in ascending order of stall number in St. George 's Chapel : 
 King Edward III ( 1312 – 77 ) 
 Edward , the Black Prince , Prince of Wales ( 1330 – 76 ) 
 Henry of Grosmont , Earl of Lancaster ( c . 1310 – 61 ) 
 Thomas , Earl of Warwick ( d . 1369 ) 
 Jean de <unk> , <unk> de Buch ( d . 1377 ) 
 Ralph , Lord Stafford ( 1301 – 72 )

 Sir Walter <unk> ( d . 1375 ) 
 They are all depicted in individual portraits in the Bruges Garter Book made c . 1431 . 
 = = = Legendary origins = = = 
 Various legends account for the origin of the Order . The most popular legend involves the " Countess of Salisbury " ( either Edward 's future daughter @-@ in @-@ law Joan of Kent or her former mother @-@ in @-@ law , Catherine Montacute , Countess of Salisbury ) . While she was dancing at a court ball at Calais , her garter is said to have slipped from her leg . When the surrounding courtiers <unk> , the king picked it up and returned it to her , exclaiming , " Honi soit qui mal y pense " ( " Shame on him who thinks evil of it . " ) , the phrase that has become the motto of the Order . 
 According to another legend , King Richard I was inspired in the 12th century by St George the Martyr while fighting in the Crusades to tie garters around the legs of his knights , who subsequently won the battle . King Edward supposedly recalled the event in the 14th century when he founded the Order . This story is recounted in a letter to the Annual Register in 1774 : 
 In <unk> 's Chronicle , I. <unk> under the life of Edward III is the following curious passage : " About the 19 yere of this <unk> , he made a solempne <unk> at <unk> , and a greate <unk> and <unk> , where he <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the order of the knyghtes of the garter ; <unk> be it some <unk> that this order began <unk> by kynge <unk> , Cure de Lyon , at the <unk> of the <unk> of Acres ; where , in his great <unk> , there were but 26 knyghtes that <unk> and surely abode by the kynge ; where he caused all them to were <unk> of blew <unk> about <unk> <unk> . And <unk> they were called the knyghtes of the blew <unk> . " I am obliged for this passage to John Fenn , Esq ; a curious and ingenious gentleman of East @-@ Dereham , in Norfolk , who is in possession of the most rare book whence it is taken . Hence some affirm , that the origin of the garter is to be dated from Richard I * and that it owes its pomp and splendor to Edward III . 
 * Winstanley , in his Life of Edward III says that the original book of the institution deduces the invention from King Richard the First . 
 Another explanation is that the motto refers to Edward 's claim to the French throne , and the Order of the Garter was created to help pursue this claim . The use of the garter as an emblem may have derived from straps used to fasten armour . 
 Medieval scholars have pointed to a connection between the Order of the Garter and the Middle English poem , Sir Gawain and the Green Knight . In Gawain , a girdle , very similar in its erotic undertones to the garter , plays a prominent role . A rough version of the Order 's motto also appears in the text . It translates from Old French as " Accursed be a cowardly and covetous heart . " While the author of that poem remains disputed , there seems to be a connection between two of the top candidates and the Order of the Garter . Scholar J.P. <unk> has suggested that it is someone related to John of Gaunt , 1st Duke of Lancaster , and , more importantly , a member of the Order . Another competing theory is that the work was written for Enguerrand de Coucy , seventh Sire de Coucy . The Sire de Coucy was married to King Edward III 's daughter , Isabella , and was given admittance to the Order of the Garter on their wedding day . " 
 = = = Ladies Companion of the Garter = = = 
 Soon after the founding of the Order , women were appointed " Ladies of the Garter , " but were not made companions . King Henry VII discontinued the practice in 1488 ; his mother , Margaret Beaufort , was the last Lady of the Garter before Queen Alexandra . Except for female sovereigns , the next Lady of the Garter named was Queen Alexandra , by her husband King Edward VII . King George V also made his consort , Queen Mary , a Lady of the Garter and King George VI subsequently did the same for his wife , Queen Elizabeth . Throughout the 20th century , women continued to be associated with the Order , but except for foreign female monarchs , they were not made companions . In 1987 , however , it became possible to install " Ladies Companion of the Garter " under a statute of Queen Elizabeth II . 
 = = Order = = 
 = = = Members = = = 
 Membership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the Monarch , the Prince of Wales , not more than 24 companion members , and various supernumerary members . The monarch alone can grant membership . He or she is known as the Sovereign of the Garter , and the Prince of Wales is known as a Royal Knight Companion of the Garter . 
 Male members of the Order are titled " Knights Companion , " and female members are called " Ladies Companion . " Formerly , the Sovereign filled vacancies upon the nomination of the members . Each member would nominate nine candidates , of whom three had to have the rank of earl or higher , three the rank of baron or higher , and three the rank of knight or higher . The Sovereign would choose as many nominees as were necessary to fill any vacancies in the Order . He or she was not obliged to choose those who received the most nominations . Candidates were last nominated in 1860 , and appointments have since been made by the Sovereign acting alone , with no prior nominations . The statutes prescribing the former procedure were not amended , however , until 1953 . 
 From the 18th century , the Sovereign made his or her choices on the advice of the Government . In 1946 , with the agreement of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill , membership of the United Kingdom 's highest ranking Orders of Chivalry ( the Order of the Garter , the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick ) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again . Thus , the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter , and need not act on or solicit the advice of His or Her Government . 
 = = = Supernumerary members = = = 
 In addition , the Order includes supernumerary members , who do not count towards the limit of 24 companions . Several supernumerary members , known as " Royal Knights and Ladies of the Garter " , belong to the royal family . These titles were introduced in 1786 by King George III so that his many sons would not count towards the limit on the number of companions . He created the statute of supernumerary members in 1805 so that any descendant of King George II could be installed as such a member . In 1831 , this statute was extended again to include all descendants of King George I. 
 With the installation of Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1813 , supernumerary membership was extended to foreign monarchs , who are known as " Stranger Knights and Ladies of the Garter " . Each such installation originally required the enactment of a statute ; however , a 1954 statute authorises the regular admission of Stranger Knights or Ladies without further special enactments . In lesser orders of chivalry , such foreign members would be regarded as having received honorary knighthoods . 
 Traditionally , reigning European monarchs are admitted to the Order as Strangers . Constantine II , King of the Hellenes , neither in his short reign nor since he was deposed in 1973 , has succeeded his father Paul of Greece as a member of the Order . Similarly , Albert II , King of the Belgians and his son and successor Philippe are the only Belgian monarchs to date not to have been admitted to the Order . For a time , both Juliana , Queen of the Netherlands and her successor , Queen Beatrix were concurrently members of the Order as Stranger Ladies of the Garter . 
 Akihito , Emperor of Japan is the only non @-@ European monarch and likely the only non @-@ Christian who is currently a member of the Order . He is the fourth ( consecutive ) Emperor of Japan to be a Stranger Knight . 
 The first non @-@ Christian ruler to be admitted to the Order was Abdülmecid I , Sultan of the Ottoman Empire , in 1856 as a Stranger Knight . 
 The first , and to date only , member of the Order from South America was Pedro II , Emperor of Brazil , created a Stranger Knight in 1871 . He was a member of the House of Braganza , the ruling house of Portugal and Brazil . 
 The first member of the Order admitted from Asia was Naser al @-@ Din Shah Qajar , King of Persia , created a Stranger Knight in 1873 . His immediate successor was also admitted to the Order in 1903 , to be followed by the Meiji , Emperor of Japan in 1906 . 
 The first , and to date only , member of the Order from Africa was Haile Selassie , Emperor of Ethiopia , created a Stranger Knight in 1954 . 
 The first knight from Australasia or Oceania was Richard Gardiner Casey , Baron Casey , an Australian politician , diplomat and the 16th Governor @-@ General of Australia , created a Knight Companion in 1969 . Subsequently , two more Australians , Sir Paul Hasluck and Sir Ninian Stephen , were appointed . Three New Zealanders have been appointed : Charles , Lord Elworthy , Sir Keith Holyoake , and Sir Edmund Hillary . 
 There have been no appointments from North America . 
 = = = Degradation of members = = = 
 The Sovereign may " degrade " members who have committed very serious crimes , such as treason or fleeing the battlefield , or those who have taken up arms against the Sovereign . 
 From the late 15th century , there was a formal ceremony of degradation , in which Garter King of Arms , accompanied by the rest of the heralds , proceeded to St George 's Chapel . While the Garter King of Arms read out aloud the Instrument of Degradation , a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight 's banner , crest , helm , and sword , throwing them down into the quire . Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel , out of the doors , and into the castle ditch . The last such formal degradation was that of James , Duke of Ormonde in 1716 . 
 During the First World War , two Royal Knights and six Stranger Knights , all monarchs or princes of enemy nations and including Wilhelm II , German Emperor and Franz Joseph , Emperor of Austria were struck off the roll of the Order or had their appointments annulled in 1915 . 
 The banner of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was also removed from the chapel after Italy entered World War II against the United Kingdom and her Allies . The banner of Emperor Hirohito of Japan was removed from St. George 's chapel when Japan entered World War II in 1941 , but that banner and the Japanese monarch 's knighthood were restored by Elizabeth II in 1971 , at which time he made a state visit to the United Kingdom . The Emperor was particularly pleased by the restoration of his banner as a Knight of the Garter . 
 = = = Officers = = = 
 The Order has six officers : the Prelate , the Chancellor , the Register , the Garter Principal King of Arms , the Usher , and the Secretary . The offices of Prelate , Register , and Usher were created on the order 's establishment ; those of Garter Principal King of Arms and Chancellor , in the 15th century ; and that of Secretary , in the 20th century . 
 The office of Prelate is held by the Bishop of Winchester , traditionally one of the senior bishops of the Church of England . 
 The office of Chancellor is now held by one of the companions of the order . For most of its existence , the Bishop of Salisbury has held the office , although laymen held it from 1553 to 1671 . In 1837 , after boundary changes made Windsor Castle fall in the diocese of Oxford , the Chancellorship was transferred to the Bishop of Oxford . A century later , the Bishop of Salisbury challenged this transfer , on the grounds that the Chancellorship had been attached to his office regardless of the diocese in which the chapel of the order lay ; and that , in any event , St George 's Chapel , as a Royal Peculiar , was not under diocesan jurisdiction . The office of Chancellor was removed from the Bishop of Oxford ( the outgoing bishop , Thomas Banks Strong , had been outspoken in the abdication crisis of Edward VIII ) , and so it was withheld from his successor , Kenneth Kirk , and has since been held by one of the Knights Companion . Since 1937 , the following members have held the post of Chancellor : 
 William , Duke of Portland ( 1937 – 1943 ) 
 Edward , Earl of Halifax ( 1943 – 1959 ) 
 Robert , Marquess of Salisbury ( 1960 – 1972 ) 
 Charles , Viscount Cobham ( 1972 – 1977 ) 
 John , Marquess of Abergavenny ( 1977 – 1994 ) 
 Peter , Lord Carrington ( 1994 – 2012 ) 
 James , Duke of Abercorn ( since 2012 ) 
 The office of Register has been held by the Dean of Windsor since 1558 . The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms ( the heraldic authority of England ) , and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College . As the title suggests , Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order 's officer of arms , attending to the companions ' crests and banners of arms , which are exhibited in the chapel . The Secretary , who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order , has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms . The office of Usher is held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod , who is also the Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Arms of the United Kingdom House of Lords ( although his functions are more often performed there by his deputy , the Yeoman Usher ) . 
 = = = Military Knights of Windsor = = = 
 At the founding of the Order of the Garter , 26 " poor knights " were appointed and attached to the Order and its chapel . This number was not always maintained , and by the 17th century , there were only thirteen such knights . King Charles II increased the number to 18 ( in large part because of funds allocated from Sir Francis Crane 's will ) after his coronation in 1660 . After the knights objected to being termed " poor " , King William IV redesignated them in the 19th century as the Military Knights of Windsor . 
 The poor knights were impoverished military veterans , required to pray daily for the Knights Companion . In return , they received a salary and lodging in Windsor Castle . The knights are no longer necessarily poor , but are still military pensioners . They participate in the Order 's processions , escorting the members , and in the chapel services . However , they are not considered members of the Order . 
 The poor knights originally wore red mantles , each of which bore St George 's Cross , but did not depict the Garter . Queen Elizabeth I replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns , but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under King Charles I. When the knights were renamed , the mantles were abandoned . The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an " army officer on the unattached list " : black trousers with red stripe , a red double @-@ breasted swallow @-@ tailed coat , gold epaulets and brushes , a cocked hat with a plume , and a sword on a white sash .

 = = = Members = = = 
 = = = = Order 's ceremonial occasions = = = = 
 For the Order 's ceremonial occasions , such as the annual Garter Day , the members wear elaborate vestments and accoutrements , which include : 
 The mantle is a vestment or robe worn by members since the 15th century . Once made of wool , by the 16th century it was made of velvet . The mantle was originally purple , but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue , pale blue , royal blue , dark blue , violet , and ultramarine . Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta . The mantles of the Sovereign , the Prince of Wales , and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains . The heraldic shield of St. George 's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle , but the Sovereign 's mantle instead has the star of the Order . Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat , which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour . 
 The hat is a Tudor bonnet of black velvet with a plume of white ostrich and black heron feathers . 
 The collar is an accessory worn around the neck , over the mantle and secured with white ribbons tied in bows on the shoulders . Like the mantle , it was introduced in the 15th and 16th centuries . Made of pure gold , it weighs 30 troy ounces ( 0 @.@ 933 kg ) . The collar is composed of gold knots alternating with enamelled medallions showing a rose encircled by the Garter . During King Henry VII 's reign , each garter surrounded two roses — one red and one white — but he changed the design such that each garter encircled the Tudor rose . 
 The George ( Great George ) , which is worn suspended from the collar , is a colourfully enamelled ( sometimes jewelled ) three @-@ dimensional figure of St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon . 
 The Garter is worn on ceremonial occasions around the left calf by knights and around the left arm by ladies , and is depicted on several insignia . The Garter is a buckled dark @-@ blue ( originally light @-@ blue ) velvet strap , and bears the motto in gold letters . The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels . Two styles have been used : one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a ' pre @-@ made ' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre @-@ fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment . 
 Up until the middle part of the 20th century , it was customary to wear Tudor style under @-@ dress , consisting of white silk embroidered doublet , breeches , full hose , white <unk> pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword , under the robes . Nowadays , morning dress or a lounge suit is worn , except for coronations when Tudor under @-@ dress is worn by the canopy @-@ bearers . 
 = = = = Other occasions = = = = 
 On other occasions when decorations are worn , the members wear simpler insignia : 
 The collar is worn on designated collar days over military uniform or morning dress by members attending formal events . The collar is fastened to the shoulders with silk ribbons ( or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress ) . Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter , members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong . The collar is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it . 
 The star , which is worn pinned to the left breast , was introduced in the 17th century by King Charles I and is a colourfully enamelled depiction of the heraldic shield of St. George 's Cross , encircled by the Garter , which is itself encircled by an eight @-@ point silver badge . Each point is depicted as a cluster of rays , with the four points of the cardinal directions longer than the intermediate ones . The stars of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels . Since the Order of the Garter is the senior order of the United Kingdom , a member will wear its star above the others ( up to three ) that he or she holds . 
 The riband is a four @-@ inch ( 10 @.@ 16 cm ) -wide sash worn over the left shoulder , or pinned beneath it , to the right hip , and was introduced in the 17th century by King Charles I. The riband 's colour has varied over the years : it was originally light blue , but was a dark shade under the Hanoverian monarchs . In 1950 , the colour was fixed as " kingfisher blue " . A member will wear only one riband , even if he or she belongs to several orders . The riband is not used when the collar is worn . 
 The badge is worn suspended from a small gold link from the riband at the right hip , and is sometimes known as " the Lesser George " . Like the Great George , the badge shows St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon , but it is flatter and gold . In earlier times , the badge was worn from a ribbon tied around the neck . 
 On the death of a member , the Lesser George and breast star are returned personally to the Sovereign by the former member 's nearest male relative , and the other insignia to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood , save the riband , mantle and hat . 
 = = = Officers = = = 
 For ceremonial occasions of the Order , the officers wear the following garments and accessories : 
 The mantles for the prelate and chancellor are dark blue like those of the members ( as a member , the chancellor wears a member 's mantle ) , but the mantles for the other officers are dark red . All mantles are embroidered with a heraldic shield of St George 's Cross . For Garter ceremonies , Garter Principal King of Arms wears this red mantle rather than the tabard of the royal arms worn for other State ceremonial occasions . 
 Officers wear badges of office suspended from a chain worn around the neck . The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George encircled by the Garter , which is surmounted by a bishop 's mitre . The badge for the chancellor is a rose encircled by the Garter . The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown . The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George 's Cross encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown . The badge for the usher is a knot ( like those on the collars of the companions of the order ) encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown . The badge for the secretary shows two crossed quills in front of a rose and encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown . 
 The chancellor carries a purse , which is embroidered with the royal arms impaled by the Cross of St. George . The purse contains the seal of the Order . Garter Principal King of Arms carries his baton of office . The usher carries his staff of office , the Black Rod . 
 = = Heraldry = = 
 Heraldry plays an important role in the Order of the Garter . This is reflected in the fact that the order has its own King of Arms . The position of Garter King of Arms has existed since 1415 . The incumbent of this office ranks as the senior Officer of Arms at the College of Arms , the heraldic authority with jurisdiction over England , Wales and Northern Ireland . 
 = = = Achievements = = = 
 In their heraldic achievements , members of the Order of the Garter may encircle their escutcheon with the Garter , and , if they wish , with a depiction of the collar as well . However , the Garter is normally used alone ; the more elaborate version is seldom seen . Stranger Knights and Ladies do not embellish the arms they use in their countries with English decorations . 
 Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters , a privilege granted to few other private individuals . While some families claim supporters by ancient use , and others have been granted them as a special reward , only members of the Royal Family , peers , Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter , Knights and Ladies of the Thistle , and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them . 
 = = = Banners = = = 
 During their lifetime , all members of the Order of the Garter are entitled to display their heraldic crests and banners in St. George 's Chapel , Windsor . While the Garter stall plates ( see below ) stay in the chapel permanently , the crests and banners of deceased knights are , following presentation at the High Altar , removed from the chapel . Sometimes they are then given to institutions that were connected with the late knight , or kept privately depending on family wishes . 
 = = = Stall plates = = = 
 Garter stall plates are small enamelled and engraved brass plates located in St George 's Chapel as memorials to Knights of the Garter . They are inscribed with the knight 's name , and generally with his titles , offices , and motto . In most cases his heraldic achievement is depicted .

 Members are assigned positions in the order of precedence , coming before all others of knightly rank , and above baronets . The wives , sons , daughters and daughters @-@ in @-@ law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence . Relatives of Ladies Companion are not , however , assigned any special positions . ( Generally , individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands , but not from their mothers or wives . ) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence , but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order , this precedence has been purely theoretical . As a member of the Order , the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office , and when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England , the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow . 
 Knights Companion prefix " Sir " and Ladies Companion prefix " Lady " to their forenames . Wives of Knights Companion may prefix " Lady " to their surnames , but no corresponding privilege exists for husbands of Ladies Companion . Such forms are not used by royals , peers , peeresses , or Anglican clergymen , who instead use only the post @-@ nominal letters . 
 Knights and Ladies Companion use the post @-@ nominal letters " KG " and " LG " respectively . When an individual is entitled to use multiple post @-@ nominal letters , those of the Order of the Garter appear before all others , except " Bt " or " Btss " ( Baronet or Baronetess ) , " VC " ( Victoria Cross ) and " GC " ( George Cross ) .

 The Order of the Garter once held services at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , but they became rare in the 18th century . The annual Garter Services , discontinued in 1805 , were revived by King George VI in 1948 and have become an annual event . Each June , on the Monday of Royal Ascot week ( also known as Garter Day ) , the members of the Order , wearing their habits and garter insignia , meet in the state apartments in the Upper Ward of Windsor Castle . When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation , an investiture ceremony is held at a Chapter of the Order in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day . This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order , wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia , and also by their wives . The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past . 
 At the investiture ceremony the Admonitions are read in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order and several insignia are offered on a cushion to the Sovereign by Garter King of Arms , Black Rod , and the secretary of the order , in turn , so that the Sovereign may perform the ceremony of investiture . Two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting the Sovereign in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight , and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar . After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded , a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room . This is attended by the royal family , by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses , and by the Officers of the Order . After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order , together with the prelate , chancellor and other officers of the order , in their mantles and ceremonial robes , led by the Military Knights of Windsor , move in procession , watched by a great crowd of spectators , through the castle , down the hill , which is lined with troops , to Saint George 's Chapel for a worship service , before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place .

 Donkey Kong Jr . Math , originally released in Japan as Donkey Kong Jr . ' s Math Play ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Donkī Kongu Junia no <unk> Asobi ) ( sometimes released as Jr . Math Lesson ( <unk> , Junia <unk> <unk> ) ) , is a Nintendo edutainment video game where players must solve math problems in order to win . It was released in Japan in 1983 for the Family Computer , in North America for the NES 's nationwide launch in 1986 , and in PAL regions in 1986 . It is the only game in the " Education Series " of NES games in North America . Donkey Kong Jr . Math was made available in the video game Animal Crossing ( along with several other NES titles ) . Donkey Kong Jr . Math was re @-@ released on the Wii 's Virtual Console in 2007 and on the Wii U 's Virtual Console in 2014 . 
 Since its release , Donkey Kong Jr . Math has received very negative reception ; Nintendo spokesman Tom Sarris commented that it was not well received , resulting in Nintendo ceasing development of educational games for the time . It was noted as one of the worst launch video games ever made by publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and 1UP.com. It has also received criticism from several publications including IGN , who called it one of the worst Virtual Console games . The game was the worst @-@ selling game in the NES 's launch library in the US . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game features one and two player modes , both of which are single screen . In the first mode , the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points . These questions include addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division . In the two player mode , two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong , incorporating platform gameplay . The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Jr . ; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area . In order to complete mathematics problems , players must collect at least three things : the first number , the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong , and the second number . When the game features a high number , such as 66 , players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this . For example , players could choose a nine , a multiplication symbol , and a seven , followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66 . The two player game have two different levels , Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challenging : Donkey Kong can ask for negative numbers , and the absolute values of the target numbers are in the hundreds instead of the tens .

 Since its release for the NES , Donkey Kong Jr . Math has been a critical and commercial disappointment . GameRankings reports an aggregate score of 32 % , based on 5 reviews . It was the worst @-@ selling launch title for the NES . Nintendo spokesman Tom Sarris said that it " wasn 't a big hit " , adding that no one was very enthusiastic about the title . He felt that if it had been received better , it would have led to more educational titles . Author Andy Slaven , writing in the Video Game Bible , criticized the premise , deriding Nintendo for combining a well @-@ liked license with math , which is generally disliked by children . Inside Higher Ed 's David Epstein did not find it to be a fun game , while 1UP.com 's Bob Mackey called it the worst NES launch title , criticizing it for its lack of value . He commented that Donkey Kong Jr. moves as well as an infant would in real life . 
 Donkey Kong Jr . Math had a poor reception from IGN , with Lucas M. Thomas finding its controls poor and its execution to be bland and flawed , while AU 's Cam Shea said it would be " too expensive if it was free " . Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games , finding it difficult to imagine any reason why anyone would want to buy it . GameSpot 's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly , also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones . Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an " ironic smile " as a reminder of the NES era , though he could not justify paying five dollars for it . 
 Donkey Kong Jr . Math has received criticism for its qualities as an educational game . Elizabeth <unk> , associate computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College , called Donkey Kong Jr . Math a realistic educational video game , criticizing such games as " not fun . " 1UP.com 's Kevin Gifford called it a game that children would never want to play . Fellow 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish commented that the game shouldn 't be judged on being an educational game , citing quality educational titles as The Oregon Trail and Where in the World Is Carmen <unk> ? . However , he noted that it should be judged for being a boring game . Ars Technica 's Frank Caron compared it to other educational games , calling it " no Brain Age " and preferring to play Math Blaster instead . Educational video game developer Traci Lawson wondered whether the word game Bookworm would have been as well received by players when they were children ; she felt that they would be intimidated by it , comparing this to how she felt when she played Donkey Kong Jr .

 = Hurricane Nicole ( 1998 ) = 
 Hurricane Nicole was the last hurricane in the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season . It developed from a frontal low to the south of the Azores on November 24 , and quickly strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) as it moved to the west @-@ southwest . An approaching upper @-@ level trough moved over the system , producing strong wind shear which rapidly weakened Nicole to a tropical depression . After the trough passed , the system entered an area of lighter shear , and steadily restrengthened . An approaching cold front turned it to the northeast , and while moving over anomalously warm sea surface temperatures Nicole attained hurricane status . It reached a peak intensity of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) on December 1 , and rapidly weakened over the waters of the north Atlantic Ocean . Nicole is one of five December Atlantic hurricanes on record . 
 = = Origins = = 
 A strong frontal low located several hundred miles south of the Azores persisted for several days in late November while remaining nearly stationary . After it began moving steadily to the west , a tightly @-@ wrapped band of convection developed near the center , and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen on November 24 while located 725 miles ( 1 @,@ 165 km ) south of Lajes , Azores . The system quickly intensified as it moved west @-@ southwestward , and strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicole six hours after forming . Tropical Storm Nicole was a small storm , and upon first forming tropical storm force winds extended only 60 miles ( 95 km ) from the center . 
 A few hours after attaining tropical storm status , a ship just north of the center reported winds of 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) , confirming the system was a tropical storm . Located to the south of a strong mid @-@ level ridge , Nicole continued to the west @-@ southwest while centered within a large upper @-@ level low . Common for late @-@ season development in the subtropics , this produced light vertical shear over the storm . The storm moved through an area of marginal sea surface temperatures of 77 ° F ( 25 ° C ) . An intermittent eye feature of the small area of deep convection , and Nicole quickly strengthened to reach an initial peak intensity of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) . After maintaining its peak for around twelve hours , an upper @-@ level trough moved rapidly eastward over Nicole , which produced high levels of wind shear . The shear weakened the storm , and by late on November 25 the center became exposed to the west of the diminishing deep convection . The shear dissipated most of the convection , and Nicole degenerated to a tropical depression on November 26 . Operationally , advisories were discontinued , and regeneration was considered unlikely . 
 = = Regeneration = = 
 The low turned to the west , and following the passage of the trough a ridge became established over Nicole . This resulted in a decrease in wind shear , and deep convection redeveloped over the storm . The National Hurricane Center reinstated advisories for Nicole on November 27 while located about 1 @,@ 515 miles ( 2 @,@ 440 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Canary Islands . The low @-@ level circulation was initially exposed on the southwest side of the convection , though Nicole quickly strengthened and unexpectedly re @-@ attained tropical storm status later on November 27 . Upon reaching tropical storm status for the second time , the center of Nicole moved beneath the convection while an anticyclone developed over the storm . Banding features began to develop , and outflow was well @-@ defined . An approaching cold front turned Nicole to the north , and late on November 28 the storm reached its westernmost point while located 1 @,@ 125 miles ( 1 @,@ 800 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda . 
 After turning to the northeast , shear from the approaching front weakened Nicole slightly , and the center became situated near the western edge of the convection . Upper @-@ level diffluence allowed the convection to persist despite the shearing environment , and an eye @-@ feature developed within the convection . <unk> warm sea surface temperatures of 3º to 5 ° F ( 2º to 3 ° C ) above normal allowed the storm to continue strengthening , and early on November 30 Nicole strengthened to attain hurricane status while located 1 @,@ 280 miles ( 2 @,@ 060 km ) west @-@ southwest of Lajes , Azores . A nearly complete eyewall organized within the storm , and early on December 1 Nicole reached a peak intensity of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . It turned northward and rapidly weakened , and Nicole became extratropical later on December 1 while located 285 miles ( 460 km ) northwest of the Azores . The extratropical remnant turned to the northwest while moving around the periphery of a larger circulation , and on December 2 Nicole dissipated . 
 When Nicole lasted into December as a hurricane , it was one of only five Atlantic hurricanes on record in the month . The other five attained the intensity during the month , and included an unnamed hurricane in the 1887 season , Hurricane Alice in 1954 , Hurricane Lili in 1984 , and Hurricane Epsilon in 2005 .

 Nicole remained hundreds of miles away from land throughout its entire lifetime , and as a result it caused no damage or deaths . 
 = Free Association of German Trade Unions = 
 The Free Association of German Trade Unions ( German : Freie Vereinigung deutscher <unk> ; abbreviated FVdG ; sometimes also translated as Free Association of German Unions or Free Alliance of German Trade Unions ) was a trade union federation in Imperial and early Weimar Germany . It was founded in 1897 in Halle under the name Representatives ' Centralization of Germany as the national umbrella organization of the localist current of the German labor movement . The localists rejected the centralization in the labor movement following the sunset of the Anti @-@ Socialist Laws in 1890 and preferred grassroots democratic structures . The lack of a strike code soon led to conflict within the organization . Various ways of providing financial support for strikes were tested before a system of voluntary solidarity was agreed upon in 1903 , the same year that the name Free Association of German Trade Unions was adopted . 
 During the years following its formation , the FVdG began to adopt increasingly radical positions . During the German socialist movement 's debate over the use of mass strikes , the FVdG advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon in the hands of the working class . The federation believed the mass strike was the last step before a socialist revolution and became increasingly critical of parliamentary action . Disputes with the mainstream labor movement finally led to the expulsion of FVdG members from the Social Democratic Party of Germany ( SPD ) in 1908 and the complete severing of relations between the two organizations . Anarchist and especially syndicalist positions became increasingly popular within the FVdG . During World War I , the FVdG rejected the SPD 's and mainstream labor movement 's cooperation with the German state — known as the Burgfrieden — but was unable to organize any significant resistance to or continue its regular activities during the war . Immediately after the November Revolution , the FVdG very quickly became a mass organization . It was particularly attractive to miners from the Ruhr area opposed to the mainstream unions ' reformist policies . In December 1919 , the federation merged with several minor left communist unions to become the Free Workers ' Union of Germany ( FAUD ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 According to Angela Vogel and Hartmut <unk> , Carl Hillmann , a typesetter and prominent trade unionist in the 1870s , was the " intellectual father " of the localist and anarcho @-@ syndicalist movement . Vogel 's and <unk> 's claim is based on the fact that Hillmann was the first in Germany to consider unions ' primary role to be the creation of the conditions for a socialist revolution , not simply to improve workers ' living conditions . He also advocated a de @-@ centralized trade union federation structure . Many of the later anarcho @-@ syndicalists including Rudolf Rocker agree with this notion . Hans Manfred Bock , on the other hand , sees no evidence for Hillmann 's influence on the FVdG . 
 From 1878 to 1890 , the Anti @-@ Socialist Laws forbade all socialist trade unions . Only small local organizations , which communicated via intermediaries such as stewards , who worked illegally or semi @-@ legally , survived . This form of organization was easier to protect against state repression . After the laws were sunset in 1890 , the General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germany was founded on November 17 at a conference in Berlin to centralize the socialist labor movement . In 1892 , the Trade Union Congress of Halberstadt was held to organize the many local unions under the committee . The localists , 31 @,@ 000 of whom were represented at the congress , wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during the repressive period . For example , they opposed separate organizations for political and economic matters , such as the party and the trade union . They especially wanted to keep their grassroots democratic structures . They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally , and were wary of bureaucratic structures . The localists ' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress , so they refused to join the centralized trade unions , which became known as the Free Trade Unions . They did not renounce social democracy , but rather considered themselves to be an avant @-@ garde within the social democratic movement in Germany . 
 The localists ' main stronghold was in Berlin , although localist unions existed in the rest of the Empire as well . Masons , carpenters , and some metal @-@ working professions — especially those requiring a higher degree of qualification like <unk> or gold and silver workers — were represented in large numbers . By 1891 , there were at least 20 @,@ 000 metal workers in localist trade unions , just as many as in the centralized German Metal Workers ' Union . 
 = = Founding = = 
 At a congress in 1897 in Halle , the localists founded a national organization of their own , the Representatives ' Centralization of Germany ( <unk> @-@ <unk> Deutschlands ) . The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier , but a lack of interest forced it to be postponed . There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6 @,@ 803 union members . Nearly two @-@ thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle . Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry , while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions . The congress decided to establish a five @-@ person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions , aid in communication between local organizations , and raise financial support for strikes . Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission . A newspaper , <unk> ( Solidarity ) , was founded , but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit ( Unity ) the following year . It initially appeared fortnightly , but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898 . 
 The decision to found a national organization was likely the result of several factors . First , the mainstream trade unions were increasingly reformist and centralized . Second , the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers ' strike in Hamburg in late 1896 and early 1897 . Third , loss of membership ( for example , the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897 ) convinced the localists of the need for action . 
 The Representatives ' Centralization 's relationship to the SPD was ambivalent . The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program . At the same time , the party mostly opposed the founding of the Representatives ' Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions . The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD , which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members . The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG 's organizational principles . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The early years of the Representatives ' Centralization of Germany were dominated by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions . The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance . Originally , all support between local organizations had been voluntary . But this system became more and more impractical , especially after the turn of the 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively — often by locking out workers . In 1899 , the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig . It took out a loan , which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions . The following year , the Business Committee incurred 8 @,@ 000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes . Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD , while the rest was apportioned among the local unions . 
 This practice was replaced in 1900 by a far more complex system of assessments and donations designed to raise the money to support strikes . This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical . The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds . Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances , and the central Business Committee 's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members . This system , too , proved problematic because it penalized the larger , wealthier unions — especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living . From 1901 to 1903 , many small organizations joined the federation , yet the FVdG 's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out . In 1903 , the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions . This system remained in place until 1914 . The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could . Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike . Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement , but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations . 
 = = <unk> and expulsion from the SPD = = 
 During the first decade of the 20th century , the FVdG was transformed from a localist union federation into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies . The process was initiated by the death of Gustav <unk> , the most important ideologue in the FVdG , in 1903 . His role was largely assumed by the physician Raphael Friedeberg . 
 In 1903 , a dispute between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party commission to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re @-@ unification of the two wings of the German labor movement . At the meeting , the FVdG made a number of compromises , which led to member protests . Soon , over one @-@ third of the members left the union . The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions . This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re @-@ unification . The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic , but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein 's theses would strengthen their position . The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904 , since the re @-@ unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions . 
 The FVdG 's disillusionment with the social democratic movement deepened during the mass strike debate . The role of the general strike for the socialist movement was first discussed within the FVdG in 1901 . At the SPD 's 1903 congress in Dresden , Raphael Friedeberg proposed discussing the topic , but his proposal was rejected by the congress . The following year , a proposal by Wilhelm Liebknecht and Eduard Bernstein to initiate debate on the topic was accepted , since they had distanced themselves from Friedeberg 's positions . 
 Liebknecht and Bernstein , like the left wing of the party , felt the general strike should not be used to provoke the state but rather to defend political rights ( especially the right to vote ) should the state should seek to abolish them . The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept . In 1904 , Friedeberg , speaking for the FVdG , advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon in the hands of the proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution . In 1905 , his speech on the topic was even more radical . He claimed that historical materialism , a pillar of Marxism , was to blame for social democracy 's alleged powerlessness , and introduced the alternative concept of historical <unk> — which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions . He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin 's writings rather than Marx 's works , which were most influential in the SPD . 
 The position that the general strike could be used , but only as a last resort , became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate . This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party , especially among many trade unionists . At a meeting in February 1906 , the trade unionists were placated by party leaders , who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs . The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit , greatly angering the party leadership . 
 At the 1905 party convention , August Bebel , who had always favored a stronger role for the SPD @-@ affiliated unions , proposed a resolution requiring all members of the party to join the centralized trade unions for their respective professions . This would have forced all FVdG members to either leave the party or the trade union . The resolution was adopted , and implemented in 1907 . An FVdG survey returned a vote of twenty @-@ two to eight opposing rejoining the centralized unions . This led some of the masons , carpenters , and construction workers in the union to leave the FVdG in 1907 to avoid being expelled from the SPD , saying the organization was " taking a path , which would certainly lead to strife with the SPD and to syndicalism and anarchism . " In 1908 , the SPD 's Nuremberg congress finally voted to make SPD and FVdG membership incompatible . 
 In addition to causing about two @-@ thirds of its members to quit between 1906 and 1910 , the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu , industries , and regions from which the organization drew its members . Many metal and construction workers , who had a localist tradition , left as a result of the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG . Miners , who worked mostly in the Ruhr area , did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures . About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I , a sign of what was to come after the war . 
 = = Pre @-@ war period = = 
 Following the split from the SPD , the FVdG was increasingly influenced by French syndicalism and anarchism . In 1908 , Kater called the Charter of Amiens , the platform of the French General Confederation of Labor ( CGT ) , the earliest and largest syndicalist union worldwide , " a new revelation " . Although there was no contact between German " intellectual anarchists " ( like Gustav Landauer and Erich Mühsam ) and the FVdG , it did have influential anarchist members , most notably Andreas <unk> and Fritz Köster . <unk> and Köster increasingly influenced the federation from 1908 on , and this led to the founding of Der Pionier in 1911 . This newspaper , which was edited by Köster , had a much more aggressive tone than Die Einigkeit . Despite these developments , the influence of the anarchists in the pre @-@ World War I FVdG remained quantitatively minute , especially as leading members like Kater were at the time very skeptical of the anarchist ideology . 
 After both the British Industrial Syndicalist Education League ( <unk> ) , a short @-@ lived syndicalist organization heavily involved in the strike wave in Britain from 1910 , and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat ( NAS ) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913 , the FVdG was the first to express support . There were difficulties in organizing the congress , and the largest syndicalist union worldwide — the CGT — refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions . Despite these challenges , the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2 . British , Swedish , Danish , Dutch , Belgian , French , Spanish , Italian , Cuban , Brazilian , and Argentine organizations — both labor unions and political groups — had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG , which was represented by Karl Roche , Carl <unk> , and Fritz Kater . There were also links with Norwegian , Polish , and American groups . Kater was elected co @-@ president of the congress alongside Jack Wills . After Wills was forced to resign , Kater served as co @-@ president with Jack Tanner . The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues , the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement ( as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands ) should be risked . The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism , while their Italian , French , and Spanish counterparts , most notably Alceste De <unk> of the Italian USI , were more intent on preventing further division . Accordingly , the congress was divided on the question of whether its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded . The opponents of a new organization prevailed , but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau . The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement <unk> . The congress was considered a success by most who attended , with the notable exception of De <unk> . A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years ' time in Amsterdam . Due to the outbreak of World War I , the congress did not take place . The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication . 
 = = World War I = = 
 During the buildup to World War I , the FVdG denounced the SPD 's anti @-@ war rhetoric as " complete humbug " . With the start of war , the SPD and the mainstream labor movement entered into the Burgfrieden ( or civil truce ) with the German state . Under this agreement , the unions ' structures remained intact and the government did not cut wages during the war . For their part , the unions did not support new strikes , ended current ones , and mobilized support for the war effort . The 1916 Auxiliary War Service Law established further cooperation between employers , unions , and the state by creating workers ' committees in the factories and joint management @-@ union arbitration courts . 
 The FVdG , on the other hand , was the only labor organization in the country which refused to participate in the Burgfrieden . The union held that war @-@ time patriotism was incompatible with proletarian internationalism and that war could only bring greater exploitation of labor . ( Indeed , the average real wage fell by 55 percent during the war . ) While the mainstream labor movement was quick to agree with the state that Russia and the United Kingdom were to blame for igniting the war , the FVdG held that the cause for the war was imperialism and that no blame could be assigned until after the conflict ended . The federation strongly criticized hostility towards foreigners working in Germany , especially Poles and Italians . It also rejected the concepts of the " nation " and national identity invoked in support of the war , claiming that common language , origin and culture ( the foundations of a nation ) did not exist in Germany . The FVdG 's newspapers also declared that the war refuted historical materialism , since the masses had gone to war against their own material interests . 
 After Fritz Kater and Max Winkler reaffirmed syndicalist antimilitarism in the August 5 , 1914 Der Pionier edition , the newspaper was banned . Three days later , Die Einigkeit criticized the SPD 's stance on the war . It was then suppressed as well . The FVdG promptly responded by founding the weekly <unk> . After it was banned in June 1915 , the federation founded the bi @-@ weekly <unk> , which survived until May 1917 . Social Democratic publications on the other hand were allowed by Prussian War Minister Erich von Falkenhayn to be distributed even in the army . In the first days of the war , about 30 FVdG activists in Cologne , Elberfeld , Düsseldorf , Krefeld and other cities were arrested — some remaining under house arrest for two years . The government repression against the FVdG was heavy . While bans were often placed on the union 's regular meetings , authorities in Düsseldorf even banned meetings of the syndicalist choir . Another problem for the union was that many of its members were conscripted . Half of the Berlin construction workers , the federation 's largest union , were forced to serve in the army . In some places , all FVdG members were called into service . 
 Although the FVdG insisted that the " goal is everything and ... must be everything " ( a play on Bernstein 's formula that " the final goal , whatever it may be , is nothing to me : the movement is everything " ) , it was unable to do much more than keep its own structures alive during World War I. Immediately after the declaration of war , FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail . Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general , industrial action was not possible except for a few minor cases ( most notably resistance by the carpenters ' union to Sunday work ) . The FVdG also received support from abroad . The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando <unk> , an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT , the Dutch NAS , as well as Spanish , Swedish , and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war . 
 As the Great War progressed , war exhaustion in Germany grew . The first strikes in the country since the start of the war broke out in 1915 , steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude . The unions ' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials , and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members . Correspondingly , the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war . The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people 's desire for peace . The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike ( which they had been advocating for years ) played in the revolution . They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the <unk> had been banned by the time it broke out . 
 = = November Revolution and re @-@ founding as FAUD = = 
 Some claim that the FVdG influenced strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918 , but the organization was not re @-@ established on a national level until December 1918 . On December 14 , Fritz Kater started publishing Der <unk> ( The Syndicalist ) in Berlin as a replacement for Die Einigkeit . On December 26 and 27 , a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin . The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti @-@ state and internationalist principles . The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the National Assembly . 
 In Spring 1919 , Karl Roche wrote a new platform for the FVdG entitled " Was <unk> die <unk> ? <unk> , <unk> und Wege der ' <unk> Vereinigung deutscher <unk> ' " ( " What Do the Syndicalists Want ? The Program , Goals , and Means of the ' Free Association of German Trade Unions ' " ) . In addition to reiterating pre @-@ war ideas and slogans , it went further by criticizing participation in electoral democracy , claiming that this handicapped and confused proletarian class struggle . The platform also called for the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat , a position which was designed to reach out to the newly formed Communist Party ( KPD ) and International Communists of Germany . In late 1918 and early 1919 , the FVdG became an important player in the strike movement in the Ruhr region ( which mostly involved miners ) . Its organizers , most notably Carl <unk> , became regular speakers at workers ' demonstrations . On April 1 , a general strike supported by the FVdG , the KPD and the Independent Social Democratic Party ( USPD ) began . The strike eventually involved up to 75 percent of the region 's miners until it was violently suppressed in late April by the SPD @-@ led government . After the strike and the ensuing collapse of the General Miners ' Union , the FVdG expanded its unions rapidly and independently of the aforementioned political parties , especially in the Ruhr region . This led to a massive expansion in FVdG membership . The FVdG 's criticism of the bureaucratic centralized trade unions , its advocation of direct action , and its low membership dues were received well by the workers in the Ruhr region . By August 1919 , the federation had around 60 @,@ 000 members throughout Germany . However , its Ruhr miners ' unions left the craft unionist scheme the FVdG had traditionally been organized by behind , preferring simpler industrial structures . 
 The end of cooperation between the FVdG and the political parties in the Ruhr region was part of a nationwide trend after Paul Levi , an anti @-@ syndicalist , became chairman of the KPD in March . Moreover , Rudolf Rocker , a communist anarchist and follower of Kropotkin , joined the FVdG in March 1919 . He returned via The Netherlands in November 1918 after living in exile in London , where he had been active in the Jewish anarchist scene . Augustin Souchy , more of a Landauer @-@ esque anarchist , also joined the federation in 1919 . Both rapidly gained influence in the organization and — as anti @-@ Marxists — were opposed to close collaboration with communists . 
 Nevertheless , the FVdG 's Rhineland and Westphalia section merged with left communist unions to form the Free Workers ' Union ( FAU ) in September 1919 . Syndicalists from the FVdG were the biggest and most dominant faction in the FAU . The FAU 's statutes mostly reflected compromises by the federation 's member unions , but also reflected the FVdG 's significant influence . 
 Soon it was decided to complete the merger in Rhineland and Westphalia on a national level . The FVdG 's 12th congress , held December 27 to 30 , became the Free Workers ' Union of Germany 's ( FAUD ) founding congress . Most left communists ( including the influential veteran member Karl Roche ) had already quit or were in the process of leaving the FAU in Rhineland and Westphalia by this point . The majority of them would join the General Workers ' Union of Germany ( <unk> ) , which was founded in February 1920 . Without the left communists to oppose its adoption , Rocker 's thoroughly anarchist " <unk> des <unk> " ( " Declaration of Syndicalist Principles " ) , which the Business Commission had charged him with drafting , became the FAUD 's platform without much controversy . The FAUD also rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat and other Marxist terms and ideas . According to the Business Commission , the congress was attended by 109 delegates representing 111 @,@ 675 workers , twice as many as were claimed just four and a half months earlier .

 Eric Henry <unk> Burhop , FRS ( 31 January 1911 – 22 January 1980 ) was an Australian physicist and humanitarian . 
 A graduate of the University of Melbourne , Burhop was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford . Under the supervision of Mark Oliphant , he investigated nuclear fusion . He produced a non @-@ relativistic theory of the Auger effect in 1935 , followed by a relativistic treatment the following year . He later wrote a monograph on the subject . He returned to the University of Melbourne as a lecturer in 1936 , and helped Professor Thomas Laby build up the physics department there . 
 During the Second World War he worked in the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney , where he produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron . In September 1942 , he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory , where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons for radar sets . In May 1944 , he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project , which created the first atomic bombs . 
 In early 1945 , Harrie Massey offered Burhop a position as a lecturer in the Mathematics Department at University College , London . He fostered international cooperation in nuclear physics . As part of a five @-@ nation study of K mesons and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years , his group produced a wealth of new results , including the first observation of a double lambda <unk> . He spent a year on secondment to CERN , as secretary of a committee that recommended the construction of the Intersecting Storage Rings and the Super Proton Synchrotron . In 1974 and 1975 , an international team under his leadership carried out a successful search for the Λ + 
 c ( charmed lambda baryon ) . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Eric Henry <unk> Burhop was born in Hobart , Tasmania , on 31 January 1911 , the third child of two Salvation Army officers , Henry Augustus Burhop and his wife Bertha née Head . He had two older sisters , Edna and Vera . His family was not wealthy , and they moved frequently owing to the nature of his parents ' evangelical work . The family moved to Ballarat in 1923 , where he attended Ballarat High School for most of his secondary education , receiving his leaving ( Year 11 ) certificate in 1926 . He transferred to Melbourne High School for his final year . 
 Burhop won a scholarship , and entered the University of Melbourne in 1928 . He initially studied civil engineering , but switched to science after two years , and majored in physics . In 1929 , he was awarded a bursary that provided financial assistance . He graduated in 1931 with a bachelor of science BSc degree with first class honours in physics . He then earned a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) , also with first class honours , in mathematics in 1932 , and a master of science in physics in 1933 . 
 For a master 's research problem , Professor Thomas Laby had Burhop investigate the probability K shell ionisation by electron impact by measuring the intensity of the resultant X @-@ ray emissions . This aroused an interest in the Auger effect , a subject in which he would later become an authority . By contrast , his master 's thesis on " The Band Spectra of Diatomic Molecules " had little influence on his later work . 
 = = Cavendish Laboratory = = 
 The thesis was good enough , though , for Burhop to be awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to study at Cambridge University 's Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford in 1933 . The scholarship included a first @-@ class ticket to London on the liner RMS Oronsay . At this time the Cavendish Laboratory was one of the leading centres of physics in the world . In 1932 , Cavendish laboratory scientists John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the atomic nucleus , James Chadwick discovered the neutron , and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini confirmed the existence of the positron . Burhop was supervised by a fellow Australian , Mark Oliphant . He was initially assigned a task of investigating the diffusion of positive alkali metal ions on hot metal surfaces , but soon switch to a more interesting subject , the measurement of the excitation function for the pairs of deuterons producing a triton through nuclear fusion :

 1D + 2 
 1D → 3 
 <unk> + p 
 Burhop was able to observe the reaction at energies of less than 8 keV . He continued his investigations of X @-@ rays and the Auger effect . He conducted investigation of the probabilities of the ionisation of the K and L shells of silver , using the Born approximation . In 1935 , he produced a non @-@ relativistic theory of the Auger effect . This followed by a relativistic treatment in 1936 with Harrie Massey , another Australian expatriate fellow at the Cavendish . His work on the Auger effect would culminate in a monograph , The Auger Effect and Other <unk> Transitions ( 1952 ) . 
 Before coming to Cambridge , Burhop had not engaged in political activities . At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe . While he rejected his parents ' faith in favour of rationalist science , he did not reject their values , especially that of compassion for others , and there was no estrangement between them . At Cambridge he embraced socialism , and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society , one that included fighting fascism . 
 = = University of Melbourne = = 
 Burhop returned to Australia in 1936 , taking up a position as a lecturer at the University of Melbourne , where Laby was eager to build up the Physics Department by adding expertise in the latest developments in nuclear physics . He married his fiancée , Winifred Ida Stevens , on 23 December 1936 in a Salvation Army ceremony . They had a daughter and two sons . He completed his Cambridge doctor of philosophy ( PhD ) degree under Laby 's supervision in 1938 . It was in three parts : " The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell , with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron " ; " Some problems in atomic disintegration " ; and " Note on the migration of atoms on a surface " . Burhop established the first research program in the field in an Australian university , employing scientific equipment that he brought back from Britain . The centrepiece of the research effort was a 300 keV accelerator that produced a homogeneous neutron beam , which he commissioned in August 1939 . He gave lectures on modern physics to the undergraduates , and on quantum mechanics to the postgraduates . 
 After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions , particularly <unk> mirrors for aerial photography . In February 1942 , Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney . Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942 . Their magnetron was based on an overseas design , but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia . In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory , an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory , where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models . Eventually , over 2 @,@ 000 radar sets were produced in Australia .

 In January 1944 , Oliphant had Sir David Rivett , the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research , release Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project , the Allied effort to create atomic bombs . In May 1944 , Burhop joined Oliphant 's British Mission at the Ernest Lawrence 's Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley . He was one of three Australian physicists working on the Manhattan Project , all at Berkeley , the others being Oliphant and Massey . The Radiation Laboratory 's task was to develop an electromagnetic isotope separation process . Burhop worked with David Bohm in Massey 's Theoretical Group , studying the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields , today known as Bohm diffusion . They also studied the ionisation of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride ( <unk> ) and uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) . Burhop 's work involved the occasional visit to the Manhattan Project 's Y @-@ 12 electromagnetic faculty at Oak Ridge , Tennessee . 
 = = University College , London = = 
 In early 1945 , Massey offered Burhop a position as a lecturer at University College , London , in the Mathematics Department , of which Massey was the departmental head . He had to wait until he was released by the University of Melbourne , and did not reach London until after the war ended in August 1945 . His wife and family , who had stayed in Australia while he was working in the United States , joined him in London some months later . Living and working conditions in London were much worse than in California or Australia . Wartime shortages persisted , and the college had suffered bombing damage , so the Mathematics Department were located in temporary quarters . He was promoted to reader in 1949 . Massey became head of the Physics Department in 1950 , and Burhop moved there too . He became a professor in 1960 , and Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1967 . 
 Burhop listed " furtherance of international scientific cooperation " as one of his hobbies . He worked with the University of Edinburgh and the University of Padua to establish a high @-@ altitude cloud chamber on <unk> that commenced operation in 1953 . In 1957 , he collaborated with Occhialini and C. F. Powell on a five @-@ nation study of K mesons and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years , and produced a wealth of new results , including the first observation of a double lambda <unk> . He spent the 1962 – 63 academic year on secondment to CERN , and was secretary of a committee chaired by Edoardo Amaldi that drew up its policy for accelerator development . The machines the committee recommended , the Intersecting Storage Rings and the Super Proton Synchrotron ( SPS ) were built , and became an important part of physics research in Europe for decades to come . 
 When Burhop took charge of the Bubble Chamber Group at University College in 1967 , he was quick to grasp the advantages of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions , and steered the group towards participation in joint European ventures , using the <unk> . The group 's discovery of neutral currents in 1973 was a milestone on the road to the theoretical unification of electromagnetism with the weak force . In 1974 and 1975 , with the help of Robert R. Wilson , the director of the Fermilab in the United States , an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop 's leadership carried out a search for a new particle , the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963 . He had suggested that neutrino interactions could create short @-@ lived ( perhaps as low as 10 − 14 s ) particles that could be detected with the use of nuclear emulsion . Experiment <unk> at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10 − 13 s . A follow @-@ up experiment <unk> with the SPS confirmed the existence of the Λ + 
 c ( charmed lambda baryon ) , with a flight time of 7 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 1 x 10 − 13 s . 
 = = Social activism = = 
 The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ( ASIO ) opened a file on Burhop in 1948 , believing him to be a secret member of the Communist Party , and an associate of Ian Milner , who was known through Venona intercepts to have passed secret documents to the Soviet Union . In July 1951 , the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer to travel to the Soviet Union . A new passport was issued after he gave the Foreign Secretary a written assurance that he would not seek to travel to the Soviet Union or other Iron Curtain countries . 
 Like many scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project , Burhop was concerned about the dangers of nuclear weapons , and addressed over 500 public meetings to raise awareness of the subject . He had been a founding member of the Australian Association of Scientific Workers in 1939 , and after the war became chairman of the Atomic Science Committee of the Association of Scientific Workers , and a member of its Science Policy Committee , in Britain . In this capacity he helped organise the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957 . He founded the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in 1969 . He was president of his local branch of the Association of University Teachers from 1970 to 1972 , and of the World Federation of Scientific Workers from 1971 to 1980 . 
 Over the years Burhop received a number of honours and awards . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1963 , and delivered its Rutherford Memorial Lecture in 1979 . He was elected a Foreign Member of the German Democratic Republic 's Academy of Sciences in 1971 . He received the Joliot @-@ Curie Medal of Peace in 1965 , the Lenin Peace Prize in 1972 , and the Bulgarian Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 1973 . 
 Burhop retired in 1978 . He died in Camden , London , from empyema as a result of stomach cancer on 22 January 1980 . He was survived by his wife and children . His papers are in the University College , London , Special Collections .

 " Asking 4 It " is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her third studio album , This Is What the Truth Feels Like ( 2016 ) . The song features guest vocals from American rapper Fetty Wap . It was released on March 18 , 2016 , as the ninth track on This Is What the Truth Feels Like by Interscope Records . The track was written by Stefani , Justin Tranter , Julia Michaels , Tor Hermansen , Mikkel Eriksen , and Fetty Wap . The track 's production was handled by Stargate , while additional production was made by Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. 
 Musically , " Asking 4 It " is a hip hop and trap influenced track , made clear especially in Fetty Wap 's rap verse . Lyrically , the song discusses someone 's doubts while in a relationship , presumably Stefani referring to her recent divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale . Upon release , " Asking 4 It " received mixed reviews from music critics . Some critics labeled the song as " trippy " and a " club stomper " , while others called it " dated " and questioned its " awkward " placement on the album . 
 = = Background and release = = 
 Shortly after the lukewarm response to singles " Baby Don 't Lie " and " Spark the Fire " , Stefani scrapped any material worked on for her then upcoming third studio album . Stefani 's record label , Interscope Records , approached her to consider the idea of working with new songwriters and producers , such as Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter , to which she agreed . During her recording sessions with Michaels and Tranter , Stefani became interested in working with new collaborators . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Stefani felt that Fetty Wap had " a voice with so much character " , so she subsequently told her team that she wanted to collaborate with him . In the same interview , Stefani stated she was surprised the collaboration even happened due to scheduling conflicts concerning Fetty Wap : 
 It was tough getting him into the studio , though . They got me [ studio ] dates , and then I was like , ' I 'm working with Fetty this week ! ' Then I went in , and nope , he doesn 't show . Day Two and nope , he doesn 't show . Day Three and nope , he doesn 't show . I wrote a song for us while I was in the studio and I sent it to him , and nope , no response . It was a miracle it happened . 
 " Asking 4 It " was written by Stefani , Justin Tranter , Julia Michaels , Tor Hermansen , Mikkel Eriksen , and Fetty Wap . It was produced by Stargate , while additional production was handled by Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. The track was mixed by Mark " Spike " Stent , while Mike Anderson and Miles Walker handled recording and tracking . Fetty Wap is the only featured artist on the album . On February 12 , 2016 , This Is What the Truth Feels Like became available for pre @-@ order on iTunes Store . Nearly a month later , " Asking 4 It " became available for purchase on March 18 , along with the rest of the album .

 " Asking 4 It " has been described as a hip hop and trap song , backed by a rapped verse by Fetty Wap , with a length of three minutes and thirty seconds . A writer for <unk> described " Asking 4 It " as a " bopping , hip hop tinged beat flecked with dancey synths . " Chris <unk> of Complex described the inclusion of Fetty Wap as Stefani " call [ ing ] upon one modern @-@ day hit maker " , while Clara Hudson of The Daily Free Press called this move " gimmicky " . Lyrically , " Asking 4 It " discusses several topics , including a lover 's doubts while in a relationship ; Stefani sings " You 're giving me truth and it 's such an unfamiliar subject " , which ET Online described as " a sultry take on the uncertainty of a new romance . " 
 The song was inspired by her divorce from Bush lead singer , Gavin Rossdale ; Stefani wrote several songs during these recording sessions to start " a new chapter in her life " . In an interview with Today 's Matt Lauer , Stefani stated that the majority of her recent studio work would discuss her breakup with Rossdale . Billboard stated that the lyrics " Are you sure you wanna love me ? / I know that it 's a lot to handle me / But it is what it is / It 's all part of my broken history " were " ultra personal " . In his description of the track , Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that " ' Asking 4 It ' strikes at the heart of pop radio " while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media described " Asking 4 It " as " the album 's sole feature atop an unconvincing beat . " Nicholaus James <unk> of Reporter felt that the album 's " sound cools down a little " , but that the track " is still easy to dance to " .

 Upon release , " Asking 4 It " received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics . In a highly positive review , Leonie Cooper of NME praised Stefani for her " nonchalant divorcée swagger " on the track , later calling " Asking 4 It " a standout track on the album . Similarly , Mesfin Fekadu of The Washington Post called the track a " high point " . Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times favored the track , labeling it as " trippy " . Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Leah Greenblatt dubbed " Asking 4 It " as a " come @-@ on disguised as [ a ] caution " ; Greenblatt further praised the song for being a " stomper " . 
 In a negative review of " Asking 4 It " , Sal Cinquemani of Slant called the track " dated " and " no more worthy of Stefani 's emotional exorcism than 2014 's stale ' Spark the Fire ' " . Emily Blake of Mashable thought that " Asking 4 It " was " an out @-@ of @-@ place hip @-@ hop track " , while Jordan Miller of BreatheHeavy felt that the song was " vulnerable " and unfavorably predicted that it will " probably become a single " in the future . Daniel Bromfield of Pretty Much Amazing panned " Asking 4 It " but enjoyed Fetty Wap 's contribution to the track ; Bromfield thought " it 's tragic how completely [ Fetty Wap ] upstages Stefani " and how Fetty Wap showed emotion during his verse while Stefani did not .

 = Flynn Rider = 
 Flynn Rider ( born Eugene Fitzherbert ) is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios ' 50th animated feature film Tangled , and its short film Tangled Ever After . The character is voiced by American actor Zachary Levi , who decided to audition for the role upon learning that he would also be providing the character 's singing voice . Levi 's duet with singer and co @-@ star Mandy Moore , " I See the Light " , would go on to become the actor 's first professionally recorded song and musical debut . 
 Loosely based on the prince in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale " Rapunzel " , Flynn is a wanted thief who seeks refuge in Rapunzel 's tower after stealing a crown . <unk> by Rapunzel into taking her to see the kingdom 's floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday , Flynn undergoes a change of heart as he gradually begins to fall in love with Rapunzel . Created by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard because they felt that the incarcerated Rapunzel needed someone to escort her out of the tower , Flynn was conceived as a thief as opposed to a traditional prince in favor of having him resemble a funnier and edgier character . Originally written as a British farmer , Flynn was ultimately developed into a swashbuckling thief based on fictional characters Han Solo and Indiana Jones . Actors Errol Flynn , whose surname also serves as the character 's first in homage , and Gene Kelly also influenced the character 's personality . 
 Flynn has ultimately divided film critics , garnering a mixed reception . While some reviewers enjoyed the character 's refreshing humor , rebelliousness and sarcasm in comparison to traditional Disney princes , others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious , while panning his narration . Additionally , Flynn has also been strongly accused of being a marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled . However , both the character 's romantic comedy @-@ esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi 's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim . Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair , E ! and Cosmopolitan . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Filmmaker Walt Disney himself had first attempted to adapt the Brothers Grimm fairy tale " Rapunzel " into a feature @-@ length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s . However , the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too " small . " When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008 , directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided that it would be best " to blow up the scale of the film " and transform it into a " big event " , while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience . Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that " Rapunzel needed to get out [ of the tower ] ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she 's going . " In the original fairy tale , Rapunzel 's love interest is a prince . However , Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed " a subtle yet startling twist for Disney " by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too " safe " , opting for a funnier and " edgier " character instead , while identifying Flynn as an antihero . Greno elaborated , " When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... a lot of them are kind of soft and they 're not like people we think are that cool , " continuing , " They 're good guys , so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme . " However , some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy . Greno revealed that " There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors , ' Well , it 's not a prince it 's a thief . He 's kind of a ladies ' man , and he 's very arrogant . ' " Greno summarized Flynn 's conception and development to Orange : 
 When we were putting it together and trying to figure out who Flynn Rider was in this movie , we looked at a bunch of different sources ... When you look back at some of the past Disney princes or something , a lot of them are kind of soft and they 're not like people we think are that cool , I guess . They 're good guys , so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme . We like cocky , arrogant sort of characters , and I think there were people in our building that were a little worried because we were up in the story room and they were hearing these rumours of , well , it 's not a prince , it 's a thief , and he 's kind of a ladies ' man and he 's very arrogant ... But , I think the trick is when you 're creating a character like that , if you have this cocky character , you have to hit him over the head with a frying pan a dozen times or something , and he needs to kind of pay for being that way . Those characters , if they 're done right , can be so funny . On the flip side , if they 're not done right , they can be really off putting . 
 Originally , Flynn was conceived as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast . The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly , and Star Wars character Han Solo , among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired . Greno explained that " Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin , especially in contrast to Rapunzel , who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower . So she has a very limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy . " The film 's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender @-@ neutral Tangled is due in part to Flynn 's role and involvement . First observing that the Disney tradition is " to name the movie after the Princess , " the directors had initially thought that the film " would be structured like Cinderella where there 's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while . " This changed , however , as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character . Howard explained that " When Nathan and I figured out that this film was really about two characters , Flynn and Rapunzel , we knew that changing the title would be a good idea . " Meanwhile , the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel , and antagonist Mother Gothel . Additionally , Flynn also narrates the film , providing it with " an ironic counterpoint , " according to Children 's Literature and Learner Empowerment : Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland . As " an example of first @-@ person voice @-@ over narration , " Flynn 's narration " compels the viewer to identify empathetically with " Flynn and Rapunzel . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Greno and Howard were not particularly interested in casting solely A @-@ list actors as the voices of main characters Flynn and Rapunzel . Instead , the directors simply searched for actors who had " the right voice " for these characters . Writing for ReelViews , film critic James Berardinelli felt that the directors ' decision mirrored " Disney 's approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s , when big name stars were often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents . " Hundreds of actors and singers auditioned and were considered for the role of Rapunzel 's love interest , among them comedian Dan <unk> and American Idol alum Clay Aiken . However , the role of Flynn Rider was ultimately won by American actor Zachary Levi because he , according to Greno , " nailed " his audition . Levi auditioned for the role after he first received a telephone call from his agent informing him about the film . Identifying himself as " a huge Disney nut , " Levi was immediately " sold " on the project . His interest was further cemented by the fact that he would also be providing the character 's singing voice . Additionally , Levi appears to have a history playing male " characters who are surrounded by tough , strong women . " Required to audition a song in the style of a singer @-@ songwriter , Levi decided to perform James Taylor 's " Sweet Baby James " for the directors . 
 When Levi was first cast as the voice of Flynn , the character had been scripted as a British farmer at the time , requiring Levi to voice him with a British accent until Flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an American accent . Although Flynn and Rapunzel share several scenes together during the film , Levi and singer Mandy Moore , his co @-@ star who provides the voice of Rapunzel , recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts , which Levi cited as one of the challenges he endured while working on the film , in addition to having to star in the television series Chuck simultaneously . Levi 's starring role on Chuck required the actor to constantly " shed a character and take on another character and shed that character and then go back to something else . " However , Levi and Moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet " I See the Light " , Levi was not intimidated by the thought of recording the song , describing the experience as " an added bonus . " However , he admitted to having been nervous to sing with Moore , a professional singer , and working with composer Alan Menken . Although the actor identifies himself as " no stranger to singing " due to his background in musical theatre , Levi 's performance of " I See the Light " is considered to be his " big singing debut " because it was his first time recording a song professionally . 
 It took Levi approximately one year to record all of his dialogue due in part to his busy schedule . Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time , recording each of his lines at least twice . The actor 's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn 's character . Howard explained , " He 's so smart and clever , and his adlibs are so great , and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn . " On Levi 's own influence on his character , the actor explained that Flynn 's " voice was really just a slight variation of [ his ] own . " Wanting to sound " more appropriate " for the film 's medieval setting , Levi " cleaned up [ his ] own diction and made things a little bit more polished , " referring to Flynn 's accent as Mid @-@ Atlantic . Describing Tangled as a " very family friendly " version of Romancing the Stone ( 1984 ) , Levi studied and channelled the film 's star , American actor Michael Douglas , and English legend Robin Hood . However , when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film 's release , the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance , explaining , " I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up , " likening the experience to hearing one 's voice played back on an answering machine .

 Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to be funny and sarcastic as opposed to snarky . One occasion in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel 's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence . The directors did not like this because , according to Greno , Flynn " did this reaction where [ he ] treated her like she 's nuts . " Although both directors agreed that Flynn 's reaction was funny , Greno and Howard wanted the characters to " connect " emotionally during this scene . Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is " at his best ... when he 's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them , " likening him to English actor Cary Grant . Fogelman concluded , " At his heart , he 's really kind of a lost soul who doesn 't quite know what he wants and who he is . " Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters , like Flynn , " are skilled but have a human side to them . " Flynn is considered an antihero because " He is quick @-@ witted and agile , stealing to survive " and " he is also extremely narcissistic . " 
 Originally , the character resembled a " <unk> leading man , " described by Greno as " a muscular commoner / farm boy . " However , the directors had always envisioned Flynn as " a dashing thief . " To assist with the development of Flynn 's design , Howard and Greno held a large meeting with thirty of Tangled 's female employees . Calling it the " Hot Man Meeting , " the employees were encouraged to " bring in pictures of their favorite hunky men . " The Hot Man Meeting was created because the directors , who found that they were very much impressed with Rapunzel 's design , felt that " Flynn [ needed ] to be up to [ Rapunzel 's ] level . " Greno described the Hot Man Meeting as " crazy , " elaborating , " Photos of all the hottest men in Hollywood [ were ] being thrown around a room . Photos being torn in half and pasted back together . Eyes were ripped from one picture and put on another . Heads were torn from photos , " concluding , " I 've never seen anything like it . " Howard cited American actor Clark Gable and English footballer David Beckham among several celebrities by whom Flynn was influenced during the meeting , joking that the employees eventually " started using Nathan and me as examples of what not to do . " 
 Defending Flynn 's personality , Levi explained that " Deep down , Flynn has a good core , although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity , love and naiveté of Rapunzel . " The actor concluded that " These are two very different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure . " According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune , Flynn " teaches [ Rapunzel ] about courage . " Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character 's relationship with Rapunzel as a " partners @-@ in @-@ crime sort of chemistry , filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own . " Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name , Eugene Fitzherbert , which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After : ( Analyzing ) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as " more humane . " Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn " a charismatic bad boy , " comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks ' Sinbad : Legend of the Seven Seas ( 2003 ) . Similarly , The New York Times ' Brooks Barnes felt that " Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney , and Flynn ... is glib in a way that many people now associate with DreamWorks . " On Flynn 's thievery , Entertainment Weekly 's Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character " only steals because he 's basically a nice @-@ guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities . " According to Tison Pugh , author of The Disney Middle Ages : A Fairy @-@ Tale and Fantasy Past , Flynn " amalgamates the comedy @-@ action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn , layering them over a fairy @-@ tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film 's setting , " while serving as a source of comic relief at times . Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries " most of the [ film 's ] modern humor . " Likewise , Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film 's " main source of action , humour and , eventually , romance . "

 Flynn debuted in Tangled ( 2010 ) as a sought @-@ after bandit who discovers refuge in Rapunzel 's secluded tower after stealing a crown . There the character is blackmailed by Rapunzel , who seizes the crown in order to convince Flynn to guide her to the floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday , while Mother Gothel , her vain , controlling guardian , is absent . Flynn is pursued by a police horse named Maximus ; the vengeful Stabbington Brothers , two former accomplices of his ; and Gothel , who grows increasingly obsessed with retrieving Rapunzel in order to continue using her hair to grant her eternal life . Meanwhile , Flynn falls in love with Rapunzel and undergoes a change of heart , only to be apprehended by the Stabbington Brothers , who hand him over to the officials , who sentence him to death . Maximus helps him escape and return to Rapunzel 's tower in time to cut her hair , which in turn kills Gothel . By falling in love with Rapunzel , Flynn undergoes a dramatic change of heart ; he stops thieving and returns to using his birth name , Eugene . 
 Eugene later appears in the short film Tangled Ever After , that features his marriage with Rapunzel . 
 Eugene will also appear in the upcoming television series .

 Flynn has received generally mixed reviews from film critics . Kirk Baird of The Blade described the character as irresistible , while Columbus Alive 's Brad Keefe called him " loveable . " Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as " a hero invested with enough colour to liven up what could have been a monochromatic role . " Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is " better than a prince . " Meanwhile , Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes , writing , " If anything , Tangled is <unk> — one more step forward in Disney 's slow march to treat male suitors like equals , from its early nameless princes ... to here , a dude with a full @-@ on personality and nearly equal screen time . " Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that " Flynn talks in a laid @-@ back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable . " Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although " Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin , Mowgli and the Beast . " Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn . Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a " fop , " while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him " bland . " The Scotsman wrote , " it 's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel 's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from " the film . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn " a second @-@ rate Nickelodeon TV punk . " Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not " all that heroic . " The Houston Chronicle 's Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn 's " sensitive chin fur , and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth – makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam . " The Los Angeles Times <unk> Turan believes that the film 's " initial shakiness " is " amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of " Flynn . Accusing the character of " lacking both superficial and emotional individuality , " Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as " rather obnoxious , " Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as " vanilla . " Flynn 's narration has also been widely panned . Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch referred to it as " flippant . " A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as " annoyingly smart @-@ alecky . " Justin Chang of Variety described the character 's opening monologue as " clunky . " William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to " a modern @-@ day Chris Evans / Pine type , and his glib narration – combined with a hasty prologue – almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys ' AND girls ' club . " However , Goss relented , " The voice @-@ over tapers off , though , and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest . " 
 Meanwhile , critics lauded the character 's relationship and chemistry with Rapunzel enthusiastically , likening it to that of a romantic comedy . Writing for the Mountain Xpress , Ken Hanke felt that " what works best is the interplay between the two leads , " concluding , " these animated characters are frankly more believable and charismatic than the human ones in ... Love and Other Drugs . " Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the characters ' " relationship is built on mutual respect and trust , something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies . " The Miami Herald 's Rene Rodriquez opined , " Even though they may seem to be boilerplate fairy @-@ tale heroes , you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together , " while Joe Neumaier of the Daily News simply called their relationship " cute . " Ted Fry of The Seattle Times wrote , " The back @-@ and @-@ forth banter of what inevitably becomes a courtship is consistently witty and given extra sparkle from adroit characterizations by Moore and Levi . " Similarly , Cathy Jakicic , writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , opined , " Moore and Levi , meanwhile , breathe new life into the classic love @-@ hate romance . " Colin Covert of the Star Tribune felt that both " characters are equally strong and funny . " Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the characters ' relationship makes the film " engaging . " BuzzFeed author Arielle Calderon compiled " 19 Reasons Rapunzel And Flynn Rider Are The Best Disney Couple " , citing their meeting and opposite personalities among them . Babble.com ranked Flynn and Rapunzel among the " Top 10 Cutest Disney Couples " . 
 Levi 's performance has garnered widespread acclaim from critics , who enjoyed the actor 's comedic delivery and singing voice . Praising the directors ' decision to " [ bypass ] big @-@ name stars in favor of lesser @-@ known talent , " TV Guide described Levi 's performance as " charming , roguish , and , well , generic enough . " Similarly , Mike Scott of The Times @-@ Picayune wrote that Levi " comes off as an exaggerated , narcissistic version of the rascally Tory <unk> from TV 's MythBusters , " complimenting the fact that " the cast 's names are less than household stature . " Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi 's performance as " terrific . " ABC Online appreciated the fact that " the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable , " concluding , " Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do a really good job on the voices . " Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi " creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a heart of gold Flynn pop on the screen . " Hucks went on to call Flynn " one the better [ Disney heroes ] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while . " Mathew <unk> of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi 's " quick @-@ tongued delivery , " while Rolling Stone <unk> Travers wrote that the actor " does a nice job " as Flynn . James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore " adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters , " while Digital Spy 's Simon Reynolds described Levi as " excellent as the <unk> hero . " Stephen Whitty of The Star @-@ Ledger called Levi " a surprisingly perfect choice for the self @-@ mocking Flynn . " Also pleasantly surprised , David Nusair of About.com wrote that " Levi effortlessly captures the character 's transformation from a vain ( yet charismatic ) rogue to a compassionate love interest . " Praising the actor 's singing voice , Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as " impressive . " 
 Flynn is often regarded as one of Disney 's most attractive heroes . In 2012 , Vanity Fair conducted a poll for which readers were asked to vote for the sexiest Disney hero of all @-@ time . Pairing Flynn against Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid , Flynn beat his competition by less than one percent , garnering 50 @.@ 35 percent of the total votes . E ! ranked the character third in its article " The Definitive Ranking of Disney Princes Based on Overall Dating Eligibility " . Writing for Seventeen , YouTube personality Tyler Oakley ranked Flynn the sixth most " dateable " Disney prince . Oakley joked , " I like a man who is <unk> himself , " continuing , " If you gotta go around with a fake name ... then you 're simply not on my level . " BuzzFeed author Louis <unk> ranked Flynn the fourth most attractive Disney prince , praising the character 's hair and eyebrows in 2013 . BuzzFeed also ranked Flynn second on the website 's list of the " Top Ten Hottest Male Cartoon Characters " , calling him a " bad boy with a heart of gold . "

 Critics harshly criticized the film 's controversial change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled . Holding Flynn 's role and characterization partially responsible for it , they accused the character of being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film 's trailers . Writing for the Los Angeles Times , Dawn C. <unk> observed that Tangled 's marketing campaign involved " amp [ ing ] up the role of the dashing Errol Flynn @-@ styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden @-@ haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story . " Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as " an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater . " One of the film 's trailers features Flynn " trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her ' the smolder ' " while " <unk> [ ing Flynn 's ] ... action components ... over the more girl @-@ oriented fairy tale stuff , " according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine . Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was " obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie . " Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film 's marketing and the idea that " The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy ... whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside . " Referring to the film 's title as " idiotic , " Matt Neal of the Standard @-@ Examiner wrote , " Disney claims it changed the film 's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider 's role in the film ... but that title @-@ change excuse doesn 't fly . " The Daily Mail 's Chris Tookey felt that Flynn 's narration " feels wrong , " describing it " as a commercially calculated move to reassure males in the audience that the film won 't be too ' girly ' . " Similarly , A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a " hijacking of a princess 's tale , " panning the character as " a crude commercial calculation , a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren 't going to be too girly , or to <unk> that the studio can bring some DreamWorks @-@ style attitude . " Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn 's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities , specifically to " take Ken 's role as [ Barbie 's ] male arm candy . " 
 Empire 's Helen O 'Hara defended Disney 's claim " that the new title reflects the fact that [ Tangled ] is very much a two @-@ hander , with Mandy Moore 's innocent but ( inevitably ) feisty Rapunzel and Zachary Levi 's street @-@ wise yet clueless Flynn sharing the lead . " O 'Hara went on to argue that both characters " get decent character development too , and base their growing love story on more than a single longing glance . " Todd Hertz of Christianity Today observed that " Disney changed the film 's title and showcased the swashbuckling Aladdin @-@ meets @-@ Robin @-@ Hood character who replaces the original story 's prince , " but felt that " Luckily , these marketing moves don 't compromise Tangled 's phenomenal storytelling or considerable charm . Hertz concluded , " Still , the movie wisely takes a page from Pixar 's playbook to fill the movie with so much well @-@ done slapstick humor , action , goofy characters , and genuine fun that boys won 't feel like the ads gave them the old bait @-@ and @-@ switch to trick them into a ' girl ' movie .

 Substitute teacher Holly Holliday ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) returns to McKinley High to cover sex education classes , and tells Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) , director of the school glee club New Directions , that his club members are among the most ignorant about sex . He asks her to educate them using song , so Holly performs " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " . Will later rehearses a rendition of " Kiss " with her , which culminates in a kiss , but Holly will not go further as she believes she would end up hurting him . 
 Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) , director of rival glee club Aural Intensity , seeks out former New Directions member and current Dalton Academy Warbler Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) to tell him and his friend Blaine ( Darren Criss ) , the Warblers ' lead singer , that New Directions is planning a sexually provocative routine for the upcoming Regionals competition , having heard that the judges will be looking for same . Blaine responds by having the Warblers work up a " <unk> " performance of " Animal " , with Kurt joining him on lead , but Kurt 's " sexy " faces and moves are anything but . Kurt insists on remaining ignorant of sexual matters , which Blaine feels is dangerous at their age , so he visits Kurt 's father , Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) , and prompts him to give Kurt " the talk " about sex . 
 At McKinley , glee club members Puck ( Mark Salling ) and Lauren ( Ashley Fink ) plan to make a sex tape , until Holly informs them that it would be considered child pornography . Puck , appalled , joins the celibacy club . The club 's advisor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) thinks Holly 's lessons are inappropriate , so she arranges for the club to perform a wholesome song for New Directions . She picks " Afternoon Delight " , unaware that the song is about sex . Her husband Carl ( John Stamos ) approaches Holly afterward about counseling . During the counseling session , he reveals that Emma is still a virgin , and Emma admits that she may still have feelings for Will . Carl tells her he will be moving into a hotel until she is certain of her feelings . 
 Holly also counsels glee club members Santana ( Naya Rivera ) and Brittany ( Heather Morris ) when they express confusion about their sexuality . She joins them for a performance of " Landslide " , after which Santana tearfully confesses to Brittany that she is in love with her and wants to be with her , but she is afraid of being bullied and ostracized for being in a same @-@ sex relationship . Brittany reciprocates her love , but explains that she also loves her boyfriend Artie ( Kevin McHale ) and will not break up with him , to Santana 's distress . 
 Lauren is annoyed with Puck for joining the celibacy club , but when he explains that he is trying to take responsibility for his actions , she kisses him and agrees to join too . Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) are secretly back together . Holly 's stint as a sex education instructor ends when parents complain about her classes . She tells Will that she wants to learn about romance ; he offers to teach her , and they kiss .

 " Sexy " marked Paltrow 's second guest appearance on Glee as substitute teacher Holly Holliday . She first appeared earlier in the second season , in the seventh episode , " The Substitute " . The role was devised for her by series co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy , who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the release of the film Country Strong , in which Paltrow plays a country singer . Paltrow was signed to Glee for two episodes , with " The Substitute " originally intended to feature a love quadrangle between Holly , Will , Emma and Carl . Her initial arc was , however , reduced to a single episode . Post @-@ broadcast , Murphy said they both hoped she would appear on Glee again in the future , depending on the right storyline . In January 2011 , Paltrow confirmed that she would be reprising the role . Murphy stated that she would appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen as a sex education teacher , and would serve as a love interest for Will , though she actually appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen . Stamos also reprised his role as Emma 's husband Carl . As of March 2011 , he was unsure whether he would return to Glee again , but stated that he might do so to conclude Emma and Carl 's storyline , explaining : " I think people like me on there , but they really love Will and Emma together . So I don 't know how much longer people can stand Will and Emma not being together . " 
 The episode continued the romantic relationship between Brittany and Santana , first alluded to during the first season . The two kissed on @-@ screen for the first time in the season two episode " Duets " , after which their romance was little explored , leading to what Rivera described as an " uproar " by fans of the pairing in December 2010 . The following month , executive producer Brad Falchuk revealed via the social networking website Twitter that further developments to the storyline had always been intended , with Paltrow 's Holly serving as a catalyst . 
 In addition to Paltrow reprising her role as Holly Holliday , recurring characters who appear on the episode include Stamos as dentist Carl Howell , glee club members Lauren Zizes ( Fink ) , Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) and Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , football coach Shannon Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) and Kurt 's friend Blaine Anderson ( Criss ) . 
 " Sexy " features cover versions of five songs , all of which were released as singles , available for download : " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " by Gary Glitter as recorded by Joan Jett , " Animal " by Neon Trees , " Kiss " by Prince , an acoustic version of " Landslide " by Fleetwood Mac , and " Afternoon Delight " by the Starland Vocal Band . Paltrow performs on " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " , " Kiss " and " Landslide " , all of which feature on the series ' sixth soundtrack album , Glee : The Music , Volume 5 . In the United Kingdom , " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " was omitted from Glee : The Music , Volume 5 , and " Afternoon Delight " , which features Stamos and Salling , was included instead . A cover of Rod Stewart 's " Da Ya Think I 'm Sexy ? " sung by the Warblers was planned to be featured in the episode but did not appear ; " Animal " was the Warblers number performed . Both tracks appear on the seventh soundtrack album , Glee : The Music Presents the Warblers . Neon Trees bassist Branden Campbell recounted how Criss approached the band at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival to thank them for allowing " Animal " to be used , as Criss was the one who brought the song to Murphy 's attention . Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac , who wrote and originated " Landslide " , visited the Glee set on the day the song was filmed .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The episode received a positive response from reviewers . They disagreed over how well Paltrow was used , but generally praised the Brittany – Santana and Kurt – Burt storylines . The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon deemed " Sexy " an episode of mixed messages , one which treated the issues it raised with " an appropriate amount of levity " , but failed to " play the nuances of the [ celibacy vs. sex ] argument as delicately as it probably thought it did . " His Atlantic co @-@ writer Patrick Burns criticized the series for glorifying a risqué subject , " then half @-@ heartedly attempt [ ing ] to hammer home a moral . " Meghan Brown , also writing for The Atlantic , called it a " solid episode with some strong character moments . " Time 's James Poniewozik felt that the episode " began clumsily , lacked subtlety , involved some embarrassing moments " and focused too much on Paltrow , but as it continued , " achieve [ d ] a few moments of delight and honest emotion " . Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times described it as " incredibly comprehensive and enjoyable to boot " , and IGN 's Robert Canning said it " avoided preaching and teaching and instead just had some fun and let guest star Gwyneth Paltrow steal all the scenes " . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that " Glee continues its climb , delicately and successfully marrying actual sex lessons with camp and humor " . 
 Several reviewers preferred Paltrow 's return in " Sexy " to her first appearance in " The Substitute " . The Washington Post 's Emily Yahr felt that she was better integrated into this episode , and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called her return " infinitely better " than her first appearance : " Back then , she was a puzzle , a loony bin . Here , she 's sly and quick @-@ witted , appropriately adult and seductively saucy in an episode that showcased more of her comedic timing , than her stiff dance skills . All the better for us . " Fallon wrote that Paltrow was " if possible , even sassier and sultrier " than before , and felt that she served to anchor a busy episode . In contrast , Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly had mixed feelings about Holly , as she believed that the character dominated screen time . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff liked Paltrow 's acting , but disliked Holly 's interaction with Will , and said they lacked chemistry . Soraya Roberts of the Daily News disliked her return for prolonging Will and Emma 's separation , and commented that while Paltrow 's appearance in " The Substitute " was " relatively fresh " , in " Sexy " she was " acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self , overly enunciating her lines [ and ] treading carefully around her choreography " . Poniewozik found all of Paltrow 's scenes " labored and ridiculous " , and wrote that the actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character . Benigno wondered why Holly appeared to be " the perfect mentor to these sexually confused kids " given that in her previous appearance she was " very fun to be around but not well equipped at all to deal with serious issues " . Canning said that " the moment she came on screen the whole episode lit up " , and the episode was a " fun and funny showcase for everybody 's favorite recurring character " , and Futterman echoed him when she called Paltrow " our new favorite cast member " . 
 The storyline featuring Santana and Brittany was very well received , and the acting was also praised . Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson wrote that Santana 's " fear , her confusion and her journey were all rendered with honesty and even a subtlety rarely exhibited on this show . " Gonzalez was somewhat surprised by the storyline and observed that Santana had not previously been portrayed as " so serious and vulnerable " , but enjoyed the depth it brought to her character . She described Rivera as " heartbreakingly perfect " , and Vanity Fair 's Brett Berk wrote that " Naya Rivera and Heather Morris deserve special praise for the complex way they portray this fraught relationship . " Poniewozik and VanDerWerff highlighted the work by the two actresses in the choir room scene when " Landslide " was being sung , and VanDerWerff described the scene where Santana confessed her feelings for Brittany as " one of the better scenes of the season " , while Poniewozik was impressed that the episode found " pathos and heartbreak " in a coupling formerly treated humorously . Canning , however , felt that Santana 's revelation " could have been built up better " . 
 Although some reviewers , including Yahr and TVLine 's Michael Slezak , were unenthusiastic about Blaine 's visit to Burt to get him to have " the talk " with Kurt , there was widespread praise for the talk itself , which Jen Harper of BuddyTV described as the " best scene " of the episode . Fallon called it " one of the most uncomfortable father – son sex talks ever committed to television ( and thus , really , one of the most realistic ) " , and his colleague Brown said it became " something lovely , open @-@ hearted , and true " . Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch , yet wrote that the scene served to convince her she had " never loved a father @-@ son pair " more . Poniewozik found it realistic and moving , and gave particular praise to O 'Malley for portraying Burt 's " determination and awkwardness in helping his son " , as did Slezak : " his completely grounded performance helps anchor the show in reality " . 
 Burns was incredulous that Emma and Carl had not yet consummated their four @-@ month @-@ old marriage , and criticized their going to a substitute teacher for relationship advice , something that Benigno also found stupid . Slezak and VanDerWerff disliked the episode 's portrayal of Emma , since the recently seen " stronger , less neurotic , and altogether more appealing Emma " , as Slezak put it , was inconsistent with her depiction here . One of the few positive comments was from Canning , who singled out Emma 's ignorance of what an " afternoon delight " actually was . The reviewers were more enthusiastic about the pairing of Puck and Lauren , though somewhat divided . MTV 's Emily Exton called them her " favorite couple of the evening " and cited " the ridiculous logic that they share " . Canning called their scenes " a hoot " , though Benigno said he was " still not buying " the relationship .

 Musical performances in the episode attracted a wide range of commentary , from enthusiastic to dismissive , though one song , " Landslide " , received generally high marks . Brown wrote that all the performances " felt a little lackluster ... though none stood out as being particularly awful " , while Hankinson maintained that the " songs were universally great " . 
 Most reviewers agreed that the performance of " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " was sexy . Benigno was one of these and was entertained by the number , but he thought Holly 's " vocals seem oddly subdued trying to imitate Joan Jett 's voice " and gave it a " B " grade . Gonzalez gave the same grade and also took issue with the vocals , though she enjoyed the energy and Brittany 's dancing . Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman had a different view of the singing , and said that " Holly can 't quite muster Jett 's vocal power " . Berk gave the song four stars out of five and noted the " amazing hairography " , but Roberts called the performance a " leather @-@ clad , hair @-@ whipping mess " . Slezak gave the performance an " A " ; he wrote that Paltrow " completely captured the track 's naughty spirit , and Brittany took it over the top with her bump and grind atop the music @-@ room piano " . 
 The inclusion of " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " in an episode dealing with sex education and adolescent sexuality sparked some controversy , as its original performer and writer , Gary Glitter , is a registered sex offender in the United Kingdom . He has been convicted of several sexual crimes involving minors , including a conviction for possession of child pornography in the UK in 1997 , and his conviction for child sexual abuse in Vietnam in 2005 . Charities dedicated to serving and helping children have filed complaints to Fox and the producers of Glee . Television executives in the UK , where the episode was to be broadcast about a month later than in the US , were rumored to be considering the removal of the scene entirely . However , a spokesperson for Channel 4 stated that the episode would air in full , and explained : " The scene is editorially justified within the programme and we do not seek to censor material in the proper context . " Claude Knights , the executive director of the London @-@ based children 's charity Kidscape , said , " It is regrettable that the producers did not consider the implication of using such a track in the context of a sex education class . The fact that this song is linked to Gary Glitter ... make [ s ] it wholly inappropriate " . The UK edition of Glee : The Music , Volume 5 omits the track ; " Afternoon Delight " is included instead . 
 Though " Afternoon Delight " was variously described as " goofy " by Benigno and " corny " by Gonzalez , it nevertheless was given a generally positive reception . Benigno called the performance " absolutely hilarious " , but characterized the cover as " pretty impressive " , and gave a grade of " A − " . Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was even more enthusiastic : she said it was an " incredible rendition " that she ranked " among the best moments of Glee ever " . Slezak 's grade of " B − " was issued after a strong caveat : " Arrested Development did it better " , and Gonzalez wrote that Stamos was wasted on the performance , which she gave a " C " . Berk cited the " incredible harmonies " when he gave the song four out of five stars . 
 " Animal " received a widely divergent mix of reviews . Harper wrote that the Warblers " did a good job with it but nothing special " , while Hankinson called it " super adorable and fun " and that it " was great to finally see Kurt get to share the spotlight with Blaine " . Flandez was not as pleased by Kurt — or by the Warblers , who he said had ruined the song — and likened his performance to " Jar Jar Binks on acid , with those jerky moves and infantile facial expressions " . Roberts called their version " hokey " , and Slezak said the setting " felt contrived as heck " and gave the song a " D " . Benigno was at the other end of the scale with an " A " grade and the summary that " they completely crush it " , while Gonzalez gave the number an " A + " , deemed it " unforgettable " , praised the " unique song selection " and called it " pure fun " . Futterman described the Warblers as " the loosest they 've been all season " , but characterized the performance as one of their " least successful " because Blaine and Kurt , " two of the series ' most reliable lead singers " , were severely <unk> electronically . Tyler Glenn , lead singer of Neon Trees , said , " I thought it was cool " . 
 There was not much enthusiasm for the performance of " Kiss " . Most reviewers were not impressed with Will 's falsetto : Harper said it made her ears " sad " and Gonzalez said it " really didn 't do it " for her , though she did like the sections in his natural register and gave the performance a " C + " , and Harper noted that " Holly saved the song " for her . Although Futterman said Will " expertly hits the falsetto notes " , she didn 't " feel the chemistry " until the final kiss . Benigno , on the other hand , said that the chemistry between them was " palpable " , called the cover " pretty great " , and gave it a " B + " . Roberts praised the " real sex appeal " Morrison brought to the number , but deemed Paltrow 's tango rigid . Burns commented that white people ought to be deterred from performing Prince . He called the music " uninteresting and soulless " , and was dismayed that the tango was " just white with white people tango dancing " . Flandez , however , enjoyed their dancing and wrote , " The strong holds , the slow cuts , the perfect swivel of hips and the lean @-@ to 's were mesmerizingly seductive . " 
 " Landslide " received the most praise of the songs in the episode ; indeed , both VanDerWerff and Harper named it the episode 's best number . Harper noted the " great harmonies " and added , " I got goose bumps . " Hankinson called the rendition " gorgeous " and Berk used " perfection " ; Berk went above his five star maximum to give the performance six stars . Roberts found the performance " pretty but uninspired " , though Flandez called it " a dreamy , perfectly pitched power song of lesbian love " and Poniewozik " surprisingly poignant " . Benigno and Slezak both noted that the cover was based on the version by the Dixie Chicks , and gave grades of " A − " and " B + " respectively . The " B + " from Gonzalez came with a caveat : she wished that Rivera , rather than Paltrow , had sung the lead vocal because of the meaning the song held for Santana . Stevie Nicks welcomed the cover of " Landslide " , and hoped it would bring the Fleetwood Mac 's songs to a new generation . She approved of the performance , and said that Paltrow " sang it beautifully " .

 = Washington v. Texas = 
 Washington v. Texas , 388 U.S. 14 ( 1967 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution ( guaranteeing the right of a criminal defendant to force the attendance of witnesses for their side ) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts . Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co @-@ defendant as a witness , but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co @-@ defendants from testifying for each other , under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand . 
 The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant 's " due process " rights to fair proceedings , which applies to the states . Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court 's " due process " focus , though he agreed with the outcome , as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts . 
 The impact of Washington was narrowed by a later case , Taylor v. Illinois ( 1988 ) , in which the Court said that " countervailing public interests " , like the need to move through cases quickly , could be balanced against a defendant 's right to present witnesses . In Taylor , the Supreme Court upheld a judge 's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney 's deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial . The defense attorney 's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified . Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on " efficient justice " , a more limited vision of trial rights than the " right to present a defense " created in Washington .

 = = = History of Compulsory Process Clause jurisprudence = = = 
 = = = = Ratification of the Sixth Amendment = = = = 
 The Compulsory Process Clause was ratified as part of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1791 . It accords a criminal defendant " the right ... to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . " The Clause was included among other rights ( e.g. right to a notice of charges ) as a foundation for how federal criminal justice would operate . Originally , the Sixth Amendment was only applicable to the federal government . 
 Despite ratification of the Clause , compulsory process was not originally interpreted to permit co @-@ defendants to testify for each other . States relied on a fear that two defendants would both " swear the other [ out ] " of the charge to prevent either defendant from being convicted . In Benson v. United States ( 1892 ) , the Supreme Court explained the underlying common law theory for this prohibition ; namely , that only witnesses who were " unaffected as a party by the result , and free from any of the temptations of interest " could testify . Federal courts accepted these common law rules and expressly applied them in United States v. Reid ( 1852 ) . In Reid , the Court held that the common law pertaining to criminal procedure in force at the time of the Constitution 's ratification would be applied in federal courts ; this effectively kept the bar on co @-@ defendant testimony . While Reid was overruled on different grounds in 1918 , it stated the general practice for co @-@ defendants as witnesses that existed before the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 = = = = Application to the States = = = = 
 After the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , the Supreme Court dealt with a series of cases regarding the scope of that amendment 's Due Process Clause . This Clause says that " Nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law " . The Court initially rejected an argument that the Due Process Clause applied to the state governments in Hurtado v. California ( 1884 ) , a case concerning the right to a grand jury hearing . Justice Matthews , writing for the majority of the Court , reasoned that " the Amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint . " While this decision rejected an expanded reach of the Due Process Clause , the Court stated that the Clause did protect against state encroachment of " fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions " . 
 Hurtado left open the question of what " fundamental principles of liberty and justice " would be protected . In 1897 , the Court held in Chicago , Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. Chicago ( 1897 ) that the Fifth Amendment 's Just Compensation Clause relating to eminent domain takings was " an essential element of due process of law ordained by the Fourteenth Amendment " to the point that a Chicago taking of railroad property was " within the meaning of that amendment " . In finding that application of the Due Process Clause , the Court said that just compensation constituted " a vital principle of republican institutions [ without which ] almost all other rights would become worthless " . 
 In the same year as the railroad takings case , the Court evaluated what procedural trial rights implicated the " fundamental principles of liberty " expressed in Hurtado . In Hovey v. Elliot , the Supreme Court specifically applied the Due Process Clause to some fair trial guarantees , holding that due process " secures an ' inherent right of defense ' " . Despite that broad statement , the Court emphasized that due to procedural issues with the case itself " our opinion is therefore exclusively confined to the case before us . " 
 A decade after Hovey , the Supreme Court announced its first rule for how the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would be applied . In Twining v. New Jersey ( 1908 ) , the Court held that " it is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action , because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law " . This understanding of the meaning of " due process " opened up the possibility that the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states . Specifically , the Court said in Twining that the test was whether the right was embedded in " the very idea of free government " . This test endorsed a " selective incorporation " approach , meaning one that would evaluate whether to apply a right to the states on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis . 
 The selective incorporation principle was expanded on further in Palko v. Connecticut ( 1937 ) , where the Court examined whether the right against double jeopardy should be incorporated against the states . In Palko , the Court stated that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states if the right was " found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty " . Though eight justices agreed that the double jeopardy right was not " implicit in the concept of ordered liberty " , the Palko test has remained the standard for incorporating rights against state and local governments . 
 = = = = Expansion of procedural trial rights = = = = 
 After Palko , the Court examined Bill of Rights protections one by one . Despite this incremental approach , the Court would eventually apply most rights to the states . 
 In the realm of criminal procedure , this doctrine eventually came to protect the defendant 's ability to " present exculpatory evidence and testimony of witnesses " . For example , the Court in Brady v. Maryland ( 1963 ) used the Due Process Clause to require the state prosecution authorities to disclose evidence that is favorable to a defendant prior to trial . 
 The Court 's due process jurisprudence was expanded with the 1948 decision in In re Oliver , which revised the breadth of the " fundamental fairness " right . The Court wrote : 
 A person 's right to reasonable notice of a charge against him , and an opportunity to be heard in his defense — a right to his day in court — are basic in our system of jurisprudence ; and these rights include , as a minimum , a right to examine the witnesses against him , to offer testimony , and to be represented by counsel . 
 = = = Washington 's trial = = = 
 Jackie Washington was charged with first @-@ degree murder in Dallas , Texas . At the trial , Washington testified on his own behalf , and he put a great deal of the blame on an accomplice named Charles Fuller . He testified that Fuller had been carrying the murder weapon — a shotgun — at the scene . When he sought to have Fuller testify to back up his story , the trial judge blocked him on the basis of a Texas statute which provided that " persons charged or convicted as co @-@ participants in the same crime could not testify for one another " . The law , however , did not block a co @-@ participant from testifying for the state . 
 Washington was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison . His conviction was subsequently upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , Texas 's highest criminal court , in 1966 . The Court of Criminal Appeals , which reasoned that the Compulsory Process Clause did not affect how the state treated the " competency " of a witness , rejected Washington 's plea that Fuller should have been allowed to testify . Washington then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case , and the Supreme Court granted review . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the opinion of the Court , which spoke for eight justices in reversing the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals . Warren began by stating that the Court had never been " previously called upon to decide whether the right of the accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor ... is so fundamental [ that ] it is incorporated in the Due Process Clause " . Because of the incorporation to states of other procedural guarantees , the " right to offer the testimony of witnesses " could be given no less weight . Warren wrote that it was critical to the ability to " present a defense ... [ a ] defendant 's version of the facts " . This broad right was necessary to detail thoroughly , he wrote , because ignoring how the right would be actually be applied would risk making the right to compel witnesses futile . 
 After determining that the Sixth Amendment 's " right to compulsory process is applicable in this state proceeding " ( i.e. that the Compulsory Process Clause applied to the states ) , the question became whether the specific instance of Washington 's trial was an unconstitutional deprivation of that right . Despite the common law restriction against co @-@ defendants testifying for each other , Warren noted that federal courts had refused to be " bound by ' the dead hand of the common @-@ law ' " since 1918 . Along with the precedent of prior federal court decisions , the fact that there were a great deal of exceptions to this rule demonstrated the " absurdity of the rule " itself . Specifically , under the Texas statute — which allowed a defendant acquitted at a separate trial to testify for the other defendant at the other 's trial — the " law leaves [ the co @-@ defendant ] free to testify when he has a great incentive to perjury , [ but ] bars his testimony in situations where he has a lesser motive to lie " . 
 Warren concluded that the nature of the Texas law at issue denied Washington the right for a fair trial using witnesses who could testify to " relevant and material " facts in the case . Here , while not entirely relying on the finding , the Court saw the law as " arbitrary " because its discrimination between the prosecution and defense served " no rational relationship " to any goal of preventing perjury . Further , the idea that a " competent " witness was barred from testifying , in and of itself , was held to be an unconstitutional predetermination on the part of the state legislature . The Court 's decision upheld the importance of juries in evaluating the truth and credibility of witnesses ' statements . 
 Despite adopting a broad principle , the Court did not list any specific rules for how trial judges were to balance evidentiary standards and the right of the defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor . 
 = = = Harlan 's concurrence = = = 
 Justice Harlan , who agreed with the decision to reverse the Texas court 's judgment but not with the majority 's reasoning , wrote a short separate concurring opinion . He repeated his position that the Due Process Clause did not incorporate the Bill of Rights to the states ; rather , the Bill of Rights was a " rational continuum , which , broadly speaking , includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints " . He isolated the Texas law 's distinction between the co @-@ defendant testifying for the state while being barred from testifying for the defendant as having " no justification " . Thus , he rejected holding the trial unconstitutional on Compulsory Process Clause grounds ; he argued instead that the State 's " arbitrary bar " against a criminal defendant 's calling a co @-@ defendant as a witness for his side , while allowing the co @-@ defendant to testify for the prosecution , violated the Due Process Clause . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 In two cases after Washington , the Court pulled back from its broad principle that a defendant in a criminal proceeding has a " right to a defense " . In United States v. Valenzuela @-@ Bernal ( 1982 ) , the Court held that an argument by the government that it had an interest in deporting illegal aliens ( some witnesses in the case ) outweighed the defendant 's right to " eye witness testimony " . Additionally , in Taylor v. Illinois ( 1988 ) , the Court held that " countervailing public interests " could also outweigh the defendant 's compulsory process rights . 
 In Taylor , a series of deliberate discovery violations by the defense counsel at trial led the trial judge to block attempts at postponing proceedings to allow a further undisclosed defense witness the chance to testify ; the judge had held that there must be some sanction against the defense for their failure to disclose witnesses earlier in the case . A divided Court upheld the trial judge 's preclusion of the witness , adding a new framework for balancing a defendant 's right to a robust defense with a series of other factors . Namely , the new framework required looking at the state 's interest in " efficient " justice , the state 's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity , the state 's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules , and the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant 's discovery violation . 
 = = Analysis and commentary = = 
 Analysis of Washington has focused on the decision in the broader context of procedural trial rights . A 2007 article in the Georgetown Law Review by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision . Hewett 's main criticism was based on the Court 's lack of a standard on which to evaluate whether certain evidence was " material " to a defendant 's case . Hewett noted that in a post @-@ Washington decision in 1973 , the Court applied a " case @-@ specific " decision rather than a " general constitutional standard " . This line of decisions , Hewett argued , led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the " actual reliability of the evidence " in cases where a witness is not present . The " newly @-@ seized power " was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed . This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the " situations [ involved ] the reliability of the excluded evidence [ that ] could <unk> " . Hewett concluded by arguing that all of these cases had diminished the protections of the jury and of the defendant 's right to have his own defense . 
 An article in the American Criminal Law Review , published in 2011 by Stacey Kime , disagreed with some of Hewett 's arguments . Kime argued that " it is well settled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence " , disagreeing with the idea that the basis for a robust defense had been gutted . Instead , she blamed the " incoherent " standard today on a lack of understanding of where the " source of this constitutional right " to have a strong defense lies . Unlike Hewett , who targeted post @-@ Washington decisions , Kime believed that there were flaws in the Washington opinion itself . Specifically , she argued that " the Court 's reasoning was not only unnecessary , but the Washington doctrine itself is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment 's history and text " . 
 In her review of the history behind the Sixth Amendment , Kime argued that James Madison could have drafted a more comprehensive right to " call for evidence " ( as existed in the Virginia Declaration of Rights ) but failed to do so . With this context in mind , she said , the Compulsory Process Clause likely enshrined the right to subpoena witnesses and have a fair trial , rather than a broader " right to have a defense " . Kime 's analysis concluded by stating that the decision in Washington had put " unnecessary tension between two analytically distinct constitutional rights " . 
 = Red warbler = 
 The red warbler ( Cardellina ruber ) is a small passerine bird endemic to the highlands of Mexico , north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . It is closely related to , and forms a superspecies with , the pink @-@ headed warbler of southern Mexico and Guatemala . There are three subspecies , found in disjunct populations , which differ primarily in the color of their ear patch and in the brightness and tone of their body plumage . The adult is bright red , with a white or gray ear patch , depending on the subspecies ; young birds are pinkish @-@ brown , with a whitish ear patch and two pale wingbars . 
 Like all New World warblers , the red warbler is an insectivore . It gleans primarily in understory shrubs . Breeding typically occurs between February and May . The female lays three or four eggs in a domed nest , which she builds on the ground . Though she alone incubates the eggs , both sexes feed the young and remove fecal sacs from the nest . The young fledge within 10 – 11 days of hatching . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 When he first described the red warbler in 1827 , naturalist William John Swainson assigned it to the genus Setophaga . Over the next half century , other naturalists moved it to Cardellina , with the red @-@ faced warbler , and to the widespread tropical warbler genus <unk> , as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus . In 1873 , naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus <unk> , where it remained for more than a century . 
 There are three subspecies , which differ slightly in appearance : 
 C. r. ruber , described by Swainson in 1827 , has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca . 
 C. r. <unk> , which was described by Robert Thomas Moore in 1937 , has dark gray ear patches and somewhat more scarlet upperparts than C. r. ruber . It is found from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit . 
 C. r. <unk> was described by R. T. Orr and J. D. Webster in 1968 . It has white ear patches and ruby @-@ red upperparts ( brightest of the three subspecies ) , and is found in the Sierra Madre del Sur , from Guerrero to southern Oaxaca . 
 The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink @-@ headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala , to which it is closely related . Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages , the two have sometimes been considered conspecific . Conversely , it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray @-@ eared species ( C. <unk> ) and a southern white @-@ eared species ( C. ruber ) . 
 The red warbler 's common name is a straightforward reference to its color . The genus name Cardellina is the diminutive of the Italian <unk> , a regional name for the European goldfinch , while its specific name , ruber , is Latin for " red " .

 The red warbler has several common calls , including a high , thin <unk> and a stronger <unk> . Its song is a mix of short trills and richer warbles , interspersed with high @-@ pitched chips .

 = = Habitat and range = = 
 Endemic to the highlands of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , the red warbler has three disjunct populations : from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit , from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca , and from Guerrero into southern Oaxaca in the Sierra Madre del Sur . It is fairly common to common in the interior and on adjacent slopes , where it occurs at elevations ranging from 1 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 900 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 to 12 @,@ 800 ft ) above sea level . It is an altitudinal migrant , moving from higher humid or semi @-@ humid pine , pine @-@ oak and fir forests in the breeding season to lower elevations , often in oak forests , in the winter . It is among the most common of the small birds in its woodland habitat , second only to the golden @-@ crowned kinglet in fir forests in one study and the third most common warbler in oak @-@ conifer woodlands in another . 
 Though the species was reported to have been collected in Texas in the late 19th century , the record 's location was not widely believed , and there is no strong evidence that it ever occurred there .

 Though it sometimes joins mixed @-@ species flocks , the red warbler is more typically found alone or in pairs . Youngsters probably choose mates in the autumn of their first year , and pairs remain together year @-@ round , except during severe weather and during post @-@ breeding molt . 
 = = = Food and feeding = = = 
 The red warbler is an insectivore . It gleans primarily in understory shrubs at low to middle levels , moving slowly and deliberately through more open areas of the vegetation , and feeding with quick jabs into cracks in bark and pine needle clusters . It sometimes hover gleans to feed at pine needle clusters . Though it lacks any obvious adaptations for climbing , it regularly does so in its search for prey items on bark and epiphytes on branches , often hanging head @-@ down as it probes . In areas of deciduous growth , it typically <unk> , making brief aerial sorties from a perch in pursuit of flying insects . While it seldom associates with mixed @-@ species flocks , it feeds alongside other birds with no signs of conflict , displaying no hostility towards other species with which it competes . Its foraging area is quite small , often amounting to only a few dozen square meters ( several hundred square feet ) per day . Late in the afternoon , its rate of foraging declines , and it rests , often taking brief naps , in the forest understory . Though it does not generally feed after sunset , it may do so to take advantage of transient food sources , such as hatching Neuroptera . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The red warbler breeds primarily in early spring , from February until May , though at least one nest containing young has been found as late as the end of June . The female alone builds the nest , a task which typically takes 4 – 6 days . She chooses a sunlit area , such as an area of windfall , the brushy edge of a trail or water course , or a small clearing , for its location . Tightly woven of plant material , the nest is hidden in ground vegetation and anchored to the stalks of surrounding vegetation . <unk> and untidy on the outside , it is typically constructed primarily of dead pine needles and dead grass , though gray lichens , green moss , dead leaves , shreds of bark and tips of fern fronds are also used ; most of these materials are gathered from the ground close to the nest , though some is picked from low branches or further away . The nest , which is usually oven @-@ shaped with a side or upward @-@ facing entrance , measures roughly 6 in ( 15 cm ) wide by 7 in ( 18 cm ) long by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 11 cm ) high . A small number of nests are only cups , lacking the roof of the more typical structures . Inside , the nest is tidy and compact , lined with fine grasses and plant fluff , which is generally gathered some distance from the nest . 
 Early in the breeding season , as many as 11 days may transpire between the completion of the nest and the laying of the first egg . Later in the season , this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready . The female normally lays three eggs , though clutches of up to four have been recorded . The eggs , which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots or white with cinnamon and rust spots densely ringing the larger end of the egg , measure 16 – 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 – 0 @.@ 67 in ) by 13 mm ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) and weigh 1 – 1 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 035 – 0 @.@ 049 oz ) . The female alone incubates the eggs for 16 days ; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch . She sits facing the back wall of the nest , with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening . She sits tight at the approach of danger , typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest . 
 Both adults feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs , though the female removes far more than the male does . The pair move deceptively when approaching the nest , foraging – or pretending to forage – in nearby vegetation . They stay only a few seconds in any one spot , including at the nest , making it more difficult for a predator to locate the young . The nestlings , which make a rapid , high @-@ pitched peeping call as an adult approaches carrying food , fledge within 10 – 11 days of hatching . 
 = = Conservation and threats = = 
 The red warbler is currently rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature . Though there is evidence that its numbers are decreasing , the decline has not been precipitous , and the population remains quite large , with estimates ranging from 50 @,@ 000 to 499 @,@ 999 birds . The forested areas in which it occurs , however , include some of the most threatened habitats in Mexico , with logging , agricultural expansion , firewood gathering , road building , tourist development , overgrazing and intensive urbanization among the many things contributing to the destruction of the forests . There is some evidence that selective logging in pine forests may actually favor this species , which prefers more open , sunlit areas in which to breed .

The bignose shark is plain @-@ colored and grows to at least 2 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 8 m ( 8 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 2 ft ) in length . It has a long , broad snout with prominent nasal skin flaps , and tall , triangular upper teeth . Its pectoral fins are long and almost straight , and there is a ridge on its back between the two dorsal fins . 
 Hunting close to the sea floor , the bignose shark feeds on bony and cartilaginous fishes , and cephalopods . It is viviparous , meaning the embryos are sustained to term via a placental connection . Females bear litters of three <unk> pups after a 10 @-@ month gestation period . Despite its size , this shark lives too deep to pose much danger to humans . It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries in many parts of its range ; the meat , fins , skin , liver oil , and offal may be used . The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks enough information to assess the global conservation status of this species . However , the various fishing pressures within its range are cause for concern given its slow reproductive rate , and it may have already declined in the northwestern Atlantic and elsewhere .

 Shark expert Stewart Springer described the bignose shark as <unk> <unk> in a 1950 issue of the scientific journal American Museum Novitates . Later authors have regarded the genus <unk> as a synonym of Carcharhinus . The specific epithet altimus is derived from the Latin altus ( " deep " ) , and refers to the shark 's deepwater habits . The type specimen is an immature female 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) long , caught off Cosgrove Reef in the Florida Keys on April 2 , 1947 . An alternate common name for this species is Knopp 's shark , originally used by Florida fishery workers since before the species was described . 
 Phylogenetic studies published by Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988 , based on morphology , placed the bignose shark in the " obscurus group " of Carcharhinus , centered on the dusky shark ( C. obscurus ) and the Galapagos shark ( C. galapagensis ) . The group consists of large , triangular @-@ toothed sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins . Gavin Naylor 's 1992 study , based on allozyme sequences , upheld and further resolved this " ridge @-@ backed " group . The bignose shark was found to be the sister species of the sandbar shark ( C. plumbeus ) , with the two forming one of the group 's two branches .

 Patchy records from around the world indicate the bignose shark probably has a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters . In the Atlantic Ocean , it occurs from Delaware Bay to Brazil , in the Mediterranean Sea , and off West Africa . In the Indian Ocean , it is known in South Africa and Madagascar , the Red Sea , India , and the Maldives . In the Pacific Ocean , it has been recorded from China to Australia , around Hawaii , and from the Gulf of California to Ecuador . It is reportedly common off Florida , the Bahamas , and the West Indies , and rare off Brazil and in the Mediterranean . 
 The bignose shark is found near the edge of the continental shelf and over the upper continental slope , generally swimming close to the sea floor at depths of 90 – 430 m ( 300 – 1 @,@ 410 ft ) . Young sharks may venture into water as shallow as 25 m ( 82 ft ) . Night @-@ time captures of this species from close to the surface suggest it may perform a diel vertical migration , moving from deep water upwards or toward the coast at night . In the northwestern Atlantic , the bignose shark conducts a poorly documented seasonal migration , spending summer off the US East Coast and winter in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea . Individual sharks have been recorded traveling distances between 1 @,@ 600 and 3 @,@ 200 km ( 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 mi ) .

 Rather heavily built , the bignose shark has a long , broad , and blunt snout with the nostrils preceded by well @-@ developed , triangular flaps of skin . The moderately large , circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . The mouth is broadly curved and lacks obvious furrows at the corners . The upper teeth number 14 – 16 rows on either side and have tall , broad , triangular cusps with serrated edges ; they are erect at the jaw center and become increasingly oblique towards the sides . The lower teeth number 14 – 15 rows on either side and have narrow , erect cusps with extremely fine serrations . The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long . 
 The long and wide pectoral fins have pointed tips and nearly straight margins . The first dorsal fin originates roughly over the rear of the pectoral fin bases ; it is fairly tall and falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) , with a blunt apex and a long free rear tip . The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short free rear tip , and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin . A high midline ridge is present between the dorsal fins . The caudal peduncle has a crescent @-@ shaped notch at the origin of the upper caudal fin margin . The caudal fin has a large lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The dermal denticles are closely spaced but non @-@ overlapping , such as that the skin shows between them ; each is oval with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . The coloration is gray to bronze above , with a faint pale stripe on the flank , and white below ; sometimes there is a green sheen along the gills . The tips of the fins ( except for the pelvic fins ) are darker ; this is most obvious in young sharks . Males and females grow to at least 2 @.@ 7 m ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) and 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) long respectively ; this species possibly reaches 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in length . The maximum weight on record is 168 kg ( 370 lb ) .

 The bignose shark feeds mainly on bottom @-@ dwelling bony fishes ( including lizardfishes , croakers , flatfishes , and <unk> ) , cartilaginous fishes ( including Squalus <unk> , Holohalaelurus catsharks , Dasyatis stingrays , and chimaeras ) , and cephalopods . In turn , juveniles may potentially fall prey to larger sharks . Like other requiem sharks , this species is viviparous : when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment . Females bear litters of three to 15 pups , with seven being typical , following a gestation period of approximately 10 months . A single litter may be sired by two or more males . Birthing has been reported to occur in August and September in the Mediterranean , and in September and October off Madagascar . The newborns measure 70 – 90 cm ( 28 – 35 in ) long . Males and females mature sexually at around 2 @.@ 2 and 2 @.@ 3 m ( 7 @.@ 2 and 7 @.@ 5 ft ) long , respectively . The average age of reproductively active individuals is 21 years .

 While large enough to perhaps be dangerous , the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its preference for deep water . This species is a bycatch of gillnet , bottom trawl , and deep @-@ set pelagic longline fisheries ( particularly those targeting tuna ) in many parts of its range . It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil , shagreen , and fishmeal . Elsewhere , such as in Southeast Asia , the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup . The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States , where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas , swordfish and sharks , or in Australia . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bignose shark as Data Deficient overall , due to inadequate population and fishery monitoring . The species is considered to be of concern , however , given it is slow @-@ reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure . There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives . Furthermore , most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters , where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries . It is listed as a " highly migratory species " under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks , but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures . Regionally , the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic . Though specific data are lacking , it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark , thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers , as well . This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters , where it faces no significant threats . 
 = Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal = 
 The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester , England , built to link Bolton and Bury with Manchester . The canal , when fully opened , was 15 miles 1 furlong ( 24 @.@ 3 km ) long . It was accessed via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford . Seventeen locks were required to climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton , heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury . Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks . Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads . 
 The canal was commissioned in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808 , during the Golden Age of canal building , at a cost of £ 127 @,@ 700 ( £ 8 @.@ 93 million today ) . Originally designed for narrow gauge boats , during its construction the canal was altered into a broad gauge canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal . The canal company later converted into a railway company and built a railway line close to the canal 's path , which required modifications to the Salford arm of the canal . 
 Most of the freight carried was coal from local collieries but , as the mines reached the end of their working lives sections of the canal fell into disuse and disrepair and it was officially abandoned in 1961 . In 1987 a society was formed with the aim of restoring the canal for leisure use and , in 2006 , restoration began in the area around the junction with the River Irwell in Salford . The canal is currently navigable as far as Oldfield Road , Salford .

 The local geology of the Irwell Valley , which included steep sided valleys with fast flowing rivers subject to rapid flooding and dry seasons , confined local river transport to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation , west of Manchester . Financial unrest and British involvement in the American Revolutionary War restricted local transport investment to road improvements . 
 With the arrival of more favourable conditions , including the end of the war , a proposal for a canal to link the towns of Manchester , Bolton and Bury was mooted . Matthew Fletcher had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed the route of the proposed canal , but the first public notice came from Manchester on 4 September 1790 . The initial proposal probably came from a group in Bolton , with the support of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company . A meeting was " intended to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe , the Bull 's Head in Manchester aforesaid , on Monday , the twentieth day of this instant , September , at eleven o 'clock in the forenoon " , where " Surveys , Plans , Levels , Estimates and Proposals " would be presented . A further meeting on 16 September , held in Bolton , appointed a committee of six <unk> chaired by Lord Grey de Wilton to attend at Manchester . A series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of the route , and authorised the necessary actions to bring the plan into fruition , which included the petitioning of Parliament for the required bill . Hugh Henshall was asked to survey the proposed route of the canal . 
 For local industries along the route of the proposed canal , whose operations relied on water from local rivers and brooks which the canal might also use , its construction was a controversial idea . At a meeting in Bolton on 4 October 1790 , it was resolved that " proper clauses be inserted in the bill to prevent injury to owners of mills " . A meeting in Bury at the Eagle & Child public house on 29 September 1790 secured an agreement that " the utility of this scheme nevertheless cannot with propriety be ascertained until such time as it has been certified , from whence and in what proportion the proprietors of the intended navigation expect to draw their resources of water " . At another meeting in Bury , on 13 October 1790 , Hugh Henshall gave a written report on the canal , and stated that his plan would not require water from the river in times of drought , but that floods and rivulets would supply his reservoirs . He suggested that mill owners could be protected by a suitable clause in the bill , and such a clause was duly obtained by Robert Peel . Businesses in Bolton were concerned with the location of the canal terminus , and proposed the construction of a tunnel to allow the terminus to be built closer to the town centre . Ralph Fletcher , spokesman for those concerned , reported on this proposal to the committee , although no tunnel was built .
