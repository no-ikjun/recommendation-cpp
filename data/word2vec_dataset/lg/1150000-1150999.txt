 The Christmas Sessions received positive reviews from music critics . Rick Anderson of Allmusic gave the album 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , praising the album 's overall rock tone . Anderson offered a small amount of criticism concerning Millard 's vocal delivery , saying he " can can be a bit mannered " , as well as criticizing the country sound of " Silent Night " as " ill @-@ advised " , but he praised the band 's version of " I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day " . Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today , who gave the album 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , praised the album 's diverse sound . Although he described the band 's influences on some songs as being " a little too obvious " , Breimeier stated that " MercyMe is clearly improving as a band " . Daniel Cunningham of Cross Rhythms awarded the album 8 out of 10 squares , stating that the album exceeded his expectations . He described the album as being " fresh @-@ sounding " and felt the album 's mix of older and newer Christmas songs would give it a wide appeal . Jesus Freak Hideout 's Spencer Priest gave the album 4 out of 5 stars , praising the album as " outstanding " and feeling that the use of instruments like the trombone , trumpet , and mandolin in some songs made them stand out in comparison to other renditions . Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times praised the album as a whole , calling it " one of the year 's most enjoyable holiday CDs " . He also felt the band 's musical changes to the traditional songs showed their care for them .

 = Antonin Raymond = 
 Antonin Raymond ( or Czech : Antonín Raymond ) , born as Antonín Reimann ( 10 May 1888 , Kladno , Bohemia – 21 November 1976 Langhorne , Pennsylvania ) , was a Czech American architect . Raymond was born and studied in Bohemia ( now the Czech Republic ) , working later in the United States and Japan . Raymond was also the Consul of Czechoslovakia to Japan from 1926 to 1939 , in which year the Czech diplomacy was closed down after the occupation of the European country by the Nazi Germany . 
 His initial work with American architects Cass Gilbert and Frank Lloyd Wright gave him an insight into the use of concrete for texture and structure that he would refine throughout his six decade career . 
 At studio practices in New Hope , Pennsylvania and Tokyo , he explored traditional Japanese building techniques combined with the latest In American building innovations . Raymond applied these principles to a wide range of residential , commercial , religious and institutional projects in Japan , America , India and the Philippines . 
 Along with British Architect Josiah Conder , Raymond is recognized as one of the fathers of modern architecture in Japan . 
 = = Czech Lands = = 
 Raymond was born on 10 May 1888 , in Kladno , Central Bohemia ( now the Czech Republic ) to Alois Reimann and his wife <unk> . Following the death of his mother and the bankruptcy of his father 's shop the family moved to Prague in 1905 . Raymond started at the <unk> gymnasium ( secondary school aimed at more technical / practical sciences ) in Kladno , then continued on the same kind of school in Prague . 
 In 1906 he entered the Czech Polytechnic Institute , studying under Josef Schultz and Jan <unk> . He completed his studies in Trieste in 1910 before leaving for New York City . 
 = = United States = = 
 There , he began a three @-@ year employment with Cass Gilbert , working on a number of projects including external architectural details for the Woolworth Building and the Austin , Nichols and Company Warehouse in Brooklyn . His experience on the latter of these gave him an insight into the structural and textural properties of concrete . 
 He began studying painting at the Independent School of Art in the Lincoln Square Arcade Building in 1912 , but was forced to curtail a painting trip to Italy and North Africa with the onset of World War I. On his trip back to New York , he met his future wife and business partner , Noémi <unk> , and they were wed on 15 December 1914 . 
 Through the influence of a mutual friend , Frank Lloyd Wright agreed to employ Raymond from May 1916 . 
 = = = Employment with Frank Lloyd Wright = = = 
 Initially , Raymond and Noémi worked with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green , Wisconsin . In 1917 he enlisted with the United States Army serving overseas with the American Expeditionary Force . Upon his discharge from the army and his return to New York , Wright persuaded him to go to Tokyo with him to work on the Imperial Hotel . 
 Although he remained as Wright 's chief assistant for one year , he soon became bored with the work . He became concerned that " the design had nothing in common with Japan , its climate , its traditions , its people and its culture " . Also , whilst his work with Gilbert showed him the great possibilities of concrete , Wright did not see concrete in the same way , preferring to encase it with brickwork or carved Oya Stone . 
 Although Raymond proposed to continue working for Wright , he was eventually dismissed in January 1921 . In February of the same year he set up the American Architectural and Engineering Company in Tokyo with Leon Whittaker Slack . 
 = = Japan and the Inter @-@ war years = = 
 In the Tokyo Women 's Christian College , commenced in 1924 , Raymond 's architecture can be seen to still be heavily influenced by Wright . Its low , hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright 's Prairie Houses . This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret . 
 After their own house was destroyed in the Great Kantō earthquake , Raymond designed a new one , the Reinanzaka House , in Azabu , Tokyo . His desire to free himself from Wright 's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living , working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens . The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete . Raymond 's workforce were enthusiastic in their use of this new material , likening it to the walls of traditional ( <unk> ( <unk> ) ) storehouses . The house itself had metal fenestration , tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes . The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture . 
 After a number of staff changes , the practice was renamed Antonin Raymond , Architect . 
 = = = Czechoslovak Consul in Japan = = = 
 Despite becoming a naturalized American citizen in 1916 , Raymond became the honorary consul for the Czechoslovak Republic , representing the government of T. G. Masaryk . This gave him influence outside those circles normally associated with an architect of his age . From 1928 to 1930 , Raymond designed and remodelled the American , Soviet and French embassies . He also undertook work for the Rising Sun Petroleum Company , designing 17 earthquake @-@ proof and fireproof employee houses , the general office building , the manager 's residence and two prototype service stations , one in steel and the other in concrete . All were constructed in an International Modern Style . 
 = = = Corbusier Inspiration = = = 
 Since the Reinanzaka House , Raymond had been interested in the work of French architect Le Corbusier . He acknowledged that further contribution of Corbusier 's ideas to the practice came in 1930 , when Kunio Maekawa ( who had just returned from two years working for Le Corbusier in his Paris Office ) joined . He later applied Le Corbusier 's ideas to vernacular Japanese architecture . Based upon Le Corbusier 's unbuilt residential scheme for Mr. <unk> in Chile , he designed a summer house for himself in Karuizawa , Nagano . Where Corbusier had used rough masonry and a tiled butterfly roof , Raymond used cedar with larch thatch . Although the design was criticised by an American reviewer for being a copy of Le Corbusier 's design , the Frenchman was so flattered and surprised that he included a photo of it in the third volume of his <unk> <unk> : 
 Please be assured that there is no bitterness between us , but – as you yourself say – you made a slight mistake , that is you neglected to send me a note when you published the images of your Tokyo house , which is very pretty , by the way .

 In 1922 , Raymond had been admitted to Tokyo Golf Club and when it relocated to Asaka , Saitama in 1932 , he was asked to design it . His links to golfer Shiro Akaboshi also led to several residential commissions . 
 In 1937 in Tokyo , Articles of Association forming a new firm , <unk> <unk> Sekkei <unk> , were signed by Antonin , Noémi and a number of Japanese architects , including Junzō Yoshimura . 
 = = A long journey home to America = = 
 In January 1938 , Antonin , Noémi and their son left Tokyo bound for America . This six @-@ month journey took them initially to the Indian subcontinent and then on to Europe , including a trip to Prague . 
 In 1935 , Raymond 's office had accepted a commission to design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Puducherry in southeast India . A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936 . Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months , Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram , so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents . 
 Initially , Nakashima , Francois <unk> ( a Czech architect who had worked for Le Corbusier in Russia ) and <unk> ( a devotee who had trained as an engineer ) , built a full @-@ scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design , and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods . Nakashima 's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing , for example , the design of the concrete formwork . Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges . 
 Raymond sought to mitigate the effects of the Puducherry climate and oriented the <unk> dormitory ( as it became known ) , so that its main facades faced north and south to make use of the prevailing breeze . A combination of moveable louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy . The building is still in use as an ashram today . 
 = = The New Hope experiment = = 
 In 1939 , Raymond 's architectural practice in the United States began with the purchase and conversion of his farm and studio in New Hope , Pennsylvania . He and his wife 's goal was to " create a physical and intellectual environment that mirrored and supported their approach to modern design @-@ one that synthesised International Style developments with lessons learned from Japan 's craft tradition " . They hoped that the lifestyle and design ethos that they would create , would be simpler and more in tune with nature , similar in set up to Frank Lloyd Wright 's Taliesin Fellowship . 
 The Raymonds modified the house to create a more open plan feel , separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and <unk> screens . The rooms were filled with objects of art , including rugs designed by Noémi and crockery by the <unk> designer Minagawa <unk> . 
 Raymond developed a prospectus for aspiring architects to come and live and study at New Hope and he attracted at least 20 . In addition to teaching practical design solutions , the apprentices had hands @-@ on work with various building trades . Farm work and hay making contributed a physical aspect . Students included Junzō Yoshimura and Carl <unk> , and the farm was visited by people like Eero Saarinen and Alvar Aalto . 
 Once the students had become settled , Raymond sought real @-@ world projects for them to work upon , to put his theories into practice . Projects included an assortment of houses and extensions in New Jersey , Connecticut and Long Island . 
 In May 1943 , the Raymonds vouched for George Nakashima and his family , releasing them from a Japanese internment camp in Idaho , so that they could come and live at the New Hope farm . 
 = = The war years ( 1941 @-@ 1945 ) = = 
 With the approach of the Second World War , Raymond moved back to New York , ending the New Hope experiment . He formed a partnership with civil engineer Arthur Tuttle , structural engineer Elwyn Seelye and mechanical engineer Clyde Place . With the country 's emphasis on the war effort , the company focused on US army contracts . Their work included : prefabricated houses at Camp Kilmer , New Jersey ( 1942 ) and Camp Shanks , New York ( 1942 – 1943 ) and housing and an airport in Fort Dix , New Jersey ( 1943 ) . Controversially , in 1943 , Raymond was asked to design a series of middle class Japanese style homes on which the Army could test the effectiveness ordnance ( specifically incendiaries ) . These houses were eventually erected on the Dugway Proving Ground , nicknamed " Japanese village " . Raymond admitted in his autobiography that he was not proud of the work . 
 = = Practice with Ladislav Rado = = 
 After the war , Raymond 's practice with Tuttle , Seelye and Place was dissolved . He formed a new company with Slovak architect , Ladislav Leland Rado ( 1909 – 1993 ) , and named it Raymond & Rado . Although this company lasted until Raymond 's death in 1976 , they practised apart , with Rado in the New York office and Raymond in Tokyo . Whilst Raymond explored pottery and sculpture ( making friends with Tarō Okamoto and Ade Bethune ) , Rado pursued an orthogonal rationalism that Raymond would eventually distance himself from . 
 Projects in the United States during the late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a foothold in occupied Japan . This helped to restart the building boom in occupied Japan after the war . This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York . 
 Their single story Great River Station on the Long Island Rail Road , expressed Raymond 's fondness for inexpensive , simple materials . It had fieldstone retaining walls and a flat roof supported in each corner with a redwood post . The wide expanse of glazing created a modernist pavilion . 
 In the Saint Joseph the Worker <unk> . Joseph the Worker Chapel , Victorias in Victorias City , Negros Island , the Philippines , Raymond worked with liturgical artist Ade Bethune , to produce mosaic murals and a lacquerware tabernacle inside the reinforced concrete church . The interior was adorned with colourful frescoes by Alfonso Ossorio . The church acted as a social centre for employees of the Ossorio sugar cane refinery . The church is regarded as one of the first examples of modern sacred architecture in the country . 
 The practice were also responsible for a number of parks and recreation buildings across the United States in the late 1940s , built largely to commemorate victory in the war . 
 = = The Reader 's Digest Building = = 
 In 1947 , Raymond petitioned General MacArthur for permission to enter occupied Japan in order to participate in the reconstruction process . His staff from <unk> <unk> Sekkei <unk> had looked after the drawings and documents of the office through the war and Raymond decided to reopen the office . 
 Raymond received the commission for the Reader 's Digest Building from Mrs DeWitt Wallace on his return from Japan in 1949 . She wanted a design that would show the best that America could offer . The site acquired for the building was opposite the <unk> Gate of the Imperial Palace . Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park . Taking influence from Le Corbusier , Raymond responded to this criticism by <unk> the site by using a Ville <unk> inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor , Isamu Noguchi . 
 The long , rectilinear , two @-@ storey building , had a double cantilevered frame supported on a single row of concrete columns . These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position . Floor to ceiling glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running the length of the building . It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles , underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting . 
 It is considered the first large building in which Raymond managed to use his principles of simplicity , economy of materials , elegance and lightness learned from his residential works . Raymond cited the design of the Hiroshima Peace Museum by Kenzo Tange as being an external imitation of the Reader 's Digest Building . 
 Despite winning awards when first completed , the Reader 's Digest Building was demolished in 1963 to be replaced by the nine floor <unk> Building , a mixed used office building designed by Shoji Hayashi that for many years has served as the headquarters of the Mainichi Newspaper . 
 = = Experimentation in Tokyo = = 
 Raymond purchased land in the Nishi Azabu district of Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters . The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using <unk> timber logs . The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating . Taking influence from Le Corbusier 's <unk> , Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken ( based upon the size of tatami mats ) as a unit of measure to set out the building 's structure . Again he used fusuma partitions and <unk> screens , but in a modern way to divide up the spaces . 
 Raymond sought to use the design and construction of the office as a platform to inform prototype dwellings for the post war reconstruction of Japan . 
 In 1955 , Raymond began a commission in Takasaki , Gunma Prefecture for a Music Centre to house the Gunma Symphony Orchestra . Out of respect for the historic site and the budget constraints , he designed a building built on three premises : it would have an economical structural system , there would be equality of sight lines and acoustics for each seat , and the building would have a low profile without a fly tower . Raymond achieved these aims by using a series of 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) thick , reinforced concrete ribs connected together like an accordion and spanning 60 metres ( 200 ft ) . 
 In 1961 , he was commissioned to design the Catholic @-@ based Nanzan University in Nagoya . It was one of the largest projects that he would undertake . The campus was orientated on a north – south axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and harmonise with the landscape . In @-@ situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form , some with pilotis , others with shells . 
 Located to the east of the Nanzan Campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel ( 1962 ) . This is a building that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete , with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower . These are punctured with vertical slots which allow light to radiate along the curved interior walls . 
 = = Influence of his wife , Noémi = = 
 Born in 1889 in Cannes to Swiss @-@ French parents , Noémi moved to New York in 1900 , and later studied Fine Art and Philosophy at Columbia Teachers College . Here , she was influenced by the painter and educator Arthur Wesley Dow . During Raymond 's period of training as a painter , Noémi supported them both by doing graphic work for publications like the New York Sun and New York Herald Tribune . When they both moved to Taliesin she became interested in 3D design . She also polished her knowledge of Japanese crafts , becoming a broker for clients such as Rudolph Schindler 's wife , Pauline <unk> . 
 Noémi 's influence on Raymond during the inter @-@ war years was substantial . She encouraged him to break away from Wright 's rigid style and explore the design of the Reinanzaka House . She increased her interest in Japanese art and philosophy , including ukiyo @-@ e woodblock prints and introduced Raymond to various influential people , including the mystic philosopher Rudolf Steiner . 
 She expanded her design repertoire to include textiles , rugs , furniture , glass and silverware . Noémi exhibited in Tokyo in 1936 and New York in 1940 , and her textiles were chosen by American designers like Louis Kahn to cover furniture in their designs . 
 Noémi also contributed to the design of the studio in <unk> and a series of Raymond 's villas during the 1950s , including the Hayama Villa ( 1958 ) . 
 = = A legacy in concrete = = 
 Ignored by Henry @-@ Russell Hitchcock , Jr and Philip Johnson in their curatorial celebration of the International Style in 1932 , and despite the homecoming exhibition of his work staged in the Rockefeller Center in 1939 and the AIA New York Chapter Medal of Honor that was awarded to him 17 years later in 1956 , one has the feeling that Raymond 's achievements were always somehow grudgingly received by his compatriots . And even now , over 50 years later ... there remains a silent consensus in the field that is reluctant to acknowledge the unrivalled excellence and breathtaking scope of Raymond 's architectural career . 
 When Wright left Raymond set up his own office , he advertised himself as a specialist in reinforced concrete . He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert , its structural ones from Wright , and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing . His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School , which was one of the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo . Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative elements for the building , such as window mullions . In a partially successful experiment , he used wooden formwork to imprint a texture onto the concrete ( but he chose to cover it up ) . 
 On the Reinanzaka House , the labourers were skilled in the use of wood , and helped Raymond <unk> the texture of cedar onto the concrete . This was further explored on the <unk> Akaboshi and the <unk> Kawasaki houses , where the concrete walls of the luxurious interiors were imprinted with cypress textures . On the Karuizawa Studio , workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate . Whilst at Nanzan University , the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns , with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface . 
 Raymond 's techniques endeared him to the Japanese architectural psyche , and in 1958 , the editor of the architectural magazine <unk> , Yoshioka <unk> remarked , " it is doubtful that concrete is handled with such pains anywhere except in Japan . The idea of an exposed concrete surface seems to fit in with Japanese ideas of decor . " Post war architects like Tadao Ando have become famous for their use of exposed concrete . 
 Raymond 's use of a traditional post and beam structure in concrete for the Reinanzaka House was a technique that was adopted by post war Japanese architects such as Kenzo Tange . 
 Predating Le Corbusier 's work in Chandigarh , the <unk> dormitory used a monolithic concrete structure with deep overhangs and louvres to adapt to specific climatic conditions . The building pioneered the use of reinforced concrete in India . 
 Although Raymond 's technique of exposing and perfecting concrete surfaces would come to be seen as " typically Japanese " over time , it is important to note that this entailed polishing and waterproofing the exposed surface rather than covering it with white tiles . 
 Antonin Raymond died at St. Mary 's Hospital in Langhorne , Pennsylvania , on 25 October 1976 , aged 88 . His wife Noémi died four years later , aged 91 . Raymond Architectural Design Office continues to practice in Tokyo .

 = Stolen Innocence = 
 Stolen Innocence : My Story of Growing Up in a <unk> Sect , Becoming a Teenage Bride , and Breaking Free of Warren Jeffs is an autobiography by American author Elissa Wall detailing her childhood in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) and subsequent later life outside of the church . It was first published by William Morrow and Company in 2008 . 
 Wall was born into a polygamous family in Salt Lake City and grew up attending the FLDS @-@ run Alta Academy . She describes her living situation as tense ; familial relations were further complicated when her mother was reassigned to marry another man in Hildale , Utah . FLDS leaders orchestrated a marriage between Wall , then 14 , and her 19 @-@ year @-@ old cousin , Allen Steed , an arrangement she claims to have vehemently opposed . During their four @-@ year marriage , Steed allegedly abused her sexually and psychologically , and Wall eventually began an affair with Lamont Barlow , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the FLDS . Barlow later persuaded her to leave the church and to press charges against Steed and Warren Jeffs , the FLDS " prophet " who performed the wedding ceremony . 
 Stolen Innocence sold well , reaching number six on the New York Times bestseller list , but received mixed reviews . Critics were interested in the story but criticized Wall 's writing style . Sharp Independent and Killer Films optioned the film rights shortly after its publication and discussed possibly creating a movie adaption of the book . 
 = = Background = = 
 Elissa Wall was born in Salt Lake City , Utah , on July 7 , 1986 to Douglas and Sharon ( Steed ) Wall , both members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) . The FLDS is a Mormon denomination that split from the mainstream Church of Latter Day Saints ( LDS ) following the latter 's decision to outlaw polygamy in the early 20th century . Wall 's family practiced polygamy , and Sharon was the second of three wives . As is typical among the FLDS , Wall 's parents produced a large number of children , with Lloyd having 24 children in total and 14 by Sharon . Female members of the FLDS wore " long pioneer style dresses " and styled their hair in traditional buns and braids . The mandated undergarments covered their full form , " from the wrist to the ankle and right up to the neck " , while makeup , tattoos , and piercings were not permitted . Wall , along with other FLDS children , grew up attending the Alta Academy , which was owned and run by the church . Warren Jeffs , a leader in the community , read from the Book of Mormon at eight in the morning . " No matter what age you were , you were expected to attend and take notes , " said Wall . " It was a very religious education ... As a child in that society , you hung on every word . I remember believing in it so much it would almost consume me . " She later referred to her education as " brainwashing " . 
 The first major crisis in Wall 's early life occurred when she was 13 and her mother was reassigned to marry another man , Fred Jessop . Wall , along with her mother and sisters , moved to Hildale in the year 2000 . The new family was particularly large , so the children were required to eat meals in shifts . She compared the experience to starting a new school in terms of aspects of life that she had to become re @-@ accustomed to . Over time , several of her brothers and sisters left or were expelled from the church . 
 In 2001 , FLDS leader <unk> Jeffs arranged for a then 14 @-@ year @-@ old Wall to marry her 19 @-@ year @-@ old cousin , Allen Steed . Wall stated that she despised her cousin and asked that she be given more time or another possible husband . Her stepfather , mother , and older sister , Rebecca Musser , were supportive of the marriage and encouraged her to go through with it , with the latter two sewing her wedding dress and organizing her honeymoon . She and Steed were married at the <unk> Motel in Caliente , Nevada . Warren Jeffs , who had previously insisted that the wedding move forward , performed the ceremony . 
 Wall describes the marriage as traumatic , with frequent rapes and miscarriages . She recounts that she did not receive any sex education while in school and as a result was unable to understand her husband 's advances . As her marriage with her cousin fell apart , she began to spend nights sleeping in her truck , and at that point met former FLDS member Lamont Barlow . Wall , then 17 , began an affair with the then 25 @-@ year @-@ old Barlow , who encouraged her to leave the church with him . The affair was eventually uncovered when she became pregnant by him , and Jeffs had the marriage to Steed annulled . Wall left the FLDS and married Barlow , having two children with him . 
 In 2006 , Wall pressed charges against Jeffs , who was put on the FBI 's Most Wanted list . He was arrested in August of the same year while travelling in Nevada " in a red Cadillac found to contain $ 54 @,@ 000 in cash , 15 mobile phones , three iPods , laptop computers , a police scanner , a stack of credit cards and two female wigs , one blonde and one brunette " .

 In January 2008 , HarperCollins publishers confirmed that Elissa Wall was writing a " tell @-@ all " memoir that was scheduled to be released in April of that year . She chose to use pseudonyms for most of the people who appear in the book but kept the names of the plaintiffs and a few other members of the church unaltered . The book provided the background for Wall 's life inside of the FLDS and focused on her marriage to Allen Steed , whom she portrayed as " boorish and odd " . She further discussed her opinions on polygamy and the difficulties it caused in her early childhood . 
 HarperCollins asked Lisa Pulitzer to audition to act as a ghost writer for Wall . Pulitzer describes herself as " the official cult gal " as she enjoys writing escape stories and is able to make the subjects of her work more comfortable during the process . " Elissa called three women mother , " she said . " But I come from a blended family , so I understand complicated relations and loyalties . " 
 Wall 's attorney commented , " It 's going to be a great book . She 's never told her story . She 's only told little pieces of it . " Attorneys for Steed and Warren Jeffs were dismayed by the decision to publish the book before the conclusion of the court case , believing that it would hinder their clients from receiving a fair trial .

 State authorities raided the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Schleicher County , Texas in April 2008 after Texas Child Protective Services ( CPS ) and other authorities received a number of phone calls from <unk> Swinton , an adult Colorado resident . Swinton falsely claimed to be a 16 @-@ year @-@ old victim of physical and sexual abuse named " Sarah " who was living at the ranch . Subsequent reports stated that Swinton had repeatedly posed as a child victim . A girl matching " Sarah 's " description was not found , and authorities rounded up members of the church . Subsequently , the children — 213 boys and 250 girls — were separated from their parents and transported to Fort Concho , " a military facility with inadequate food , lavatories or bathing facilities , and little privacy for people to whom modesty was a basic dignity " . After it was determined that there was no evidence that the children were unhealthy , mistreated , or in danger of suffering abuse at the hands of the FLDS , they were returned to the ranch . 
 Elissa Wall , who participated in the raid by " [ educating ] the Texas officials on the people " , publicly defended the state 's actions , saying , " They have reason to fear that the girls are being married and having children at way too young of an age . They have reason to fear that children are in a dangerous place . It doesn 't mean the mothers don 't love their children . It doesn 't mean they don 't want to be good mothers . It just means there are reasons for what Texas is doing . "

 Warren Jeffs ' prison life has been tumultuous . At Utah 's Purgatory Correctional Facility , he suffered from infected ulcers on his knees , which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement . He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point . In August 2008 , Jeffs went into convulsions after banging his head against the walls of his cell repetitively and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter . 
 On July 27 , 2010 , the conviction of Warren Jeffs as an accomplice to Elissa Wall 's rape was overturned because " instructions given to jurors were erroneous . " State authorities considered retrying Jeffs in Utah , though the matter was complicated when Wall was accused of fabricating a key piece of evidence during the first trial ; Wall 's attorneys had used medical records for proof of a 2002 miscarriage , and thus proof of intimacy in the marriage . Michael <unk> , Jeffs ' defense attorney , interviewed Jane Blackmore , Wall 's midwife at the time of the miscarriage , in November 2010 and alleged that Wall had requested that she recreate the detailed records when she could not find them . Wall 's attorneys responded that she had only " unwittingly " replied to Blackmore 's questions during a phone call . 
 In 2011 , Warren Jeffs was convicted in Texas on sexual assault charges unrelated to Wall 's case and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years . Since Warren Jeffs would therefore be 100 years old by the earliest time he could be released from prison , Utah decided to drop the retrial . 
 Elissa Wall 's cousin and ex @-@ husband Allen Steed was charged with first @-@ degree felony rape after Jeffs ' first conviction in 2007 . The rape charges were later dropped in favor of Steed entering a plea bargain by confessing to the charge of engaging in sexual relations with a minor . As a result , he would serve 30 days in prison and three years on probation as well as pay $ 10 @,@ 000 in fines . Wall was pleased with the outcomes and commented , " This is a good day .

 = Actinium = 
 Actinium is a radioactive chemical element with symbol Ac ( not to be confused with the abbreviation for an acetyl group ) and atomic number 89 , which was discovered in 1899 . It was the first non @-@ primordial radioactive element to be isolated . Polonium , radium and radon were observed before actinium , but they were not isolated until 1902 . Actinium gave the name to the actinide series , a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table . 
 A soft , silvery @-@ white radioactive metal , actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation . As with most lanthanides and many actinides , actinium assumes oxidation state + 3 in nearly all its chemical compounds . Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac , which decays with a half @-@ life of 21 @.@ 772 years , predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles , and 228Ac , which is beta active with a half @-@ life of 6 @.@ 15 hours . One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0 @.@ 2 milligrams of actinium @-@ 227 , and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium @-@ 228 . The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical . Instead , the element is prepared , in milligram amounts , by the neutron irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reactor . Owing to its scarcity , high price and radioactivity , actinium has no significant industrial use . Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body . 
 = = History = = 
 André @-@ Louis Debierne , a French chemist , announced the discovery of a new element in 1899 . He separated it from pitchblende residues left by Marie and Pierre Curie after they had extracted radium . In 1899 , Debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and ( in 1900 ) as similar to thorium . Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance being similar to lanthanum and called it " <unk> " in 1904 . After a comparison of the substances half @-@ lives determined by Debierne , <unk> Brooks in 1904 , and Otto Hahn and Otto <unk> in 1905 , Debierne 's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority . 
 Articles published in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne 's results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900 . This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery . A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by <unk> . He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry : highlighting the prudence of Debierne 's claims in the original papers , he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne 's substance did not contain actinium . Debierne , who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer , lost interest in the element and left the topic . Giesel , on the other hand , can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of <unk> pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89 . 
 The name actinium originates from the Ancient Greek <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , meaning beam or ray . Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium , such as acetyl , acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Actinium is a soft , silvery @-@ white , radioactive , metallic element . Its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead . Owing to its strong radioactivity , actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light , which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles . Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides , and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores . Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation . 
 The first element of the actinides , actinium gave the group its name , much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides . The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev 's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides , by introducing the actinides , a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg . 
 Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation . As with most lanthanides and actinides , actinium exists in the oxidation state + 3 , and the <unk> + ions are colorless in solutions . The oxidation state + 3 originates from the [ Rn ] <unk> electronic configuration of actinium , with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed @-@ shell structure of the noble gas radon . The rare oxidation state + 2 is only known for actinium dihydride ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Chemical compounds = = 
 Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , AcOF , <unk> , <unk> , Ac2S3 , Ac2O3 and AcPO4 . Except for AcPO4 , they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds and contain actinium in the oxidation state + 3 . In particular , the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent . 
 Here a , b and c are lattice constants , No is space group number and Z is the number of formula units per unit cell . Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters .

 Actinium oxide ( Ac2O3 ) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 ° C or the oxalate at 1100 ° C , in vacuum . Its crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare @-@ earth metals . 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction . The former reaction is carried out at room temperature , by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions . In the latter method , actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 ° C in an all @-@ platinum setup . Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900 – 1000 ° C yields oxyfluoride AcOF . Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 ° C for an hour , similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product . 
 <unk> + 2 NH3 + H2O → AcOF + 2 NH4F 
 Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960 ° C. Similar to oxyfluoride , actinium oxychloride can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000 ° C. However , in contrast to the oxyfluoride , the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia . 
 Reaction of aluminium bromide and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide : 
 Ac2O3 + 2 <unk> → 2 <unk> + Al2O3 
 and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 ° C results in the <unk> <unk> .

 Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 ° C , and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH2 hydride . The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain . 
 Mixing monosodium phosphate ( <unk> ) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white @-@ colored actinium phosphate <unk> ( AcPO4 · <unk> ) , and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400 ° C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3 . It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 ° C. 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive isotopes ; 227Ac ( from the radioactive family of 235U ) and 228Ac ( a granddaughter of 232Th ) . 227Ac decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy , but in 1 @.@ 38 % of cases it emits an alpha particle , so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry . Thirty @-@ six radioisotopes have been identified , the most stable being 227Ac with a half @-@ life of 21 @.@ 772 years , 225Ac with a half @-@ life of 10 @.@ 0 days and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 29 @.@ 37 hours . All remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half @-@ lives shorter than one minute . The shortest @-@ lived known isotope of actinium is <unk> ( half @-@ life of 69 nanoseconds ) which decays through alpha decay and electron capture . Actinium also has two known meta states . The most significant isotopes for chemistry are 225Ac , 227Ac , and 228Ac . 
 Purified 227Ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products after about a half of year . It decays according to its 21 @.@ 772 @-@ year half @-@ life emitting mostly beta ( 98 @.@ 62 % ) and some alpha particles ( 1 @.@ 38 % ) ; the successive decay products are part of the actinium series . Owing to the low available amounts , low energy of its beta particles ( maximum 44 @.@ 8 keV ) and low intensity of alpha radiation , 227Ac is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products . The isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206 u ( <unk> ) to 236 u ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Occurrence and synthesis = = 
 Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore contains about 0 @.@ 2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores , which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium . The actinium isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium @-@ actinium series decay chain , which begins with the parent isotope 235U ( or 239Pu ) and ends with the stable lead isotope <unk> . The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium series decay chain , which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb . Another actinium isotope ( 225Ac ) was transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain , beginning with 237Np ( or 233U ) and ending with thallium ( <unk> ) and near @-@ stable bismuth ( 209Bi ) , but this chain existed only in the early Solar System , due to the short half @-@ life of neptunium @-@ 237 . 
 The low natural concentration , and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides , which are always abundant in actinium @-@ bearing ores , render separation of actinium from the ore impractical , and complete separation was never achieved . Instead , actinium is prepared , in milligram amounts , by the neutron irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reactor . 
 <formula> 
 The reaction yield is about 2 % of the radium weight . 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of 228Ac . After the synthesis , actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion , such as thorium , polonium , lead and bismuth . The extraction can be performed with <unk> @-@ benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products , and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH ( to about 6 @.@ 0 for actinium ) . An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid , which can result in a separation factor of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two @-@ stage process . Actinium can then be separated from radium , with a ratio of about 100 , using a low cross @-@ linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant . 
 225Ac was first produced artificially at the Institute for Transuranium Elements ( ITU ) in Germany using a cyclotron and at St George Hospital in Sydney using a <unk> in 2000 . This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium @-@ 226 target with 20 – 30 MeV deuterium ions . This reaction also yields <unk> which however decays with a half @-@ life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate 225Ac . 
 Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 ° C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation . Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Owing to its scarcity , high price and radioactivity , actinium currently has no significant industrial use . 
 227Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators , for example in spacecraft . The oxide of 227Ac pressed with beryllium is also an efficient neutron source with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium @-@ beryllium and radium @-@ beryllium pairs . In all those applications , 227Ac ( a beta source ) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha @-@ emitting isotopes upon its decay . Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross @-@ section for the ( α , n ) nuclear reaction : 
 <formula> 
 The <unk> neutron sources can be applied in a neutron probe – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil , as well as moisture / density for quality control in highway construction . Such probes are also used in well logging applications , in neutron radiography , tomography and other radiochemical investigations . 
 225Ac is applied in medicine to produce <unk> in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radiation therapy , in particular targeted alpha therapy ( TAT ) . This isotope has a half @-@ life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than <unk> ( half @-@ life 46 minutes ) . Not only 225Ac itself , but also its decay products emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body . The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years . As a result , after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac , the radiation from the actinium and its decay products might induce new mutations . To solve this problem , 225Ac was bound to a chelating agent , such as citrate , <unk> acid ( EDTA ) or diethylene <unk> <unk> acid ( <unk> ) . This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones , but the excretion from the body remained slow . Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as <unk> ( 1 @,@ 4 @,@ 7 @,@ 10 @,@ 13 @,@ 16 @-@ <unk> @-@ N , N ' , N ' ` , N ' `` , N ' `` ' , N ' `` ' <unk> acid ) or DOTA ( 1 @,@ 4 @,@ 7 @,@ 10 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @,@ 4 @,@ 7 @,@ 10 @-@ <unk> acid ) coupled to trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the <unk> / neu receptor . The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia , lymphoma , breast , ovarian , neuroblastoma and prostate cancers . 
 The medium half @-@ life of 227Ac ( 21 @.@ 77 years ) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters . The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities ( of the order 50 meters per year ) . However , evaluation of the concentration depth @-@ profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates . The physics behind this method is as follows : oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U . Its decay product , 231Pa , gradually precipitates to the bottom , so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant . 231Pa decays to 227Ac ; however , the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile , but instead increases toward the sea bottom . This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom . Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 227Ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a glove box . When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats , about 33 % of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50 % into the liver . Its toxicity is comparable to , but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium .

 = Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution = 
 The Thirteenth Amendment ( Amendment XIII ) to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude , except as punishment for a crime . In Congress , it was passed by the Senate on April 8 , 1864 , and by the House on January 31 , 1865 . The amendment was ratified by the required number of states on December 6 , 1865 . On December 18 , 1865 , Secretary of State William H. Seward proclaimed its adoption . It was the first of the three Reconstruction Amendments adopted following the American Civil War . 
 Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the original Constitution through provisions such as Article I , Section 2 , Clause 3 , commonly known as the Three @-@ Fifths Compromise , which detailed how each state 's total slave population would be factored into its total population count for the purposes of apportioning seats in the United States House of Representatives and direct taxes among the states . Though many slaves had been declared free by President Abraham Lincoln 's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation , their post @-@ war status was uncertain . On April 8 , 1864 , the Senate passed an amendment to abolish slavery . After one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration , the House followed suit on January 31 , 1865 . The measure was swiftly ratified by nearly all Northern states , along with a sufficient number of border and " reconstructed " Southern states , to cause it to be adopted before the end of the year . 
 Though the amendment formally abolished slavery throughout the United States , factors such as Black Codes , white supremacist violence , and selective enforcement of statutes continued to subject some black Americans to involuntary labor , particularly in the South . In contrast to the other Reconstruction Amendments , the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law , but has been used to strike down peonage and some race @-@ based discrimination as " badges and incidents of slavery " . The Thirteenth Amendment applies to the actions of private citizens , while the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments apply only to state actors . The amendment also enables Congress to pass laws against sex trafficking and other modern forms of slavery .

 Section 1 . Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . 
 Section 2 . Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . 
 = = Slavery in the United States = = 
 The institution of slavery existed in all of the original thirteen British North American colonies . Prior to the Thirteenth Amendment , the United States Constitution ( adopted in 1789 ) did not expressly use the words slave or slavery but included several provisions about unfree persons . The Three @-@ Fifths Clause ( in Article I , Section 2 ) allocated Congressional representation based " on the whole Number of free Persons " and " three fifths of all other Persons " . This clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to be counted as ' persons ' for congressional representation and northerners rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South , because representation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to the one @-@ vote @-@ for @-@ one @-@ state principle in the earlier Continental Congress . Under the Fugitive Slave Clause ( Article IV , Section 2 ) , " No person held to Service or Labour in one State " would be freed by escaping to another . Article I , Section 9 allowed Congress to pass legislation outlawing the " Importation of Persons " , but not until 1808 . However , for purposes of the Fifth Amendment — which states that , " No person shall ... be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law " — slaves were understood as property . Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery , it became part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property with Dred Scott v. Sandford ( 1857 ) . 
 Stimulated by the philosophy of the Declaration of Independence between 1777 and 1804 , every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery . Most of the slaves involved were household servants . No Southern state did so , and the slave population of the South continued to grow , peaking at almost 4 million people in 1861 . An abolitionist movement headed by such figures as William Lloyd Garrison grew in strength in the North , calling for the end of slavery nationwide and exacerbating tensions between North and South . The American Colonization Society , an alliance between abolitionists who felt the races should be kept separated and slaveholders who feared the presence of freed blacks would encourage slave rebellions , called for the emigration and colonization of both free blacks and slaves to Africa . Its views were endorsed by politicians such as Henry Clay , who feared that the main abolitionist movement would provoke a civil war . Proposals to eliminate slavery by constitutional amendment were introduced by Representative Arthur Livermore in 1818 and by John Quincy Adams in 1839 , but failed to gain significant traction . 
 As the country continued to expand , the issue of slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue . The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property . The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state , preserving the Senate 's equality between the regions . In 1846 , the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican – American War ; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House , but not the Senate . The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state , instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act , banning the slave trade in Washington , D.C. , and allowing New Mexico and Utah self @-@ determination on the slavery issue . 
 Despite the compromise , tensions between North and South continued to rise over the subsequent decade , inflamed by , amongst other things , the publication of the 1852 anti @-@ slavery novel Uncle Tom 's Cabin ; fighting between pro @-@ slave and abolitionist forces in Kansas , beginning in 1854 ; the 1857 Dred Scott decision , which struck down provisions of the Compromise of 1850 ; abolitionist John Brown 's 1859 attempt to start a slave revolt at Harpers Ferry and the 1860 election of slavery critic Abraham Lincoln to the presidency . The Southern states seceded from the Union in the months following Lincoln 's election , forming the Confederate States of America , and beginning the American Civil War .

 Acting under presidential war powers , Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 , 1863 , which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in the ten states that were still in rebellion . However , it did not affect the status of slaves in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union . That December , Lincoln again used his war powers and issued a " Proclamation for Amnesty and Reconstruction " , which offered Southern states a chance to peacefully rejoin the Union if they abolished slavery and collected loyalty oaths from 10 % of their voting population . Southern states did not readily accept the deal , and the status of slavery remained uncertain . 
 In the final years of the Civil War , Union lawmakers debated various proposals for Reconstruction . Some of these called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery nationally and permanently . On December 14 , 1863 , a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley . Representative James F. Wilson soon followed with a similar proposal . On January 11 , 1864 , Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery . The Senate Judiciary Committee , chaired by Lyman Trumbull , became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment . 
 Radical Republicans led by Senator Charles Sumner and Representative Thaddeus Stevens sought a more expansive version of the amendment . On February 8 , 1864 , Sumner submitted a constitutional amendment stating : 
 All persons are equal before the law , so that no person can hold another as a slave ; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States . 
 Sumner tried to promote his own more expansive wording by circumventing the Trumbull @-@ controlled Judiciary Committee , but failed . On February 10 , the Senate Judiciary Committee presented the Senate with an amendment proposal based on drafts of Ashley , Wilson and Henderson . 
 The Committee 's version used text from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , which stipulates , " There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory , otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted . " Though using Henderson 's proposed amendment as the basis for its new draft , the Judiciary Committee removed language that would have allowed a constitutional amendment to be adopted with only a majority vote in each House of Congress and ratification by two @-@ thirds of the states ( instead of two @-@ thirds and three @-@ fourths , respectively ) . 
 = = = Passage by Congress = = = 
 The Senate passed the amendment on April 8 , 1864 , by a vote of 38 to 6 ; two Democrats , Reverdy Johnson of Maryland and James Nesmith of Oregon voted " aye . " However , just over two months later on June 15 , the House failed to do so , with 93 in favor and 65 against , thirteen votes short of the two @-@ thirds vote needed for passage ; the vote split largely along party lines , with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing . In the 1864 presidential race , former Free Soil Party candidate John C. Frémont threatened a third @-@ party run opposing Lincoln , this time on a platform endorsing an anti @-@ slavery amendment . The Republican Party platform had , as yet , failed to include a similar plank , though Lincoln endorsed the amendment in a letter accepting his nomination . Fremont withdrew from the race on September 22 , 1864 and endorsed Lincoln . 
 With no Southern states represented , few members of Congress pushed moral and religious arguments in favor of slavery . Democrats who opposed the amendment generally made arguments based on federalism and states ' rights . Some argued that the proposed change so violated the spirit of the Constitution that it would not be a valid " amendment " but would instead constitute " revolution " . Representative White , among other opponents , warned that the amendment would lead to full citizenship for blacks . 
 Republicans portrayed slavery as uncivilized and argued for abolition as a necessary step in national progress . Amendment supporters also argued that the slave system had negative effects on white people . These included the lower wages resulting from competition with forced labor , as well as repression of abolitionist whites in the South . Advocates said ending slavery would restore the First Amendment and other constitutional rights violated by censorship and intimidation in slave states . 
 White Northern Republicans , and some Democrats , became excited about an abolition amendment , holding meetings and issuing resolutions . Many blacks , particularly in the South , focused more on landownership and education as the key to liberation . As slavery began to seem politically untenable , an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment , including Representative James Brooks , Senator Reverdy Johnson , and Tammany Hall , a powerful New York political machine . 
 President Lincoln had had concerns that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid after the war . He saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution . He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous . Nonetheless , Lincoln 's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment . After winning the election of 1864 , Lincoln made the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority , beginning his efforts while the " lame duck " session was still in office . Popular support for the amendment <unk> and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6 State of the Union speech : " there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action . And as it is to so go , at all events , may we not agree that the sooner the better ? " 
 Lincoln instructed Secretary of State William H. Seward , Representative John B. Alley and others to procure votes by any means necessary , and they promised government posts and campaign contributions to outgoing Democrats willing to switch sides . Seward had a large fund for direct bribes . Ashley , who reintroduced the measure into the House , also lobbied several Democrats to vote in favor of the measure . Representative Thaddeus Stevens commented later that " the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption , aided and abetted by the purest man in America " ; however , Lincoln 's precise role in making deals for votes remains unknown . 
 Republicans in Congress claimed a mandate for abolition , having gained in the elections for Senate and House . The 1864 Democratic vice @-@ presidential nominee , Representative George H. Pendleton , led opposition to the measure . Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment 's coalition of supporters . In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric , some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact . 
 In mid @-@ January 1865 , Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax estimated the amendment to be five votes short of passage . Ashley postponed the vote . At this point , Lincoln intensified his push for the amendment , making direct emotional appeals to particular members of Congress . On January 31 , 1865 , the House called another vote on the amendment , with neither side being certain of the outcome . With 183 House members present , 122 would have to vote " aye " to secure passage of the resolution ; however eight members abstained , reducing the number to 117 . Every Republican supported the measure , as well as 16 Democrats , almost all of them lame ducks . The amendment finally passed by a vote of 119 to 56 , narrowly reaching the required two @-@ thirds majority . The House exploded into celebration , with some members openly weeping . Black onlookers , who had only been allowed to attend Congressional sessions since the previous year , cheered from the galleries . 
 While under the Constitution , the President plays no formal role in the amendment process , the joint resolution was sent to Lincoln for his signature . Under the usual signatures of the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate , President Lincoln wrote the word " Approved " and added his signature to the joint resolution on February 1 , 1865 . On February 7 , Congress passed a resolution affirming that the Presidential signature was unnecessary . The Thirteenth Amendment is the only ratified amendment signed by a President , although James Buchanan had signed the Corwin Amendment that the 36th Congress had adopted and sent to the states in March 1861 . 
 = = = Ratification by the states = = = 
 When the Thirteenth Amendment was submitted to the states on February 1 , 1865 , it was quickly taken up by several legislatures . By the end of the month it had been ratified by eighteen states . Among them were the ex @-@ Confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana , where ratifications were submitted by Reconstruction governments . These , along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures ; and if there were fewer legislatures than states , if Article V required ratification by three @-@ fourths of the states or three @-@ fourths of the legally valid state legislatures . President Lincoln in his last speech , on April 11 , 1865 , called the question about whether the Southern states were in or out of the Union a " pernicious abstraction . " Obviously , he declared , they were not " in their proper practical relation with the Union " ; whence everyone 's object should be to restore that relation . Lincoln was assassinated three days later . 
 With Congress out of session , the new President , Andrew Johnson , began a period known as " Presidential Reconstruction " , in which he personally oversaw the creation of new state governments throughout the South . He oversaw the convening of state political conventions populated by delegates whom he deemed to be loyal . Three leading issues came before the convention : secession itself , the abolition of slavery , and the Confederate war debt . Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , North Carolina , and South Carolina held conventions in 1865 , while Texas ' convention did not organize until March 1866 . Johnson hoped to prevent deliberation over whether to re @-@ admit the Southern states by accomplishing full ratification before Congress reconvened in December . He believed he could silence those who wished to deny the Southern states their place in the Union by pointing to how essential their assent had been to the successful ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment . 
 Direct negotiations between state governments and the Johnson administration ensued . As the summer wore on , administration officials began including assurances of the measure 's limited scope with their demands for ratification . Johnson himself suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could proactively control the allocation of rights to freedmen . Though Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights , including , as he specified , the right to testify in court , he wanted state lawmakers to know that the power to confer such rights would remain with the states . When South Carolina provisional governor Benjamin Franklin Perry objected to the scope of the amendment 's enforcement clause , Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause " is really restraining in its effect , instead of enlarging the powers of Congress " . White politicians throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite the amendment 's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black suffrage . 
 When South Carolina ratified the amendment in November 1865 , it issued its own interpretive declaration that " any attempt by Congress toward legislating upon the political status of former slaves , or their civil relations , would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States " . Alabama and Louisiana also declared that their ratification did not imply federal power to legislate on the status of former slaves . During the first week of December , North Carolina and Georgia gave the amendment the final votes needed for it to become part of the Constitution . 
 The Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution on December 6 , 1865 , based on the following ratifications : 
 Illinois — February 1 , 1865 
 Rhode Island — February 2 , 1865

 Having been ratified by the legislatures of three @-@ fourths of the several states ( 27 of the 36 states , including those that had been in rebellion ) , Secretary of State Seward , on December 18 , 1865 , certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid , to all intents and purposes , as a part of the Constitution . Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex @-@ Confederate states that had given their assent , but with strings attached . Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment , challenge or acknowledgment . 
 The Thirteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified by : 
 Oregon — December 8 , 1865 
 California — December 19 , 1865 
 Florida — December 28 , 1865 ( <unk> – June 9 , 1869 ) 
 Iowa — January 15 , 1866 
 New Jersey — January 23 , 1866 ( After rejection – March 16 , 1865 )

 Mississippi — March 16 , 1995 ; Certified – February 7 , 2013 ( After rejection – December 5 , 1865 ) 
 The Thirteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution 61 years after the Twelfth Amendment . This is the longest interval between constitutional amendments . 
 = = Effects = = 
 The impact of the abolition of slavery was felt quickly . When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational , the scope of Lincoln 's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation . Although the majority of Kentucky 's slaves had been emancipated , 65 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 people remained to be legally freed when the Amendment went into effect on December 18 . In Delaware , where a large number of slaves had escaped during the war , nine hundred people became legally free . 
 In addition to abolishing slavery and prohibiting involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime , the Thirteenth Amendment also nullified the Fugitive Slave Clause and the Three @-@ Fifths Compromise . The population of a state originally included ( for congressional apportionment purposes ) all " free persons " , three @-@ fifths of " other persons " ( i.e. , slaves ) and excluded untaxed Native Americans . The Three @-@ Fifths Compromise was a provision in the Constitution that required three @-@ fifths of the population of slaves be counted for purposes of apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and taxes among the states . This compromise had the effect of increasing the political power of slave @-@ holding states by increasing their share of seats in the House of Representatives , and consequently their share in the Electoral College ( where a state 's influence over the election of the President is tied to the size of its congressional delegation ) . 
 Even as the Thirteenth Amendment was working its way through the ratification process , Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase the congressional representation of the Democratic @-@ dominated Southern states . Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three @-@ fifths , the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population @-@ based House of Representatives . Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population . 
 = = = Political and economic change in the South = = = 
 Southern culture remained deeply racist , and those blacks who remained faced a dangerous situation . J. J. Gries reported to the Joint Committee on Reconstruction : " There is a kind of innate feeling , a lingering hope among many in the South that slavery will be <unk> in some shape or other . They tried by their laws to make a worse slavery than there was before , for the freedman has not the protection which the master from interest gave him before . " W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1935 : 
 Slavery was not abolished even after the Thirteenth Amendment . There were four million freedmen and most of them on the same plantation , doing the same work that they did before emancipation , except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war . Moreover , they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name . There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or on the streets of the cities , homeless , sick , and impoverished . They had been freed practically with no land nor money , and , save in exceptional cases , without legal status , and without protection . 
 Official emancipation did not substantially alter the economic situation of most blacks who remained in the south . 
 As the amendment still permitted labor as punishment for convicted criminals , Southern states responded with what historian Douglas A. Blackmon called " an array of interlocking laws essentially intended to criminalize black life " . These laws , passed or updated after emancipation , were known as Black Codes . Mississippi was the first state to pass such codes , with an 1865 law titled " An Act to confer Civil Rights on Freedmen " . The Mississippi law required black workers to contract with white farmers by January 1 of each year or face punishment for vagrancy . Blacks could be sentenced to forced labor for crimes including petty theft , using obscene language , or selling cotton after sunset . States passed new , strict vagrancy laws that were selectively enforced against blacks without white protectors . The labor of these convicts was then sold to farms , factories , lumber camps , quarries , and mines . 
 After its ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865 , the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes . The Black Codes created a separate set of laws , punishments , and acceptable behaviors for anyone with more than one black great @-@ grandparent . Under these Codes , Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights . Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent . 
 Some states mandated indefinitely long periods of child " apprenticeship " . Some laws did not target Blacks specifically , but instead affected farm workers , most of whom were Black . At the same time , many states passed laws to actively prevent Blacks from acquiring property . 
 Southern business owners sought to reproduce the profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage , in which ( disproportionately black ) workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt . Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared a large proportion of black workers in the South . These workers remained destitute and persecuted , forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South . Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion . However , a person 's debt — and by extension a person — could still be sold , and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways . 
 = = Congressional and executive enforcement = = 
 As its first enforcement legislation , Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , which guaranteed black Americans citizenship and equal protection of the law , though not the right to vote . The Amendment was also used as authorization for several Freedmen 's Bureau bills . President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills , but a Congressional supermajority overrode his veto to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen 's Bureau Bill . 
 Proponents of the Act including Trumbull and Wilson argued that Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment ( enforcement power ) authorized the federal government to legislate civil rights for the States . Others disagreed , maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery . Seeking more substantial justification , and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation , Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution : the Fourteenth Amendment ( 1868 ) , which defined citizenship and mandated equal protection under the law , and the Fifteenth Amendment ( 1870 ) , which banned racial voting restrictions . 
 The Freedmen 's Bureau enforced the Amendment locally , providing a degree of support for people subject to the Black Codes . ( <unk> , the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau 's legal basis to operate in Kentucky . ) The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts . The Enforcement Acts of 1870 – 1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 , in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy , were also part of the effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks . However , the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South , particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency . 
 = = = Peonage law = = = 
 With the Peonage Act of 1867 , Congress abolished " the holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage " , specifically banning " the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons , in liquidation of any debt or obligation , or otherwise . " 
 In 1939 , the Department of Justice created the Civil Rights Section , which focused primarily on First Amendment and labor rights . The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead @-@ up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude , abroad and at home . The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system . Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle , the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era as the basis for its actions . 
 In 1947 , the DOJ successfully prosecuted Elizabeth Ingalls for keeping domestic servant Dora L. Jones in conditions of slavery . The court found that Jones " was a person wholly subject to the will of defendant ; that she was one who had no freedom of action and whose person and services were wholly under the control of defendant and who was in a state of enforced compulsory service to the defendant . " The Thirteenth Amendment enjoyed a swell of attention during this period , but from Brown v. Board ( 1954 ) until Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co . ( 1968 ) it was again eclipsed by the Fourteenth Amendment .

 Peonage 
 Refers to a person in " debt servitude , " or involuntary servitude tied to the payment of a debt . Compulsion to servitude includes the use of force , the threat of force , or the threat of legal coercion to compel a person to work . 
 Involuntary servitude 
 Refers to a person held by actual force , threats of force , or threats of legal coercion in a condition of slavery – compulsory service or labor against his or her will . This includes the condition in which people are compelled to work by a " climate of fear " evoked by the use of force , the threat of force , or the threat of legal coercion ( i.e. , suffer legal consequences unless compliant with demands made upon them ) which is sufficient to compel service . In Bailey v. Alabama ( 1911 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that peonage laws violated the amendment 's ban on involuntary servitude . 
 Requiring specific performance as a remedy for breach of personal services contracts has been viewed as a form of involuntary servitude by some scholars and courts , though other jurisdictions and scholars have rejected this argument ; it is a popular rule in academia and many local jurisdictions , but has never been upheld by higher courts . 
 Forced labor 
 Labor or service obtained by : 
 threats of serious harm or physical restraint ; 
 any scheme , plan , or pattern intended to cause a person to believe he would suffer serious harm or physical restraint if he did not perform such labor or services : 
 the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process .

 In contrast to the other " Reconstruction Amendments " , the Thirteenth Amendment was rarely cited in later case law . As historian Amy Dru Stanley summarizes , " beyond a handful of landmark rulings striking down debt peonage , <unk> involuntary servitude , and some instances of race @-@ based violence and discrimination , the Thirteenth Amendment has never been a potent source of rights claims " .

 U. S. v. Rhodes ( 1866 ) , one of the first Thirteenth Amendment cases , tested the Constitutionality of provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts . Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites — an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ( " a citizen of the United States of the African race " ) to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her . After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court , the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional . Noah Swayne ( a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court ) overturned the Kentucky decision , holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act , slavery would not truly be abolished . With In Re Turner ( 1867 ) , Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner , a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master . 
 In Blyew v. U.S. , ( 1872 ) the Supreme Court heard another Civil Rights Act case relating to federal courts in Kentucky . John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin of a black family , the Fosters . Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Richard Foster and hit him twice in the head with an ax . Blyew and Kennard killed Richard 's parents , Sallie and Jack Foster , and his blind grandmother , Lucy Armstrong . They severely wounded the Fosters ' two young daughters . Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard . But federal courts , authorized by the Civil Rights Act , found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder . When the Supreme Court took the case , they ruled ( 5 – 2 ) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act . In doing so , the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases . Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented , maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects , the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression . 
 Though based on a technicality , the Blyew case set a precedent in state and federal courts that led to the erosion of Congress 's Thirteenth Amendment powers . The Supreme Court continued along this path in the Slaughter @-@ House Cases ( 1873 ) , which upheld a state @-@ sanctioned monopoly of white butchers . In United States v. Cruikshank ( 1876 ) , the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870 . 
 The Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery , but also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations . As the U.S. Supreme Court explicated in the Slaughter @-@ House Cases ( 1873 ) with respect to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment and the Thirteenth Amendment in special : 
 Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thirteenth article , it forbids any other kind of slavery , now or hereafter . If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory , this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void . And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles , that protection will apply , though the party interested may not be of African descent . But what we do say , and what we wish to be understood is , that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments , it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all , the evil which they were designed to remedy , and the process of continued addition to the Constitution , until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished , as far as constitutional law can accomplish it . 
 In the Civil Rights Cases ( 1883 ) , the Supreme Court reviewed five consolidated cases dealing with the Civil Rights Act of 1875 , which outlawed racial discrimination at " inns , public conveyances on land or water , theaters , and other places of public amusement " . The Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not ban most forms of racial discrimination by non @-@ government actors . In the majority decision , Bradley wrote ( again in non @-@ binding dicta ) that the Thirteenth Amendment empowered Congress to attack " badges and incidents of slavery " . However , he distinguished between " fundamental rights " of citizenship , protected by the Thirteenth Amendment , and the " social rights of men and races in the community " . The majority opinion held that " it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain , or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car ; or admit to his concert or theatre , or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business . " In his solitary dissent , John Marshall Harlan ( a Kentucky lawyer who changed his mind about civil rights law after witnessing organized racist violence ) argued that " such discrimination practiced by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi @-@ public functions is a badge of servitude , the imposition of which congress may prevent under its power . " 
 The Court in the Civil Rights Cases also held that appropriate legislation under the amendment could go beyond nullifying state laws establishing or upholding slavery , because the amendment " has a reflex character also , establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout the United States " and thus Congress was empowered " to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States . " The Court stated about the scope the amendment : 
 This amendment , as well as the Fourteenth , is undoubtedly self @-@ executing , without any ancillary legislation , so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances . By its own unaided force and effect , it abolished slavery and established universal freedom . Still , legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it , and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit . And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character , for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery , but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States . 
 Attorneys in Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) argued that racial segregation involved " observances of a servile character coincident with the incidents of slavery " , in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment . In their brief to the Supreme Court , Plessy 's lawyers wrote that " distinction of race and caste " was inherently unconstitutional . The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning and upheld state laws enforcing segregation under the " separate but equal " doctrine . In the ( 7 – 1 ) majority decision , the Court found that " a statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races — a distinction which is founded on the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from the other race by color — has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races , or reestablish a state of involuntary servitude . " Harlan dissented , writing : " The thin disguise of ' equal ' accommodations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead any one , nor , atone for the wrong this day done . " 
 In Hodges v. United States ( 1906 ) , the Court struck down a federal statute providing for the punishment of two or more people who " conspire to injure , oppress , threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States " . A group of white men in Arkansas conspired to violently prevent eight black workers from performing their jobs at a lumber mill ; the group was convicted by a federal grand jury . The Supreme Court ruled that the federal statute , which outlawed conspiracies to deprive citizens of their liberty , was not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment . It held that " no mere personal assault or trespass or appropriation operates to reduce the individual to a condition of slavery " . Harlan dissented , maintaining his opinion that the Thirteenth Amendment should protect freedom beyond " physical restraint " . Corrigan v. Buckley ( 1922 ) reaffirmed the interpretation from Hodges , finding that the amendment does not apply to restrictive covenants . 
 Enforcement of federal civil rights law in the South created numerous peonage cases , which slowly traveled up through the judiciary . The Supreme Court ruled in <unk> v. United States ( 1905 ) that peonage was involuntary servitude . It held that although employers sometimes described their workers ' entry into contract as voluntary , the servitude of peonage was always ( by definition ) involuntary . 
 In Bailey v. Alabama the U.S. Supreme Court again reaffirmed its holding that Thirteenth Amendment was not solely a ban on chattel slavery , but also covers a much broader array of labor arrangements and social deprivations In addition to the aforesaid the Court also ruled on Congress enforcement power under the Thirteenth Amendment . The Court said : 
 The plain intention [ of the amendment ] was to abolish slavery of whatever name and form and all its badges and incidents ; to render impossible any state of bondage ; to make labor free , by prohibiting that control by which the personal service of one man is disposed of or coerced for another 's benefit , which is the essence of involuntary servitude . While the Amendment was self @-@ executing , so far as its terms were applicable to any existing condition , Congress was authorized to secure its complete enforcement by appropriate legislation . 
 = = = = Jones and beyond = = = = 
 Legal histories cite Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co . ( 1968 ) as a turning point of Thirteen Amendment jurisprudence . The Supreme Court confirmed in Jones that Congress may act " rationally " to prevent private actors from imposing " badges and incidents of servitude " . The Joneses were a black couple in St. Louis County , Missouri who sued a real estate company for refusing to sell them a house . The Court held : 
 Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery , and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation . [ ... ] this Court recognized long ago that , whatever else they may have encompassed , the badges and incidents of slavery -- its " burdens and disabilities " -- included restraints upon " those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom , namely , the same right . . . to inherit , purchase , lease , sell and convey property , as is enjoyed by white citizens . " Civil Rights Cases , 109 U. S. 3 , 109 U. S. 22 . 
 Just as the Black Codes , enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights , were substitutes for the slave system , so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes . And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin , then it too is a relic of slavery . 
 Negro citizens , North and South , who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom — freedom to " go and come at pleasure " and to " buy and sell when they please " — would be left with " a mere paper guarantee " if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man . At the very least , the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy , the right to live wherever a white man can live . If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much , then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep . 
 The Court in Jones reopened the issue of linking racism in contemporary society to the history of slavery in the United States . 
 The Jones precedent has been used to justify Congressional action to protect migrant workers and target sex trafficking . The direct enforcement power found in the Thirteenth Amendment contrasts with that of the Fourteenth , which allows only responses to institutional discrimination of state actors .

 The Supreme Court has taken an especially narrow view of involuntary servitude claims made by people not descended from black ( African ) slaves . In Robertson v. Baldwin ( 1897 ) , a group of merchant seaman challenged federal statutes which criminalized a seaman 's failure to complete their contractual term of service . The Court ruled that seamen 's contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial , and that " the amendment was not intended to introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional . " In this case , as in numerous " badges and incidents " cases , Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections . 
 In Selective Draft Law Cases , the Supreme Court ruled that the military draft was not " involuntary servitude " . In United States v. <unk> , the Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment did not prohibit compulsion of servitude through psychological coercion . <unk> defined involuntary servitude for purposes of criminal prosecution as " a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process . This definition encompasses cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion . " 
 The U.S. Courts of Appeals , in <unk> v. Rye Neck School District , Herndon v. Chapel Hill , and <unk> v. Bethlehem School District , have ruled that the use of community service as a high school graduation requirement did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment .

 During the six decades following the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress and sent to the states for ratification . Neither has been ratified by the number of states necessary to become part of the Constitution . Commonly known as the Titles of Nobility Amendment and the Corwin Amendment , both are referred to as Article Thirteen , as was the successful Thirteenth Amendment , in the joint resolution passed by Congress . 
 The Titles of Nobility Amendment ( pending before the states since May 1 , 1810 ) would , if ratified , strip citizenship from any United States citizen who accepts a title of nobility or honor from a foreign country without the consent of Congress . 
 The Corwin Amendment ( pending before the states since March 2 , 1861 ) would , if ratified , shield " domestic institutions " of the states ( in 1861 this was a common euphemism for slavery ) from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress .

 " Empire State of Mind " is a song written by Angela Hunte and Jane 't " <unk> " Sewell @-@ Ulepic and produced by American rapper Jay @-@ Z , featuring vocals sung by American singer Alicia Keys . It was released as the third single from Jay @-@ Z 's 11th studio album , The Blueprint 3 ( 2009 ) , by his Roc Nation label in October 2009 . The song was written as a tribute to both artists ' hometown , New York City , and features a music sample of " Love on a Two @-@ Way Street " ( 1970 ) , written by Sylvia Robinson and Bert Keyes and performed by The Moments . The following month they submitted the song to Jay @-@ Z 's Roc Nation , whose reviews were a discouragement . Following an incident that Hunte and Sewell @-@ Ulepic describe as an omen , they took the suggestion of an associate of EMI Music Publishing and resubmitted it to Jay @-@ Z , who kept the " New York " singing part on the hook , changed the verses , and recorded it as a single . 
 The single was supposed to feature Hunte on the song 's hook , but when Hunte and Sewell @-@ Ulepic were asked if they thought anyone else would be more appropriate for the chorus , Hunte suggested Keys . Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part , but Keys was chosen after Jay @-@ Z heard the song 's piano loop . The song was viewed as being an " orchestral rap ballad " and has pop @-@ rap musical styles . It contains references to various locations in New York and its famous residents , while describing the city 's essence . Profanity is present throughout the song and , although it is usually included during live performances , it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series . 
 A critical success , the song was included in multiple critics ' top 10 list for the best songs of 2009 ; including Rolling Stone magazine and the New York Times . The song was also nominated for three Grammy Awards , winning Best Rap Song and Best Rap / Sung Collaboration . " Empire State of Mind " achieved commercial success worldwide . The track peaked within the top 10 in countries including the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , France , Italy and Sweden . The single was commercially successful in the United States , peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks , becoming Jay @-@ Z 's first number @-@ one single on the chart as a lead artist . It appeared in 2009 year @-@ end charts in Italy , Australia and the US , where the song was also the last number one hit of the 2000s . As of June 2014 , the single has sold over 5 @.@ 5 million copies in the United States . 
 In the song 's music video , which is primarily in black @-@ and @-@ white , Jay @-@ Z and Keys are shown performing the song in various locations in New York . " Empire State of Mind " has been performed by Jay @-@ Z and Keys multiple times , including during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2009 American Music Awards . Usually when the duo performs the song , an overhead screen shows images of places in New York . Keys has recorded a sequel entitled " Empire State of Mind ( Part II ) Broken Down " , which is featured on her fourth studio album The Element of Freedom ( 2009 ) . Her version was positively received by critics and did well commercially , although it was not as successful as its predecessor . It was , however , Top 10 in the UK , the Netherlands and Ireland . She said that she chose to record her own version of " Empire State of Mind " because she wanted to express her own personal feelings about New York . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 " Empire State of Mind " was originally created by singer @-@ songwriter @-@ producer Angela Hunte , a native of Brooklyn , along with writing partner Jane 't " <unk> " Sewell @-@ Ulepic . Hunte grew up in the same building where rapper and hip hop artist Jay @-@ Z lived — 560 State Street , an address which is mentioned in the song . The track 's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell @-@ Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick . Hunte was ill during that summer , while Sewell @-@ Ulepic 's mother was ill . Hunte recalls , " We said to ourselves , ' we complain so much about New York — about the busy streets , about the crowds and the pushing , about the subway system — but I would trade that for anything right now . ' Before we left the hotel that night , we knew we would write a song about our city . " Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown , they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay @-@ Z would like it and record it . When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded . However , in the summer of the same year , EMI Music Publishing 's ( EMI ) Jon " Big Jon " Platt heard the track at a barbecue and fell in love with it , believing that " it would be perfect for Jay @-@ Z " . 
 Hunte and Sewell @-@ Ulepic were hesitant though , as they had sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful . According to Hunte , when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt — a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they 've blasted music — she realized it was an omen . She commented , " We all just looked at each other like , ' if Biggie approves , then , send it to Jay ' " . The next day Platt sent it to Jay @-@ Z and he " loved it and recorded it that night " . Hunte recalls , " We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production . Two female producers / writers , and for him as a rapper to take our song — that 's not a combination you see a lot . For him to be so open @-@ minded about it , we just couldn 't be any more grateful and thankful . " Originally composed as a song to be sung , Jay @-@ Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song 's hook . However , when Hunte and Sewell @-@ Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus , Hunte suggested R & B and soul artist Alicia Keys . Hunte said , " She 's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone . She made the song sound so close to the original , She just nailed it and brought it home . It was a great choice . " Keys also contributed to writing " Empire State of Mind " ' s new bridge . 
 Jay @-@ Z stated in an interview that after he first heard the track 's piano loops ( which are sampled from " Love on a Two @-@ Way Street " by The Moments ) , he immediately thought of Keys and wanted her to be featured on the song . Jay @-@ Z said that Mary J. Blige was initially considered for Keys ' part on " Empire State of Mind " and admitted that he was " two seconds away " from asking Blige to appear on the record 's chorus . His second choice for the track 's vocals was Keys and that using Blige on the song would have been a safe move , but said that the combination of Keys ' sound and piano talent had struck a chord with him . In December 2009 Hunte , who would not reveal many details , said the original version of " Empire State of Mind " will one day be released , adding that " The original is so powerful it 's only a matter of time till you hear it down the line " .

" noting that he 's " one of those waffling retirees " , but is a living " hip hop legend " . 
 Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News felt that Keys " croons " on the track 's chorus line , " I 'm from <unk> <unk> / These streets will make you feel brand @-@ new / Bright lights will inspire you . " Keys said that while recording the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining , " I did try it a couple of times , but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it . With the way I sang it the first time , I was actually kind of sick , and I knew that he needed the record , so I was like , ' Let me get to it . ' " She added , " I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now [ . ] So it actually took a couple of times , but every time , the energy was just so high . " Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song 's hook has a " crucial role " , believing that " Empire State of Mind " is a " smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play , and it just wouldn 't work without a big , clear voice to sing that hook " . In November 2012 , Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay @-@ Z said he wasn 't happy with her original take . Keys said she had been battling " nasal congestion " when she did the first take .

Jay @-@ Z also performed the song at the Yankees ' World Series victory ceremonies in New York City Hall on November 6 , 2009 . Keys was not in attendance for the performance , so singer and Roc Nation recording artist Bridget Kelly filled in . As the last verse of the song was sung , Yankee members got up from their seats to shower Jay @-@ Z with handshakes and hugs . 
 The single was also performed by Jay @-@ Z and Keys at the American Music Awards ( AMA ) on November 22 , 2009 . They began their performance of " Empire State of Mind " with a rendition of Frank Sinatra 's " New York , New York " . Keys played on a piano on a stage with blue lights in front of a backdrop that had tall buildings . Also , the words " New York " scrolled across screens on the stage . Towards the end of the song , Keys sung with Jay @-@ Z at the front of the stage while holding up a " I love you " sign . Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times felt that the song had " worn out its welcome " , and gave the performance a letter grade " D " . However , Jeremy Blacklow of Access Hollywood had a more positive feeling towards the performance , describing it as being " so great " in his live blog for the award ceremony . " Empire State of Mind " was performed by Jay @-@ Z and Alicia Keys at the 2010 BRIT Awards on February 16 , 2010 . The Guardian wrote that Jay @-@ Z and Alicia Keys " dazzled with their rendition of " Empire State of Mind " " . The Daily Mail commented on the performance that it was " a rare highlight in a show of lowlights " . According to Metro , Jay @-@ Z and Alicia Keys " blew the place away " with their performance and " Jay @-@ Z was given a welcome befitting a cultural hero " while " Keys oozed elegance and soul as her startlingly powerful voice stopped everyone in their tracks ” . The Nation opined that the pair " delivered a powerful rendition " of the song . 
 In March , Jay @-@ Z joined Keys onstage during one of her Freedom Tours New York concerts to perform " Empire State of Mind " , while images of New York were shown throughout the concert arena . Jay @-@ Z performed " Empire State of Mind " as well as three of his other singles , at California 's Coachella music festival in April 2010 . Jay @-@ Z performed the song live on an episode of Saturday Night Live on May 9 , 2010 . Jay @-@ Z performed the song with a medley of his other singles , including " On to the Next One " . Jay @-@ Z wore a white T @-@ shirt with a black leather vest while performing the song on a stage light by blue lights , with musicians playing instruments in the far back . Caitlyn <unk> of San Diego 's NBC felt that Jay @-@ Z " brought the house down " during his performances of the melodies . Rodriguez of MTV News said that Bridget Kelly , who sang Keys ' part , " turned more than a few heads " because the outfit she was wearing was " tighter than her boss ' rhyme " .

 Following the release of " Empire State of Mind " in January 2010 , Keys stated that she was planning to release a second version of the song as a single the following month , featuring only her vocals . The track , entitled " Empire State of Mind ( Part II ) Broken Down " , appeared on Keys ' fourth studio album The Element of Freedom which was released in December 2009 . The original version , entitled " Empire State of Mind Part 2 " , included both Keys ' vocals and a new rap verse from Jay @-@ Z , but the final product did not include Jay @-@ Z. Discussing the record , Keys claimed that it acts as a dichotomy of strength and vulnerability , commenting that " The music is really strong , and the drums are really aggressive , but my voice is vulnerable and delicate " . 
 " Empire State of Mind ( Part II ) Broken Down " was generally well received by contemporary music critics in their reviews for The Element of Freedom . Allison Stewart of The Washington Post noted that the track , which is a pop ballad , had replaced " Empire State of Mind " sports team references and ruminations with " even milder and less controversial string of generalities " , highlighting Keys ' version 's lyrics " If I could make it here / I could make it anywhere " . The track was not as commercially successful as " Empire State of Mind " , peaking at number four in the United Kingdom , number forty on the Canadian Hot 100 , and number sixty @-@ nine in Sweden . It also debuted on the Billboard R & B charts at number seventy @-@ seven and peaked at number fifty @-@ five on the Billboard Hot 100 without an official release .

 The comedy website CollegeHumor parodied the song in a video titled " Galactic Empire State of Mind " which re @-@ writes the lyrics to follow the events of the first three Star Wars films from the perspective of Darth Vader . The video has been viewed nearly four million times on YouTube . 
 The music video for " Newport ( Ymerodraeth State of Mind ) " parodies the song , replacing references to the " Empire State " of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport . In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means " empire " . " Newport ( Ymerodraeth State of Mind ) " was directed by British filmmaker M @-@ J Delaney and featured London @-@ based actors Alex Warren and <unk> Wainwright , rapping and singing respectively . Days after its release Delaney said : " I hope Jay @-@ Z and Alicia get to see the video as long as their publishing people don 't force us to take it offline . It 's only tongue in cheek . " Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers . Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport Transporter Bridge . It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and , by August 2010 , nearly 2 @.@ 5 million people had watched it on YouTube . In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records ( the music publishers ) to discuss releasing the track as a single , with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind . But the seven co @-@ writers of " Empire State of Mind " refused to give permission for the Newport single , a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10 . 
 " Empire State of Mind " was covered by the cast of the US television series Glee for the second season premiere episode " Audition " on September 21 , 2010 . In the episode the fictional William McKinley High School glee club , upon learning that Nationals will be held in New York , decide to perform " Empire State of Mind " at the school courtyard , in the hopes it will pique the interest of their schoolmates . MTV 's Kyle Anderson felt that the choreography of " Empire State of Mind " compensated for any awkwardness in its delivery . Aly Semigran , also writing for the same publication , thought the cast 's performance was lacking the gravitas of the original version , but reported that Keys had deemed the Glee cover " amazing " . Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post found the song 's performance to be " maybe @-@ trying @-@ too @-@ hard " . Music critic Tom Stack , of Entertainment Weekly , had a more positive assessment of Glee 's take on it in the episode , stating that from the wardrobe to the choreography , it was " spectacular " and <unk> . He gave it a letter grade of " A " . MTV Buzzworthy wrote that " [ t ] hings get a little dicey when the male cast members make their way through Jay ’ s rapped first verse " . Glee 's cover version was released as a single and debuted at number twenty @-@ one on the Billboard Hot 100 , taking the title for biggest jump of that week . It also charted number twenty in Australia . 
 In 2010 , American alternative dance band LCD Soundsystem played " Empire State of Mind " in concert , performing a verse of the song as a duet between James Murphy and keyboardist Nancy Whang . In May 2011 , at 64th Cannes Film Festival , British singer @-@ songwriter Jamie Cullum performed a piano medley of Frank Sinatra 's " New York , New York " and " Empire State of Mind " in honour of Robert De Niro . In February 2012 , British singer Ed Sheeran did a soulful acoustic rendition of the song at BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge . Sheeran later sang it as a duet with Jason Mraz at the Jingle Ball Viewing Party in December 2012 . In April 2012 , British glam rock band Sweet released an updated version of the Hello and Ace Frehley hit single " New York Groove " that incorporated the chorus of " Empire State of Mind " into its own chorus . 
 The song was also parodied in The Simpsons episode " The Food Wife " as " <unk> ' a Food Blog " , sung by Tim Heidecker , Eric Wareheim and Carmen Carter .

 = Richard Mohun = 
 Richard Dorsey Loraine Mohun ( April 12 , 1864 – July 13 , 1915 ) was an American explorer , diplomat , mineral prospector and mercenary . Mohun worked for the United States government as a commercial agent in Angola and the Congo Free State . During his time as commercial agent , he volunteered to command a unit of Belgian artillery in a campaign to force Arab slavers from the colony . 
 Mohun remained in the service of the US government during this time and was subsequently posted as consul to Zanzibar . In this capacity , he was called upon to act as an intermediary between the combatants in the Anglo @-@ Zanzibar War . Following the conclusion of his three @-@ year posting , Mohun returned to the Congo to prospect for minerals , and later worked with the Belgian authorities . 
 His most ambitious undertaking was a three @-@ year expedition , beginning in 1898 , that laid a telegraph line from Lake Tanganyika to Stanley Falls . He then spent some time prospecting in South Africa before returning to the Congo to reform the Abir Congo Company on behalf of Leopold II of Belgium . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Richard Dorsey Mohun was born in Washington , D.C. on April 12 , 1864 . Mohun 's family had a long association with Africa - his grandfather , William McKenny , had been a prominent figure during the colonisation of the continent and built up a comprehensive collection of photographs during his time there . Mohun , who was privately tutored at the family home , is known to have seen these photographs whilst growing up . Mohun developed an interest in the slave trade , which continued under Arab control in Eastern and Southern Africa , and became the fourth member of his family to campaign for its eradication . Mohun 's sister , Lee intended to train as a nun to join a Catholic mission in the Congo , where the slavers were active , and was only dissuaded by her family who asked her to minister to African @-@ Americans in Washington instead . 
 Mohun received a commission in the Pay Corps of the United States Navy in 1881 and served on a four @-@ year cruise in the Mediterranean . His grandmother , religious writer Anna Hanson Dorsey , arranged for him to meet her acquaintance , Monsignor Denis J. O 'Connell , at the Pontifical North American College in Rome in 1885 . Mohun was appointed Assistant Paymaster in 1885 and served with the United States Department of the Navy upon his return from the cruise . He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1889 , the same year he reigned his navy commission to join the United States Department of State . 
 Mohun and his brother , Louis , were involved in the short @-@ lived Nicaragua Canal Construction Company , a private American enterprise seeking link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans . Louis had been on survey expeditions with the company since 1888 and construction works began at Corinto in 1890 . Richard secured a position as an auditor with the company 's transportation division by 1891 but the project was hit by tropical disease and the Mohuns returned home to Washington by January 1892 . 
 = = United States agent in the Congo = = 
 The well @-@ connected Anna Hanson Dorsey was close friends with the mother of the American Secretary of State James Blaine and Blaine and Dorsey shared ties with Notre Dame University . Dorsey was able to use this influence to arrange the appointment of Mohun as US commercial agent to the Congo Free State on 22 January 1892 , filling a vacancy caused by the death @-@ in @-@ post of US Navy Lieutenant Emory <unk> the previous year . The US had maintained an agent in the Congo ever since it had been formally recognised and the commercial agent also acted as the nation 's diplomatic representative to the Free State . The post came with a $ 5 @,@ 000 annual budget and a remit to investigate the commercial potential of Congo and to promote trade between the two countries , which previously had been almost non @-@ existent . Mohun was appointed ahead of the missionary Samuel Norvell Lapsley who had been championed by a state senator from Alabama . 
 Mohun left America for Genoa , Italy with Louis and their sister , Laura . The three travelled in Europe for 2 – 3 months before Mohun reported to Brussels to meet with King Leopold II who , in spite of his callous reputation , impressed him with his apparent ambition to bring peace and western civilization to the Congo . Mohun then journeyed to the Congo with Louis , who was to act as his sub @-@ agent . The US commercial post in the Free State was then at Boma near the Atlantic coast , but Mohun also operated from Léopoldville , further inland . In July 1892 he assisted US citizen Warren C. <unk> in establishing a rubber factory on the <unk> River near <unk> for the Société <unk> belge pour le commerce du Haut @-@ Congo . <unk> , a plantation manager in Costa Rica , had imported experienced rubber cutters from South America to begin the enterprise but came under attack from tribesmen and a Belgian force had to be dispatched to provide security . Mohun spent much of his time in exploration of the country 's interior , visiting several areas where no white man had ever ventured and making a survey of the quality of the agricultural land and the crops grown by the native population . 
 Mohun frequently came into conflict with the native tribesmen . When his mail bag and personal papers were stolen and a local chief refused to return them he proceeded to wage war on the chief accompanied by four gunmen and a steamboat . Mohun attacked and burnt at least ten villages before he captured the chief 's son whom he threatened to hang . In return for his son 's life the chief returned the mail bag , alongside a second that Mohun had not noticed was missing . Another time , seeking to view the native method of making cloth , he visited a remote town accompanied by only six followers covertly armed with revolvers . The party came under attack by spears and poisoned arrows . Having fought off their assailants Mohun captured the town and " burned it to the ground to teach them a lesson " . Mohun was always conscious of his public image and wrote a diary with a view to later publication . Mohun 's diary contains little in the way of self @-@ criticism and he reflects upon his responsibility for this incident by stating that he was " satisfied in my own conscience that I had rid the country of a brute and unnecessary member of society . " On another occasion he witnessed the funeral of a local chief who had four of his wives and 10 slaves buried alive with him . Mohun was unable to intervene , in spite of his horror at the situation , as he had only a small escort and was heavily outnumbered . 
 Mohun , who came under attack five or six times within six months , blamed much of the violence on Arab slavers who Mohun claimed had directed the killing of all of the white men in the east of the country and allowed their bodies to be eaten by cannibals . The slavers , who originated from the East coast of Africa , were in conflict with the heavily @-@ outnumbered Belgian authorities in the Congo Arab War . Francis , Baron Dhanis , vice @-@ governor general to the Free State , had been leading an expedition against slavers - who were led by <unk> , the son of Tippu Tip - since July 1892 . 
 = = Chaltin Expedition = = 
 In 1893 Mohun was appointed commander of the artillery attached to a Belgian expedition , commanded by Louis Napoléon Chaltin , sent against the slavers led by <unk> . Mohun had risen to the position owing to the illness of the original Chief of Artillery , a Belgian Army officer , and joined the expedition via the steamer Bruxelles sometime after it had started off from <unk> . Just prior to his joining the expedition had destroyed entirely the 1 @,@ 200 @-@ house village of <unk> . Mohun accompanied the expedition to Bena @-@ Kamba where the party suffered an outbreak of smallpox before 555 of the survivors continued on towards Riba Riba . The expedition passed through <unk> , entirely deserted except for an array of 16 severed heads left as a warning by the slavers . Around this time Mohun led part of the expedition into a village where he disturbed a cannibal feast , he arrested the village chief who was tried and hanged . On another occasion he was traversing the jungle alone when he came across 6 armed Arab slavers in a clearing . In the subsequent fight he killed four of the slavers before the remaining two fled . 
 On March 29 the Chaltin Expedition reached a deep stream and , in searching for a fording place , came across a large group of Arab slavers . The expedition launched a surprise attack on the camp , supported by an artillery piece , and routed them after several hours fighting . The expedition found only one dead body left on the field , though it was supposed that the Arabs had lost more men and carried the bodies away with them in retreat . Mohun was with a force of 150 men sent over the stream to Riba Riba with the intention of reaching the town before the retreating slavers could give warning . Once again they encountered a deserted town , except for two hands nailed to a flagstaff taken from the corpses of two European men killed the week before . Mohun 's group burned the town to the ground before returning to the main party of the expedition . The force suffered another outbreak of smallpox and it was decided to send the sick back to the steamer at Bene @-@ Kamba . The main force rested for a number of days before following on . During the three @-@ day march the expedition encountered the bodies of the sick that had died on the return journey and a roll call at Bene @-@ Kamba revealed some 104 men had died in the first 2 weeks of the expedition . 
 The expedition proceeded by the steamer to Stanley Falls and split into two detachments . One attacked the slaver 's factory and the other their nearby boma under supporting artillery fire from the steamer . Some 75 slavers were killed , including their chief , and a further 100 slaves , soldiers , women and retainers taken prisoner . The slavers , comprehensively defeated , were driven from the country and the war effectively brought to a close . Mohun accompanied a force sent to investigate the slavers town of <unk> and discovered it to already be in the hands of Congo State forces . At <unk> Mohun encountered several of the Belgian native troops engaging in cannibalism of the dead Arabs . This practice had been outlawed by Chaltin and was punishable by death . Mohun recorded that he fired a single shot which put an end to the matter . 
 Mohun then marched 500 miles with the expedition to Kasongo , the former home of Tippu Tip , in January 1894 . There his force of 1 @,@ 400 native auxiliaries and porters and 150 soldiers joined with Dhanis ' 26 @,@ 000 men for an assault on the fortified town . In the subsequent fighting the Belgian forces , assisted by artillery , killed 3 @,@ 000 of the slaver 's men , blew up their powder magazines and burnt the town . Still in Kasongo by February Mohun had intended to take a force of some sixty soldiers , 100 porters and 90 others to Tanganyika where he planned to catch a steamer to South Africa to arrange passage to the Congolese coast . From there he planned to settle his affairs , resign his post and return to America . He hoped in the process to intercept a slave caravan that had been fleeing eastwards from the expedition loaded with slaves , ivory and gold . 
 Instead Mohun , recognised for the leading role he played in many of the engagements , was in March 1894 appointed by Dhanis to be second @-@ in @-@ command of an expedition to determine whether there was a navigable watercourse between Lake Tanganyika and the upper <unk> River . The expedition encountered difficulties in traversing the terrain and waterways of the country and with hostile natives . Mohun discovered the confluence of the <unk> and <unk> rivers and was able to disprove the existence of Lake <unk> , which had been marked on many maps at this location . The river itself proved to be highly variable ranging from <unk> to just 90m in width , contained in gorges up to <unk> deep and with one 110 km stretch proving entirely unnavigable by canoe . Mohun recorded that the soil in the valley was highly fertile , the local Barua people quite numerous and named two new peaks Mount Dhanis and Mount Cleveland . 
 The expedition reached as far as Mount <unk> on the <unk> River when its commander , Dr Sidney Langford Hinde , fell ill with an abscess on the liver , Mohun assumed command from 11 April and successfully completed the remainder of the task . Mohun delivered Hinde , who was incapable even of sitting upright or eating , through native attacks to Kasongo on 25 April . Hinde 's abscess , which could not be treated as there was no other doctor nearer than <unk> , successfully resolved itself by bursting during travel and saved his life . 
 In April 1894 whilst at Kasongo Mohun 's sergeant Omari bo <unk> , who had been Stanley 's chief sergeant in the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition , identified two men who had murdered Emin Pasha on the orders of the slaver <unk> . Mohun questioned the pair , garnered their confessions and sent them for trial after which they were hanged . During his time in the Congo Mohun also took part in big @-@ game hunting killing 20 elephants and 50 leopards within two years . 
 In this role Mohun was given responsibility for the government of some five million natives and tasked with improving internal markets in the country . 
 Mohun continued his work to eradicate the slave trade , made several surveying expeditions , established new trade markets , and assisted in the suppression of cannibalism . He estimated that there were 20 million cannibals in the Free State , and spoke of witnessing both a cannibal feast , and the practice of burying people alive . Mohun 's work in the Congo has been described as the last " spectacular contribution " by an American in opening up the country . The record he kept of this expedition was used by Belgian author and cartographer AJ Wauters to compose a map of the Lomami River , which was published in 1901 . 
 Mohun had remained US commercial agent throughout this time , and insisted on drawing no pay from the Belgian government for his services , though he did receive $ 5000 from the Société Anonyme Belge pour le commerce du Haut @-@ Congo . Although he never held a commission in the Belgian Army during this , and later expeditions , he would often wear a uniform to maintain discipline amongst his men . Mohun is quoted as saying , of the reason for choosing to assist the Belgian military operations , that " I prefer killing Arabs in the interior to killing time at Boma " . In 1894 , he was awarded honorary membership of the Société Royale Belge de Géographie ( Royal Belgian Geographical Society ) , and Leopold I appointed him a chevalier of the Royal Order of the Lion for his accomplishments in the slaver war . Mohun also received decorations from the United Kingdom and France for his work in the Congo . Mohun 's stated priority in the Congo was to improve conditions for the inhabitants by bringing them within the Belgian sphere of influence . He also claimed that the popular image of Belgian brutality in the region was a lie spread by missionaries — a statement contradicted by evidence of unnecessary cruelty by Belgian troops . 
 It seems that Mohun later had second thoughts about the removal of the Arab slavers from the Congo and their replacement by pro @-@ Belgian Congolese village chiefs . In the late 1890s he made his views known to Roger Casement , the British @-@ Irish diplomat who was then campaigning for reform in the Congo . Mohun stated " we were all called upon to admire as an achievement of civilisation over barbarism " the removal of the Arab slavers but that " I believe the Arabs when they permanently occupied a country did a very great deal of good , much more than they will ever be given credit for " . It was then his , and Casement 's , belief that " slavery still exists ... For the native I believe the change has been for the worst as they certainly don 't have the same respect for a dirty native chief as they had for the powerful Arab always clean , and even the worst of them with the manners of gentlemen " . Mohun also recounts the case of <unk> , a town of 3 @,@ 000 houses and up to 45 @,@ 000 inhabitants that he encountered , within a year of a Free State army post being established there the town had been completely destroyed . In 1896 he noted that one of the Belgian generals had encouraged the cruelty and that the situation improved after he was recalled by King Leopold .

 Due to the frequent expeditions Mohun carried out in the Congo , Mohun was unable to spend much time on his duties as commercial agent . The US State Department was , perhaps surprisingly , pleased with Mohun 's undiplomatic conduct in assisting the Belgians . This may have been because he did not receive a salary for his work and assisted in making the Congo more commercially stable . Mohun left the Congo and returned to the United States where he married Harriette Louise Barry from New York and had his Congo report presented to Congress . After a short period of leave Mohun was appointed to be the State Department 's Consul to Zanzibar on May 24 , 1895 . His appointment , which he then held until November 22 , 1897 , may have been a reward for his work in the Free State . Mohun was not replaced as commercial agent and the office ceased to exist in July 1895 - the next US government appointment to the Free State was not until 1906 when a consul @-@ general was appointed . Mohun arranged a period of five minutes between his resignation as commercial agent and acceptance of the post of consul so that he could accept his Order of the Lion without contravening the US constitutions Title of Nobility Clause that prohibits those holding public office from accepting gifts from foreign powers . Harriette accompanied Mohun to Zanzibar and , on April 18 , 1896 , gave birth to their first son , Reginald Dorsey Mohun . Casement served as Reginald 's godfather and , shortly after his birth , sent him an autographed copy of his " Careless Chicken " fable . 
 During his time on the island , he became involved in the Anglo @-@ Zanzibar War of 27 August 1896 , as an intermediary between the Sultan of Zanzibar and the British authorities . He reported the outcome of the war and the safety of all American subjects to the State Department on the same morning . In return for his services and conduct during the engagement , he was decorated by the new Sultan . During the course of the war Mohun compiled a portfolio of photographs that he later published . After the war Mohun served as a mediator between the Sultan and the British authorities . On 6 July 1897 he informed his superiors of an outbreak of smallpox on the island among the Indian and native population and that an English missionary had been attacked for carrying a victim around in his arms . Mohun was concerned that the outbreak might spread to the white population and noted that vaccination doses had been ordered from Marseilles for the native population . 
 During his time in Africa Mohun had acquired a leopard cub after killing its mother , who was attacking the livestock of a native village . He named the young male Dijini ( " Devil " ) and raised him in his house . During a visit to Europe Dijini accompanied his master in his carriage . After terrifying the staff and residents of a hotel in Antwerp Mohun was forced to cage the leopard . Despite receiving several bids from menagerie @-@ owners Mohun made a gift of the animal to the Washington Zoo and arranged to have him shipped to his hometown . Mohun returned to Washington six months layer , upon completion of his posting in Zanzibar , and visited his former pet . Mohun amazed staff at the zoo by jumping the railings and passing his hand between the bars of Dijini 's enclosure to allow the animal to lick his hand . 
 = = Tanganyika @-@ Nile telegraph expedition = = 
 Mohun 's appointment at <unk> ended in November 1897 and he returned to Belgium with Harriette , purchasing a house in Brussels . Harriette remained at this house during the rest of Mohun 's subsequent postings in Africa . Mohun was contacted by the Belgian government , which had been impressed by his work on behalf of the United States , and was appointed a district commissioner ( 1st class ) in their colonial service in June 1898 . In July King Leopold commissioned Mohun to lay a telegraph line from Lake Tanganyika to <unk> on the White Nile . Mohun accepted the position despite , just months before , condemning the region as a " wretched country in the heart of Africa " . Mohun left Antwerp , Belgium for Africa at the end of August 1898 . 
 The overhead telegraph may have been intended as a link in the proposed line from the Cape to Cairo , it was to be supported by 7m @-@ high poles at 150m spacings and had been allocated a budget of three million francs . Mohun was allowed free rein to choose his own staff and set out with five electricians / engineers ( including some from Britain and France ) , Dr. <unk> Horace <unk> as medical officer and a military escort commanded by Belgian Captain <unk> . He advertised among the Askari of Zanzibar for volunteers to provide the escort required by the expedition , and received more than one thousand responses . From these , he selected one hundred men to accompany him , twenty of whom had served with him in the Congo expedition of 1894 . The work was hoped to have been completed by 1900 . 
 In order to negotiate with the local population along his route , Mohun took " 100 boxes [ of ] trade goods consisting of bells , knives , locks , mirrors , music boxes , watches , clocks , fezzes , and other odds and ends " . His diary also notes that spectacles , Arab @-@ made incense and American @-@ made cloth were popular , and that he used the latter to pay his Askari escort . The expedition also included porters to carry the equipment and to lay the telegraph line . In addition to laying the telegraph Mohun was instructed by Dhanis to use his askaris against parties of <unk> mutineers that still plagued the region in the aftermath of the rebellion of 1897 @-@ 8 . 
 A ship named Sir Harry Johnson took them from Zanzibar to the African mainland in the German colony of Tanganyika . The expedition then proceeded to the settlement of Fort Johnston at the southern tip of Lake Nyasa where they replenished their food stocks with fish from the Shire River . Mohun 's party then proceeded along the western bank of the lake to the settlement of Karonga in North @-@ Eastern Rhodesia . The expedition probably used the Stevenson Road which connected Karonga to <unk> at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika . At <unk> the group encountered Ewart Grogan , the British explorer then in the process of completing the first crossing of Africa from south to north . Captain <unk> drew Grogan 's attention to a group of pale Southern <unk> . Grogan shot one and sent its pelt to the Zoological Society of London where it was regarded as potentially the first sighting of a new form of the species . 
 Mohun 's group then began laying the telegraph line ( starting at Albertville ) , heading north along the western bank of the Lake and entering the Congo Free State before turning west to meet the River Congo at Kasongo . Shortly after entering the Congo in July 1899 the party , then comprising just ten European men , came under attack by a force of cannibal tribesmen . Mohun estimated that his opponents numbered some 1 @,@ 500 men and claimed to have inflicted 300 dead and 600 wounded in exchange for 9 men killed and 47 wounded in his party . Mohun was said to have contributed much to the party 's defence with his Winchester rifle and was reinforced part way through the engagement by three companies of native infantry sent by Dhanis . The cannibals subsequently fled towards Lake Tanganyika . <unk> died on the expedition on 26 September . In December 1900 Mohun 's family contacted the US ambassador to Belgium , Lawrence Townsend , to ask him to investigate rumours of his death which had been announced at a lecture in Washington . 
 Mohun 's party followed the river north to Stanley Falls where , after three years , the expedition completed the line some distance short of the Nile . The telegraph was some 286 miles ( 460 km ) long and enabled the transmission of messages across the African interior for the first time . As a result , Mohun claimed to be known amongst the indigenous peoples along the route as " Big master of the telephone " . Mohun , the only white survivor of the expedition , returned to Belgium from the west coast Congo ports and thus completed an east @-@ west traverse of the continent . Mohun claimed to be the first American to achieve the feat , a credit usually given to Henry Morton Stanley for his 1874 @-@ 77 expedition . Mohun 's claim may have been due to knowing Stanley was a naturalised American citizen born in Wales . He is regarded as one of three Americans who played key roles in opening the Belgian Congo to outsiders , alongside Stanley and the missionary William Henry Sheppard .

 Mohun 's contract was the Belgian crown came to an end in October 1901 and he returned to Harriette in Brussels where he acted as an advisor to King Leopold on the management of the Congo . His second son , Cecil Peabody Mohun , who later became a stockbroker , was born in Brussels on March 27 , 1904 . Not wishing to embark upon another long appointment in Africa , Mohun wrote a request for employment to former US State Department official Thomas W. <unk> , commissioner for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition . Mohun suggested the inclusion of an anthropological exhibit with " a few pygmies , from the Congo . Cannibals of course would be amongst the Congo lot , as it would be impossible to bring natives from interior Africa without finding a large percentage of man eaters amongst them ... I am not proposing any dime Museum , or Midway Plaisance sort of show . Make it a part of the Equatorial African Section , an integral part of the Exhibition itself " . Mohun was unsuccessful and never received a formal position with the exposition , though his suggestion might have led to the inclusion of the pygmy Ota Benga and other African tribesmen as part of the exhibition . He is believed to have written to Roger Casement during this time in an attempt to counter the accounts of Belgian abuses in the Congo that Casement was then compiling for publication in his 1905 Casement Report . 
 In December 1905 , on the recommendation of King Leopold , he was appointed director of the Abir Congo Company . The Abir Rubber Company was the only company mentioned by name in a Congo Commission report , which reported : " the imprisonment of women as hostages , flogging to excess , and various acts of brutality are not contested . It is the black spot on the history of Central African settlement . " Mohun was appointed to institute reforms addressing these practices . He enjoyed some success in this regard and also devoted much time to an attempt to exterminate the tsetse fly . In 1906 successfully proposed that Leopold II buy out Abir and take the concession under direct control of the crown . He appears to have left Abir around the same time and was , in March 1907 , proposed by the Congo Free State government to assume the role of African manager for the American Congo Company . 
 Mohun was selected , in May 1907 , by Thomas Fortune Ryan and Daniel Guggenheim , founders of the Forminière company to undertake a prospecting operation on the <unk> River in the Kasai and Maniema regions . The result was the 1908 Ryan @-@ Guggenheim Expedition , a rubber and mineral prospecting party funded by American capital and accompanied by a member of the US Geological Service . This was in two parts , a scientific expedition led by SP Verner for the American Congo Company that sought to trial the " Mexican Process " of utilising acetone for rubber extraction in the Congo , and a mineral prospecting party , the Mohun @-@ Ball Expedition ( also known as the Mission de Recherches Minières ) , with mineralogist Sydney Hobart Ball and mining engineer Alfred Chester Beatty , that sought out new gold , copper and coal deposits . The expedition was also tasked with capturing a live specimen of the Okapi for which a wealthy resident of Paris had offered a $ 5 @,@ 000 reward . Mohun was appointed chief of the Mohun @-@ Ball expedition when it set out in 1907 . 
 Late that year the party came under attack by a force of flintlock @-@ armed cannibals and , with the assistance of a 25 @-@ strong unit of Belgian native soldiers , repelled the attack — inflicting 125 dead for the loss of five native porters . In press reports of the time Mohun was described as an ex @-@ US Army officer who had been involved in revolutions in several South American countries . The incident became locally known as the " Battle of Ball 's Run " . A further attack in January 1908 was more successful , causing the party to flee the area . Mohun 's men eventually reached safety at <unk> in March . 
 The expedition ended in 1909 , by which time it had uncovered valuable diamond deposits at <unk> , the first such to be located in the country , and recommended the mineral @-@ rich Kasai region to Forminière for further investigation The expedition was judged favourably in relation to Verner 's party , who were forced to abandon their attempts to introduce the Mexican process . The discovery of diamonds opened a new source of revenue for the colony and many subsequent American expeditions were carried out in search of further deposits . Mohun 's contract with Forminière expired in November 1909 and he returned briefly to his family in the USA . In 1910 he was commissioned by the Rubber Exploration Company to inspect rubber concessions in South Africa , Rhodesia , Mozambique , Madagascar and Equatorial Africa and to negotiate their purchase on behalf of the company . Although Mohun left the company early the next year , the concessions proved successful with the first shipments of rubber arriving in the USA in August 1911 . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 In August 1911 Mohun returned to his home at Royal Oak , Maryland to recover from wounds he had received during his twenty years service in Africa . His convalescence included a period spent in the Virginia mountains . He served as on officer on an American Red Cross ship sent to Belgium during the first year of World War One . Aged 50 and without any prior signs of illness , he died of a fever on July 13 , 1915 . Although he was alone when he fell ill at two o 'clock in the morning a non @-@ Catholic woman made a 26 miles ( 42 km ) journey to fetch a priest to conduct the Last Rites . Mohun 's funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle and he was interred in the family plot at Oak Hill Cemetery . During his postings in Africa he had returned to the USA only three times . 
 During his career Mohun received honours from the British , French and Belgian governments and was a member of the Royal Geographical Societies of Britain , France and Belgium . He was a fluent speaker of Arabic and Swahili in addition to his native English . A sizeable collection of ethnographic information and objects that Mohun collected in Africa is now held in the collection of the Smithsonian Museum and many of his papers are held by the Belgian Royal Museum for Central Africa and the US National Archives and Records Administration . Harriette Mohun died on October 6 , 1942 in Stamford , Connecticut and was buried alongside her husband . 
 = U.S. Route 412 in Oklahoma = 
 U.S. Route 412 ( abbreviated US @-@ 412 ) is a U.S. highway in the south @-@ central <unk> of the United States , connecting Springer , New Mexico to Columbia , Tennessee . A 504 @.@ 11 @-@ mile ( 811 @.@ 29 km ) section of the highway crosses the state of Oklahoma , traversing the state from west to east . Entering the state southwest of Boise City , US @-@ 412 runs the length of the Oklahoma Panhandle and serves the northern portion of the state 's main body , before leaving the state at West Siloam Springs . Along the way , the route serves many notable cities and towns , including Boise City , Guymon , Woodward , Enid , and the state 's second @-@ largest city , Tulsa . 
 US @-@ 412 has two tolled sections , both of them in Oklahoma — the Cimarron Turnpike and the Cherokee Turnpike . The tolled portions of the highway are operated by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority ( OTA ) , with the remainder of the route maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) . In addition to the freeway @-@ grade turnpikes , a large amount of the highway has been upgraded to four @-@ lane expressway facilities , although some portions remain two @-@ lane , especially in the Panhandle . Much of US @-@ 412 's route through Oklahoma either overlaps or is in close proximity to that of US @-@ 64 . 
 US @-@ 412 was extended into Oklahoma in 1988 to encourage recreational travel and the resulting economic benefit to the state . This extension , in which the new designation replaced or overlapped several already existing highways , brought US @-@ 412 's western terminus to Woodward . In 1993 , it was extended west of Oklahoma , bringing it through the Panhandle and into New Mexico .

 U.S. Route 412 crosses the New Mexico – Oklahoma state line northeast of Clayton , New Mexico , concurrent with US @-@ 56 and US @-@ 64 . The three highways enter the state just north of the extreme southwest corner of Cimarron County , the westernmost tip of the Oklahoma Panhandle . The highways head northeast , passing through disconnected parcels of the Rita Blanca National Grassland . The first town US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 64 , and US @-@ 412 encounter in Oklahoma is unincorporated Felt , which they skirt the northern edge of . The highways then cross the Beaver River before intersecting US @-@ 385 , which joins the other three highways in a concurrency as they approach Boise City , the county seat . In Boise City , the highways reach a traffic circle which surrounds the Cimarron County Courthouse . At this traffic circle , US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 64 , and US @-@ 412 all turn east , while US @-@ 385 splits away to the north . State Highway 3 ( SH @-@ 3 ) enters the circle from the north and leaves from the east , following US @-@ 412 , while SH @-@ 325 begins at the circle and heads west toward Kenton . East of town , US @-@ 56 / US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 have an interchange with US @-@ 287 , which bypasses Boise City to the east . Six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of here , US @-@ 56 splits away from the other highways ; it continues northeast , while US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 turn onto a due east course . The routes intersect SH @-@ 171 eight miles ( 13 km ) east of the split . 
 Approximately 12 miles ( 19 km ) east of the SH @-@ 171 junction , US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 cross into Texas County . Seven miles ( 11 km ) east of the county line , at unincorporated Four Corners , SH @-@ 95 joins the concurrency ; it splits away after following the other three routes for five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . The next major highway junction lies 18 @.@ 1 miles ( 29 @.@ 1 km ) miles to the east , where SH @-@ 136 joins with US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 as the highways turn south toward Guymon . The four highways cross the Beaver River once again before entering that city , Texas County 's seat and the largest city in the Panhandle . In Guymon , US @-@ 64 splits away to the east , while US @-@ 412 and State Highways 3 and 136 continue south , turning back east along US @-@ 54 to form a short concurrency . A US @-@ 412 truck route follows US @-@ 64 and US @-@ 54 around the east side of the city , reuniting with mainline US @-@ 412 where it splits away from SH @-@ 136 . Just 217 feet ( 66 m ) east of the US @-@ 54 junction , SH @-@ 136 splits away to the south , leaving US @-@ 412 and SH @-@ 3 to continue east . Southwest of Optima Lake , the two highways serve as the southern terminus of SH @-@ 94 . East of the highway junction , US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 enter Optima National Wildlife Refuge , where they cross Coldwater Creek , one of the lake 's tributaries . After leaving the refuge , the routes pass through the town of Hardesty . From Hardesty , the road continues due east , crossing Palo Duro Creek and Chiquita Creek , two tributaries of the Beaver River . The highways then leave Texas County . 
 The third county US @-@ 412 and SH @-@ 3 enter is Beaver County , the panhandle 's easternmost county . The highways ' route across Beaver County is arrow @-@ straight , proceeding due east with only a single curve at the extreme east edge of the county . At the unincorporated location of Bryan 's Corner , approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of the county line , the highway intersects US @-@ 83 . Near the county 's east – west midpoint , at Elmwood , US @-@ 412 and SH @-@ 3 intersect US @-@ 270 and SH @-@ 23 . While SH @-@ 23 passes through the intersection north to south , eastbound US @-@ 270 , following southbound SH @-@ 23 from Beaver , joins US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 heading east . The three highways continue on , passing through <unk> , before curving slightly to the north as they exit both Beaver County and the Oklahoma Panhandle . 
 = = = Northwest Oklahoma = = = 
 Upon entering the main body of Oklahoma , the first county US @-@ 270 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 pass through is Harper County . Here , they intersect US @-@ 283 south of Laverne ; eight miles ( 13 km ) east of US @-@ 283 , in May , they intersect SH @-@ 46 . US @-@ 270 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 only cross the southwest part of Harper County before curving southeast into Ellis County . The routes , however , only clip the northeast corner of the county , traversing only 1 @.@ 81 miles ( 2 @.@ 91 km ) of it before passing into Woodward County . 
 Shortly after entering Woodward County , US @-@ 270 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 enter the town of Fort Supply . There , the routes junction with US @-@ 183 , which joins the other routes as they make their way southeast . Thirteen miles ( 21 km ) southeast of Fort Supply , the four highways enter the city of Woodward , the largest city within a nine @-@ county area and the commercial hub of northwest Oklahoma . On the west edge of town , the four highways serve as the eastern terminus of the western segment of SH @-@ 15 , a route made discontinuous by the establishment of US @-@ 412 ( see history ) . US @-@ 270 / US @-@ 183 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 proceed east through Woodward . In downtown , they meet with SH @-@ 34 ; here , US @-@ 412 leaves the four @-@ way concurrency , as it continues east by itself while the other three highways it has followed since Fort Supply turn south to overlap SH @-@ 34 instead . For the first time since its western terminus in New Mexico , where it began concurrent with US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 412 is the sole highway designation on the road it follows . 
 As US @-@ 412 leaves town , it passes south of Boiling Springs State Park , running parallel to SH @-@ 34C and SH @-@ 50B , both of which serve the park . Along this stretch , it crosses the Beaver River for the third and final time , though this time it has since become the North Canadian River . SH @-@ 50 forms a concurrency with US @-@ 412 for 1 @.@ 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 1 km ) before splitting off again in <unk> . The highway passes just south of Curtis as it continues east out of Woodward County . 
 The next northwestern Oklahoma county that US @-@ 412 serves is Major County . The first intersection with another highway that US @-@ 412 comes to is with US @-@ 281 at Bouse Junction . East of here , US @-@ 412 skirts the northern edge of the Glass Mountains ( also known as the Gloss Mountains ) , turning southeast before returning to a due east course . At Orienta , the highway begins a concurrency with US @-@ 60 and SH @-@ 8 ; the three highways turn north and together cross the Cimarron River . South of Cleo Springs , US @-@ 60 and US @-@ 412 turn east , while SH @-@ 8 splits away to the north . From here , it is a straight shot into Enid along US @-@ 60 / US @-@ 412 ; there are no curves along the highway for over 33 miles ( 53 km ) . US @-@ 60 and US @-@ 412 continue to the east , meeting up with SH @-@ 58 on the north edge of Ringwood . The two US highways pass through Meno before coming to the Major – Garfield County line . 
 Soon after entering Garfield County , US @-@ 60 / US @-@ 412 run through Lahoma . Three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of there , they share a brief concurrency with SH @-@ 132 . The two highways enter the county seat of Garfield County , the city of Enid , along Owen K. Garriott Road , named in honor of the astronaut . In downtown Enid , the routes intersect US @-@ 81 ; US @-@ 60 breaks away from US @-@ 412 to turn north along US @-@ 81 , while US @-@ 412 continues east along Garriott Road . On the east side of Enid , US @-@ 412 reunites with US @-@ 64 ; the two form a concurrency as Garriott Road becomes an expressway heading east out of town . The next highway junction is an interchange with SH @-@ 74 ; this interchange also serves as the western terminus of the eastern segment of SH @-@ 15 . From here , US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 proceed due east into Noble County to a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 35 ( I @-@ 35 ) . US @-@ 64 follows I @-@ 35 south toward Perry , while US @-@ 412 continues straight ahead , where it will form the Cimarron Turnpike . 
 = = = Northeast Oklahoma = = = 
 The Cimarron Turnpike , carrying US @-@ 412 , passes through Noble , Payne , and Pawnee Counties . The highway heads east from I @-@ 35 to its first interchange , Exit 3 , which provides access to US @-@ 77 . The first mainline toll plaza is just west of Exit 15 , a cloverleaf interchange with no straight @-@ line ramps ( forcing all traffic getting on or off to pass through the toll plaza ) connecting the turnpike to US @-@ 177 . East of the US @-@ 177 interchange , the highway curves to the south , crossing Black Bear Creek . US @-@ 412 then meets US @-@ 64 once again , interchanging with it at Exit 23 east of Morrison . The turnpike then turns back east , with a spur route ( accessible only from the westbound turnpike ) branching off to the southwest toward Stillwater . The Lone Chimney service plaza , a twenty @-@ four @-@ hour concession area , is located in the median of the turnpike east of the interchange with the spur . South of Pawnee lies an interchange ( Exit 37 ) with SH @-@ 18 . Just south of Hallett , a second mainline toll plaza sits just west of the SH @-@ 99 interchange ; again , this interchange is a cloverleaf interchange with only loop ramps . The turnpike 's final exit is Exit 60 , a partial interchange with SH @-@ 48 southeast of Cleveland . The missing movements are provided by US @-@ 64 , the northern terminus of SH @-@ 48 , which merges with US @-@ 412 as the Cimarron Turnpike ends . The two routes continue east as a freeway . 
 The US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 freeway , known locally as the Keystone Expressway , serves the western outlying areas of the Tulsa metropolitan area . Passing south of Westport , the freeway is routed along a peninsula in extreme southeastern Pawnee County , before crossing Keystone Lake , formed by the impounded Arkansas River , into far southern Osage County . US @-@ 64 and US @-@ 412 only traverse a short distance in the county , however ; after 1 @.@ 42 miles ( 2 @.@ 29 km ) the two routes pass into Tulsa County . Just south of the county line , the freeway has an interchange with SH @-@ 151 , a short connector route that runs across Lake Keystone 's dam . At this interchange the Keystone Expressway ends . The Sand Springs Expressway continues from here , through Sand Springs , where it includes an interchange with SH @-@ 97 and SH @-@ 51 , the latter of which joins US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 on the freeway . The three routes then continue east into Tulsa proper . 
 The Sand Springs Expressway comes to an end at the northwest corner of the Inner <unk> Loop ( IDL ) , a ring of freeways surrounding Downtown Tulsa . At a stack interchange there , US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 51 split away to the south along I @-@ 244 ; this will be the final intersection US @-@ 412 and US @-@ 64 will have in Oklahoma . US @-@ 412 continues east along I @-@ 244 . This interchange is also the southern terminus of L.L. Tisdale Parkway . I @-@ 244 and US @-@ 412 form the north side of the IDL ; at its northeast corner , they interchange with US @-@ 75 , the east side of the loop ; south of the interchange , US @-@ 75 also carries the I @-@ 444 designation . I @-@ 244 / US @-@ 412 continue east , with exit ramps to local streets , as well as SH @-@ 11 and US @-@ 169 . I @-@ 244 ends at I @-@ 44 / SH @-@ 66 ; US @-@ 412 forms a concurrency with the latter two routes as they continue east into Rogers County . 
 Upon entering Rogers County , I @-@ 44 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 66 parallel the southern boundary of the county , staying just north of the Rogers – Tulsa and , further east , Rogers – Wagoner county lines . In Rogers County , the three highways enter the city of Catoosa , one of Tulsa 's eastern suburbs . In Catoosa , the freeway serves as the southern terminus of SH @-@ 167 , which serves the city 's port , and SH @-@ 66 splits off toward <unk> . I @-@ 44 and US @-@ 412 continue east for a short distance before going separate directions ; I @-@ 44 exits from US @-@ 412 and joins the Will Rogers Turnpike . This interchange is also the northern terminus of the Creek Turnpike . US @-@ 412 becomes an expressway , and continues east of the interchange , passing through Fair Oaks on its way out of the Tulsa metro . In rural south @-@ central Rogers County , it connects to SH @-@ 412P , a state highway spur to Port 33 , before crossing the Verdigris River , a component of the McClellan – Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System . US @-@ 412 continues east through unincorporated territory before reaching <unk> , where it has an interchange with SH @-@ 88 , 1 @.@ 39 miles ( 2 @.@ 24 km ) north of that highway 's southern terminus . US @-@ 412 then heads eastward out of Rogers County . 
 After leaving Rogers County , the next county along US @-@ 412 is Mayes County . South of Chouteau , the route provides access to US @-@ 69 via an interchange . Just west of US @-@ 412 's crossing of the Grand River , the highway intersects SH @-@ 412B , which connects US @-@ 412 to SH @-@ <unk> . After crossing the river , US @-@ 412 comes to a fork in the road ; one half of the fork is the Cherokee Turnpike , which mainline US @-@ 412 follows , while the other is US @-@ 412 Alternate , which runs parallel to the turnpike on an old alignment of US @-@ 412 . 
 The first interchange on the Cherokee Turnpike is with SH @-@ 82 in Locust Grove . The turnpike continues east , passing into Delaware County , to intersect US @-@ 412 Alternate again between Rose and Leach . East of this interchange , a service area lies in the median of the roadway ; east of there , the highway passes through the Cherokee Turnpike 's only mainline toll plaza . The turnpike 's final interchange is with US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 in Kansas . The Cherokee Turnpike then ends , merging with US @-@ 59 ; at this junction , US @-@ 412 Alternate , which was concurrent with US @-@ 59 , also ends . US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 412 continue southeast through Flint , before turning due east to West Siloam Springs . There , US @-@ 59 splits away from US @-@ 412 , while US @-@ 412 remains on an easterly trajectory , crossing the state line into Siloam Springs , Arkansas .

 US @-@ 412 initially connected Walnut Ridge , Arkansas to Jackson , Tennessee . Mr. Murphy , deputy director of ODOT , recommended to the Transportation Commission that US @-@ 412 be extended into Oklahoma on February 1 , 1988 . ODOT hoped that establishing US @-@ 412 in Oklahoma would generate new recreational traffic , thus benefiting the state economically . The new western terminus was to become the US @-@ 183 / US @-@ 270 junction in Woodward ; from there , the highway extended for 288 @.@ 42 miles ( 464 @.@ 17 km ) to the east , exiting the state in West Siloam Springs . The Transportation Commission approved the recommendation unanimously . 
 The US @-@ 412 designation was applied to preexisting Oklahoma highways . From Woodward to just east of Enid , US @-@ 412 replaced SH @-@ 15 . From there to the I @-@ 35 junction , it was overlaid on US @-@ 64 ; east of I @-@ 35 , the designation was applied to the Cimarron Turnpike . US @-@ 412 continued east from the end of the turnpike along US @-@ 64 . From there , it was routed through the Tulsa metropolitan freeway system along I @-@ 244 and I @-@ 44 . East of Tulsa , the highway replaced SH @-@ 33 to the Arkansas line . The highway designations made redundant by US @-@ 412 were removed , effective December 12 , 1988 . 
 The first major change to US @-@ 412 occurred on November 4 , 1991 , when US @-@ 412 was rerouted onto the newly built Cherokee Turnpike . US @-@ 412 Scenic , which was later redesignated US @-@ 412 Alternate , was established along the old highway , allowing the highway system to retain a free alternate to the new toll road . US @-@ 412 was extended west on May 5 , 1993 ; like its initial extension into Oklahoma , this new portion of US @-@ 412 followed existing highways : US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 64 , US @-@ 270 , and SH @-@ 3 . 
 Subsequent changes to US @-@ 412 have been more minor . On March 7 , 1994 , the highway was relocated near Chouteau . Finally , on October 4 , 2004 , the Transportation Commission approved the realignment of US @-@ 60 , US @-@ 412 , and SH @-@ 8 at their junction near Orienta . Other than routine maintenance , there have been no further changes to the highway since then . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 As of 2013 , passengers of two @-@ axle vehicles ( such as cars and motorcycles ) pay a total of $ 3 @.@ 00 to travel the entire length of the Cimarron Turnpike and $ 2 @.@ 50 to travel the entire length of the Cherokee Turnpike . Tolls vary based on the entrance and exit used . Both turnpikes accept OTA 's Pikepass transponder system as an alternative to cash payment . Pikepass customers receive discounted toll rates ; the Pikepass rate for the full length of the Cimarron is $ 2 @.@ 85 , and the discounted rate for the Cherokee is $ 2 @.@ 40 . 
 Toll revenues from the two turnpikes US @-@ 412 uses are not necessarily used to maintain those highways . Under a practice known as cross @-@ pledging , all OTA toll revenue is pledged against the sum of OTA 's indebtedness , including bonds financing the state 's other turnpikes .

 SH @-@ 412A begins at the Cherokee – Delaware county line in the town of Oaks . The route proceeds north through town . After leaving Oaks , the highway enters unincorporated territory before ending at US @-@ 412 Alternate at the unincorporated location of Twin Oaks . 
 SH @-@ 412A existed prior to the extension of US @-@ 412 in Oklahoma . As the adjacent section of highway was part of SH @-@ 33 prior to becoming US @-@ 412 , what would become SH @-@ 412A was originally designated as SH @-@ 33C . SH @-@ 33C was first shown on the Oklahoma state highway map in 1958 . At the time of the highway 's designation , it was a gravel highway ; by 1959 , however , it had been paved . The first revision of the state highway map to reflect the renumbering of SH @-@ 33 to US @-@ 412 was the 1989 edition ; this was also the first to show SH @-@ 33C redesignated as SH @-@ 412A .

 = <unk> ( Nadar ) = 
 In 1860 , French photographer Nadar ( real name Gaspard @-@ Félix Tournachon ) took a series of photographs of a young intersex person , who had a male build and stature and who may have been female assigned , or self @-@ identified as female . Possibly done on commission by Armand Trousseau , the nine photographs have been described as " probably the first medical photo @-@ illustrations of a patient with intersex genitalia " . They were originally restricted for scientific uses , and Nadar did not publish them . Further photographs of intersex subjects followed over the next several decades , although there is no evidence that the photographers knew of Nadar 's work . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nadar ( 1820 – 1910 ) , the son of a publisher , had previously had medical training in Lyon and at Hôtel @-@ Dieu . However , by the late 1830s he had left medicine to focus on the printed press , becoming a caricaturist , journalist , and novelist . He only began photography in 1854 , but by the end of that decade he was well known for his portraits of famous persons and advances in photographic techniques . 
 Although developed several decades earlier , photography was rarely used for medical documentation until the 1850s . In the mid @-@ 1850s France , at the request of neurologist Duchenne de Boulogne , photographer Adrien Tournachon documented experiments in which facial muscles were electrically stimulated ; another example of clinical photography was documented by German physician Hermann Wolff Berend in an 1855 journal article entitled " Ueber die <unk> der <unk> für <unk> <unk> " ( " On the Use of Photographs for Therapeutic Research Purposes " ) . 
 Several years later , in late 1860 , Tournachon 's elder brother Nadar took a series of nine photographs of a young intersex person , possibly on commission by Armand Trousseau ; This commission is suggested by an undated letter from Trousseau to Nadar , in which the former requests help in the documentation of a subject with a " very strange malady " , to be done " with as much truth and art as you can .

 The subject of the series , whose name was never released , was an intersex person with a male build and stature , but who may have self @-@ identified as female and / or been assigned female at birth . The subject had a small , probably <unk> , penis , rudimentary scrotum , and male pubic hair pattern . The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary clitoral hood and vaginal opening . In most photographs the subject 's face and chest are covered . 
 = = Series = = 
 The series consists of nine photographs documenting the subject in various poses and angles . Anna Blume , writing in the journal <unk> , describes the images as quite different from Nadar 's other work ; she writes that Nadar , whose normal portraits captured a personality and personage , instead focused on " a body and specifically of the genitals of this body " . 
 These include two images that show the subject standing . One captures a full length view , in which the subject is unclothed except for a pair of stockings and shoes . In the other , the subject 's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia . Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else 's hand pulls on the penile tissue . A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position , with a hand – visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve – spreading the vaginal lips . The series also includes a close @-@ up of the subject 's genitalia , with the legs open . 
 = = Post @-@ photography = = 
 Nadar did not publish the photographs , but in 1861 he copyrighted them – something he almost never did – and limited them to scientific uses , excluding public display . In The Journal of Sexual Medicine , Dirk Schultheiss , Thomas R.W. Herrmann , and Udo Jonas suggest that the photographs are " probably the first medical photo @-@ illustrations of a patient with intersex genitalia " and describe them as a " milestone in the history of sexual medicine " . 
 According to Schultheiss , Herrmann , and Jonas , although Trousseau had earlier suggested that surgery was a viable option , there is no evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment ; They suggest several possible factors , including legal issues , the subject 's refusal , or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting , for the lack of surgery or evidence of such . Maisonneuve , partially shown in one of the photographs , treated another intersex patient in 1862 . 
 Several photographs are at the Musée d 'Orsay in Paris , and at least one is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( MET ) in New York . The MET occasionally puts the photographs on display with other Nadar works ; a 1995 exhibition featured two of the series . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Medical photography continued to develop , both in France and abroad , after the Nadar images were shot . In Europe , several further cases of intersexuality were documented , although there is no evidence that the photographers were aware of Nadar 's work . In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société <unk> de Reims . In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five @-@ volume <unk> ( <unk> ) , while Louis <unk> published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la <unk> ( Hermaphrodites and Surgery ) . 
 = Malaysia – Vietnam relations = 
 Malaysia – Vietnam relations ( Malay <unk> Malaysia @-@ Vietnam ; Vietnamese : Quan <unk> Malaysia @-@ Việt Nam ) date to at least the 15th century . Malaysia forged diplomatic ties with the modern @-@ day Vietnamese state on 30 March 1973 ; as of 2015 , these ties are still in existence . During the late 1970s and 1980s , the countries ' relationship became strained as a result of the Cambodian – Vietnamese War and the influx of Vietnamese boat people into Malaysia . The subsequent resolution of these issues saw the cultivation of strong trade and economic ties , and bilateral trade between the countries grew exponentially , with an expansion into areas including information technology , education and defence . 
 Vietnam and Malaysia share a maritime border in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea , and have overlapping claims in the Spratly Islands . Both have an embassy located in the other 's capital ; Vietnam has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur , and Malaysia has an embassy in Hanoi and a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City . Historical records show that Vietnamese people have visited states and Sultanates comprising modern @-@ day Malaysia in small numbers since the 18th century , and Malaysia is currently home to a large Vietnamese expatriate community consisting of migrant workers , mail order brides and students , numbering around 100 @,@ 000 people . Vietnam also hosts a small Malaysian expatriate community , consisting mostly of businessmen based in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi .

 = = = Early contacts ( 15th to 18th century ) = = = 
 The earliest record of diplomatic contact between present @-@ day Malaysia and Vietnam dates back to 1469 . Soldiers of Vietnamese Later Le dynasty had captured a Malaccan tributary mission en route to the Chinese Ming dynasty , killing some of them , and castrating and enslaving the survivors . Tonkin expressed their intent to conquer Malacca ; this intent was conveyed to the Chinese emperor in a later mission in 1481 . The Chinese emperor ordered Malacca to raise soldiers in the event of a similar attack . Malacca defeated the Vietnamese during an invasion of Lan Xang as reported in a Chinese account . The Malay Annals also mention a Cham prince taking some of his followers to form a small Cham colony in Malacca when Vietnam invaded Champa in 1471 , and deploying military assistance to Johor to fend off a botched military conquest in the 1590s . In the mid 17th @-@ century , the Cham vassal states Panduranga and Kelantan cultivated close diplomatic ties when they led a long @-@ term diplomatic mission to Kelantan to learn more about Malay culture and Islam . Subsequent Champa kings after Po Rome , beginning with his son Po <unk> , periodically received Malay Muslim missionaries from Kelantan in the 17th and 18th centuries . 
 = = = British colonial era ( 18th to mid @-@ 20th century ) = = = 
 Not long after Penang was established as a port by the British at the end of the 18th century , Vietnamese junks began to visit the area for trade at the instruction of the Vietnamese emperor in Hue . An early account in the late 1790s showed Nguyen Anh 's ( who became Emperor Gia Long ) merchant ship docking in Penang carrying cargoes of sugarcane en route to India . Soldiers referred to Penang in its Sino @-@ Vietnamese terminology , Tân Lang <unk> ( Chinese character : <unk> ) ; a royal narrative in 1810 showed the Vietnamese began to refer to Penang as <unk> lao Cau , meaning Palm Island . Vietnamese Catholics travelled to Penang for seminary studies from the 1840s ; these included <unk> Pétrus <unk> ethnic Chinese from Cochinchina sailed to the east in the Sultanate of Terengganu to trade in poultry and rice ; some also settled there and assimilated with the local Chinese . 
 In the late 1920s and early 1930s , Ho Chi Minh played a key role in facilitating the formation of the Nanyang Communist Party — later renamed the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) — and visited Malaya on several occasions , such as presiding over a ceremony to mark the formation of the Malayan Communist Party in Buloh <unk> , Johor , in April 1930 . Ho Chi Minh 's influence on the MCP paved the way for Lai Teck , who was also of Vietnamese origin , to be appointed as the MCP 's Secretary General between 1934 and 1938 . Collaboration and communications between the MCP and the Vietnamese Communists increased following Lai Teck 's disappearance in the late 1940s ; the MCP briefly facilitated the shipping and transport of light ammunitions to the Viet Minh around this time . During World War II , both the Viet Minh and Malayan Peoples ' Anti @-@ Japanese Army ( <unk> ) opposed the Japanese invasion of French Indochina and Malaya . Closer ties between communist cadres from Malaya and Vietnam were forged following successful efforts by the Communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 ; the Viet Minh provided small @-@ scale logistical and communication support and training to the MCP in the 1950s and 1960s . 
 = = = Vietnamese refugees ( 1975 to 2005 ) = = = 
 In May 1975 , shortly after the Fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War , the first Vietnamese refugees arrived in Malaysia , and the first boat that arrived carried 47 refugees . Until 1978 , more Vietnamese fled their country , and many of them were of Chinese descent . According to Malaysian government statistics , the country hosted 19 @,@ 000 refugees in November 1978 , compared to 500 in 1977 . The Malaysian government responded by directing its Home Ministry to set up Federal Task Force VII in 1978 , which was tasked with limiting the rising number of refugees from landing in Malaysia . The press reported incidents of Malaysian police and army personnel turning away the refugees , but some refugees resorted to deliberately sinking their boats to gain admittance to Malaysia . When the government was informed of boat @-@ sinking attempts made by the refugees , then Deputy Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad announced in June 1979 that legislation would be introduced to empower the police and navy to shoot refugees attempting to land . Mahathir 's superior , Prime Minister Hussein Onn quickly recanted Mahathir 's shooting threat . 
 The first Vietnamese refugee camp was opened in Pulau <unk> in August 1978 with United Nations assistance ; the island accommodated up to 25 @,@ 000 refugees . Other refugee camps were set up at Pulau Tengah , Pulau Besar , Kota Bharu , Kuantan , Sarawak and Sabah . In 1982 , a transit centre was established at Sungei Besi , where refugees awaiting deportation to Western countries that were willing to accept them would be housed . The number of Vietnamese refugee arrivals fluctuated between 1981 and 1983 , before a period of significant decrease from 1984 to 1986 . In 1987 , Malaysia and other neighbouring countries saw a sudden increase in the number of Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia . At an ASEAN summit in June 1987 , member countries chastised the Vietnamese government for not having sufficiently addressed the refugee problem . 
 In August 1988 , Malaysia and Vietnam jointly proposed an involuntary repatriation agreement , which provided for Vietnamese refugees that failed to gain admittance to Western countries to be counselled to return to Vietnam . A few Vietnamese government delegations were deployed to conduct outreach sessions at some of the refugee camps . This arrangement was considered unsuccessful because less than 40 individuals registered for the voluntary repatriation programme between 1988 and 1989 . A deadline was set for 14 March 1989 , whereby all Vietnamese who arrived before that date would automatically be considered refugees and all refugees arriving after that date would undergo a screening process to assess whether they qualified for refugee status . The screening process was proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in June 1988 ; it involved thorough background checks on arrivals to determine whether they qualify for refugee status to be sent to any Western countries that were willing to accept them . Within 10 months , 4 @,@ 000 of 9 @,@ 000 refugees were sent to Western countries . In the same period , an additional 11 @,@ 000 refuges arrived in Malaysia . 
 The implementation of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals to qualify for refugee status prompted some of them to opt for the voluntary repatriation programme ; between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989 . Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR . In the early 1990s , as Vietnam began to experience economic growth , the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped . Joint collaborations between Malaysia , Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia to reduce the size of its Vietnamese refugee populace , facilitating the closure of the Pulau <unk> refugee camp in November 1991 . 3 @,@ 000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme , and Malaysia 's refugee populace reduced to 6 @,@ 000 by 1994 . Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants . The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam ; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp 's impending closure was announced in 1995 . Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996 . The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005 . 
 = = Diplomatic ties = = 
 Malaysia established diplomatic ties with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level after the Paris Peace Accords were signed that year . An agreement between the ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975 . The following year , Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi , while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976 . In the mid to late 1970s , bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the <unk> concept , which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti @-@ communist containment policy . During a bilateral summit in August 1977 , Malaysia 's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic and technical assistance to rebuild Vietnam 's war @-@ torn economy . When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 , many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s , and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial balance as most the Vietnamese refugees resemble the Chinese people . Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards , when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia . In the early 1990s , government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits , which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co @-@ operation and development . Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991 . Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia 's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties . Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995 ; its entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia . 
 In the 1990s , bilateral ties were characterised by trade and economic co @-@ operation ; other areas of bilateral co @-@ operation were explored from 2000 onwards . In that year , Vietnam and Malaysia reached an agreement on bilateral efforts on law enforcement and suppressing the trans @-@ national drug trade . In 2004 , three Memoranda of Understanding ( MoU ) in the areas of information technology , education and diplomatic ties , and co @-@ operation @-@ in @-@ general were signed . Bilateral co @-@ operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed , which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries . The MoU also provided for the navies of both countries to prevent Vietnamese fishermen from encroaching into Malaysian waters for fishing activities as well as to control piracy . 
 = = = Relations with South Vietnam ( 1959 to 1975 ) = = = 
 Relations with the former state of South Vietnam were established when South Vietnam recognised the Federation of Malaya 's independence on 1957 . Since then , Malaya was providing aid to the South Vietnamese regime in its fight against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army . Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman made a first visit on 1958 which was reciprocated twice by the South Vietnamese President Ngô Đình Diệm on 28 – 31 January 1958 and in October 1961 . By 1963 , when Malaya transformed into Malaysia ( with an additional territory in the island of Borneo ) , the main government in Kuala Lumpur worried the influence of North Vietnamese communists would threaten its existence in accordance to the Domino theory , thus changing its position to become very supportive of the American involvement in the Vietnam War as Malaysia also have experienced a communist insurgency of its own . Tunku Abdul Rahman then expressed these concerns in December 1966 and called on the United States and the United Kingdom to provide increased logistical support to war efforts in Vietnam . Malaysia hosted training courses in public administration and jungle warfare for government officials , and provided motorcycles to bolster the South Vietnamese police and military logistical capabilities . Towards the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 , Malaysia closed its embassy in Saigon in two stages ; first it withdrew the embassy dependants on 12 April 1975 , before a complete closure 16 days later — two days before the fall of Saigon . Malaysia had also extended recognition to the short @-@ lived Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam within days of its formation in May 1975 , citing Malaysia 's impartial position on political ideology and social system . 
 = = Embassy = = 
 The Embassy of Malaysia in Hanoi is currently located at 43 @-@ 45 Dien Bien Phu Street , where it has been located since 2004 . Malaysia also has a Consular Office in Ho Chi Minh City that was opened in 1991 , and its executive functions were later upgraded to that of Consular @-@ General one year later . The Malaysian embassy in Hanoi has shifted three times since 1976 : 
 Thong Nhat Hotel ( later renamed Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi ) , 1976 – 1983 
 Van Phuc Diplomatic Compound , 1983 – 1984 
 Fortuna Hotel Hanoi , 1984 – 2004 
 The Vietnamese embassy in Kuala Lumpur is located at 4 <unk> Stonor and was opened in 1976 through the acquisition of the former South Vietnamese embassy . The Vietnamese embassy also has separate offices catering to labour and defence matters in two separate locations within Kuala Lumpur set up in the 2000s . In February 2013 , the Vietnamese embassy secured the purchase of 0 @.@ 69 hectares ( 2 acres ) of land in Precinct 15 , Putrajaya , that would be used for the construction and subsequent relocation of the Vietnamese embassy . 
 = = Economy and trade = = 
 Bilateral trade between Malaysia and Vietnam stood at US $ 2 @.@ 2 million following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 . Within the first three years after the war , Malaysia proposed to extend economic and technical assistance to Vietnam 's oil palm and rubber industries . Malaysia exported zinc to Vietnam and signed a contract that would facilitate the import of Vietnamese vegetables into Malaysia . These early co @-@ operations and proposals ended following Vietnam 's invasion of Cambodia in 1979 . Economic co @-@ operation slowly resumed from 1988 , when bilateral trade between the countries stood at $ 50 million . In 1990 , bilateral trade increased to $ 140 million and to $ 235 million in 1991 . Around this time , Malaysian businessmen began to open hotels in Vung Tau to cater to its flourishing tourism industry . At a bilateral summit in 1992 , both countries agreed on the idea of joint oil and gas exploration ; Vietnam has a sizeable number of oil fields in the South China Sea . 
 Around this time , Malaysian <unk> boards and government @-@ linked companies including Bank Negara , <unk> and Petronas started to provide technical assistance programmes to Vietnam . Vietnam also sought Malaysia 's assistance to develop its banking sector ; Malaysia 's Public Bank formed joint ventures with VID bank ( later <unk> bank ) to open branches in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City between 1993 and 1994 . By 1994 , Malaysia became ASEAN 's second largest investor in Vietnam . Exports from Vietnam to Malaysia mainly consisted of rice , rubber , oil seeds and machinery , while Malaysia exported machinery , equipment and chemicals mainly derived from the former 's economic assistance to the country . Malaysian businessmen were responsible for the development of the An Don Export Processing Zone beginning in 1994 in Danang . At an APEC meeting in 1994 , Malaysia 's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad spoke of the belief that Malaysia did not need to be totally self @-@ reliant in food , and expressed his interest in procuring some food from Vietnam as a means of strengthening economic ties . Two years later , Malaysian @-@ made Proton <unk> cars were first sold in Vietnam . 
 A joint commission meeting between the countries in 1996 brought skilled and semi @-@ skilled workers entering Vietnam from Malaysia from that time onwards . Between 2002 and 2003 , the first wave of Vietnamese workers arrived in Malaysia to provide labour for its expanding manufacturing sector . By 2003 , there were 67 @,@ 000 Vietnamese workers in Malaysia ; both countries signed a memorandum of understanding exempting unskilled Vietnamese workers from needing a sufficient grasp of English or the Malay language to qualify for employment . The number of Vietnamese work permit holders increased slightly to 80 @,@ 000 @-@ 90 @,@ 000 by 2011 ; their presence later extended to other sectors including construction , housekeeping , agriculture and the service sector . A few Vietnamese workers found employment in Chinese restaurants as waiters , and learnt to speak some Chinese as well . 
 In 2015 , Malaysia was the largest ASEAN 's investor in Vietnam with total pledges of US $ 2 @.@ 47 billion . Malaysia and Vietnam have signed a joint statement on strategic partnership in economic matters along with a memorandum of understanding on joint patrol , hotline contact , search and rescue co @-@ ordination , and piracy prevention in the South China Sea . 
 = = Social developments = = 
 A sizeable number of Malaysian men have foreign wives especially with Vietnamese women . Accounts of such marriages first surfaced in the 1990s , but in the 2000s these marriages became especially popular with older Chinese Malaysian men . A thriving matchmaking industry in which prospective grooms could select Vietnamese brides based on road shows and profiling methods has developed . Malaysian spouses cited the inability to find a local spouse because of career commitments and cultural affinity between Chinese Malaysians and Vietnamese as their main motivations for finding a Vietnamese wife . Such unions have faced considerable issues , such as language barriers , cases in which wives abandon their Malaysian spouses and take their mixed @-@ race children back to Vietnam , and extortion . A Chinese community leader , Michael Chong , said the key reason for runaway Vietnamese brides was their inability to adapt to Malaysian life and society , and that many of the women married to escape poverty in their homeland . 
 Malaysia is home to almost 100 @,@ 000 Vietnamese nationals , mostly concentrated in the industrial hubs in the West Malaysian states of Penang , Negeri Sembilan , Selangor and Johor . Vietnamese migrant workers have occasionally been mistreated by employers , and have faced overcrowded dormitories , salary deductions and physical abuse at work . A sizeable number of crimes in Malaysia , including robbery , rape , murder , and prostitution , have been attributed to the Vietnamese community . In 2008 , the then Inspector @-@ General of the Malaysian police Musa Hassan , said the Malaysian police had handled more than 200 cases of crimes involving the Vietnamese community in 2008 . Vietnamese women are common in the Malaysian prostitution trade , Malaysian clients have attributed their popularity to their alluring physique and good hospitality practices . Some Vietnamese prostitutes have reportedly resorted to registering false student passes or false marriages with local men to gain employment in this trade ; many were forced into prostitution after being tricked by unscrupulous agents promising them employment as waitresses or factory workers in Malaysia . 
 = Planet of the Apes ( 2001 film ) = 
 Planet of the Apes is a 2001 American science fiction adventure film directed by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg , Tim Roth , Helena Bonham Carter , Michael Clarke Duncan , Paul Giamatti , and Estella Warren . The sixth film produced in the Planet of the Apes franchise , it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle 's 1963 novel of the same name and the 1968 film version . It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash @-@ landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes . The apes treat humans as slaves , but with the help of an ape named Ari , Leo starts a rebellion . 
 Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin . His project nearly reached the pre @-@ production stage before being canceled . Terry Hayes 's script , titled Return of the Apes , would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger , under the direction of Phillip Noyce . Oliver Stone , Don Murphy , and Jane Hamsher were set to produce . Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier / distributor 20th Century Fox . Chris Columbus , Sam Hamm , James Cameron , Peter Jackson , and the Hughes brothers later became involved . 
 With William Broyles , Jr . ' s script , Burton was hired as director , and the film was put into active development . Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script , and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001 . Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews , but was a financial success . Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending , although Rick Baker 's prosthetic makeup designs were praised . Despite its financial success , 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel , and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2029 , aboard the United States Air Force space station Oberon , Leo Davidson works closely with primates who are trained for space missions . His favorite simian co @-@ worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles . With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station , a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm . Pericles 's pod heads into the storm and disappears . Against his commanding officer 's orders , Leo takes a second pod and goes in pursuit of Pericles . Entering the storm , Leo loses contact with the Oberon and crashes on a planet called Ashlar in the year <unk> . He discovers that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who can speak human language and treat human beings as slaves . 
 Leo comes across a female chimpanzee named Ari , who protests the awful treatment humans receive . Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena to have them work as servants in the house of her father , Senator Sandar . Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans . Ari sees them , but Leo convinces her to join a human rebellion against the apes . General Thade and Colonel Attar march ape warriors in pursuit of the humans . Leo discovers Calima ( the temple of " Semos " ) , a forbidden , but holy , site for the apes . 
 Calima turns out to be the remains of the Oberon , Leo 's space station , which has crashed on the planet 's surface and looks ancient ( the name Calima coming from the sign " <unk> <unk> <unk> " , the relevant letters being the only ones not covered in dust ) . According to the computer logs , the station has been there for thousands of years . Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex he was pushed forward in time , while the Oberon , searching after him , was not , crashing on the planet long before he did . 
 The Oberon 's log reveals that the apes on board , led by Semos , organized a mutiny and took control of the vessel after it crashed . The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing . In the present , a battle ensues between the humans and the apes . A familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo as the pod piloted by Pericles , the chimpanzee astronaut . Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was , and had just now found his way to the planet . When Pericles lands , the apes interpret his landing as the return arrival of Semos , the first ape , who is their god . They bow , and hostilities between humans and apes disappear . 
 Pericles then runs into the Oberon and Leo runs after him , followed by General Thade . Inside , Thade and Leo fight , with Pericles trying to help Leo , only to be thrown hard against a wall . Thade gets hold of Leo 's gun , but does not understand how to use it at first . Seeing that Thade is in the pilot 's deck , Leo closes the automatic door of the entrance , trapping Thade as he shoots the gun , the bullets ricocheting off the door harmlessly . Thade thrashes around to escape , but after all attempts to do so fail , he finally gives up . Leo then decides that it is time for him to leave the Planet of the Apes , so he gives Pericles to Ari , with her promising to look after him , also saying farewell to Daena . Leo climbs aboard Pericles 's undamaged pod and uses it to travel back in time through the same electromagnetic storm . Leo ends up crashing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. on Earth . He looks up at the Memorial , and sees it is now a monument in honor of General Thade . A swarm of police officers , firefighters , and news reporters descend on Leo , but on closer inspection , they are all apes .

( Matt Damon was eventually cast in the Ocean 's Eleven role . ) Whereas other actors contending for the Leo Davidson role wanted to see the script before signing a contract , Wahlberg signed on after a five @-@ minute meeting with Burton . To avoid evoking associations with his previous work as an underwear model , Wahlberg did not wear a loincloth , even though Heston had worn one in the original film . 
 Tim Roth as General Thade 
 A sinister chimpanzee military commander who wants control over the ape civilization . Thade also intends to marry Ari , but she dismisses him .

 20th Century Fox president Craig Baumgarten was impressed with Adam Rifkin 's filmmaking with Never on Tuesday . In 1988 , Rifkin was brought in the studio to pitch ideas for films . Rifkin , being a fan of the 1968 Planet of the Apes felt it was best to continue the film series . " Having independent film experience , I promised I could write and direct a huge @-@ looking film for a reasonable price and budget , like Aliens . " Fox commissioned Rifkin to write what amounted to a sequel , " but not a sequel to the fifth film , an alternate sequel to the first film . " He took influences from Spartacus , with the storyline being " the ape empire had reached its Roman era . A descendant of Charlton Heston 's character named Duke would eventually lead a human slave revolt against the oppressive Roman @-@ esque apes , led by General <unk> . A real sword and sandal spectacular , monkey style . Gladiator did the same movie without the ape costumes . " 
 Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes , the project was put on fast track and almost entered pre @-@ production . Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score . Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role . " I can 't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I , Adam Rifkin , was going to be resurrecting the Planet of the Apes . It all seemed too good to be true . I soon found out it was . " Days before the film was to commence pre @-@ production , new studio executives arrived at Fox , which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio . Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts . The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea , with the apes going through a Renaissance . In the story , the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works , the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half @-@ human , half @-@ ape from the gorillas . Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci @-@ type character they had written for him . However , the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall 's involvement in the series , and Jackson turned his attention back to Heavenly Creatures .

 By 1993 , Fox hired Don Murphy and Jane Hamsher as producers . Sam Raimi and Oliver Stone were being considered as possible directors , though Stone signed on as executive producer / co @-@ writer with a $ 1 million salary . On the storyline , Stone explained in December 1993 , " It has the discovery of cryogenically frozen Vedic Apes who hold the secret numeric codes to the Bible that foretold the end of civilizations . It deals with past versus the future . My concept is that there 's a code inscribed in the Bible that predicts all historical events . The apes were there at the beginning and figured it all out . " 
 Stone brought Terry Hayes to write the screenplay entitled Return of the Apes . Set in the near future , a plague is making humans extinct . Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age . He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond to a time when Palaeolithic humans were at war for the future of the planet with highly evolved apes . The apes ' supreme commander is a gorilla named <unk> . Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named <unk> ( pronounced Eve ) to be the next step in evolution . It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the human race . They protect her from the virus , thus ensuring the survival of the human race 102 @,@ 000 years later . Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam . 
 Fox president Peter Chernin called Return of the Apes " one of the best scripts I ever read " . Chernin was hoping Hayes ' script would create a franchise that included sequels , spin @-@ off television shows and merchandise . In March 1994 , Arnold Schwarzenegger signed on as Will Robinson with the condition he had approval of director . Chuck Russell was considered as a possible director before Phillip Noyce was hired in January 1995 , while pre @-@ production was nearing commencement with a $ 100 million budget . Stone first approached Rick Baker , who worked on Rifkin 's failed remake , to design the prosthetic makeup , but eventually hired Stan Winston . 
 Fox became frustrated by the distance between their approach and Hayes ' interpretation of Stone 's ideas , as producer Don Murphy put it , " Terry wrote a Terminator and Fox wanted The Flintstones " . Fox studio executive Dylan Sellers felt the script could be improved by comedy . " What if Robinson finds himself in Ape land and the Apes are trying to play baseball ? But they 're missing one element , like the pitcher or something . " Sellers continued . " Robinson knows what they 're missing and he shows them , and they all start playing . " Sellers refused to give up his baseball scene , and when Hayes turned in the next script , sans baseball , Sellers fired him . Dissatisfied with Sellers ' decision to fire Hayes , Noyce left Return of the Apes in February 1995 to work on The Saint .

 Stone pursued other films of his own , Chernin was replaced by Thomas Rothman , and a drunken Sellers crashed his car , killing a much @-@ loved colleague and earning jail time , while producers Murphy and Hamsher were paid off . " After they got rid of us , they brought on Chris Columbus " , Murphy stated . " Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing , which didn 't make much sense . " Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs . Columbus brought Sam Hamm , his co @-@ writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script , to write the screenplay . " We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films , and would also incorporate a lot of material [ from Pierre Boulle 's novel ] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production , " Hamm continued . " The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book , but a lot of the stuff in the second half comes directly from it , or directly inspired by it . " 
 Hamm 's script had an ape astronaut from another planet crash @-@ landing in New York Harbor , launching a virus that will make human beings extinct . Dr. Susan Landis , who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and Alexander Troy , an Area 51 scientist , use the ape 's spacecraft to return to the virus ' planet of origin , hoping to find an antidote . They find an urban environment where apes armed with heavy weapons hunt humans . The main villain was Lord Zaius ; in contrast to Dr. Zaius , Lord Zaius was very cruel to the humans . Landis and Troy discover the antidote and return to Earth , only to find in their 74 @-@ year absence that apes have taken over the planet . " The Statue of Liberty 's once proud porcelain features have been crudely chiseled into the grotesque likeness of a great grinning ape " . 
 Schwarzenegger remained attached , but Fox had mixed emotions with Hamm 's script . When Columbus dropped out in late 1995 to work on Jingle All the Way , Fox offered the director 's position to Roland Emmerich in January 1996 . James Cameron was in talks during the filming of Titanic as writer and producer . Cameron 's version would have drawn elements from the original film and its sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes . After the financial and critical success of Titanic , Cameron dropped out . After learning about his previous involvement , Chernin and Rothman met with Peter Jackson to learn about his original Renaissance idea . Jackson turned down directing the film with Schwarzenegger and Cameron as his producer , recognizing they would probably conflict over the direction . Schwarzenegger left to work on Eraser . Michael Bay then turned down the director 's position . Jackson again turned down the project while facing the possible cancellation of The Lord of the Rings in 1998 , because he was unenthusiastic following Roddy McDowall 's death . In mid @-@ 1999 , the Hughes brothers were interested in directing but were committed to From Hell . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 In 1999 , William Broyles , Jr. turned down the chance to write the script , but decided to sign on " when I found out I could have an extensive amount of creative control " . Fox projected the release date for July 2001 , while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet " <unk> " . Entitled The Visitor and billed as " episode one in the Chronicles of <unk> " , Broyles ' script caught the attention of director Tim Burton , who was hired in February 2000 . " I wasn 't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film , " Burton said later . " But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world . Like a lot of people , I was affected by the original film . I wanted to do a ' re @-@ imagining ' . " Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March . " This is a very emotional film for me . I greenlighted the original Apes when I was the head of Fox in 1967 . " 
 Under Burton 's direction , Broyles wrote another draft , but his script was projected at a $ 200 million budget . Fox wanted to cut it to $ 100 million . In August 2000 , two months before principal photography , Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites . Broyles " had a lot of respect with the work they [ Konner and Rosenthal ] did . And to think that given what I 'd done and given what Tim wanted , they navigated the right course . " One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash @-@ landing at Yankee Stadium , witnessing apes playing baseball . Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one . The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton . This was largely contributed by Fox 's adamant release date ( July 2001 ) , which meant that everything from pre @-@ production to editing and visual effects work was rushed . 
 Konner and Rosenthal were rewriting the script even as sets were being constructed . Ari , Helena Bonham Carter 's character , was originally a princess . She was changed to " a Senator 's daughter with a liberal mentality " . One of the drafts had General Thade , Tim Roth 's character , as an albino gorilla , but Burton felt chimpanzees were more frightening . Limbo , Paul Giamatti 's character " was supposed to turn into a good guy . There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end , " Giamatti reflected . " But Tim [ Burton ] and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into the end . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Burton wanted to begin filming in October 2000 , but it was pushed back to November 6 , 2000 and ended in April 2001 . Filming for Planet of the Apes began at Lake Powell , where parts of the original film were shot . Due to a local drought , production crews had to pump in extra water . The film was mostly shot at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City , California , while other filming locations included lava plains in Hawaii and Trona Pinnacles at Ridgecrest . To preserve secrecy , the shooting script did not include the ending . Stan Winston was the original makeup designer but left because of creative differences . Fox considered using computer @-@ generated imagery to create the apes , but Burton insisted on using prosthetic makeup designed by Rick Baker . Baker was previously involved with Adam Rifkin 's unproduced remake . Burton commented , " I have a relationship with both of them [ Winston and Baker ] , so that decision was hard , " he says . " Stan worked on Edward Scissorhands and Baker did Martin Landau 's makeup [ as Béla Lugosi in Ed Wood ] " . 
 On his hiring , Baker explained , " I did the Dino De Laurentiis version of King Kong in 1976 and was always disappointed because I wasn 't able to do it as realistically as I wanted . I thought Apes would be a good way to make up for that . " In addition to King Kong , Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on Greystoke : The Legend of Tarzan , Lord of the Apes , Gorillas in the Mist : The Story of Dian Fossey , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young . The makeup took 4 @.@ 5 hours to apply and 1 @.@ 5 hours to remove . Burton explained , " it 's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours . Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night . " Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially " more animal @-@ like ; flying through trees , climb walls , swing out of windows , and go ape shit when angry . " For a month and a half before shooting started , the actors who portrayed apes attended " ape school " . Industrial Light & Magic , Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences . Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design . 
 To compose the film score , Burton hired regular collaborator Danny Elfman , who had previously been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989 . Elfman noted that his work on Planet of the Apes contained more percussion instruments than usual . 
 During filming , Roth held a grudge against Heston due to his work with the National Rifle Association : " It was very difficult for me . On one level , there 's the man and he 's my dad . But on the other level , the whole NRA thing is what it is now . I 'm so against it , very vocally so . But it was inappropriate for the workplace . If I 'm going to talk to him , I 'll talk to him outside the workplace . So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene . " Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston .

 Based on 156 reviews collected by the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 45 % of the critics gave Planet of the Apes positive reviews , with the site 's consensus stating : " This remake of Planet of the Apes can 't compare to the original in some critics ' minds , but the striking visuals and B @-@ movie charms may win you over . " By comparison , Metacritic calculated an average score of 50 out of 34 reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews . " Prominent critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film 2 ½ stars ; he praised the twist ending , but felt the film lacked a balanced story structure . " The movie is great @-@ looking . Rick Baker 's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups , and his apes sparkle with personality and presence . The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe , " Ebert commented . " Tim Burton made a film that 's respectful to the original , and respectable in itself , but that 's not enough . Ten years from now , it will be the 1968 version that people are still renting . " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave a negative review . " Call it a letdown , worsened by the forces of shoddy screenwriting . To quote Heston in both films , ' Damn them , damn them all ' . " 
 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed " the actors in the nonhuman roles are mostly too buried by makeup to make strong impressions . Unfortunately , none of the good work counts as much as you 'd think it would , " Turan said . " Planet of the Apes shows that taking material too seriously can be as much of a handicap as not taking it seriously at all . " Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave a more favorable review , feeling the script was balanced and the film served its purpose as " pure entertainment " . Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today enjoyed Planet of the Apes , feeling most of the credit should go to prosthetic makeup designer Rick Baker . 
 Much criticism was leveled against the ambiguous ending . Tim Roth , who portrayed General Thade , said " I cannot explain that ending . I have seen it twice and I don 't understand anything . " Helena Bonham Carter , who played Ari , said , " I thought it made sense , kind of . I don 't understand why everyone went , ' Huh ? ' It 's all a time warp thing . He 's gone back and he realizes Thade 's beat him there . " Although the ending was ambiguous , it was closer to the ending of the actual Pierre Boulle book than was the ending of the 1968 Charlton Heston movie version . In the first of two twist endings of the Pierre Boulle book , the astronaut escapes back to planet Earth , only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip . Burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense , but it was more of a cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel . " It was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case Fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie , " he explained . 
 The film was nominated for two BAFTA Awards , one for Best Make @-@ up held by Rick Baker , the other for Best Costume Design . Roth ( Supporting Actor ) , Bonham Carter ( Supporting Actress ) , Colleen Atwood ( Costume ) , and Rick Baker ( Make @-@ up ) received nominations at the Saturn Awards . Atwood and Baker were nominated at the 55th British Academy Film Awards , while music composer Danny Elfman was nominated for his work at the 43rd Grammy Awards . Planet of the Apes won Worst Remake at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards , while Heston ( Worst Supporting Actor ) and Estella Warren ( Worst Supporting Actress ) also won awards .

 Fox stated that if Planet of the Apes was a financial success , then a sequel would be commissioned . Although the film was indeed a financial success , Fox decided not to proceed with a sequel . When asked whether he would be interested in working on a follow @-@ up , director Tim Burton replied , " I 'd rather jump out a window . " Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter would have returned if Burton had decided to make another Apes film . Paul Giamatti had been interested in reprising his role . " I think it 'd be great to have apes driving cars , smoking cigars , " Giamatti said . " Wearing glasses , sitting in a board room , stuff like that . " Planet of the Apes was the last film Burton worked on with his former fiancée Lisa Marie . After their relationship broke up , Burton started a relationship with Helena Bonham Carter , who portrayed Ari . Planet of the Apes was also Burton 's first collaboration with producer Richard D. Zanuck . 
 Fox returned to the Planet of the Apes franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes , a reboot of the series that proved to be a hit and led to its own sequels .

 = Hippocrates = 
 Hippocrates of Kos ( / <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> ; <unk> ; c . 460 – c . 370 BC ) , also known as Hippocrates II , was a Greek physician of the Age of Pericles ( Classical Greece ) , and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine . He is referred to as the " Father of Western Medicine " in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine . This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece , establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated ( <unk> and philosophy ) , thus establishing medicine as a profession . 
 However , the achievements of the writers of the Corpus , the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine , and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled ; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought , wrote , and did . Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the paragon of the ancient physician , and credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath , still relevant and in use today . He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of clinical medicine , summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools , and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Historians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the Greek island of Kos ; other biographical information , however , is likely to be untrue . 
 Soranus of Ephesus , a 2nd @-@ century Greek gynecologist , was Hippocrates ' first biographer and is the source of most personal information about him . Later biographies are in the Suda of the 10th century AD , and in the works of John Tzetzes , which date from the 12th century AD . Hippocrates is mentioned in passing in the writings of two contemporaries : Plato , in " Protagoras " and " Phaedrus " , and , Aristotle 's " Politics " , which date from the 4th century BC . 
 Soranus wrote that Hippocrates ' father was Heraclides , a physician , and his mother was <unk> , daughter of <unk> . The two sons of Hippocrates , Thessalus and Draco , and his son @-@ in @-@ law , <unk> , were his students . According to Galen , a later physician , <unk> was Hippocrates ' true successor , while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named Hippocrates ( Hippocrates III and IV ) . 
 Soranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather ( Hippocrates I ) , and studied other subjects with Democritus and Gorgias . Hippocrates was probably trained at the <unk> of Kos , and took lessons from the Thracian physician <unk> of Selymbria . Plato mentions Hippocrates in two of his dialogues : in Protagoras , Plato describes Hippocrates as " Hippocrates of Kos , the <unk> " ; while in Phaedrus , Plato suggests that " Hippocrates the <unk> " thought that a complete knowledge of the nature of the body was necessary for medicine . Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life , traveling at least as far as Thessaly , Thrace , and the Sea of Marmara . Several different accounts of his death exist . He died , probably in Larissa , at the age of 83 , 85 or 90 , though some say he lived to be well over 100 . 
 = = Hippocratic theory = = 
 Hippocrates is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally , not because of superstition and gods . Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine . He separated the discipline of medicine from religion , believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors , diet , and living habits . Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus . However , Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology , such as <unk> . 
 Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split ( into the Knidian and Koan ) on how to deal with disease . The Knidian school of medicine focused on diagnosis . Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek taboo forbidding the dissection of humans . The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms . The Hippocratic school or Koan school achieved greater success by applying general diagnoses and passive treatments . Its focus was on patient care and prognosis , not diagnosis . It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice . 
 Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine . Now , the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment , both of which were espoused by the Knidian school . This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates ' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia , with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations ; for example , the French doctor M. S. <unk> called the Hippocratic treatment a " meditation upon death " . 
 = = = Crisis = = = 
 Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a crisis , a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death , or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover . After a crisis , a relapse might follow , and then another deciding crisis . According to this doctrine , crises tend to occur on critical days , which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease . If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day , a relapse might be expected . Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates , though it is possible that it predated him . 
 Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive . The therapeutic approach was based on " the healing power of nature " ( " vis <unk> naturae " in Latin ) . According to this doctrine , the body contains within itself the power to re @-@ balance the four humours and heal itself ( <unk> ) . Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process . To this end , Hippocrates believed " rest and immobilization [ were ] of capital importance . " In general , the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient ; treatment was gentle , and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile . For example , only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds , though " dry " treatment was preferable . <unk> <unk> were sometimes employed . 
 Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen ; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis . Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of apple cider vinegar . Hippocrates once said that " to eat when you are sick , is to feed your sickness . " However , potent drugs were used on certain occasions . This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required traction to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area . The Hippocratic bench and other devices were used to this end . 
 One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis . At Hippocrates ' time , medicinal therapy was quite immature , and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories . 
 = = = Professionalism = = = 
 Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism , discipline , and rigorous practice . The Hippocratic work On the Physician recommends that physicians always be well @-@ <unk> , honest , calm , understanding , and serious . The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice : he followed detailed specifications for , " lighting , personnel , instruments , positioning of the patient , and techniques of bandaging and <unk> " in the ancient operating room . He even kept his fingernails to a precise length . 
 The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation . These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner , so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians . Hippocrates made careful , regular note of many symptoms including complexion , pulse , fever , pains , movement , and excretions . He is said to have measured a patient 's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying . Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment . " To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation . " For this reason , he may more properly be termed as the " Father of Medicine " . 
 = = Direct contributions to medicine = = 
 Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions . He is given credit for the first description of clubbing of the fingers , an important diagnostic sign in chronic lung disease , lung cancer and <unk> heart disease . For this reason , clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as " Hippocratic fingers " . Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe Hippocratic face in Prognosis . Shakespeare famously alludes to this description when writing of Falstaff 's death in Act II , Scene <unk> of Henry V. 
 Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as acute , chronic , endemic and epidemic , and use terms such as , " exacerbation , relapse , resolution , crisis , paroxysm , peak , and convalescence . " Another of Hippocrates ' major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology , physical findings , surgical treatment and prognosis of thoracic empyema , i.e. suppuration of the lining of the chest cavity . His teachings remain relevant to present @-@ day students of pulmonary medicine and surgery . Hippocrates was the first documented chest surgeon and his findings and techniques , while crude , such as the use of lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess , are still valid . 
 The Hippocratic school of medicine described well the ailments of the human rectum and the treatment thereof , despite the school 's poor theory of medicine . Hemorrhoids , for instance , though believed to be caused by an excess of bile and phlegm , were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways . <unk> and excision are described in the Hippocratic Corpus , in addition to the preferred methods : ligating the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron . Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as well . Today , " treatment [ for hemorrhoids ] still includes burning , strangling , and excising . " Also , some of the fundamental concepts of <unk> outlined in the Corpus are still in use . For example , the uses of the rectal speculum , a common medical device , are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus . This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to endoscopy . Hippocrates often used lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to treat diseases such as diabetes , what is today called lifestyle medicine . He is often quoted with " Let food be your medicine , and medicine be your food " and " Walking is man 's best medicine " , however the quote " Let food be your medicine " is an apparent misquotation and its exact origin remains unknown . 
 = = Hippocratic Corpus = = 
 The Hippocratic Corpus ( Latin : Corpus <unk> ) is a collection of around seventy early medical works from Alexandrian Greece . It is written in Ionic Greek . The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of the corpus has not been conclusively answered , but the volumes were probably produced by his students and followers . Because of the variety of subjects , writing styles and apparent date of construction , scholars believe Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person ( <unk> numbers the authors at nineteen ) . The corpus was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity , and its teaching generally followed his principles ; thus it came to be known by his name . It might be the remains of a library of Kos , or a collection compiled in the 3rd century BC in Alexandria . 
 The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks , lectures , research , notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine , in no particular order . These works were written for different audiences , both specialists and laymen , and were sometimes written from opposing viewpoints ; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus . Notable among the treatises of the Corpus are The Hippocratic Oath ; The Book of <unk> ; On <unk> in Acute Diseases ; Aphorisms ; On Airs , Waters and Places ; Instruments of Reduction ; On The Sacred Disease ; etc . 
 = = = Hippocratic Oath = = = 
 The Hippocratic Oath , a seminal document on the ethics of medical practice , was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows it may have been written after his death . This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus . Recently the authenticity of the document 's author has come under scrutiny . While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today , it serves as a foundation for other , similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals . Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice .

 The Travels of Sir John Mandeville reports ( incorrectly ) that Hippocrates was the ruler of the islands of " Kos and Lango " [ sic ] , and recounts a legend about Hippocrates ' daughter . She was transformed into a hundred @-@ foot long dragon by the goddess Diana , and is the " lady of the manor " of an old castle . She emerges three times a year , and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her , making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands . Various knights try , but flee when they see the hideous dragon ; they die soon thereafter . This is a version of the legend of Melusine . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Hippocrates is widely considered to be the " Father of Medicine " . His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine ; but after his death the advancement stalled . So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time . The centuries after Hippocrates ' death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement . For instance , " after the Hippocratic period , the practice of taking clinical case @-@ histories died out , " according to Fielding Garrison . 
 After Hippocrates , the next significant physician was Galen , a Greek who lived from AD 129 to AD 200 . Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine , moving both forward and backward . In the Middle Ages , the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies . After the European Renaissance , Hippocratic methods were revived in western Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century . Notable among those who employed Hippocrates ' rigorous clinical techniques were Thomas Sydenham , William Heberden , Jean @-@ Martin Charcot and William Osler . Henri <unk> , a French physician , said that these revivals make up " the whole history of internal medicine . " 
 The most severe form of hair loss and baldness is called the Hippocratic form . 
 = = = Image = = = 
 According to Aristotle 's testimony , Hippocrates was known as " The Great Hippocrates " . Concerning his disposition , Hippocrates was first portrayed as a " kind , dignified , old country doctor " and later as " stern and forbidding " . He is certainly considered wise , of very great intellect and especially as very practical . Francis Adams describes him as " strictly the physician of experience and common sense . " 
 His image as the wise , old doctor is reinforced by busts of him , which wear large beards on a wrinkled face . Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of Jove and Asklepius . Accordingly , the busts of Hippocrates that have been found could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities . Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals . Fielding Garrison , an authority on medical history , stated , " He is , above all , the exemplar of that flexible , critical , well @-@ poised attitude of mind , ever on the lookout for sources of error , which is the very essence of the scientific spirit . " " His figure ... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician , " according to A Short History of Medicine , inspiring the medical profession since his death .
