 While a French citizen , Marie Skłodowska Curie ( she used both surnames ) never lost her sense of Polish identity . She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland . She named the first chemical element that she discovered ‍ — ‌ polonium , which she isolated in 1898 ‍ — ‌ after her native country . 
 Curie died in 1934 , aged 66 , at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz ( Haute @-@ Savoie ) , France , due to aplastic anemia brought on by exposure to radiation while carrying test tubes of radium in her pockets during research , and in the course of her service in World War I mobile X @-@ ray units that she had set up .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw , in the Russian partition of Poland , on 7 November 1867 , the fifth and youngest child of well @-@ known teachers Bronisława , née <unk> , and Władysław Skłodowski . The elder siblings of Maria ( nickname : Mania ) were Zofia ( born 1862 , nickname : Zosia ) , Józef ( born 1863 , nickname : <unk> ) , Bronisława ( born 1865 , nickname : <unk> ) and Helena ( born 1866 , nickname : Hela ) . 
 On both the paternal and maternal sides , the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland 's independence ( the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863 – 65 ) . This condemned the subsequent generation , including Maria , her elder sisters and her brother , to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life . 
 Maria 's paternal grandfather , Józef Skłodowski , had been a respected teacher in Lublin , where he taught the young Bolesław Prus , who would become a leading figure in Polish literature . Her father , Władysław Skłodowski , taught mathematics and physics , subjects that Maria was to pursue , and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia for boys . After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools , he brought much of the laboratory equipment home , and instructed his children in its use . 
 The father was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro @-@ Polish sentiments , and forced to take lower @-@ paying posts ; the family also lost money on a bad investment , and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house . Maria 's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls ; she resigned from the position after Maria was born . She died of tuberculosis in May 1878 , when Maria was ten years old . Less than three years earlier , Maria 's oldest sibling , Zofia , had died of typhus contracted from a boarder . Maria 's father was an atheist ; her mother a devout Catholic . The deaths of Maria 's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic . 
 When she was ten years old , Maria began attending the boarding school of J. <unk> ; next she attended a gymnasium for girls , from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal . After a collapse , possibly due to depression , she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father , and the next year with her father in Warsaw , where she did some tutoring . Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman , she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University , a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students . 
 Maria made an agreement with her sister , Bronisława , that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława 's medical studies in Paris , in exchange for similar assistance two years later . In connection with this , Maria took a position as governess : first as a home tutor in Warsaw ; then for two years as a governess in <unk> with a landed family , the <unk> , who were relatives of her father . While working for the latter family , she fell in love with their son , Kazimierz Żorawski , a future eminent mathematician . His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative , and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them . Maria 's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both . He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician , becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University . Still , as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic , he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932 . 
 At the beginning of 1890 , Bronisława — who a few months earlier had married Kazimierz <unk> , a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris . Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition ; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds . She was helped by her father , who was able to secure a more lucrative position again . All that time she continued to educate herself , reading books , exchanging letters , and being tutored herself . In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw . She continued working as a governess , and remained there till late 1891 . She tutored , studied at the Flying University , and began her practical scientific training ( 1890 – 91 ) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66 , near Warsaw 's Old Town . The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef <unk> , who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev . 
 = = = New life in Paris = = = 
 In late 1891 , she left Poland for France . In Paris , Maria ( or Marie , as she would be known in France ) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law before renting a garret closer to the university , in the Latin Quarter , and proceeding with her studies of physics , chemistry , and mathematics at the University of Paris , where she enrolled in late 1891 . She subsisted on her meager resources , suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger . 
 Skłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings , barely earning her keep . In 1893 , she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Professor Gabriel Lippmann . Meanwhile , she continued studying at the University of Paris , and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894 . 
 Marie had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels , commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry ( Société d 'encouragement pour l 'industrie nationale [ 1 ] ) . That same year Pierre Curie entered her life ; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together . Pierre was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry , the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris ( ESPCI ) . They were introduced by the Polish physicist , Professor Józef Wierusz @-@ Kowalski , who had learned that Marie was looking for a larger laboratory space , something that Wierusz @-@ Kowalski thought Pierre had access to . Though Pierre did not have a large laboratory , he was able to find some space for Marie where she was able to begin work . 
 Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer , and they began to develop feelings for one another . Eventually Pierre proposed marriage , but at first Marie did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country . Pierre , however , declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland , even if it meant being reduced to teaching French . Meanwhile , for the 1894 summer break , Marie returned to Warsaw , where she visited her family . She was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland , but she was denied a place at Kraków University because she was a woman . A letter from Pierre convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. At Marie 's insistence , Pierre had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895 ; he was also promoted to professor at the School . A contemporary quip would call Marie , " Pierre 's biggest discovery . " On 26 July 1895 they were married in Sceaux ( Seine ) ; neither wanted a religious service . Marie 's dark blue outfit , worn instead of a bridal gown , would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit . They shared two pastimes : long bicycle trips , and journeys abroad , which brought them even closer . In Pierre , Marie had found a new love , a partner , and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend .

 In 1895 , Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the existence of X @-@ rays , though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood . In 1896 , Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X @-@ rays in their penetrating power . He demonstrated that this radiation , unlike phosphorescence , did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself . Influenced by these two important discoveries , Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis . 
 She used an innovative technique to investigate samples . Fifteen years earlier , her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer , a sensitive device for measuring electric charge . Using Pierre 's electrometer , she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity . Using this technique , her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present . She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself . This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible . 
 In 1897 , her daughter Irène was born . To support her family , Curie began teaching at the École Normale Supérieure . The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory ; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry . The shed , formerly a medical school dissecting room , was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof . They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances . The School did not sponsor her research , but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments . 
 Curie 's systematic studies included two uranium minerals , pitchblende and torbernite ( also known as chalcolite ) . Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself , and chalcolite twice as active . She concluded that , if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct , then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium . She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation , and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive . 
 Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work . By mid @-@ 1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her . 
 The [ research ] idea [ writes Reid ] was her own ; no one helped her formulate it , and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it . She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity . It [ is ] likely that already at this early stage of her career [ she ] realized that ... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved . 
 She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority . Had not Becquerel , two years earlier , presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it , credit for the discovery of radioactivity , and even a Nobel Prize , would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson . Curie chose the same rapid means of publication . Her paper , giving a brief and simple account of her work , was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor , Gabriel Lippmann . Even so , just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel , so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium ; two months earlier , Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin . 
 At that time , no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper , describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself : " The fact is very remarkable , and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium . " She later would recall how she felt " a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible . " On 14 April 1898 , the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100 @-@ gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar . They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore . 
 In July 1898 , Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named " polonium " , in honour of her native Poland , which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires . On 26 December 1898 , the Curies announced the existence of a second element , which they named " radium " , from the Latin word for " ray " . In the course of their research , they also coined the word " radioactivity " . 
 To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt , the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form . Pitchblende is a complex mineral ; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task . The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy ; chemically it resembles the element bismuth , and polonium was the only bismuth @-@ like substance in the ore . Radium , however , was more elusive ; it is closely related chemically to barium , and pitchblende contains both elements . By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium , but appreciable quantities , uncontaminated with barium , were still beyond reach . The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization . From a ton of pitchblende , one @-@ tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902 . In 1910 , Marie Curie isolated pure radium metal . She never succeeded in isolating polonium , which has a half @-@ life of only 138 days . 
 Between 1898 and 1902 , the Curies published , jointly or separately , a total of 32 scientific papers , including one that announced that , when exposed to radium , diseased , tumor @-@ forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells . 
 In 1900 , Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École Normale Supérieure , and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris . In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father 's death . 
 In June 1903 , supervised by Gabriel Lippmann , Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris . That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity ; being a woman , she was prevented from speaking , and Pierre alone was allowed to . Meanwhile , a new industry began developing , based on radium . The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business .

 In December 1903 , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie , Marie Curie , and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics , " in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel . " At first , the Committee intended to honour only Pierre and Becquerel , but one of the committee members and an advocate of woman scientists , Swedish mathematician Magnus <unk> Mittag @-@ Leffler , alerted Pierre to the situation , and after his complaint , Marie 's name was added to the nomination . Marie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize . 
 Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person ; they were too busy with their work , and Pierre , who disliked public ceremonies , was feeling increasingly ill . As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture , the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905 . The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant . Following the award of the Nobel Prize , and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva , which offered Pierre a position , the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics , although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory . Upon Pierre 's complaint , the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory , but it would not be ready until 1906 . 
 In December 1904 , Curie gave birth to their second daughter , Ève . She later hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language , and sent or took them on visits to Poland . 
 On 19 April 1906 , Pierre was killed in a road accident . Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain , he was struck by a horse @-@ drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels , causing his skull to fracture . Curie was devastated by her husband 's death . On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for Pierre and to offer it to Marie . She accepted it hoping to create a world @-@ class laboratory as a tribute to Pierre . She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris . 
 Curie 's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris , however . In her later years , she headed the Radium Institute ( Institut du radium , now Curie Institute , Institut Curie ) , a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris . The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux , director of the Pasteur Institute , who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute . Only then , with the threat of Curie leaving , did the University of Paris relent , and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute . 
 In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium ; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre : the curie . Nevertheless , in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences did not elect her to be a member by one or two votes . Elected instead was Édouard Branly , an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph . A doctoral student of Curie , Marguerite Perey , became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy – over half a century later , in 1962 . Despite Curie 's fame as a scientist working for France , the public 's attitude tended toward xenophobia — the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair – which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish . During the French Academy of Sciences elections , she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist . Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour , but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes . 
 In 1911 it was revealed that in 1910 – 11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year 's duration with physicist Paul Langevin , a former student of Pierre 's — a married man who was estranged from his wife . This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents . Curie ( then in her mid @-@ 40s ) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home @-@ wrecker . When the scandal broke , she was away at a conference in Belgium ; on her return , she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge , with her daughters , in the home of a friend . 
 International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights , and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal , honored her a second time , with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . This award was " in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium , by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element . " She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes , and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each . A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning , headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz , encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country . Curie 's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute , built in 1914 , where research was conducted in chemistry , physics , and medicine . A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize , she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment . For most of 1912 she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist , Hertha Ayrton . She returned to her laboratory only in December , after a break of about 14 months . 
 In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined , focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914 , and on a new street named Rue Pierre @-@ Curie . She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities . The Institute 's development was interrupted by the coming war , as most researchers were drafted into the French Army , and it fully resumed its activities in 1919 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 During World War I , Curie saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons . After a quick study of radiology , anatomy , and automotive mechanics she procured X @-@ ray equipment , vehicles , auxiliary generators , and developed mobile radiography units , which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ( " Little Curies " ) . She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France 's first military radiology centre , operational by late 1914 . Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Irène , Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war . Later , she began training other women as aides . 
 In 1915 Curie produced hollow needles containing ' radium emanation ' , a colorless , radioactive gas given off by radium , later identified as radon , to be used for sterilizing infected tissue . She provided the radium from her own one @-@ gram supply . It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X @-@ ray units . Busy with this work , she carried out very little scientific research during that period . In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort , Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government . 
 Also , promptly after the war started , she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them . She did buy war bonds , using her Nobel Prize money . She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause . After the war , she summarized her war time experiences in a book Radiology in War ( 1919 ) .

 In 1920 , for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium , the French government established a stipend for her ; its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur ( 1822 – 95 ) . In 1921 , Marie was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium . Mrs. William Brown <unk> , after interviewing Marie , created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium , publicising her trip . In 1921 , US President Warren G. Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States . Before the meeting , recognising her growing fame abroad , and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public , the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award , but she refused . In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine . She also travelled to other countries , appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium , Brazil , Spain , and Czechoslovakia . 
 Led by Curie , the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners , including her daughter Irène Joliot @-@ Curie and her son @-@ in @-@ law , Frédéric Joliot @-@ Curie . Eventually , it became one of four major radioactivity research laboratories , the others being the Cavendish Laboratory , with Ernest Rutherford ; the Institute for Radium Research , Vienna , with Stefan Meyer ; and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry , with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner . 
 In August 1922 , Marie Curie became a member of the newly created International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations . In 1923 , she wrote a biography of Pierre , entitled Pierre Curie . In 1925 , she visited Poland , to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the Radium Institute in Warsaw . Her second American tour , in 1929 , succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium ; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director . These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided resources needed for her work . In 1930 , she was elected a member of the International Atomic Weights Committee where she served until her death . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934 . A few months later , on 4 July 1934 , she died at the Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy , in Haute @-@ Savoie , from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long @-@ term exposure to radiation . The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work , which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed . She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket , and she stored them in her desk drawer , remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark . Curie was also exposed to X @-@ rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war . Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses ( including near blindness due to cataracts ) and ultimately her death , she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure . 
 She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux , alongside her husband Pierre . Sixty years later , in 1995 , in honour of their achievements , the remains of both were transferred to the Panthéon , Paris . She became the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthéon on her own merits . In 2015 , two other women were also interred on their own merits . 
 Because of their levels of radioactive contamination , her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle . Even her cookbook is highly radioactive . Her papers are kept in lead @-@ lined boxes , and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing . 
 In her last year , she worked on a book , Radioactivity , which was published posthumously in 1935 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The physical and societal aspects of the Curies ' work contributed substantially to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty @-@ first centuries . Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes : 
 The result of the Curies ' work was epoch @-@ making . Radium 's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored . It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics . On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom . As a result of Rutherford 's experiments with alpha radiation , the nuclear atom was first postulated . In medicine , the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked . 
 If Curie 's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry , it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere . To attain her scientific achievements , she had to overcome barriers that were placed in her way because she was a woman , in both her native and her adoptive country . This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud 's Marie Curie : A Life , which emphasizes Marie 's role as a feminist precursor . 
 She was known for her honesty and moderate life style . Having received a small scholarship in 1893 , she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep . She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends , family , students , and research associates . In an unusual decision , Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium @-@ isolation process , so that the scientific community could do research unhindered . She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her . She and her husband often refused awards and medals . Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame . 
 = = Awards , honours , and tributes = = 
 As one of the most famous women scientists to date , Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe , even in the realm of pop culture . In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist , Marie Curie was voted the " most inspirational woman in science " . Curie received 25 @.@ 1 per cent of all votes cast , nearly twice as many as second @-@ place Rosalind Franklin ( 14 @.@ 2 per cent ) . 
 Poland and France declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie , and the United Nations declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry . An artistic installation celebrating " Madame Curie " filled the Jacobs Gallery at San Diego 's Museum of Contemporary Art . On 7 November , Google celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special Google Doodle . On 10 December , the New York Academy of Sciences celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie 's second Nobel prize in the presence of Princess Madeleine of Sweden . 
 Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize , the first person to win two Nobel Prizes , the only woman to win in two fields , and the only person to win in multiple sciences . Awards that she received include : 
 Nobel Prize in Physics ( 1903 , with Pierre ) 
 Davy Medal ( 1903 , with Pierre ) 
 Matteucci Medal ( 1904 , with Pierre ) 
 <unk> Prize ( 1907 ) 
 Elliott Cresson Medal ( 1909 ) 
 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ( 1911 ) 
 Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society ( 1921 ) 
 Marie Curie 's 1898 publication with her husband M. P. Curie and also with M. G. <unk> for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the ESPCI Paris ( Ecole supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris ) in 2015 . 
 In 1995 , she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon , Paris . The curie ( symbol Ci ) , a unit of radioactivity , is named in honour of her and Pierre ( although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre , Marie or both of them ) . The element with atomic number 96 was named curium . Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world . The Marie Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her . In Poland , she had received honorary doctorates from the Lwów Polytechnic ( 1912 ) , Poznań University ( 1922 ) , Kraków 's Jagiellonian University ( 1924 ) , and the Warsaw Polytechnic ( 1926 ) . In 1921 , she was awarded the Iota Sigma Pi National Honorary Member for her significant contribution . 
 Numerous locations around the world are named after her . In 2007 , a metro station in Paris was renamed to honour both of the Curies . Polish nuclear research reactor Maria is named after her . The 7000 Curie asteroid is also named after her . A KLM McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 11 ( registration PH @-@ KCC ) is named in her honour . 
 Several institutions bear her name , starting with the two Curie institutes – the Maria Skłodowska – Curie Institute of Oncology , in Warsaw ; and the Institut Curie in Paris . She is the patron of Maria Curie @-@ Skłodowska University , in Lublin , founded in 1944 ; and of Pierre and Marie Curie University ( Paris VI ) , France 's pre @-@ eminent science university . In Britain , Marie Curie Cancer Care was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill . 
 Two museums are devoted to Marie Curie . In 1967 , the Maria Skłodowska @-@ Curie Museum was established in Warsaw 's " New Town " , at her birthplace on ulica Freta ( Freta Street ) . Her Paris laboratory is preserved as the Musée Curie , open since 1992 . 
 Several works of art bear her likeness . In 1935 , <unk> <unk> , wife of Polish President Ignacy Mościcki , unveiled a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw 's Radium Institute . During the 1944 Second World War Warsaw Uprising against the Nazi German occupation , the monument was damaged by gunfire ; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal . In 1955 Jozef Mazur created a stained glass panel of her , the Maria Skłodowska @-@ Curie Medallion , featured in the University at Buffalo Polish Room . 
 A number of biographies are devoted to her . In 1938 her daughter , Ève Curie , published Madame Curie . In 1987 Françoise Giroud wrote Marie Curie : A Life . In 2005 Barbara Goldsmith wrote Obsessive Genius : The Inner World of Marie Curie . In 2011 Lauren Redniss published Radioactive : Marie and Pierre Curie , a Tale of Love and Fallout . 
 Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon starred in the 1943 U.S. Oscar @-@ nominated film , Madame Curie , based on her life . More recently , in 1997 , a French film about Pierre and Marie Curie was released , Les Palmes de M. Schutz . It was adapted from a play of the same name . In the film , Marie Curie was played by Isabelle Huppert . 
 Curie is the subject of the play False Assumptions by Lawrence <unk> , in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life .

 On the 2011 centenary of Marie Curie 's second Nobel Prize ( 1911 ) , an allegorical mural was painted on the façade of her Warsaw birthplace . It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the elements that she would discover as an adult : polonium and radium . 
 Also in 2011 , a new Warsaw bridge over the Vistula was named after her .

 " You Don 't Know What to Do " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey included on her fourteenth studio album , Me . I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse ( 2014 ) , and features rapper Wale . The track was released on June 30 , 2014 , as the fourth single from the album . It was written by Wale , Carey , Jermaine Dupri and Bryan @-@ Michael Cox , with production helmed by the latter three . The song contains an interpolation of " I 'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair " written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez , both of whom received songwriting credits as a result . The single 's artwork caused controversy when the media criticised Carey for <unk> and re @-@ using images of herself . 
 A disco revival song , the lyrics are about Carey being dissatisfied by her lover 's failed attempts at romancing her . Despite being serviced to urban and rhythmic radio in the United States , Belgium and South Korea were the only territories where the song charted , peaking at number 14 on its Ultratip chart , which ranks the top songs that have yet to enter the main Ultratop 50 chart , and number 2 on the South Korea download chart . " You Don 't Know What to Do " garnered critical acclaim amongst music critics : many complimented the disco revival and throwback style , calling it the best track on the album , and compared it to the works of Jocelyn Brown , Daft Punk , Chic and post @-@ revivalist songs produced Pharrell Williams . Carey and Wale performed the song for the first and only time on the Today show in the United States .

 " You Don 't Know What to Do " was written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri and Bryan @-@ Michael Cox , with featured artist Wale . The song interpolates a song called " I 'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair " , written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979 . Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result . In August 2012 , Cox revealed that he , Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey 's then untitled fourteenth studio album , later revealed to be Me . I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse , before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010 , and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011 . " She was committed to making it before she got pregnant . Then she got pregnant and she took the time off . Then after she came back , we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off . I just feel like between Jermaine , myself and her , we came up with a few things that [ are ] really , really a solid body of work " . 
 In August 2013 , Wale revealed that he had been in the studio with Carey , posting the message " Mariah x Wale x JD = coming soon " on his Twitter account . Then , on May 16 , 2014 , Carey and Wale premiered their collaboration , revealed to be called " You Don 't Know What to Do " , live during a mini @-@ concert for Today held by Carey . Following the performance , Carey premiered the studio version on May 19 on The Russ Parr Morning Show radio show . A solo version which omits Wale 's rap verses was later released in June 2014 . The song was serviced to urban contemporary radio on June 30 , 2014 and rhythmic contemporary radio on July 1 , 2014 , as the fourth single to be released from the album .

 When Carey released " You Don 't Know What to Do " as the fourth single from the album , fans noticed that it 's accompanying single artwork looked odd . It was later revealed that the single artwork was a cropped version of the album cover for Me . I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse , whereby her head had been swapped for another image in favor of one which was forward @-@ facing , as well as an edited background . Various media outlets criticized Carey for continuing to heavily airbrush and " recycle " images of herself . In response , Carey expressed her discontent on Twitter , stating she had nothing to do with the selection of the single 's artwork and in turn asked for fans to send in their artwork designs as alternatives , ending the message with " ' cause at this point <unk> ! " , an abbreviation of the song 's title . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " You Don 't Know What to Do " is a disco revival song with elements of gospel , pop and R & B styles . It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds . Several critics highlighted the track as following in the recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk , Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material . The song begins with Carey singing about how she is in a dilemma as to whether or not she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover , as he is no longer capable of romancing her . In response , Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance . Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for , and feels liberated for letting him go . Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic 's 1979 single " Good Times " . Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared " You Don 't Know What to Do " to Carey 's previous singles " Fantasy " ( 1995 ) and " Heartbreaker " ( 1999 ) , but noted that it felt like a " logical extension of post @-@ Pharrell disco revivalism " . Christina Lee for Idolator thought that the 70s disco feel embodied Daft Punk 's 2013 single , " Get Lucky " .

 PopMatters writer Devone Jones described the song as " the most energetic track " on the album , and continued to write that the " skillful " lyrics allow Carey to perform " genuine harmonies " which are reminiscent of seventies dance songs . Both Andy Kellman of AllMusic and Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine noted that Carey appeared to be channeling American dance singer Jocelyn Brown , with the former writer that she sounded like Brown more prominently in the intro , while the latter described " You Don 't Know What to Do " as a " stunning " tribute to Brown 's 1984 single " Somebody Else 's Guy " . Henderson continued to write that " You Don 't Know What to Do " , along with another album track called " Meteorite " , are two of Carey 's " most serious @-@ minded performances " on the album , further describing them as " galaxies away " from her 2008 single " I 'll Be Lovin ' U Long Time " . 
 Billboard writer Kenneth Partridge complimented the song for its dance appeal , adding that the only thing missing was a cameo from Nile Rodgers . Melinda Newman of HitFix praised the song 's " playful " sentiment , writing that it was the best song that had been released from Me . I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse so far . Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz complimented the interpolation of " I 'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair " , describing it as " nostalgic " , and further stated that Carey embodies the " bravado " of American singer Jennifer Holliday in the broadway musical Dreamgirls . Digital Spy 's Lewis Corner praised Dupri for producing a piano " disco <unk> " with throwback appeal . Mike Wass of Idolator thought that " You Don 't Know What to Do " would have been worthy of being recorded by American disco singer Donna Summer . 
 Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its composition and noted that the disco and gospel genres are where middle @-@ aged woman can " thrive " , whereby Carey " fits in unsurprisingly well " . He was , however , critical of the decision to include Wale on the song . Similarly , Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song 's production and Carey 's vocals too , but also thought that Wale 's rap verses were not required . Conversely , fashion designer Donatella Versace , a friend of Carey 's , told Vogue that she thought Carey 's singing and Wale 's rapping complimented each other on the song , describing it as " poetry " , and that it made her want to get up and dance " all summer " .

 = Hi @-@ Level = 
 The Hi @-@ Level is a type of bilevel intercity railroad passenger car built by the Budd Company for the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ( " Santa Fe " ) in the 1950s and 1960s . The first two coaches entered service on the El Capitan in 1954 and found immediate success . Budd built sufficient coaches , dining cars , and lounge cars to fully reequip the El Capitan , with additional coaches seeing use on the San Francisco Chief . Amtrak inherited the entire fleet in 1971 and continued to use the equipment on its western routes . In 1979 , the first Superliners , based on the Hi @-@ Level concept , although built by Pullman @-@ Standard , began entering service . As of 2013 Amtrak continues to operate five Hi @-@ Level lounges , which it calls the " Pacific Parlour Cars " , on the Coast Starlight . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Santa Fe introduced the El Capitan in 1938 . The train ran on the Santa Fe 's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles . Unusually for streamliners of the period , the El Capitan carried coaches only , and had no sleeping cars . Passengers flocked to the new train , and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand . The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952 . Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ( " section " ) of the train on the same day . The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase the capacity of the train without lengthening it further . Two popular innovations by the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad ( CB & Q ) suggested a solution . First , in 1945 , the CB & Q introduced the first dome car , in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks , affording better views . Second , in 1950 , it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area . Taken together , these innovations suggested a new possibility : a long @-@ distance bilevel coach , with greater capacity than single @-@ level cars , and the panoramic views of a dome . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Hi @-@ Levels stood 15 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 7 m ) high , 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) taller than most conventional equipment . Seating occupied the entire upper level , with restrooms , baggage , and other non @-@ revenue areas on the lower level . In most cars , vestibules connected the upper levels only . A central staircase linked the two levels . Hi @-@ Levels featured a row of windows across the upper level ; on the prototype coaches , this row slanted inwards . The two @-@ level design offered several advantages over conventional single @-@ level equipment . Budd and the Santa Fe expected the upper level , located 8 feet 7 inches ( 2 @.@ 62 m ) above the rails , to provide a smoother , quieter ride for passengers . With the lower level free of passengers , designers could provide larger restrooms and baggage areas . Finally , the lower level contained all the electrical equipment , away from the passengers , and with easy access for maintenance . The cars cost US $ 275 @,@ 000 apiece . 
 Originally , Budd built the Hi @-@ Levels with steam heating . When Amtrak began converting its inherited fleet to head @-@ end power in 1970s , the Santa Fe handled the conversion of the Hi @-@ Levels in its Topeka , Kansas , shops . Of the 73 Hi @-@ Levels , all but three underwent the conversion . 
 = = = Coaches = = = 
 The 61 coaches could carry either 68 or 72 passengers , half again more than the 44 of comparable single @-@ level long @-@ distance coaches . This increased capacity permitted the Santa Fe to run the El Capitan with fewer cars , while increasing the total number of passengers carried . The 68 @-@ seat coaches featured " step down " stairs at one end to permit access to standard @-@ height equipment ; that space was given over to four additional seats on the 72 @-@ seat coaches . The prototypes also featured step @-@ down stairs , but carried one fewer passenger . In the prototypes the upper level had no restrooms ; in response to passenger feedback , Budd added a restroom to the upper level in the production models . The prototypes also included a " step up " from the aisle to the coach seats ; in the production cars , the seats rested flush with the aisle . Each coach weighed 80 short tons ( 73 t ) . 
 = = = Lounges = = = 
 Each of the six lounges could seat 60 on the upper level , with additional seating on the lower level . Nicknames for these cars included " Top of the Cap " and " Sky Lounges " . A glass top across two @-@ thirds of the car distinguished it from the rest of the Hi @-@ Levels . The lower level featured the " Kachina Coffee Shop " and a lounge area with seating for 26 . The lounge cars weighed 83 short tons ( 75 t ) .

 Six dining cars were built . Each dining car seated 80 ( all on the upper level ) , compared to 36 in a single @-@ level diner .

 = = = Santa Fe = = = 
 The Budd Company delivered the Hi @-@ Levels to the Santa Fe in three batches . The original two prototype coaches ( Nos. 526 – 527 ) entered service on the El Capitan in 1954 . Following a positive customer response , the Santa Fe ordered 47 more cars , sufficient to completely re @-@ equip the El Capitan : 
 10 68 @-@ seat " step down " coaches ( Nos. 528 – 537 ) 
 25 72 @-@ seat coaches ( Nos. 700 – 724 ) 
 6 lounges ( Nos. 575 – 580 ) 
 6 dining cars ( Nos. 650 – 655 ) 
 These constituted five equipment sets ( " consists " ) , sufficient for daily service on the El Capitan beginning on July 8 , 1956 . A typical train comprised two step @-@ down coaches , five standard coaches , a lounge and a dining car . The Hi @-@ Level cars continued in service after the Santa Fe combined the El Capitan and Super Chief in 1958 . The Santa Fe also converted six single @-@ level baggage cars to baggage @-@ dormitories ( <unk> – <unk> ) , with a spoiler at one end to create a visual transition . 
 By the 1960s , the Santa Fe encountered capacity problems on the San Francisco Chief , which ran between Chicago and San Francisco . Unlike the El Capitan , the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches . To augment capacity , the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 1963 – 1964 ; 12 step @-@ down ( 538 – 549 ) and 12 standard ( 725 – 736 ) . Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi @-@ Level coaches , displacing six single @-@ level coaches . 
 = = = Amtrak = = = 
 Amtrak took over operation of most intercity passenger service in the United States in 1971 , including the Santa Fe 's remaining trains . It acquired the entire Hi @-@ Level fleet and continued to operate them . Amtrak used the Hi @-@ Levels as the basis for the design of the Superliners it ordered from Pullman @-@ Standard , which began arriving in 1978 . In the 1980s , Amtrak rebuilt many of the coaches as dormitory @-@ coaches , with half of the car given over to crew space . Several Hi @-@ Level coaches remained in service into the 2000s on the Heartland Flyer . Amtrak refurbished five of the six lounges for use on the Coast Starlight as sleeping car passenger @-@ only lounges , branded as the " Pacific Parlour Car . " As of 2016 , they are the last Hi @-@ Levels in regular service .

He finished the playoffs with a 2 @.@ 15 GAA and .922 save percentage in 22 games . 
 In September 2009 , Vancouver re @-@ signed Luongo to a 12 @-@ year extension . As such , it was widely speculated that Schneider would inevitably be traded . Despite his success in the AHL , his chances of competing for a starting position with the Canucks were seen as unlikely by the media due to Luongo 's prominence on the team . Regardless , he publicly maintained he was unfazed by his position on the Canucks ' depth chart and that he was focused on competing with the newly acquired Andrew Raycroft for the Canucks ' backup position in 2009 – 10 . Schneider was , however , sent back to the Moose out of training camp . 
 Less than a month into the season , Schneider received his second NHL call @-@ up with the Canucks to back up Raycroft after Luongo was sidelined with a rib fracture on October 28 , 2009 . He remained with the Canucks for nearly two weeks , earning one start against the Dallas Stars on November 6 , stopping 45 shots in a 2 – 1 loss . He was returned to the Moose on November 10 . 
 Despite being the reigning goaltender of the year in the AHL and having a comparable season in 2009 – 10 , Schneider was not named to PlanetUSA for the 2010 AHL All @-@ Star Game . The non @-@ selection drew public criticism from Moose head coach Arniel . Amidst a mediocre season as a team , Schneider posted a 2 @.@ 51 GAA and <unk> save percentage and topped his previous team record of wins in a season with 35 in 60 games . During the campaign , he also surpassed Alex Auld on the franchise 's all @-@ time wins and games played list , finishing with 84 and 136 , respectively . Manitoba qualified for the 2010 playoffs with the final and eighth seed in the Western Conference . Matching up against the Hamilton Bulldogs in the opening round , they were eliminated in six games . Schneider recorded a 3 @.@ 12 GAA and <unk> save percentage in the losing effort .

 On June 2 , 2010 , Schneider signed a two @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 8 million contract extension with the Vancouver Canucks . Assistant general manager Lawrence Gilman asserted that the new deal should establish him as Luongo 's backup and garner more exposure to potentially facilitate a trade to another NHL team . He made his first start of the 2010 – 11 season on October 18 , 2010 , against the Carolina Hurricanes . He stopped 32 shots in a 5 – 1 win , marking his first NHL victory since December 14 , 2008 . Later in the season , he recorded his first NHL shutout , stopping 26 shots in a 3 – 0 win against the Anaheim Ducks on March 6 , 2011 . Nearing the end of the regular season , the Canucks were leading the league in team GAA , putting Luongo and Schneider in contention for the William M. Jennings Trophy . However , with a week remaining in the regular season , Schneider was two appearances short of the 25 @-@ game minimum to qualify for the Jennings ( had he not reached the requirement , Luongo would have been awarded the trophy by himself ) . While head coach Alain Vigneault initially dismissed the notion of playing Schneider for the sole purpose of sharing the award with Luongo , he sent Schneider in relief of Luongo with 28 seconds remaining in the third @-@ last game of the season , a 2 – 0 loss to the Edmonton Oilers for Schneider 's 24th appearance . Two games later – the Canucks ' last contest of the regular season – Schneider was given the start against the Calgary Flames . Needing to allow seven goals or fewer to secure the Jennings , he helped Vancouver to a 3 – 2 overtime win . It marked the first time in the trophy 's history that it was awarded to Canucks goaltenders . Luongo and Schneider 's combined GAA of 2 @.@ 20 was 0 @.@ 10 better than the Boston Bruins 's second @-@ place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask . Schneider completed his NHL rookie season with a 2 @.@ 23 GAA and .929 save percentage in 25 games ( 22 starts ) , as well as a 16 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 record . His GAA tied for fourth in the league , while his save percentage ranked third and set a single @-@ season Canucks record . 
 Schneider made his NHL playoff debut in Game 4 of the opening round against the Chicago Blackhawks . With the Canucks down 6 – 1 , Luongo was pulled in favour of Schneider in the third period . Schneider allowed one goal on seven shots , as the Blackhawks went on to win the game 7 – 2 . After Luongo was pulled again in Game 5 , Schneider was chosen to start for Game 6 . Schneider allowed three goals on 20 shots ; he left the game in the third period after suffering cramps during a failed attempt to stop a penalty shot from Michael <unk> . The Canucks went on to lose the contest 4 – 3 in overtime , but won the following Game 7 with Luongo in net to advance to the second round . The Canucks would advance to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins . Schneider made an appearance in Game 6 , replacing Luongo in the first period after he gave up three goals . Schneider allowed two goals in relief for the remainder of the game as the Canucks went on to lose the contest . With Schneider on the bench , Vancouver then lost Game 7 at home . 
 Remaining as Luongo 's backup for the start of the 2011 – 12 season , Schneider 's playing time was expanded when Luongo suffered an injury in mid @-@ November 2011 . Despite Luongo 's return to the lineup after missing two games , Schneider continued to earn starts due to his performance . On November 28 , he was named the NHL 's Second Star of the Week after recording three wins in as many contests , a span that included back @-@ to @-@ back shutouts ( on November 23 against the Colorado Avalanche and November 25 against the Phoenix Coyotes ) . Schneider finished his second full NHL season with improved numbers . Of the 33 games he played , he started 28 and compiled 20 wins and 9 losses . His 1 @.@ 96 GAA and .937 save percentage over 33 games ranked third and second in the league , respectively , while also setting Canucks team records . His GAA topped the 2 @.@ 11 mark Luongo had set in 2010 – 11 , while his save percentage bettered the .929 he had achieved , also in the previous season . The latter team record also ranked as the fourth @-@ best ever recorded in the NHL . 
 During the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs , Schneider supplanted Luongo as the team 's playoff goalie . After Vancouver lost their first two games against the eighth @-@ seeded Los Angeles Kings in the opening round , Vigneault started Schneider . Despite losing game three , Schneider started for the remainder of the series , which Los Angeles won four @-@ games @-@ to @-@ one . In three games , he recorded a 1 @.@ 31 GAA and .960 save percentage . Vigneault 's decision led many in the media to believe that Schneider would retain the role the following season , while Luongo would be traded . Although Luongo 's contract included a no @-@ trade clause , he told reporters following the Canucks ' defeat to the Kings that he would waive it if the team asked him to . During the off season , Schneider and the Canucks agreed to a three @-@ year contract worth $ 12 million . 
 During the 2012 – 13 NHL lockout , Schneider played with Swiss team HC <unk> @-@ <unk> of National League A. He played in eight games and recorded a .914 save percentage . Returning to Vancouver as NHL play resumed , Schneider appeared in 30 games for the Canucks and posted a 17 – 9 – 4 record and was one of five goaltenders to tie for the league lead with five shutouts . He appeared in two playoff games , both losses , as the Canucks were swept out of the first round by the San Jose Sharks .

 The Canucks spent a full year attempting to trade Luongo and his contract before conceding that no team was willing to meet their demands . Instead they agreed to trade Schneider to the New Jersey Devils . The deal , completed on June 30 at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft , saw the ninth overall selection ( Bo Horvat ) sent to Vancouver . Schneider described the trade as " shocking " , adding that after several seasons of expecting to be traded , he had finally begun to believe he would stay in Vancouver . He played his first game against the Pittsburgh Penguins , a 3 @-@ 0 loss . 
 Schneider had spent his first season with the Devils as a backup to veteran Martin Brodeur , earning a few extra starts due to the 42 @-@ year old Brodeur 's poor performance , but after Brodeur 's departure from New Jersey , Schneider became the Devils starting goaltender . 
 On July 9 , 2014 , Schneider signed a seven @-@ year , $ 42 million contract extension with the Devils . 
 In 2014 – 15 , Schneider posted a .925 save percentage ( the sixth best in the league ) and a 2 @.@ 26 GAA . Despite Schneider 's success , the Devils missed the playoffs for the third consecutive season , finishing 32 @-@ 36 @-@ 14 . 
 Schneider continued to put up reasonable numbers for the Devils in the 2015 – 16 season , including a 2 @.@ 15 GAA and a .924 save percentage . The Devils missed the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season . 
 = = International play = = 
 Schneider competed for the United States at the 2003 U @-@ 18 Junior World Cup , held in <unk> , Czech Republic and Piešťany , Slovakia . He helped the club go undefeated in five games , en route to the country 's first gold medal in the history of the tournament . Sharing goaltending duties with Ian <unk> over the course of the tournament , Schneider was given the start for the gold medal game against Russia , turning aside 32 shots for the 3 – 2 win . 
 Schneider next appeared for the United States at the 2004 IIHF World U18 Championships in Minsk , Belarus . He recorded the third @-@ best GAA ( 1 @.@ 71 ) and second @-@ best save percentage ( .929 ) of the tournament en route to a silver medal . The United States were defeated in the gold medal game by Russia 3 – 2 . He was later named the David Peterson Goalie of the Year by USA Hockey , having led them to two medals in the 2003 – 04 season . 
 In August 2004 , Schneider participated in the U.S. National Junior Team Evaluation Camp in Grand Forks , North Dakota . Several months later , he debuted at the under @-@ 20 level at the 2005 World Junior Championships , hosted by the United States in Grand Forks and Thief River Falls , Minnesota . Playing backup to Al Montoya , he was given the start for a preliminary game against Belarus . After just over a period of play , he was pulled for allowing three goals on eight shots . The United States lost the game 5 – 3 in Schneider 's only tournament appearance . After losing to Russia 7 – 2 in the semifinal , the United States lost the bronze medal game 3 – 2 to the Czech Republic in overtime . 
 After attending the U.S. ' s summer evaluation camp for a second straight year in Lake Placid , New York , Schneider was given the starting position for the 2006 World Junior Championships in British Columbia , Canada . He was named the United States ' player of the game in their third match of the preliminary round , a 2 – 2 tie against Switzerland ; Schneider made 22 saves . He earned his second player of the game selection in the quarterfinal , stopping 30 shots in a 2 – 1 win against the Czech Republic . The United States were then eliminated in the semifinal by Russia before losing the bronze medal game to Finland . He appeared in six games total with a 2 @.@ 67 GAA and <unk> save percentage , fifth among tournament goaltenders . 
 Schneider 's first experience with the men 's senior team came in 2007 when he was among the first eighteen players named to the United States ' team for the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Russia . Despite being named to the team , Schneider did not play in any games , instead serving as the team 's third goaltender behind John Grahame and Jason <unk> . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Schneider plays in the butterfly style of goaltending , dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net . He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian <unk> , beginning at the age of 15 . After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010 – 11 , Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson , who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease . Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots , but better prepared him for rebounds and cross @-@ crease plays . Schneider 's strengths are his size and athleticism . His coach with the Moose , Scott Arniel , has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time , anticipating plays .

 = British people = 
 British people , or Britons , are the citizens of the United Kingdom , British Overseas Territories , and Crown dependencies , and their descendants . British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality , which can be acquired , for instance , by descent from British nationals . When used in a historical context , " British " or " Britons " can refer to the ancient Britons , the indigenous Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain , south of the River Forth . 
 Although early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages , the creation of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity . The notion of Britishness was forged during the Napoleonic Wars between Britain and the First French Empire , and developed further during the Victorian era . The complex history of the formation of the United Kingdom created a " particular sense of nationhood and belonging " in Great Britain and Ireland ; Britishness became " superimposed on much older identities " , of English , Scots , Welsh and Irish cultures , whose distinctiveness still resists notions of a <unk> British identity . Because of longstanding ethno @-@ sectarian divisions , British identity in Northern Ireland is controversial , but it is held with strong conviction by unionists . 
 Modern Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic groups that settled in the British Isles in and before the 11th century : Prehistoric , Celtic , Roman , Anglo @-@ Saxon , Norse and Normans . Union facilitated migration , cultural and linguistic exchange , and intermarriage between the peoples of England , Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages , Early Modern period and beyond . Since 1922 and earlier , there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from what is now the Republic of Ireland , the Commonwealth , mainland Europe and elsewhere ; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens , with some assuming a British , dual or hyphenated identity . 
 The British are a diverse , multi @-@ national and multicultural society , with " strong regional accents , expressions and identities " . The social structure of the United Kingdom has changed radically since the 19th century , with a decline in religious observance , enlargement of the middle class , and increased ethnic diversity . The population of the UK stands at around 62 @.@ 5 million , with a British diaspora of around 140 million concentrated in Australia , Canada , South Africa , Hong Kong , New Zealand , and the United States . 
 = = History of the term = = 
 Greek and Roman writers , in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD , name the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland as the <unk> , the origin of the Latin word Britannic . Parthenius , a 1st @-@ century Ancient Greek grammarian , and the <unk> <unk> , a 9th @-@ century lexical encyclopaedia , describe <unk> ( the Latinised form of the Ancient Greek <unk> ) as the Celtic national forefather of the Britons . It has been suggested that this name derives from a Gaulish description translated as " people of the forms " , referring to the custom of tattooing or painting their bodies with blue woad . 
 By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of <unk> as a collective name for the British Isles . However , with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia was used for the island of Great Britain , and later Roman @-@ occupied Britain south of Caledonia . Following the Roman departure from Britain , the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by pagan , seafaring warriors such as Saxons and Jutes , who gained control in areas around the south east . 
 In this post @-@ Roman period , as the Anglo @-@ Saxons advanced , the Britons became confined to what would later be called Wales , Cornwall , North West England and Strathclyde . However , the term Britannia persisted as the Latin name for the island . The Historia Brittonum claimed legendary origins as a prestigious genealogy for Brittonic kings , followed by the Historia Regum Britanniae which popularised this pseudo @-@ history to support the claims of the Kings of England . 
 During the Middle Ages , and particularly in the Tudor period , the term " British " was used to refer to the Welsh people . At that time , it was " the long held belief that the Welsh were descendants of the ancient Britons and that they spoke ' the British tongue ' " . This notion was supported by texts such as the Historia Regum Britanniae , a pseudohistorical account of ancient British history , written in the mid @-@ 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth . The Historia Regum Britanniae chronicled the lives of legendary kings of the Britons in a narrative spanning 2000 years , beginning with the Trojans founding the ancient British nation and continuing until the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion of Britain in the 7th century forced the Celtic Britons to the west , i.e. Wales and Cornwall . This legendary Celtic history of Great Britain is known as the Matter of Britain . The Matter of Britain , a national myth , was retold or reinterpreted in works by Gerald of Wales , a Cambro @-@ Norman chronicler who in the 12th and 13th centuries used the term British to refer to the people later known as the Welsh .

 The indigenous people of the British Isles have a combination of Celtic , Norse , Anglo @-@ Saxon and Norman ancestry . Modern studies using DNA analysis , popularised by the geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer and others , increasingly suggest that three @-@ quarters of Britons share a common ancestry with the hunter @-@ gatherers who settled in Atlantic Europe during the Paleolithic era , " after the melting of the ice caps but before the land broke away from the mainland and divided into islands " . 
 Despite the separation of the British Isles from continental Europe following the last glacial period , the genetic record indicates that the British and Irish broadly share their closest common ancestry with the Basque people , who live in the Basque Country near the Pyrenees . Oppenheimer continues that the majority of the people of the British Isles share genetic commonalities with the Basques , ranging from highs of 90 % in Wales to lows of 66 % in East Anglia . 
 The genetic difference between western Britain and the East of England is thought to originate from two divergent prehistoric routes of immigration – one up the Atlantic coast , the other from continental Europe . Major immigrant settlement of the British Isles occurred during the Neolithic period , interpreted by Bryan Sykes — professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford — as the arrival of the Celts from the Iberian Peninsula , and the origin of Britain 's and Ireland 's Celtic tribes . 
 Oppenheimer 's opinion is that " .. by far the majority of male gene types in the British Isles derive from Iberia ( modern Spain and Portugal ) , ranging from a low of 59 % in <unk> , Norfolk to highs of 96 % in Llangefni , north Wales " . The National Museum Wales states that " it is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject " but " early studies have , so far , tended to produce implausible conclusions from very small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and archaeology . " 
 Between the 8th and 11th centuries , " three major cultural divisions " had emerged in Great Britain : the English , the Scots and the Welsh . The English had been unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh . Before then , the English ( known then in Old English as the <unk> ) were under the governance of independent Anglo @-@ Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states , the most powerful of which were Mercia and Wessex . Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver said that the Battle of Brunanburh would " define the shape of Britain into the modern era " , it was a " showdown for two very different ethnic identities – a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon . It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms , a split in perceptions which is still very much with us today " . However , historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely " responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood " in the 13th century . Scottish national identity , " a complex amalgam " of Gael , Pict , Norsemen and Anglo @-@ Norman , was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . 
 Though Wales was conquered by England , and its legal system replaced by that of the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 – 1542 , the Welsh endured as a nation distinct from the English . Later , with both an English Reformation and a Scottish Reformation , Edward VI of England , under the counsel of Edward Seymour , 1st Duke of Somerset , advocated a union with the Kingdom of Scotland , joining England , Wales , and Scotland in a united Protestant Great Britain . The Duke of Somerset supported the unification of the English , Welsh and Scots under the " indifferent old name of Britons " on the basis that their monarchies " both derived from a Pre @-@ Roman British monarchy " . 
 Following the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603 , the throne of England was inherited by James VI , King of Scots , so that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI of Scotland and I of England , an event referred to as the Union of the Crowns . King James advocated full political union between England and Scotland , and on 20 October 1604 proclaimed his assumption of the style " King of Great Britain " , though this title was rejected by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland , and so had no basis in either English law or Scots law . 
 = = = Union and the development of Britishness = = = 
 Despite centuries of military and religious conflict , the Kingdoms of England and Scotland had been " drawing increasingly together " since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century and the Union of the Crowns in 1603 . A broadly shared language , island , monarch , religion and Bible ( the Authorized King James Version ) further contributed to a growing cultural alliance between the two sovereign realms and their peoples . The Glorious Revolution of 1688 resulted in a pair of Acts of the English and Scottish legislatures — the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 respectively — which ensured that the shared constitutional monarchy of England and Scotland was held only by Protestants . Despite this , although popular with the monarchy and much of the aristocracy , attempts to unite the two states by Acts of Parliament in 1606 , 1667 , and 1689 were unsuccessful ; increased political management of Scottish affairs from England had led to " criticism " , and strained Anglo @-@ Scottish relations . 
 While English maritime explorations during the Age of Discovery gave new @-@ found imperial power and wealth to the English and Welsh at the end of the 17th century , Scotland suffered from a long @-@ standing weak economy . In response , the Scottish kingdom , in opposition to William II of Scotland ( III of England ) , commenced the Darien Scheme , an attempt to establish a Scottish imperial outlet — the colony of New Caledonia — on the isthmus of Panama . However , through a combination of disease , Spanish hostility , Scottish mismanagement and opposition to the scheme by the East India Company and the English government ( who did not want to provoke the Spanish into war ) this imperial venture ended in " catastrophic failure " with an estimated " 25 % of Scotland 's total liquid capital " lost . 
 The events of the Darien Scheme , and the passing by the English Parliament of the Act of Settlement 1701 asserting the right to choose the order of succession for English , Scottish and Irish thrones , escalated political hostilities between England and Scotland , and neutralised calls for a united British people . The Parliament of Scotland responded by passing the Act of Security 1704 , allowing it to appoint a different monarch to succeed to the Scottish crown from that of England , if it so wished . The English political perspective was that the appointment of a Jacobite monarchy in Scotland opened up the possibility of a Franco @-@ Scottish military conquest of England during the Second Hundred Years ' War and War of the Spanish Succession . The Parliament of England passed the Alien Act 1705 , which provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property , whilst also restricting the import of Scottish products into England and its colonies ( about half of Scotland 's trade ) . However , the Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Parliament of Scotland entered into negotiations regarding the creation of a unified Parliament of Great Britain , which in turn would refund Scottish financial losses on the Darien Scheme . 
 = = = Union of Scotland and England = = = 
 Despite opposition from much of the Scottish and English populations , a Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706 and was then ratified by the parliaments of both countries with the passing of the Acts of Union 1707 . With effect from 1 May 1707 , this created a new sovereign state called the " Kingdom of Great Britain " . This kingdom " began as a hostile merger " , but led to a " full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world " ; historian Simon Schama stated that " it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history " . 
 After 1707 , a British national identity began to develop , though it was initially resisted , particularly by the English . The peoples of Great Britain had by the 1750s begun to assume a " layered identity " : to think of themselves as simultaneously British and also Scottish , English , or Welsh . 
 The terms North Briton and South Briton were devised for the Scots and the English respectively , with the former gaining some preference in Scotland , particularly by the economists and philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment . Indeed , it was the " Scots [ who ] played key roles in shaping the contours of British identity " ; " their scepticism about the Union allowed the Scots the space and time in which to dominate the construction of Britishness in its early crucial years " , drawing upon the notion of a shared " spirit of liberty common to both Saxon and Celt ... against the usurpation of the Church of Rome " . James Thomson was a poet and playwright born to a Church of Scotland minister in the Scottish Lowlands in 1700 who was interested in forging a common British culture and national identity in this way . In collaboration with Thomas Arne , they wrote Alfred , an opera about Alfred the Great 's victory against the Vikings performed to Frederick , Prince of Wales in 1740 to commemorate the accession of George I and the birthday of Princess Augusta . " Rule , Britannia ! " was the climactic piece of the opera and quickly became a " jingoistic " British patriotic song celebrating " Britain 's supremacy offshore " . An island country with a series of victories for the Royal Navy associated empire and naval warfare " inextricably with ideals of Britishness and Britain 's place in the world " . 
 Britannia , the new national personification of Great Britain , was established in the 1750s as a representation of " nation and empire rather than any single national hero " . On Britannia and British identity , historian Peter <unk> wrote : 
 Up until 1797 Britannia was conventionally depicted holding a spear , but as a consequence of the increasingly prominent role of the Royal Navy in the war against the French , and of several spectacular victories , the spear was replaced by a trident ... The navy had come to be seen ... as the very bulwark of British liberty and the essence of what it was to be British . 
 From the Union of 1707 through to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 , Great Britain was " involved in successive , very dangerous wars with Catholic France " , but which " all brought enough military and naval victories ... to flatter British pride " . As the Napoleonic Wars with the First French Empire advanced , " the English and Scottish learned to define themselves as similar primarily by virtue of not being French or Catholic " . In combination with sea power and empire , the notion of Britishness became more " closely bound up with Protestantism " , a cultural commonality through which the English , Scots and Welsh became " fused together , and remain [ ed ] so , despite their many cultural divergences " . 
 The neo @-@ classical monuments that proliferated at the end of the 18th century and the start of the 19th , such as The <unk> at Monmouth , were attempts to meld the concepts of Britishness with the Greco @-@ Roman empires of classical antiquity . The new and expanding British Empire provided " unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth " , and so the " Scottish , Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds " . The British Empire was " crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self @-@ image of Britishness " . Indeed , the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century " for it offered a context within which they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in , and benefiting from , the expansion of the [ British ] Empire " . Similarly , the " new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons – a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh " . For the English , however , by the Victorian era their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness had meant that , for them , Britishness " meant the same as ' Englishness ' " , so much so that " Englishness and Britishness " and " ' England ' and ' Britain ' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts " . Britishness came to borrow heavily from English political history because England had " always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size , population and power " ; Magna Carta , common law and hostility to continental Europe were English factors that influenced British sensibilities . 
 = = = Union with Ireland = = = 
 The political union of the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain in 1800 , coupled with the outbreak of peace with France in the early 19th century , challenged the previous century 's concept of militant Protestant Britishness . The new , expanded United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland meant that the state had to re @-@ evaluate its position on the civil rights of Catholics , and extend its definition of Britishness to the Irish people . Like the terms that had been invented at the time of the Acts of Union 1707 , " West Briton " was introduced for the Irish after 1800 . In 1832 Daniel O 'Connell , an Irish politician who campaigned for Catholic Emancipation , stated in Britain 's House of Commons : 
 The people of Ireland are ready to become a portion of the British Empire , provided they be made so in reality and not in name alone ; they are ready to become a kind of West Briton if made so in benefits and justice ; but if not , we are Irishmen again . 
 Ireland , from 1801 to 1923 , was marked by a succession of economic and political mismanagement and neglect , which marginalised the Irish , and advanced Irish nationalism . In the forty years that followed the Union , successive British governments grappled with the problems of governing a country which had , as Benjamin Disraeli put it in 1844 , " a starving population , an absentee aristocracy , and an alien Church , and in addition the weakest executive in the world " . Although the vast majority of Unionists in Ireland proclaimed themselves " simultaneously Irish and British " , even for them there was a strain upon the adoption of Britishness after the Great Famine . 
 War continued to be a unifying factor for the people of Great Britain : British jingoism re @-@ emerged during the Boer Wars in southern Africa . The experience of military , political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire led to a very specific drive in artistic technique , taste and sensibility for Britishness . In 1887 , Frederic Harrison wrote : 
 Morally , we Britons plant the British flag on every peak and pass ; and wherever the Union Jack floats there we place the cardinal British institutions — tea , tubs , sanitary appliances , lawn tennis , and churches . 
 The Catholic Relief Act 1829 reflected a " marked change in attitudes " in Great Britain towards Catholics and Catholicism . A " significant " example of this was the collaboration between Augustus Welby Pugin , an " ardent Roman Catholic " and son of a Frenchman , and Sir Charles Barry , " a confirmed Protestant " , in redesigning the Palace of Westminster — " the building that most enshrines ... Britain 's national and imperial pre @-@ tensions " . Protestantism gave way to imperialism as the leading element of British national identity during the Victorian and Edwardian eras , and as such , a series of royal , imperial and national celebrations were introduced to the British people to assert imperial British culture and give themselves a sense of uniqueness , superiority and national consciousness . Empire Day and jubilees of Queen Victoria were introduced to the British middle class , but quickly " merged into a national ' tradition ' " . 
 = = = Modern period = = = 
 The First World War " reinforced the sense of Britishness " and patriotism in the early 20th century . Through war service ( including conscription in Great Britain ) , " the English , Welsh , Scots and Irish fought as British " . The aftermath of the war institutionalised British national commemoration through Remembrance Sunday and the Poppy Appeal . The Second World War had a similar unifying effect upon the British people , however , its outcome was to recondition Britishness on a basis of democratic values and its marked contrast to Europeanism . Notions that the British " constituted an Island race , and that it stood for democracy were reinforced during the war and they were circulated in the country through Winston Churchill 's speeches , history books and newspapers " . 
 At its international zenith , " Britishness joined peoples around the world in shared traditions and common loyalties that were strenuously maintained " . But following the two world wars , the British Empire experienced rapid decolonisation . The secession of the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom meant that Britishness had lost " its Irish dimension " in 1922 , and the shrinking empire supplanted by independence movements dwindled the appeal of British identity in the Commonwealth of Nations during the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 Since the British Nationality Act 1948 and the subsequent mass immigration to the United Kingdom from the Commonwealth and elsewhere in the world , " the expression and experience of cultural life in Britain has become fragmented and reshaped by the influences of gender , ethnicity , class and region " . Furthermore , the United Kingdom 's membership of the European Economic Community in 1973 eroded the concept of Britishness as distinct from continental Europe . As such , since the 1970s " there has been a sense of crisis about what it has meant to be British " , exacerbated by growing demands for greater political autonomy for Northern Ireland , Scotland , and Wales . 
 The late 20th century saw major changes to the politics of the United Kingdom with the establishment of devolved national administrations for Northern Ireland , Scotland , and Wales following pre @-@ legislative referendums . Calls for greater autonomy for the four countries of the United Kingdom had existed since their original union with each other , but gathered pace in the 1960s and 1970s . Devolution has led to " increasingly assertive Scottish , Welsh and Irish national identities " , resulting in more diverse cultural expressions of Britishness , or else its outright rejection : Gwynfor Evans , a Welsh nationalist politician active in the late 20th century , rebuffed Britishness as " a political synonym for Englishness which extends English culture over the Scots , Welsh and the Irish " . 
 In 2004 Sir Bernard Crick , political theorist and democratic socialist tasked with developing the life in the United Kingdom test said : 
 Britishness , to me , is an overarching political and legal concept : it signifies allegiance to the laws , government and broad moral and political concepts — like tolerance and freedom of expression — that hold the United Kingdom together . 
 Gordon Brown , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , initiated a debate on British identity in 2006 . Brown 's speech to the Fabian Society 's Britishness Conference proposed that British values demand a new constitutional settlement and symbols to represent a modern patriotism , including a new youth community service scheme and a British Day to celebrate . One of the central issues identified at the Fabian Society conference was how the English identity fits within the framework of a devolved United Kingdom . An expression of Her Majesty 's Government 's initiative to promote Britishness was the inaugural Veterans ' Day which was first held on 27 June 2006 . As well as celebrating the achievements of armed forces veterans , Brown 's speech at the first event for the celebration said : 
 Scots and people from the rest of the UK share the purpose — that Britain has something to say to the rest of the world about the values of freedom , democracy and the dignity of the people that you stand up for . So at a time when people can talk about football and devolution and money , it is important that we also remember the values that we share in common .

 Britons - people with British citizenship or of British descent - have a significant presence in a number of countries other than the United Kingdom , and in particular in those with historic connections to the British Empire . After the Age of Discovery the British were one of the earliest and largest communities to emigrate out of Europe , and the British Empire 's expansion during the first half of the 19th century triggered an " extraordinary dispersion of the British people " , resulting in particular concentrations " in Australasia and North America " . 
 The British Empire was " built on waves of migration overseas by British people " , who left the United Kingdom and " reached across the globe and permanently affected population structures in three continents " . As a result of the British colonisation of the Americas , what became the United States was " easily the greatest single destination of emigrant British " , but in Australia the British experienced a birth rate higher than " anything seen before " resulting in the displacement of indigenous Australians . 
 In colonies such as Southern Rhodesia , British East Africa and Cape Colony , permanently resident British communities were established and whilst never more than a numerical minority these Britons " exercised a dominant influence " upon the culture and politics of those lands . In Australia , Canada and New Zealand " people of British origin came to constitute the majority of the population " contributing to these states becoming integral to the Anglosphere . 
 The United Kingdom Census 1861 estimated the size of the overseas British to be around 2 @.@ 5 million , but concluded that most of these were " not conventional settlers " but rather " travellers , merchants , professionals , and military personnel " . By 1890 , there were over 1 @.@ 5 million further UK @-@ born people living in Australia , Canada , New Zealand and South Africa . A 2006 publication from the Institute for Public Policy Research estimated 5 @.@ 6 million Britons lived outside of the United Kingdom . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 From the beginning of Australia 's colonial period until after the Second World War , people from the United Kingdom made up a large majority of people coming to Australia , meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain . The colony of New South Wales , founded on 26 January 1788 , was part of the eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770 , and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation . Together with another five largely self @-@ governing Crown Colonies , the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901 . 
 Its history of British dominance meant that Australia was " grounded in British culture and political traditions that had been transported to the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century and become part of colonial culture and politics " . Australia maintains the Westminster system of Parliamentary Government and Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia . Until 1987 , the national status of Australian citizens was formally described as " British Subject : Citizen of Australia " . Britons continue to make up a substantial proportion of immigrants . 
 = = = British overseas territories = = = 
 The people of the British overseas territories are British by citizenship , via origins or naturalisation . Along with aspects of common British identity , each of them has their own distinct identity shaped in the respective particular circumstances of political , economic , ethnic , social and cultural history . For instance , in the case of the Falkland Islanders , Lewis Clifton the Speaker of the Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands , explains : 
 British cultural , economic , social , political and educational values create a unique British @-@ like , Falkland Islands . Yet Islanders feel distinctly different from their fellow citizens who reside in the United Kingdom . This might have something to do with geographical isolation or with living on a smaller island — perhaps akin to those Britons not feeling European . 
 In contrast , for the majority of the Gibraltarians , who live in Gibraltar , there is an " insistence on their Britishness " which " carries excessive loyalty " to Britain . The sovereignty of Gibraltar has been a point of contention in Spain – United Kingdom relations , but an overwhelming number of Gibraltarians embrace Britishness with strong conviction , in direct opposition to Spanish territorial claims . 
 = = = Canada = = = 
 Canada traces its statehood to the French , English and Scottish expeditions of North America from the late @-@ 15th century . France ceded nearly all of New France in 1763 after the Seven Years ' War , and so after the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 , Quebec and Nova Scotia formed " the nucleus of the colonies that constituted Britain 's remaining stake on the North American continent " . British North America attracted the United Empire Loyalists , Britons who migrated out of what they considered the " rebellious " United States , increasing the size of British communities in what was to become Canada . 
 In 1867 there was a union of three colonies with British North America which together formed the Canadian Confederation , a federal dominion . This began an accretion of additional provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom , highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminating in the Canada Act 1982 , which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the parliament of the United Kingdom . Nevertheless , it is recognised that there is a " continuing importance of Canada 's long and close relationship with Britain " ; large parts of Canada 's modern population claim " British origins " and the cultural impact of the British upon Canada 's institutions is profound . 
 It was not until 1977 that the phrase " A Canadian citizen is a British subject " ceased to be used in Canadian passports . The politics of Canada are strongly influenced by British political culture . Although significant modifications have been made , Canada is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system , and retains Elizabeth II as The Queen of Canada and Head of State . English is an official language used in Canada . 
 = = = Chile = = = 
 Chile , facing the Pacific Ocean , has a large British presence . Over 50 @,@ 000 British immigrants settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914 . A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province , especially in the city of Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan . Around 32 @,@ 000 English settled in Valparaíso , influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century . However , the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe . 
 In Valparaíso , they created their largest and most important colony , bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character , schools , social clubs , sports clubs , business organisations and periodicals . Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas , such as the banks and the navy , as well as in certain social activities , such as football , horse racing , and the custom of drinking tea . 
 During the movement for independence ( 1818 ) , it was mainly the British who formed the Chilean Navy , under the command of Lord Cochrane . 
 British investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific . Chile won two wars , the first against the Peru @-@ Bolivian Confederation and the second , the War of the Pacific , in 1878 – 79 , against an alliance between Peru and Bolivia . The liberal @-@ socialist " Revolution of 1891 " introduced political reforms modelled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking . 
 British immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the saltpetre boom , in the ports of Iquique and Pisagua . The " King of Saltpetre " , John Thomas North , was the principal tycoon of nitrate mining . The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique , with the foundation of various institutions , such as the Club <unk> ( Racing Club ) . Nevertheless , the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s . 
 Some Scots settled in the country 's more temperate regions , where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland ( the Highlands and Northern Scotland ) while English and Welsh made up the rest . The Irish immigrants , who were frequently confused with the British , arrived as merchants , tradesmen and sailors , settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports . 
 An important contingent of British ( principally Welsh ) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950 , settling in the present @-@ day region of Magallanes . British families were established in other areas of the country , such as Santiago , Coquimbo , the Araucanía , and Chiloé . 
 The cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community into society at large . Customs taken from the British include afternoon tea ( called <unk> by Chileans ) , football , rugby union and horse racing . Another legacy is the widespread use of British personal names by Chileans . 
 Chile has the largest population of descendants of British settlers in Latin America . Over 700 @,@ 000 Chileans may have British ( English , Scottish and Welsh ) origin , amounting to 4 @.@ 5 % of Chile 's population . 
 = = = New Zealand = = = 
 A long @-@ term result of James Cook 's voyage of 1768 – 71 , a significant number of New Zealanders are of British descent , for whom a sense of Britishness has contributed to their identity . As late as the 1950s , it was common for British New Zealanders to refer to themselves as British , such as when Prime Minister Keith Holyoake described Sir Edmund Hillary 's successful ascent of Mount Everest as putting " the British race and New Zealand on top of the world " . New Zealand passports described nationals as " British Subject : Citizen of New Zealand " until 1974 , when this was changed to " New Zealand citizen " . 
 In an interview with the New Zealand Listener in 2006 , Don Brash , the then Leader of the Opposition , said : 
 British immigrants fit in here very well . My own ancestry is all British . New Zealand values are British values , derived from centuries of struggle since Magna Carta . Those things make New Zealand the society it is . 
 The politics of New Zealand are strongly influenced by British political culture . Although significant modifications have been made , New Zealand is governed by a democratic parliamentary framework comparable to the Westminster system , and retains Elizabeth II as the head of the monarchy of New Zealand . English is the dominant official language used in New Zealand . 
 = = = Hong Kong = = = 
 British nationality law as it pertains to Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842 . From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people , the territory has attracted refugees , immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life . Citizenship matters were complicated by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in Hong Kong as British subjects ( although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship ) , while the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such . The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as " unequal " , including the ones which ceded Hong Kong Island , the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories to Britain . The British government , however , recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong , granted 3 @.@ 4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as British National ( Overseas ) , which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985 . Among those 3 @.@ 4 million people , there are many British Nationals ( Overseas ) who are eligible for full British citizenship . Both British Nationals ( Overseas ) and British citizens are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens according to the British Nationality Law , which enables them to various rights in the United Kingdom and the European Union . 
 = = = South Africa = = = 
 The British arrived in the area which would become the modern @-@ day South Africa during the early 18th century , yet substantial settlement only started end of the 18th century , in the Cape of Good Hope ; the British first explored the area for conquests for or related to the Slave Trade . In the late 19th century , the discovery of gold and diamonds further encouraged colonisation of South Africa by the British , and the population of the British @-@ South Africans rose substantially , although there was fierce rivalry between the British and Afrikaners ( descendants of Dutch colonists ) in the period known as the Boer Wars . When apartheid first started most British @-@ South Africans were mostly keen on keeping and even strengthening its ties with the United Kingdom . The latest census in South Africa showed that there are almost 2 million British @-@ South Africans ; they make up about 40 % of the total White South African demographic , and the greatest white British ancestry populations in South Africa are in the KwaZulu @-@ Natal province and in cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town . 
 = = = Ireland = = = 
 Plantations of Ireland introduced large numbers of people from Great Britain to Ireland throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period . The resulting Protestant Ascendancy , the aristocratic class of the Lordship of Ireland , broadly identified themselves as Anglo @-@ Irish . In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , Protestant British settlers subjugated Catholic , Gaelic inhabitants in the north of Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster and the Williamite War in Ireland ; it was " an explicit attempt to control Ireland strategically by introducing ethnic and religious elements loyal to the British interest in Ireland " . 
 The Ulster Scots people are an ethnic group of British origin in Ireland , broadly descended from Lowland Scots who settled in large numbers in the Province of Ulster during the planned process of colonisations of Ireland which took place in the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England . Together with English and Welsh settlers , these Scots introduced Protestantism ( particularly the Presbyterianism of the Church of Scotland ) and the Ulster Scots and English languages to , mainly , northeastern Ireland . With the partition of Ireland and independence for what is now the Republic of Ireland some of these people found themselves no longer living within the United Kingdom . 
 Northern Ireland itself was , for many years , the site of a violent and bitter ethno @-@ sectarian conflict — The Troubles — between those claiming to represent Irish nationalism , who are predominantly Roman Catholic , and those claiming to represent British unionism , who are predominantly Protestant . Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom , while nationalists desire a united Ireland . 
 Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , most of the paramilitary groups involved in the Troubles have ceased their armed campaigns , and constitutionally , the people of Northern Ireland have been recognised as " all persons born in Northern Ireland and having , at the time of their birth , at least one parent who is a British citizen , an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence " . The Good Friday Agreement guarantees the " recognition of the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British , or both , as they may so choose " . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 An English presence in North America began with the Roanoke Colony and Colony of Virginia in the late @-@ 16th century , but the first successful English settlement was established in 1607 , on the James River at Jamestown . By the 1610s an estimated 1 @,@ 300 English people had travelled to North America , the " first of many millions from the British Isles " . In 1620 the Pilgrims established the English imperial venture of Plymouth Colony , beginning " a remarkable acceleration of permanent emigration from England " with over 60 % of trans @-@ Atlantic English migrants settling in the New England Colonies . During the 17th century an estimated 350 @,@ 000 English and Welsh migrants arrived in North America , which in the century after the Acts of Union 1707 was surpassed in rate and number by Scottish and Irish migrants . 
 The British policy of salutary neglect for its North American colonies intended to minimise trade restrictions as a way of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests . This permitted the development of the American Dream , a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders . The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation ; they proclaimed their independence in 1776 , and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America , which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation . The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain 's formal acknowledgement of the United States ' sovereignty at the end of the American Revolutionary War . 
 Nevertheless , longstanding cultural and historical ties have , in more modern times , resulted in the Special Relationship , the historically close political , diplomatic , and military co @-@ operation between the United Kingdom and United States . Linda Colley , a professor of history at Princeton University and specialist in Britishness , suggested that because of their colonial influence on the United States , the British find Americans a " mysterious and paradoxical people , physically distant but culturally close , engagingly similar yet irritatingly different " . 
 Today , 838 @,@ 000 people in the United States identified themselves as born in Britain .. 
 = = Culture = = 
 Result from the expansion of the British Empire , British cultural influence can be observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , India , Pakistan , the United States , and the British overseas territories . These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere . As well as the British influence on its empire , the empire also influenced British culture , particularly British cuisine . Innovations and movements within the wider @-@ culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom ; Humanism , Protestantism , and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture . 
 As a result of the history of the formation of the United Kingdom , the cultures of England , Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland are diverse and have varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Historically , British cuisine has meant " unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients , matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour , rather than disguise it " . It has been " vilified as unimaginative and heavy " , and traditionally been limited in its international recognition to the full breakfast and the Christmas dinner . This is despite British cuisine having absorbed the culinary influences of those who have settled in Britain , resulting in hybrid dishes such as the British Asian Chicken tikka masala , hailed by some as " Britain 's true national dish " . 
 Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for Celts and Britons . The Anglo @-@ Saxons developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe . The Norman conquest of England introduced exotic spices into Britain in the Middle Ages . The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of India 's food tradition of " strong , penetrating spices and herbs " . Food rationing policies , imposed by the British government during wartime periods of the 20th century , are said to have been the stimulus for British cuisine 's poor international reputation . 
 British dishes include fish and chips , the Sunday roast , and bangers and mash . British cuisine has several national and regional varieties , including English , Scottish and Welsh cuisine , each of which has developed its own regional or local dishes , many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cheddar cheese , Cheshire cheese , the Yorkshire pudding , Arbroath Smokie , Cornish pasty and Welsh cakes . 
 The British are the second largest per capita tea consumers in the world , consuming an average of 2 @.@ 1 kilograms ( 4 @.@ 6 lb ) per person each year . British tea culture dates back to the 19th century , when India was part of the British Empire and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent . 
 = = = Languages = = = 
 There is no single British language , though English is by far the main language spoken by British citizens , being spoken <unk> by more than 70 % of the UK population . English is therefore the de facto official language of the United Kingdom . However , under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , the Welsh , Scottish Gaelic , Cornish , Irish , Ulster Scots and Scots ( or Lowland Scots ) languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government . As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants , Welsh and Scottish Gaelic have a different legal status from other minority languages . In some parts of the UK , some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language ; in wider areas , their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported and / or promoted by central and / or local government policy . For naturalisation purposes , a competence standard of English , Scottish Gaelic or Welsh is required to pass the life in the United Kingdom test . However , English is used routinely , and although considered culturally important , Scottish Gaelic and Welsh are much less used . 
 Throughout the United Kingdom there are distinctive spoken expressions and regional accents of English , which are seen to be symptomatic of a locality 's culture and identity . An awareness and knowledge of accents in the United Kingdom can " place , within a few miles , the locality in which a man or woman has grown up " . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 British literature is " one of the leading literatures in the world " . The overwhelming part is written in the English language , but there are also pieces of literature written in Scots , Scottish Gaelic and Welsh . 
 Britain has a long history of famous and influential authors . It boasts some of the oldest pieces of literature in the Western world , such as the epic poem Beowulf , one of the oldest surviving written work in the English language . 
 Famous authors include some of the world 's most studied and praised writers . William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe defined England 's Elizabethan period . The British Romantic movement was one of the strongest and most recognisable in Europe . The poets William Blake , Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature . Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe , such as John Keats , Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron . Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing , including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray . 
 Women 's literature in Britain has had a long and often troubled history , with many female writers producing work under a pen name , such as George Eliot . Other great female novelists that contributed to world literature were the Brontë sisters , Emily , Charlotte and Anne . 
 Non @-@ fiction has also played an important role in the history of British letters , with the first dictionary of the English language being produced and compiled by Samuel Johnson , a graduate of Oxford University and a London resident . 
 = = = Media and music = = = 
 Although cinema , theatre , dance and live music are popular , the favourite pastime of the British is watching television . Public broadcast television in the United Kingdom began in 1936 , with the launch of the BBC Television Service ( now BBC One ) . In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies , one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service , from any source . This includes the commercial channels , cable and satellite transmissions , and the Internet . Revenue generated from the television licence is used to provide radio , television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation , and Welsh language television programmes for S4C . The BBC , the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation , is the world 's largest broadcaster . Unlike other broadcasters in the UK , it is a public service based , quasi @-@ autonomous , statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust . Free @-@ to @-@ air terrestrial television channels available on a national basis are BBC One , BBC Two , ITV , Channel 4 ( S4C in Wales ) , and Five . 
 100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000 , chosen by a poll of industry professionals , to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened . Topping the list was Fawlty Towers , a British sitcom set in a fictional Torquay hotel starring John Cleese . 
 " British musical tradition is essentially vocal " , dominated by the music of England and Germanic culture , most greatly influenced by hymns and Anglican church music . However , the specific , traditional music of Wales and music of Scotland is distinct , and of the Celtic musical tradition . In the United Kingdom , more people attend live music performances than football matches . British rock was born in the mid @-@ 20th century out of the influence of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from the United States . Major early exports were The Beatles , The Rolling Stones , The Who and The Kinks . Together with other bands from the United Kingdom , these constituted the British Invasion , a popularisation of British pop and rock music in the United States . Into the 1970s heavy metal , new wave , and 2 tone . Britpop is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands reviving British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s . Leading exponents of Britpop were Blur , Oasis and Pulp . Also popularised in the United Kingdom during the 1990s were several domestically produced varieties of electronic dance music ; acid house , UK hard house , jungle , UK garage which in turn have influenced grime and British hip hop in the 2000s . The BRIT Awards are the British Phonographic Industry 's annual awards for both international and British popular music . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Historically , Christianity " has been the most influential and important religion in Britain " , and it remains the declared faith of the majority of the British people . The influence of Christianity on British culture has been " widespread , extending beyond the spheres of prayer and worship . Churches and cathedrals make a significant contribution to the architectural landscape of the nation 's cities and towns " whilst " many schools and hospitals were founded by men and women who were strongly influenced by Christian motives " . Throughout the United Kingdom , Easter and Christmas , the " two most important events in the Christian calendar " , are recognised as public holidays . 
 Christianity remains the major religion of the population of the United Kingdom in the 21st century , followed by Islam , Hinduism , Sikhism and then Judaism in terms of numbers of adherents . The 2007 <unk> Survey revealed 53 % identified themselves as Christian , which was similar to the 2004 British Social Attitudes Survey , and to the United Kingdom Census 2001 in which 71 @.@ 6 % said that Christianity was their religion , However , the <unk> Survey showed only one in ten Britons attend church weekly . Secularism was advanced in Britain during the Age of Enlightenment , and modern British organisations such as the British Humanist Association and the National Secular Society offer the opportunity for their members to " debate and explore the moral and philosophical issues in a non @-@ religious setting " . 
 The Treaty of Union that led to the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured that there would be a Protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains . The Church of England ( Anglican ) is legally recognised as the established church , and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual , whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor . The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures ( related to religious administration ) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament . The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members , mainly in England . There are also growing Orthodox , Evangelical and Pentecostal churches , with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance . Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists . 
 The Presbyterian Church of Scotland ( known informally as The Kirk ) , is recognised as the national church of Scotland and not subject to state control . The British monarch is an ordinary member and is required to swear an oath to " defend the security " of the church upon his or her accession . The Roman Catholic Church in Scotland is Scotland 's second largest Christian church , with followers representing a sixth of the population of Scotland . The Scottish Episcopal Church , which is part of the Anglican Communion , dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690 , when it split from the Church of Scotland over matters of theology and ritual . Further splits in the Church of Scotland , especially in the 19th century , led to the creation of other Presbyterian churches in Scotland , including the Free Church of Scotland . In the 1920s , the Church in Wales became independent from the Church of England and became ' disestablished ' but remains in the Anglican Communion . Methodism and other Protestant churches have had a major presence in Wales . The main religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all @-@ Ireland basis . Though collectively Protestants constitute the overall majority , the Roman Catholic Church of Ireland is the largest single church . The Presbyterian Church in Ireland , closely linked to the Church of Scotland in terms of theology and history , is the second largest church followed by the Church of Ireland ( Anglican ) which was disestablished in the 19th century . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Sport is an important element of British culture , and is one of the most popular leisure activities of Britons . Within the United Kingdom , nearly half of all adults partake in one or more sporting activity each week . Some of the major sports in the United Kingdom " were invented by the British " , including football , rugby union , rugby league and cricket , and " exported various other games " including tennis , badminton , boxing , golf , snooker and squash . 
 In most sports , separate organisations , teams and clubs represent the individual countries of the United Kingdom at international level , though in some sports , like rugby union , an all @-@ Ireland team represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic , and the British and Irish Lions represent the isles as a whole . The UK is represented by a single team at the Olympic Games and at the 2012 Summer Olympics , the Great Britain team won 65 medals : 29 gold ( the most since the 1908 Summer Olympics ) , 17 silver and 19 bronze , ranking them 3rd . In total , sportsmen and women from the UK " hold over 50 world titles in a variety of sports , such as professional boxing , rowing , snooker , squash and motorcycle sports " . 
 A 2006 poll found that association football was the most popular sport in the UK . In England 320 football clubs are affiliated to The Football Association ( FA ) and more than 42 @,@ 000 clubs to regional or district associations . The FA , founded in 1863 , and the Football League , founded in 1888 , were both the first of their kind in the world . In Scotland there are 78 full and associate clubs and nearly 6 @,@ 000 registered clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Football Association .

 Recreational fishing , particularly angling , is one of the most popular participation activities in the United Kingdom , with an estimated 3 — 4 million anglers in the country . The most widely practised form of angling in England and Wales is for coarse fish while in Scotland angling is usually for salmon and trout . 
 = = = Visual art and architecture = = = 
 For centuries , artists and architects in Britain were overwhelmingly influenced by Western art history . Amongst the first visual artists credited for developing a distinctly British aesthetic and artistic style is William Hogarth . The experience of military , political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire , led to a very specific drive in artistic technique , taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom . Britons used their art " to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world " , whilst the permanent settlers in British North America , Australasia , and South Africa " embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity " . The empire has been " at the centre , rather than in the margins , of the history of British art " , and imperial British visual arts have been fundamental to the construction , celebration and expression of Britishness . 
 British attitudes to modern art were " polarised " at the end of the 19th century . Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics ; Impressionism was initially regarded by " many conservative critics " as a " subversive foreign influence " , but became " fully assimilated " into British art during the early @-@ 20th century . Representational art was described by Herbert Read during the interwar period as " necessarily ... revolutionary " , and was studied and produced to such an extent that by the 1950s , Classicism was effectively void in British visual art . Post @-@ modern , contemporary British art , particularly that of the Young British Artists , has been pre @-@ occupied with postcolonialism , and " characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture ... perceived as a post @-@ imperial cultural anxiety " . 
 Architecture of the United Kingdom is diverse ; most influential developments have usually taken place in England , but Ireland , Scotland , and Wales have at various times played leading roles in architectural history . Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the British Isles , British architecture effectively begins with the first Anglo @-@ Saxon Christian churches , built soon after Augustine of Canterbury arrived in Great Britain in 597 . Norman architecture was built on a vast scale from the 11th century onwards in the form of castles and churches to help impose Norman authority upon their dominion . English Gothic architecture , which flourished between 1180 until around 1520 , was initially imported from France , but quickly developed its own unique qualities . Secular medieval architecture throughout Britain has left a legacy of large stone castles , with the " finest examples " being found lining both sides of the Anglo @-@ Scottish border , dating from the Wars of Scottish Independence of the 14th century . The invention of gunpowder and canons made castles redundant , and the English Renaissance which followed <unk> the development of new artistic styles for domestic architecture : Tudor style , English Baroque , The Queen Anne Style and Palladian . Georgian and Neoclassical architecture advanced after the Scottish Enlightenment . <unk> the United Kingdom , the influence of British architecture is particularly strong in South India , the result of British rule in India in the 19th century . The Indian cities of Bangalore , Chennai , and Mumbai each have courts , hotels and train stations designed in British architectural styles of Gothic Revivalism and neoclassicism . 
 = = = Political culture = = = 
 British political culture is tied closely with its institutions and civics , and a " subtle fusion of new and old values " . The principle of constitutional monarchy , with its notions of stable parliamentary government and political liberalism , " have come to dominate British culture " . These views have been reinforced by Sir Bernard Crick who said : 
 To be British seems to us to mean that we respect the laws , the elected parliamentary and democratic political structures , traditional values of mutual tolerance , respect for equal rights and mutual concern ; that we give our allegiance to the state ( as commonly symbolised by the Crown ) in return for its protection . 
 British political institutions include the Westminster system , the Commonwealth of Nations and Privy Council of the United Kingdom . Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution , officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body . The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand , its senior politicians , Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made Privy Counsellors , as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be . Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy Counsellors . 
 Universal suffrage for all males over 21 was granted in 1918 and for adult women in 1928 after the Suffragette movement . Politics in the United Kingdom is multi @-@ party , with three dominant political parties : the Conservative Party , the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party . The social structure of Britain , specifically social class , has " long been pre @-@ eminent among the factors used to explain party allegiance " , and still persists as " the dominant basis " of party political allegiance for Britons . The Conservative Party is descended from the historic Tory Party ( founded in England in 1678 ) , and is a centre @-@ right conservative political party , which traditionally draws support from the middle classes . The Labour Party ( founded by Scotsman Keir Hardie ) grew out of the trade union movement and socialist political parties of the 19th century , and continues to describe itself as a " democratic socialist party " . Labour states that it stands for the representation of the low @-@ paid working class , who have traditionally been its members and voters . The Scottish National Party is the third largest political party in the UK in terms of both party membership and representation in parliament , having won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats at the 2015 General Election . The Liberal Democrats are a liberal political party , and third largest in England in terms of membership and MPs elected . It is descended from the Liberal Party , a major ruling party of 19th century Britain through to the First World War , when it was supplanted by the Labour Party . The Liberal Democrats have historically drawn support from wide and " differing social backgrounds " . There are over 300 other , smaller political parties in the United Kingdom registered to the Electoral Commission . 
 = = Classification = = 
 According to the British Social Attitudes Survey , there are broadly two interpretations of British identity , with ethnic and civic dimensions : 
 The first group , which we term the ethnic dimension , contained the items about birthplace , ancestry , living in Britain , and sharing British customs and traditions . The second , or civic group , contained the items about feeling British , respecting laws and institutions , speaking English , and having British citizenship . 
 Of the two perspectives of British identity , the civic definition has become " the dominant idea ... by far " , and in this capacity , Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity . This has been used to explain why first- , second- and third @-@ generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British , rather than English , Scottish or Welsh , because it is an " institutional , inclusive " identity , that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law ; the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British . 
 However , this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales ; " white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second , and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British , but none identified as English , a label they associated exclusively with white people " . <unk> , in Scotland and Wales , White British and ethnic minority people both identified more strongly with Scotland and Wales than with Britain . 
 Studies and surveys have " reported that the majority of the Scots and Welsh see themselves as both Scottish / Welsh and British though with some differences in emphasis " . The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain , " the most basic , objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English , the Scots and the Welsh " . However , " English participants tended to think of themselves as indistinguishably English or British , while both Scottish and Welsh participants identified themselves much more readily as Scottish or Welsh than as British " . 
 Some persons opted " to combine both identities " as " they felt Scottish or Welsh , but held a British passport and were therefore British " , whereas others saw themselves as exclusively Scottish or exclusively Welsh and " felt quite divorced from the British , whom they saw as the English " . Commentators have described this latter phenomenon as " nationalism " , a rejection of British identity because some Scots and Welsh interpret it as " cultural imperialism imposed " upon the United Kingdom by " English ruling elites " , or else a response to a historical misappropriation of equating the word " English " with " British " , which has " brought about a desire among Scots , Welsh and Irish to learn more about their heritage and distinguish themselves from the broader British identity " . 
 = The King of Limbs = 
 The King of Limbs is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead , produced by Nigel Godrich . It was self @-@ released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats , followed by physical CD and 12 " vinyl releases on 28 March and a special " newspaper " edition on 9 May 2011 . The physical editions were released through the band 's Ticker Tape imprint on XL in the United Kingdom , TBD in the United States , and Hostess Entertainment in Japan . 
 Following the protracted recording and more conventional rock instrumentation of In Rainbows ( 2007 ) , Radiohead developed The King of Limbs by sampling and looping their recordings . Singer Thom Yorke described the album as an expression of " wildness " and " mutation " . Radiohead released no singles from the album , but released a music video for " Lotus Flower " that spawned an internet meme . 
 The King of Limbs was named one of the best albums of 2011 by publications including the Wire , the NME , and PopMatters , and was nominated for five categories in the 54th Grammy Awards , including Best Alternative Music Album . It sold an estimated 300 @,@ 000 to 400 @,@ 000 download copies in the first two months of release and became a bestseller on vinyl . The album was followed in the same year by a remix album , TKOL RMX 1234567 , and a live video , The King of Limbs : Live from the Basement . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Radiohead worked on The King of Limbs with longtime producer Nigel Godrich intermittently from May 2009 to January 2011 . Like their sixth album , Hail to the Thief ( 2003 ) , it was recorded in Los Angeles , possibly at the home of actress Drew Barrymore , who is thanked in the album 's liner notes . 
 The band wanted to avoid repeating the protracted recording process of their previous album In Rainbows ( 2007 ) . Cover artist Stanley Donwood said : " In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement , and that isn 't where the band are at the moment . Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released . The music is a continuing thing . And we wanted to make the album representative of that . " Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that " if we are gonna carry on , we need to do it for a new set of reasons . " Multi @-@ instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to " pick up guitars and write chord sequences . We didn 't want to sit in front of a computer either . We wanted a third thing , which involved playing and programming . " 
 Whereas Radiohead developed In Rainbows from their live performances , they developed The King of Limbs from studio experimentation . Much of the album is constructed from samples of drum , bass and guitar parts individually played by the band members , then looped , manipulated and edited with turntables , vinyl emulation software and sampling software written by Greenwood . Yorke likened the process to editing a film . Guitarist Ed O 'Brien said : " Music came first , then the lyrics , and the melody came after . So we had blocks of music and then Thom would write a lead vocal line melody and lyrics to it . " He told Rolling Stone : " The brick walls we tended to hit were when we knew something was great , like ' Bloom ' , but not finished . We knew the song was nearly something . Then [ bassist Colin Greenwood ] had that bassline , and Thom started singing . Those things suddenly made it a hundred times better . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The King of Limbs emphasises drummer Phil Selway and bassist Colin Greenwood 's rhythm section . According to O 'Brien : " Rhythm is the king of limbs ! The rhythm dictates the record . It 's very important . " The album makes prominent use of sampling , looping , and ambient sounds , including samples of natural sounds such as birdsong and wind . Pitchfork described its music as " aggressive rhythms made out of dainty bits of digital detritus , robotically repetitive yet humanly off @-@ kilter , parched thickets of drumming graced with fleeting moments of melodic relief . " Several critics noted dubstep influences . 
 The first track , " Bloom " , opens with a repeating piano loop and features complex rhythms and a flugelhorn arrangement by Jonny Greenwood . " Morning Mr Magpie " , debuted as a solo acoustic performance by Yorke in a webcast in 2002 , appears with a repeating electric guitar riff and a looping hi @-@ hat pattern . " Little by Little " features intricate guitar playing over busy , syncopated percussion . " Feral " is an instrumental with wordless , processed vocals , cut @-@ up drum loops , and a distorted synth bassline . " Lotus Flower " features a driving synth bassline and Yorke 's falsetto vocals . " Codex " is a downtempo piano ballad with <unk> and strings . " Give Up the Ghost " is an acoustic guitar ballad with call @-@ and @-@ response vocal harmonies . The final track , " Separator " , features a looped drum pattern and a " Neil Young @-@ inspired " electric guitar riff . 
 Yorke told NPR that he felt The King of Limbs was a " visual " album , with lyrics and artwork about " wildness " and " mutating " inspired by his environmental concerns . The album title is thought to refer to the King of Limbs , an ancient oak tree in Wiltshire 's Savernake Forest , close to Tottenham House , where Radiohead recorded In Rainbows . 
 At eight tracks and 37 minutes in length , The King of Limbs is Radiohead 's shortest album . Appearing on a BBC radio show in April 2011 , O 'Brien explained that Radiohead felt the ideal album was around 40 minutes long , and cited Marvin Gaye 's What 's Going On ( 1971 ) as a classic record shorter than The King of Limbs . 
 = = Packaging and artwork = = 
 The King of Limbs artwork was created by Yorke and Stanley Donwood , who has worked with Radiohead since their second album , The Bends ( 1995 ) . Donwood originally intended to paint oil portraits of the Radiohead members in the style of Gerhard Richter , but abandoned the idea as " I 'd never painted with oils before and I 'm not Gerhard Richter so it was just a series of painted disasters . " The final artwork was influenced by Northern European fairy tales and their association with nature and woods . As with previous Radiohead albums , Donwood worked on the artwork as the band recorded nearby ; the music made Donwood think of " immense multicoloured cathedrals of trees , with music echoing from the branches whilst strange fauna lurked in the fog . " He and Yorke drew trees with eyes , limbs , mouths and familiars , creating " strange , multi @-@ limbed creatures that are neither malevolent or benevolent , they 're simply there , part of the living spirit of the forest . " 
 For the special " newspaper " edition of The King of Limbs , Donwood wanted to create something " in a state of flux . " He chose newspaper for " its ephemeral nature " , admiring how paper fades in sunlight ; this reflected the album 's nature themes , mirroring the natural decay of living things . Donwood took inspiration from real publications , including weekend broadsheets and a stack of radical 1960s newspapers and magazines left at bassist Colin Greenwood 's house by an unknown person . The " newspaper " edition of The King of Limbs was nominated for the Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package in the 54th Grammy Awards .

 Radiohead released a music video for " Lotus Flower " on their YouTube channel on February 16 , 2011 , featuring black @-@ and @-@ white footage of Yorke dancing . It was directed by Hammer & <unk> member Garth Jennings and choreographed by Wayne McGregor . The video sparked the " Dancing Thom Yorke " internet meme , whereby fans replaced the video 's audio or edited the visuals , and " # <unk> " became a trending hashtag on Twitter . 
 To promote the retail release of The King of Limbs , Radiohead distributed a free single @-@ issue newspaper , the Universal Sigh , at independent record shops across the world on 28 March 2011 . Influenced by free newspapers such as LA Weekly or London Lite , the Universal Sigh is a 12 @-@ page tabloid printed using web @-@ offset lithography on newsprint paper and features artwork , poetry , and lyrics along with short stories by Donwood , Jay Griffiths and Robert Macfarlane . Donwood and Yorke distributed copies of the Universal Sigh in person at a record shop in east London . 
 Radiohead did not support The King of Limbs with a tour until 2012 , as Yorke wanted to continue studio work , and as it took the band some time to arrange the album for live performance . They enlisted drummer Clive Deamer , best known for his work with Portishead and Get the Blessing , to help perform the complex rhythms . Selway said of the two @-@ drummer setup : " That was fascinating . One played in the traditional way , the other almost mimicked a drum machine . It was push @-@ and @-@ pull , like kids at play , really interesting . " On 24 June 2011 , Radiohead played a surprise performance on the Park stage at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival , performing songs from The King of Limbs before an audience for the first time . [ 106 ] In September , they played two dates at New York City 's Roseland Ballroom and made American TV appearances including a one @-@ hour special episode of The Colbert Report and the season première of Saturday Night Live . In February 2012 , Radiohead began their first extended North American tour in four years , including dates in the United States , Canada and Mexico .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , The King of Limbs has an average score of 80 based on 40 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . BBC Music 's Mike Diver described the album as " a fans @-@ pleasing eighth album from Britain 's most consistently brilliant band . " Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe praised " the tense calm these eight songs maintain — a composure that feels constantly ready to crack " , commenting that " where In Rainbows was mellow but brisk — an album that felt on its way somewhere — these songs are eerie and insidious , creeping like shadows — and , often because of the haunting voice of Thom Yorke , the occasional chill . " PopMatters wrote : " The King of Limbs is a beautiful record , one that begs more of a conscious listen than its predecessor , but one that provides equal – if different – thrills in doing so . " 
 François Marchand of The Vancouver Sun said that the album " bridges Radiohead 's many different styles " and is " worth embracing " . Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork Media called the album " well @-@ worn terrain for Radiohead , and while it continues to yield rewarding results , the band 's signature game @-@ changing ambition is missed . " Pitchfork later named " Give Up the Ghost " as " Best New Music " , describing it as " a highlight " and " life @-@ affirming . " Robert Christgau awarded the album a two @-@ star " honourable mention " and recommended the songs " Little by Little " and " Bloom " . Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers wrote that the album " can be heard from several different angles ... fans and critics have already been registering wildly divergent reactions : some think it 's one of the band 's best efforts ; others find it too low @-@ key or similar to previous work ; a few consider it awfully doomy , and a few others wish it were less abstract . " In a retrospective 2015 article for Stereogum , Ryan Leas wrote that The King of Limbs is " very good , occasionally great music by a pivotal band that nevertheless felt like something of a letdown because it wasn 't , ultimately , some genius stroke none of us expected .

 The album was named one of the best of 2011 by several publications : The Wire and the Guardian both named it the 27th best of the year , Mojo the 47th , NME the 20th , PopMatters the 10th , Uncut the 7th and Rolling Stone the 5th , the latter describing it as " a record that grew all year – in your room , and onstage " .

 = Precipice ( Battlestar Galactica ) = 
 " Precipice " is the second part of the third season premiere and 35th episode of the re @-@ imagined American science fiction drama television series Battlestar Galactica . The episode was written by re @-@ imagined creator Ronald D. Moore , and directed by Sergio Mimica @-@ Gezzan . It first aired on October 6 , 2006 on the Sci @-@ Fi Channel along with the preceding episode " Occupation " . In " Precipice " , the Cylons respond to the suicide attack in the previous episode by rounding up several civilians believed to be affiliated with the resistance , and later decide to have them executed . Meanwhile , Galactica is to send a squadron to meet with the resistance on New Caprica . Unlike most episodes , it does not include a survivor count . 
 Since " Occupation " revolved around the resistance , " Precipice " focused more on the New Caprica Police and Jammer 's role in it . The producers also decided to release the Sharon model imprisoned on Galactica . During the writing process , Moore included references to Seinfeld and The Great Escape . The episode was seen by 2 @.@ 2 million viewers and received universal acclaim from critics . In addition , Moore 's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and Writers Guild of America awards . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In response to the suicide bombing of a New Caprica Police ( NCP ) ceremony , the Cylons order a crackdown against the insurgency . Many resistance members start to disagree about the legitimacy of the suicide bombings , but leader Colonel Saul Tigh ( Michael Hogan ) continues to orchestrate them . Meanwhile , in an attempt to get Kara " Starbuck " Thrace ( Katee Sackhoff ) to love him , Leoben Conoy ( Callum Keith Rennie ) presents her with a toddler named Kacey ( Madeline Parker ) , of whom Leoben claims Starbuck is the mother , as a result of her time on Caprica in " The Farm " . Leoben leaves her alone with the toddler , but Starbuck refuses to play with her . When she leaves Kacey unattended , however , Kacey injures herself falling down the stairs . As Kacey is recovering , Starbuck has a change of heart and prays to the Lords of <unk> not to let her die . 
 In a move against the insurgency , the Cylons decide to have the NCP arrest 200 civilians they believe to be affiliated with the resistance . Headed by Jammer ( Dominic <unk> ) , most of the arrests take place during the night . Those being arrested include Laura Roslin ( Mary McDonnell ) , Tom <unk> ( Richard Hatch ) and Cally Henderson Tyrol ( Nicki Clyne ) . After another suicide bombing at a power station , the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed , but require President Gaius Baltar 's ( James Callis ) signature . When he refuses to sign , an Aaron Doral ( Matthew Bennett ) copy forces him to at gunpoint . Caprica @-@ Six ( Tricia Helfer ) attempts to stop him , but Doral shoots her in the head . Baltar signs the document . Meanwhile , Ellen Tigh ( Kate Vernon ) learns from Cavil ( Dean Stockwell ) that he only released her husband Saul ( Michael Hogan ) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance . He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next , he will imprison Saul once more . Reluctantly , Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet . 
 On board Galactica , Admiral William Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) appoints their Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon ( Grace Park ) a Colonial officer and sends her to the planet to liaise with the resistance . When she arrives to meet with resistance members , Centurions attack , having learned of the meeting place from the intelligence Ellen provided . Simultaneously , the 200 human prisoners are being transported to a location by the Cylons and NCP . A masked Jammer , realizing they are to be executed , saves Cally by releasing her in secret and telling her to run . As she runs away , the sound of gunfire is heard . 
 = = Production = = 
 Since the previous episode " Occupation " focused on the resistance , writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part to focus more on Jammer 's role within the NCP , as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force . He also wanted to make Tigh know he 's wrong with launching suicide bombers , but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons . This is also Tigh 's principal trait and role in the series . Moore stated " why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica ? Why does Adama keep him around ? Because when the chips are down , and they are way down , baby , in this situation , when you are in a foxhole , who do you want next to you ? You want Colonel Tigh ' cause he is gonna get your ass out of there . " The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore 's favourite scenes , as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to " root for , " since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans , but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings . 
 After a Number Eight ( Sharon ) Cylon model was imprisoned onboard Galactica for the majority of the second season , the producers decided they needed to have her released , as they believed the storyline ran its course , and make her worthy for Adama 's trust . " The swirl " , a sex position Ellen Tigh uses , was a reference to Seinfeld , a comedy series Moore was a fan of . The sequence leading up to the Cylon Centurions lining up to execute the prisoners was an homage to The Great Escape , particularly the scene featuring the death of Richard Attenborough 's character from the Nazis after stopping the truck he was in , and telling him to take a break , at which point he was executed . 
 Madeline Parker was cast as Kacey Brynn . Parker 's performance impressed the producers , as they believed she was " one of the better child actors " they ever worked with , since casting them , especially at a younger age , was not easy . The one problem they had with Parker however , was filming her lying injured on the stairs . In the scene where the NCP arrest civilians at night , the idea of using night vision , which did not come from the original script , came from director Sergio Mimica @-@ Gezzan . Real night scopes were used to ensure the authenticity of the effect . One of the main visual effects of the episode was another suicide bombing which was caught on camera . Moore stated to have " tortured the visual effects guys about [ it ] quite a bit , " because the camera footage was in black and white and the visual quality of the explosion had to be degraded to match the footage . 
 Much like " Occupation " , " Precipice " also features scenes filmed on the Colonial One set featuring several copies of the same Cylon models . Furthermore Mimica Gezzan decided to shoot a 360 degree angle around the set , requiring additional digital duplication . The actors had to change their clothes between every take , which normally took as long as 30 minutes , after including time for touch ups on hair and makeup . The countryside of New Caprica was featured more towards the end of the episode . The producers found it a challenge to differentiate New Caprica from Caprica , the name of the planet New Caprica was named after following the holocaust from the miniseries , and featured extensively again during the first season , and both planets were filmed on location in temperate British Columbia forests . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Occupation " and " Precipice " were originally meant to be released as two separate episodes , however the producers decided to merge them together to be released as a two @-@ hour broadcast . The reasoning was partly due to the third episode " Exodus " , which became too long and split to a two @-@ part episode , and the producers did not wish to stretch the New Caprica storyline to several weeks . The two @-@ hour season @-@ three premiere was first broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on Friday , October 6 , 2006 between 9 pm and 11 pm . After its original broadcast , the two @-@ hour episode attracted a household rating of 1 @.@ 8 , equaling a total of 2 @.@ 2 million viewers .

" Ian Berriman of SFX reacted positively towards the episode , stating " Although there are a couple of great surprises in this episode – Casey , the Great Escape @-@ <unk> finale – the highlights are a fistful of fabulous face @-@ offs : Baltar discussing the bombing with Roslin ; Roslin questioning Tigh 's methods ; Apollo telling Adama that his plan is madness . James Callis 's performance as the haggard , tortured Baltar is outstanding . " Berriman rated the episode five stars out of five . Patrick Sauriol of UGO felt that although it was set a year since " Lay Down Your Burdens " , it " hasn 't lost a thing by jumping ahead , " and that the episode , along with " Occupation " , " confirm that it 's still the best show on television .

 = Fraser Mansion = 
 The Fraser Mansion is a building at 1701 20th Street NW , at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue , 20th Street , and R Street in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington , D.C. Since its construction in 1890 , the mansion has served as a private residence , a restaurant , a boarding house , and most recently as home to the Founding Church of Scientology . The building is currently the location of Scientology 's National Affairs office . 
 The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 . 
 = = Design , construction , and early use = = 
 The mansion was designed by the architectural firm of Hornblower and Marshall in an early eclectic beaux arts style to serve as the home of New York merchant George S. Fraser . The building is three stories tall with two basement levels and an attic . It is constructed of red brick and pink granite with a colonnaded entrance porch with balustraded deck , and a tiled , hipped roof . The interior was planned around a central open stair , with large , central halls on each floor . It was constructed in 1890 at a cost of $ 75 @,@ 000 , more than ten times the cost of a typical Washington home at that time . 
 The building served as Fraser 's residence until his death in 1896 . In 1901 , Fraser 's widow sold the mansion to Pennsylvania Congressman Joseph <unk> Thropp , where he took up residence beginning on March 3 , 1901 . The <unk> made exterior alterations , enlarging dormer windows and adding an oriel window in 1901 . In 1905 , architects Totten and Rogers designed a terrace with an entrance to the house near the oriel window , and also redesigned the garden wall . 
 The mansion remained in the ownership of Thropp and his wife , Miriam Scott @-@ Thropp , until Scott @-@ Thropp 's death in 1930 . 
 = = Restaurant = = 
 In 1932 , the lower floor of the mansion began operation as the Parrot Tea Room , a tea house , with a boarding house located on the upper levels . In 1950 , upon leasing to John Goldstein , the facility was converted to a restaurant and renamed the Golden Parrot . The mansion was sold in 1974 , and the restaurant was renamed the Golden <unk> . Later , the mansion became home to nightclubs Larry Brown 's and Sagittarius . 
 The mansion was again sold in 1981 to Walter Sommer for $ 2 million . In 1982 , following a $ 3 million restoration / renovation , the Fourways fine dining restaurant on the first floor and the Bermuda Bar and Grill below it were opened . The Fourways served Continental European and American dishes under the leadership of chef Jacques Barre . 
 By 1988 , Sommer opened the Bermuda Bar and Grill patio @-@ cafe alongside the Fourways . According to the Nation 's Restaurant News , the restaurant seated 40 people inside and 60 outside , and was modeled after the Fourways Restaurant and Inn of Bermuda . Among other things , the restaurant featured an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat salad bar , an unlimited Sunday brunch , and " traditional Bermuda drink , Dark & Stormy , made with Bermuda 's <unk> Black Seal rum and Ginger Beer . Another Bermudian tradition , Bermuda Fish Chowder with Outerbridge 's Sherry Peppers Sauce was always on the menu . 
 = = Proposed apartment building = = 
 In 1987 , Sommer proposed to construct a seven @-@ story , 29 @-@ unit apartment building in its parking lot behind the mansion . At the time , the property was zoned residential , with variances permitting a restaurant on the property . Then @-@ owner Walter Sommer claimed that the variances restricted him unfairly , requiring him to go to the zoning board multiple times for changes to his business , in a process that he considered costly and time consuming . Additionally , Sommer claimed that without commercial zoning , he was unable to obtain a " realistic commercial loan " to fund maintenance costs . Between 1982 and 1987 , the D.C. Board of Zoning Appeals granted Sommer variances to expand the commercial use of the building above the first floor permitting a private business club on the second floor . The club never opened . The third floor was an apartment for the General Manager . 
 While the proposed design for the building was approved by the D.C. Office of Planning and the Historic Preservation Review Board , and the Department of Public Works had determined that the plans , which would have included underground parking for both the apartments and the restaurant , would not cause an increase in parking or traffic problems in the area , the community opposed the building 's construction . Nearby resident Duff <unk> described the proposed apartment building as " such a blight to this area , " and that " there would have been so many people inconvenienced by it . " Several neighborhood associations opposed rezoning the building , expressing concern that the new building would be used as a hotel . Sommer denied that there were plans to use the building as a hotel or an office building . 
 Several covenants were proposed . One would require that the new building only be used for residential purposes . A second would have required that any future owners of the Fraser Mansion would be required to submit their plans for the building for review by the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board . A third proposed covenant would have split the zoning of the property , allowing only residential use of the building , but requiring variances for any changes in the parking for the restaurant or the apartment building . 
 Despite the proposed covenants , however , community groups vowed to continue to fight the proposal . 
 = = Bankruptcy and attempted sale = = 
 During the fight over the building 's zoning , Sommer claimed that he would go bankrupt if he was unable to develop the property . Fourways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1989 , and by October 1989 , the Fourways restaurant had closed . 
 Trying to pay creditors , Sommer attempted to sell the mansion . Sommer 's initial asking price was $ 7 million , which he later reduced to $ 3 million . A number of embassies and <unk> looked at the mansion , but none purchased . According to real estate broker Stanley Holland , Sommer " thought it was worth more than it was . " 
 = = Church of Scientology = = 
 In 1994 , the Church of Scientology purchased the property with the intention of using the building as a church facility . In purchasing the building , Scientology first purchased mortgages on the building in 1993 from the FDIC , which had assumed the loans after the 1990 failure of the National Bank of Washington . Following the purchase of the loans , Scientology foreclosed on the building . In the subsequent foreclosure auction , Scientology purchased the building for $ 2 @.@ 7 million . 
 Following $ 1 million in renovations , the building was dedicated as the new Founding Church of Scientology on October 21 , 1995 by Religious Technology Center chairman David Miscavige . 
 The Founding Church of Scientology relocated from the Fraser Mansion to the nearby Embassy Building on 16th Street NW on October 31 , 2009 . Fraser Mansion now serves as the National Affairs office for the Church of Scientology .

In response to " Unbreakable " being featured on NBC 's Bionic Woman , The Phantom Tollbooth 's second reviewer Bert <unk> said , " Mainstream attention is a wonderful thing , of course , but often signals a necessarily generic element to a project that sometimes sends out danger signals as to its artistic or creative potential .

 = = Overview = = 
 A boy named Adam is transferred to a middle school established for anthropomorphic zoo animals due to a spelling error making his surname " Lion " . There , he is befriended by a mischievous , eccentric spider monkey named Jake , hence the title of the series , along with a sassy toucan named Lupe , a giraffe named Ingrid , who is infatuated with Adam , the intelligent , wise gorilla Windsor , and Slips the easygoing python . In spite of his usual kindness and fondness for his friends , Adam despises being banished to Charles Darwin Middle School because of something beyond his control and longs for his previous human middle school . 
 Usually , the episodes are focused on Adam 's experiences at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability to fit in with his anthropomorphic schoolmates , the challenges that he must face ( such as the presumed stupidity of his peers , being schooled in subjects of use only to animals , the introductions of new students of odd , dangerous , or fictional species to the school or the misadventures that Adam stumbles into with them , or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals ) . 
 = = Characters = = 
 Adam Lyon ( voiced by Nika Futterman ) is a 12 @-@ year @-@ old human boy who was transferred from Chester Arthur Middle School to Charles Darwin Middle School ( CDMS ) by an accidental misspelling of his last name from " Lyon " to " Lion " . As the series title suggests , in gym class , Adam was paired up with Jake Spidermonkey and the two become best friends . Jake 's plans have them getting involved in situations which end up with him and Adam in trouble . Adam , being physically weak , is often preyed upon by the other animal students . His personality is downtrodden , due to being in an animal school and he also has a reputation of complaining about his daily experiences at the school . Adam can be arrogant and strong @-@ willed at times . Outside of school , he is often seen with a human girl named Kerry , with whom he has a secret crush . His efforts to impress her end up with Adam 's embarrassment . Towards the middle of the series , Adam seems to be on the borderline of sanity . Throughout the series , he is a big fan of his favorite superhero , Captain <unk> , despite the time he didn 't get a Captain <unk> action figure for his birthday after making a wish on a star that he would when he was little . He eagerly hopes to attend a clown @-@ based summer day @-@ camp and his college of choice is Clown College , as seen on his resume in the episode " My Feral Lyon " . 
 Jacob P. " Jake " Spidermonkey ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) , as his last name implies , is a spider monkey who quickly became Adam 's best friend . He is often very possessive of Adam and hates not having him around regularly . Jake is emotional and goofy , who takes to heart some of Adam 's comments and actions , leading to some overly @-@ dramatic and exaggerated reactions . He can be lazy and selfish , but at the same time , he is also fairly sensible . A running gag in the series is his obsession with the well @-@ being of his butt , which he made grow so large that it blocked out the sun in one episode . Along with the majority of the other animal students , Jake lives close enough to the school that he can see it from where he lives . Jake is often depicted as unintelligent . Jake has an older brother who looks like a taller , more stretched @-@ out version of Jake . 
 Windsor Gorilla ( voiced by Rick Gomez ) is a highly intelligent Western lowland gorilla , who serves as the anti @-@ bully at the school and often gives confusing wisdom to people . He speaks in a soft @-@ spoken and nearly monotonous manner , often stringing together technical words as a matter of his normal speech . When he talks , only the side of his mouth closest to the camera moves and the rest of his mouth remains closed . He is usually seen with Slips and is generally shown to be the leader of the two . Windsor tends to relate with Adam 's troubles better than the rest of the school , having a good grasp of both human and animal worlds , although he occasionally gives in to his animal instincts as well . Windsor has an older brother in high school who plays for his school 's football team . 
 Slips Python ( voiced by Rick Gomez ) is an easy @-@ going , street @-@ talking green tree python . He is an underachiever and excessive daydreamer whose gullibility allows him to believe anything he hears , which makes him a constant source of misinformation . As a snake , he has no limbs , yet wears a T @-@ shirt ( why is never explained ) . Slips has an older sister in high school who , despite being a girl , looks like an older version of Slips with a deep voice . He is usually seen with his best friend Windsor . 
 Guadalupe " Lupe " Toucan ( voiced by Grey DeLisle ) is a female Keel @-@ billed toucan , who is loud @-@ mouthed , acerbic , dominating and materialistic , although she considers herself to be mild @-@ tempered and low maintenance . Her best friend is Ingrid , who she dominates more than anyone else . Lupe loves popular culture , such as celebrities and fashion , though not being fond of clumsy toucan celebrity Kiki <unk> ( despite this , she said later on that she was one of Kiki 's biggest fans ) . She does not like milk . She speaks with a somewhat exaggerated , but fake , Chicano dialect and is known to have some issues involving what she sees as her overly large beak . Lupe has an elder sister who is in high school . She has a boyfriend named Corey Vulture , who is seen in the episode " Lupe in Love " . 
 Ingrid Giraffe ( voiced by Grey DeLisle ) is a female Masai giraffe and the tallest student in CDMS . Her towering height only adds to her feelings of insecurity , as she tries desperately to blend into the background . She is often seen with her neck going up then heading down on the screen in an exaggerated hunch , since it is very long and is often seen from the neck down . Lupe , Ingrid 's best friend , often <unk> her when she gives advice and basically runs the whole " friendship " . Ingrid has a crush on Adam Lyon , of which he is mostly unaware , or is actively frightened by her advances . She is also considered to be the weakest in the group . 
 Principal <unk> <unk> Pixiefrog ( voiced by Maurice LaMarche ) , as his last name implies , is a Pixie Frog and the CDMS principal . As a strict , but fair , administrator , he runs a tight ship , which is somewhat remarkable , considering he could easily be squashed underfoot by most of his students and the rest of the faculty ; for instance , when he was forced to watch the cheerleading practice , he ended up being crushed under <unk> Hippo 's foot with the weight of the entire team . Principal Pixiefrog always dodges lawsuits , is terrified of lawyers and is scared when anyone in the school could get sued ( he is shown to have <unk> ) . He talks similarly to Windsor , only moving part of his mouth , but his voice is much louder . Adam always asks him if anything bothers him , this frog principal will always help him to see . It is also revealed that Principal Pixiefrog has a mother , who bothers him . 
 Mrs. Geraldine Sharon Warthog ( voiced by Grey DeLisle ) is Principal Pixiefrog 's assistant ; she does all of the filing and is a warthog . Ironically , she never works . Completely fed up with her job and her employer , she always has an air of complete exasperation about her . Her voice is identical to that of Nurse Gazelle . 
 Nurse Gazelle ( voiced by Grey DeLisle ) is a female gazelle who serves as the school nurse of CDMS . She has blond hair and blue eyes . She also claims to have a brain the size of a soy nut , and that it 's really tiny and dry . An interesting note is that she can 't tell between a mirror 's reflection and the animal looking into the mirror or the difference between two slightly similar but not identical animals . Surprisingly , when Adam and Jake created nasty clones of themselves , she was able to differentiate them just before Principal Pixiefrog , who was with her , did . She is a nurse who specializes in injection . She 's also a <unk> . 
 Virgil " Bull " <unk> ( voiced by Phil LaMarr ) is a bull shark who enjoys beating up smaller kids and stealing their lunches . His intimidating presence , however , is offset by a high @-@ pitched , squeaky voice that sometimes lessens the impact of his verbal threats . Despite being a bully , he also has a soft humane side that he does not usually realize he is revealing . Due to Bull being a water creature , he wears water @-@ filled headphones over his gills to help him breathe ; when he talks , he will stop as his gills suck up the water with a loud noise . Bull has a big sister , Euripedes , who graduated CDMS prior to the beginning of the show and left a lasting impression in the school , a fact that has caused Bull to develop an inferiority complex at the mere mention of her name ( despite the fact she is not only half Bull 's size , but bullies via feminine taunts instead of physical abuse ) . 
 Henry Armadillo ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) is an armadillo who speaks in a thick southern drawl . 
 Coach Tiffany Gills ( voiced by Brian Doyle @-@ Murray ) is a female goldfish . Coach Gills is the school 's tiny , deep @-@ voiced PE and health teacher who instructs her students from inside her fishbowl . She often pesters Adam when he does not perform as well as his fellow students . In " Le <unk> " , she and Adam trade roles for a day . After experiencing some trouble , they later reconciled . She has mentioned several times in the series that she has no friends . She once had a crush on Mr. Cheetah , an athletic individual who plans to succeed her and Principal Pixiefrog in their careers . Ironically , though she is a fish , she apparently cannot swim . 
 Miss Chameleon ( voiced by Nika Futterman ) is a female chameleon who is the drama instructor and art teacher . As expected from a drama teacher , she is a drama queen , who speaks overly melodramatically and will often have stereotypical horror music playing when on @-@ scene . She can blend into her surroundings and turn invisible , although in reality , that is a popular misconception about chameleons . She holds class while perched on a twig located under a warming lamp . 
 Dickie <unk> ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) is an Australian @-@ American sugar glider . He made a successful career as a writer for the school 's greatest class clowns . His catch phrase is " Hello ! How 's your trousers ? "

The series went on top the Fridays block ratings , gaining millions of viewers . 
 My Gym Partner 's a Monkey received generally positive reviews from critics . William Barker of Web Wombat gave the King of the Jungle DVD a positive review , awarding it with a score of 70 % , saying : " With an original – dare I say unique ? – premise , My Gym Partner 's a Monkey makes for a somewhat refreshing change from super heroes and mutants , and the cut @-@ out animation style is captivating , though far from novel . It 's not the most impressive cartoon show I 've ever seen , but it 's quite cute and fairly amusing – even for the older primates among us . " Larisa Wiseman of Common Sense Media awarded the series three out of five stars , saying : " It 's difficult to tell what age group the show 's producers were aiming at – the animation style and slapstick by themselves would seem to appeal mainly to grade @-@ schoolers , while the jokes and life lessons are definitely aimed at the tween set .

 Walter " Wally " Peeler , VC , BEM ( 9 August 1887 – 23 May 1968 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest award for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces . He was decorated following his actions during the Battle of Broodseinde in October 1917 . Then a lance corporal in the Australian Imperial Force , he repeatedly took the lead in the 37th Battalion 's advance on well @-@ defended German positions , destroying four machine gun posts and killing more than 30 German soldiers during the battle . 
 Born in Castlemaine , Victoria , Peeler worked at various jobs in his home town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916 . Posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion , he arrived on the Western Front during November . In June 1917 , his battalion participated in the assault on Messines ridge , where he was lightly wounded . Eight days after his Victoria Cross action , Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm and spent the next seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom . Following the armistice with Germany , he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918 . 
 Peeler re @-@ settled with his family in Victoria , and was appointed the inaugural custodian of Melbourne 's Shrine of Remembrance in 1934 . In May 1940 , Peeler enlisted for service in the Second World War , understating his age by fourteen years to avoid the upper age limit imposed on volunteers . He was posted to the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion and initially saw action in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign . However , with the entry of Japan into the war , his unit was one of the first sent to the Netherlands East Indies in early 1942 . Originally destined for Sumatra it was diverted to Java and after disembarking assisted in the Dutch defence of the island . When Dutch resistance collapsed in March , allied forces in Java signed a formal surrender with British , Australian and American troops becoming prisoners of war . After three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years as prisoner of war , Peeler was freed in August 1945 and returned to Australia in October , resuming his duties at the Shrine of Remembrance . He retired in 1964 and , aged 80 , died at his home in South Caulfield on 23 May 1968 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Walter " Wally " Peeler was born at Barker 's Creek , near Castlemaine , Victoria , on 9 August 1887 . He was the eighth child of William Peeler , a farmer and miner , and his English @-@ born wife Mary Ellen ( née Scott ) . As a youth Peeler worked in his parent 's orchard , before gaining employment with Thompson 's Foundry in Castlemaine . On 10 July 1907 , he wed Kathleen Emma Hewitt ; the couple were to have five children . An active sportsman , Peeler was a member of the Castlemaine Cricket Club and , briefly , secretary of the Wesley Hill Football Club . 
 = = First World War = = 
 By 1916 , Peeler was living in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters . On 17 February , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War . Posted as a private soldier to the machine gun section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion , Peeler underwent his initial training in Victoria , before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard HMAT Wandilla on 6 June . The battalion arrived in Plymouth seven weeks later . During the three months Peeler 's unit spent in England undergoing additional training , he was charged with being absent without leave for six hours on 3 July , and fined a day 's pay . He was nevertheless promoted to lance corporal on 6 November . 
 Two weeks later , the 3rd Pioneer Battalion was posted to the Western Front . Sent to the Armentières sector , the battalion spent several months working on trench and railway construction . In mid @-@ December , Peeler attended a week @-@ long course at the Machine Gun School in Le Touquet , and in early 1917 , accompanied the battalion north in preparation for the upcoming Messines offensive . However , on 8 May 1917 , one month before the offensive , Peeler found himself the subject of a court @-@ martial in the field . Following an incident that occurred during a training session on 26 April , he was charged with " careless and negligent handling of a Lewis Gun whilst instructing " that led to " grievous bodily injury " to Private John Martin Fife . Found guilty of the charge , Peeler was stripped of his lance corporal stripe . 
 On 7 June 1917 , Peeler participated in the initial assault on Messines Ridge . Manning a Lewis Gun during the action , he was injured twice , suffering shrapnel wounds to his face and eye from an artillery shell , and a gunshot wound to his right cheek . He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion . On 22 June , he was once again promoted to lance corporal . The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front .

 As part of the third stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer 's Passchendaele offensive , an attack against Broodseinde was scheduled for 4 October 1917 . The 3rd Australian Division 's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade was one of the assault formations charged with delivering the main blow , and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge . To provide defence against low @-@ flying German aircraft during the attack , a group of 24 men , including Peeler , from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion 's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade 's 37th Battalion . 
 The attack on Broodseinde began at 06 : 00 under the cover of an artillery barrage . Armed with a Lewis Gun , Peeler advanced with the initial wave . The Australians rapidly crossed the first 100 metres ( 110 yd ) before becoming pinned down by a party of nine German soldiers , who were situated in a <unk> and sniping at the advancing troops . Firing his machine gun from the hip , Peeler dashed forward across the exposed ground and shot the group of Germans , " clearing the way for the advance " . He performed similar feats on two subsequent occasions , killing several German soldiers and emerging unscathed . 
 The Australian force continued to press their assault , encountering pillboxes and machine gun positions as they pushed forward . One such machine gun position , situated in the open , held up the advance . Firing a single burst from his Lewis Gun , Peeler killed the gunner and caused the remainder of the gun 's defenders to seek cover in a nearby dugout . One of the Australians then lobbed a " well aimed " grenade into the dugout , driving out ten soldiers whom Peeler then shot . Described as being " particularly prominent in the advance " by historian Charles Bean , Peeler " almost single @-@ handedly " destroyed four German posts in an hour , accounting for more than 30 soldiers . 
 By 07 : 15 the following morning , the 37th Battalion had captured its objective , having seized eight pillboxes , several concrete dugouts , 20 machine guns and 420 prisoners . Two hours later , the Australians were in possession of Broodseinde Ridge . For his actions during the battle , Peeler was awarded the Victoria Cross ; one of two Australians to be so decorated that day . On 12 October , eight days after Peeler 's actions , the men of the 10th Brigade returned to the front line in an effort to exploit the success of the previous week . The ground in front of their position was dominated by a series of German pillboxes and had been turned into a quagmire by heavy rain . The brigade 's attack was soon subject to a " torrent of machine gun fire " , and Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm . Initially evacuated to the 11th Australian Field Ambulance casualty station , it was decided that his wound necessitated treatment in England so he embarked for the Northampton War Hospital on 15 October , arriving the following day . 
 While recuperating in England , the announcement and accompanying citation for Peeler 's Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 November 1917 , reading : 
 War Office , 26th November , 1917 . 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer , Non @-@ commissioned Officers and Men : — 
 No. 114 L. / Cpl. Walter Peeler , Aus . Imp . Force . 
 For most conspicuous bravery when with a Lewis gun accompanying the first wave of the assault he encountered an enemy party sniping the advancing troops from a shell @-@ hole . 
 L. / Cpl. Peeler immediately rushed the position and accounted for nine of the enemy , and cleared the way for the advance . On two subsequent occasions he performed similar acts of valour , and each time accounted for a number of the enemy . 
 During operations he was directed to a position from which an enemy machine gun was being fired on our troops . He located and killed the gunner , and the remainder of the enemy party ran into a dugout close by . From this shelter they were dislodged by a bomb , and ten of the enemy ran out . These he disposed of . 
 This non @-@ commissioned officer actually accounted for over thirty of the enemy . 
 He displayed an absolute fearlessness in making his way ahead of the first wave of the assault , and the fine example which he set ensured the success of the attack against most determined opposition .

 As news of Peeler 's decoration spread , it prompted a " wave of celebrations " in his hometown of Castlemaine ; flags flew in his honour , and one of his daughters was cheered by fellow pupils at her school . On 8 January 1918 , Peeler was formally conferred with his Victoria Cross by King George V in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace . Having sufficiently recovered from his wound , Peeler rejoined the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in France on 17 May ; he was promoted to temporary corporal two weeks later . 
 On 22 June 1918 , Peeler was posted to the Corps Gas School for eight days . He was promoted to sergeant on 30 July . Around this time , Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes invited Australia 's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive . Among the group who accepted the offer , Peeler was one of ten who embarked for Melbourne aboard HMAT Medic on 24 August , arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later . He would not return to France ; on 11 November 1918 an armistice with Germany was declared , effectively ending the war . Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December . 
 = = Inter @-@ war years = = 
 Following his discharge , Peeler gained employment with the soldier @-@ settler branch of the Victorian Department of Lands . He remained with the department for six years , before acquiring an orchard in the Castlemaine district . However , this venture proved short @-@ lived and he soon returned with his family to Melbourne , joining the H.V. McKay Sunshine Harvester Works at Sunshine . Also on the company 's staff was a fellow Victoria Cross recipient , Dominic McCarthy . When Melbourne 's Shrine of Remembrance was completed in 1934 , Peeler was appointed as the memorial 's first custodian . He occupied this post for next 30 years , coming to regard the Shrine as " his second home " .

 On 27 May 1940 , Peeler enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force for service in the Second World War , giving his date of birth on his enlistment forms as 9 August 1901 , thus understating his age by fourteen years . At 52 , Peeler was twelve years over the maximum age limit , although he later claimed he was not the " oldest fellow in my unit " . Granted the acting rank of sergeant , he was allotted to the newly raised 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion . The battalion completed its initial training at Puckapunyal , during which time Peeler was made acting staff sergeant and Company Quartermaster Sergeant of D Company on 1 August . 
 On 7 April 1941 , the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked aboard HMT Queen Mary at Sydney , bound for the Middle East ; Peeler 's rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day . After just under four weeks at sea , the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in Suez , where the battalion entrained for Palestine . There it was attached to the 7th Division in support of the Syrian campaign against Vichy French forces . 
 The 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion was initially divided up , with each company attached to a different brigade of the 7th Division . Peeler 's D Company — assigned to the 25th Brigade — was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality . However , when the Vichy French launched a counter @-@ attack on 15 June , the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area in an effort to prevent any further French gains . On the night of 27 June , after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day , Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded . Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines . Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria , the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign , including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July . 
 After the Vichy French defeat in Syria , the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion was relocated to Tripoli , Lebanon where it headquartered itself in an olive grove while carrying out training and garrison duties over the next four months . During November , the battalion was moved to Qatana in Syria , but with the entry of Japan into the war in late 1941 , the 1st Australian Corps including the 6th and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the Netherlands East Indies for service in the Pacific theatre . In January 1942 , Peeler was among the men of the 2 / 2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT Orcades for Sumatra but later diverted to Java . He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time . 
 = = = Defence of Java and prisoner of war = = = 
 With the rapid Japanese advance through the Pacific and the fall of Singapore in February 1942 , the 3 @,@ 400 troops aboard Orcades were diverted from Sumatra to Java in the Dutch East Indies . Disembarking at Batavia on 18 February , Peeler 's battalion was combined with the other units aboard Orcades to form Blackforce . This ad hoc grouping , under the command of fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier Arthur Blackburn , was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch . Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation , consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions — the men of the 2 / 2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce 's 2nd Battalion . 
 On 28 February 1942 , elements of the Imperial Japanese Army landed on Java . Blackforce was stationed at Buitenzorg , poised to advance west to confront the invaders . However , rapid Japanese progress pushed the defending Dutch forces in the opposite direction , and Blackforce was assigned the defence of Buitenzorg and Leuwiliang . As the situation deteriorated further , Blackburn was forced to withdraw his men east on the night of 4 / 5 March , and again on 7 / 8 March . On 8 March , the Dutch surrendered , ordering all men to lay down their arms . With supplies running low and unable to contact the Australian Government , Brigadier Blackburn announced the surrender of Blackforce four days later . Peeler and his fellow soldiers thus became prisoners of war . At the time , he was one of three Australian Victoria Cross recipients of the First World War serving overseas , all of whom were " swept up in the Japanese advance " ; Blackburn surrendered with Peeler at Java , while Walter Brown was caught up in the fall of Singapore , where he is believed to have been killed attempting to evade capture . 
 Peeler was among a contingent of Australian captives transported to work on the Burma Railway . Despite the " harsh treatment " meted out by the Japanese , he later played down his ordeal , stating : " I wasn 't treated too badly , apart from nearly starving ... But what the Japs did to the others on the railway was pretty horrifying " . After three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years incarceration , he was freed following the Japanese capitulation in August 1945 and the subsequent liberation of prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps in the Pacific . On 6 October , Peeler embarked for Australia aboard HMS Highland Brigade ; he arrived in Melbourne fifteen days later . Back in Australia , he learned that his son , Donald , had been killed in action on the island of Bougainville on 31 December 1944 , while serving with the 15th Battalion . Donald Peeler was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches for his " distinguished service in the South @-@ West Pacific Area " . Warrant Officer Class II Walter Peeler was discharged from the Second Australian Imperial Force on 12 December 1945 .

 Peeler resumed his duties as custodian of the Shrine of Remembrance on his discharge , guiding visitors around the memorial . In the 1961 Queen 's Birthday Honours , his " long and dedicated service " at the Shrine was recognised with the award of the British Empire Medal . He retired three years later at the age of 76 , stating : " It 's time I had a rest . " In 1966 , Peeler was interviewed for a newspaper article ; when queried on his Victoria Cross exploit , he recalled : 
 My wartime experiences are nothing to make a splash about ... I 'm just an ex @-@ soldier who did his job . I never saw the faces of those I killed . They were just men in an enemy uniform . It was simply them or me . I don 't think I was brave — not any more than the other Aussies who were with me . I simply had a job to do and I did it ... Only afterwards did I realise how lucky I 'd been not to get killed myself . 
 On 23 May 1968 , Peeler died at his home in South Caulfield , Victoria . Survived by his wife , Kathleen , and their four remaining children , he was buried in Brighton Cemetery . Kathleen died the following year . Peeler is commemorated in the Victorian Garden of Remembrance , and a soldiers ' club in <unk> , New South Wales , bears his name . His Victoria Cross and other medals are on display in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . 
 = Astatine = 
 Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the chemical symbol At and atomic number 85 , and is the rarest naturally occurring element on the Earth 's crust . It occurs on Earth as the decay product of various heavier elements . All its isotopes are short @-@ lived ; the most stable is astatine @-@ 210 , with a half @-@ life of 8 @.@ 1 hours . Elemental astatine has never been viewed because any macroscopic sample would be immediately vaporized by its radioactive heating . It has yet to be determined if this obstacle could be overcome with sufficient cooling . 
 The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty . Many of these have been estimated based on its periodic table position as a heavier analog of iodine , and a member of the halogens – the group of elements including fluorine , chlorine and bromine . It is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal ; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine . Chemically , several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine . It also shows some metallic behavior , including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution ( unlike the lighter halogens ) . 
 Dale R. Corson , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , and Emilio G. Segrè synthesized the element at the University of California , Berkeley in 1940 , naming it after the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , " unstable " . Four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found in nature , although it is the least abundant of all the naturally occurring elements , with much less than one gram being present at any given time in the Earth 's crust . Neither the most stable isotope astatine @-@ 210 nor the medically useful astatine @-@ 211 occurs naturally . They can only be produced synthetically , usually by bombarding bismuth @-@ 209 with alpha particles . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Astatine is an extremely radioactive element ; all its isotopes have short half @-@ lives of 8 @.@ 1 hours or less , decaying into bismuth , polonium , radon , or other astatine isotopes . Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half @-@ lives of one second or less . Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table , only francium is less stable . 
 The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty . Research is limited by its short half @-@ life , which prevents the creation of weighable quantities . A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity . It remains to be seen if , with sufficient cooling , a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film . Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid ; metal formation has also been predicted . 
 = = = Physical = = = 
 Most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated ( by interpolation or extrapolation ) , using theoretically or empirically derived methods . For example , halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight – fluorine is nearly colorless , chlorine is yellow @-@ green , bromine is red @-@ brown , and iodine is dark gray / violet . Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid ( assuming it follows this trend ) , or as having a metallic appearance ( if it is a metalloid or a metal ) . The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series , increasing with atomic number . On this basis they are estimated to be 575 and 610 K ( 302 and 337 ° C ; 575 and 638 ° F ) , respectively . Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend . Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine , having a lower vapor pressure . Even so , half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature . The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224 @.@ 401 and 216 @.@ 225 nm , suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions . 
 The structure of solid astatine is unknown . As an analogue of iodine it may have an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules , and be a semiconductor ( with a band gap of 0 @.@ 7 eV ) . Alternatively , if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase , as has been predicted , it may have a monatomic face @-@ centered cubic structure . Evidence for ( or against ) the existence of diatomic astatine ( <unk> ) is sparse and inconclusive . Some sources state that it does not exist , or at least has never been observed , while other sources assert or imply its existence . Despite this controversy , many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted ; for example , its bond length would be 300 ± 10 pm , dissociation energy 83 @.@ 7 ± 12 @.@ 5 kJ · mol − 1 , and heat of vaporization ( ∆ Hvap ) 54 @.@ 39 kJ · mol − 1 . The latter figure means that astatine may ( at least ) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~ 42 kJ · mol − 1 are metallic when liquid ; diatomic iodine , with a value of 41 @.@ 71 kJ · mol − 1 , falls just short of the threshold figure . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 The chemistry of astatine is " clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted , and the possibility of reactions with impurities , walls and filters , or radioactivity by @-@ products , and other unwanted nano @-@ scale interactions . " Many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions , typically less than 10 − 10 mol · L − 1 . Some properties – such as anion formation – align with other halogens . Astatine has some metallic characteristics as well , such as plating onto a cathode , coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid , and forming a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution . It forms complexes with EDTA , a metal chelating agent , and is capable of acting as a metal in antibody radiolabeling ; in some respects astatine in the + 1 state is akin to silver in the same state . Most of the organic chemistry of astatine is , however , analogous to that of iodine . 
 Astatine has an electronegativity of 2 @.@ 2 on the revised Pauling scale – lower than that of iodine ( 2 @.@ 66 ) and the same as hydrogen . In hydrogen astatide ( <unk> ) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom , implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride . That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred – <unk> scale ( 1 @.@ 9 ) being less than that of hydrogen ( 2 @.@ 2 ) . The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one @-@ third because of spin @-@ orbit interactions . 
 = = Compounds = = 
 Less reactive than iodine , astatine is the least reactive of the halogens , although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration . The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine . Acting as a carrier , the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques ( such as filtration and precipitation ) to work . Like iodine , astatine has been shown to adopt odd @-@ numbered oxidation states ranging from − 1 to + 7 . 
 Only a few compounds with metals have been reported , in the form of astatides of sodium , palladium , silver , thallium , and lead . Some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide , and the other hypothetical alkali and alkaline earth astatides , have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides . 
 The formation of an astatine compound with hydrogen – usually referred to as hydrogen astatide – was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry . As mentioned , there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride . It is easily oxidized ; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the <unk> or At + forms , and the subsequent addition of silver ( I ) may only partially , at best , precipitate astatine as silver ( I ) astatide ( <unk> ) . Iodine , in contrast , is not oxidized , and precipitates readily as silver ( I ) iodide . 
 Astatine is known to bind to boron , carbon , and nitrogen . Various boron cage compounds have been prepared with At – B bonds , these being more stable than At – C bonds . Carbon <unk> ( <unk> ) has been synthesized . Astatine can replace a hydrogen atom in benzene to form <unk> <unk> ; this may be oxidized to <unk> by chlorine . By treating this compound with an alkaline solution of hypochlorite , <unk> can be produced . In the molecules <unk> @-@ astatine ( I ) perchlorate [ At ( <unk> ) 2 ] [ ClO4 ] and the analogous nitrate , the astatine atom is bonded to each nitrogen atom in the two pyridine rings . 
 With oxygen , there is evidence of the species AtO − , AtO − 
 2 , and AtO + in aqueous solution , formed by the reaction of astatine with an oxidant such as elemental bromine or ( in the last case ) by sodium persulfate in a solution of perchloric acid . The well characterized AtO − 
 3 anion can be obtained by , for example , the oxidation of astatine with potassium hypochlorite in a solution of potassium hydroxide . Preparation of lanthanum <unk> La ( <unk> ) 3 , following the oxidation of astatine by a hot <unk> solution , has been reported . Further oxidation of AtO − 
 3 , such as by xenon difluoride ( in a hot alkaline solution ) or <unk> ( in a neutral or alkaline solution ) , yields the <unk> ion AtO − 
 4 ; this is only stable in neutral or alkaline solutions . Astatine is also thought to be capable of forming cations in salts with oxyanions such as iodate or dichromate ; this is based on the observation that , in acidic solutions , monovalent or intermediate positive states of astatine <unk> with the insoluble salts of metal cations such as silver ( I ) iodate or thallium ( I ) dichromate . 
 Astatine may form bonds to the other chalcogens ; these include <unk> + and At ( CSN ) − 
 2 with sulfur , a coordination <unk> compound with selenium , and an astatine – tellurium colloid with tellurium . 
 Astatine is known to react with its lighter homologs iodine , bromine , and chlorine in the vapor state ; these reactions produce diatomic interhalogen compounds with formulas AtI , AtBr , and AtCl . The first two compounds may also be produced in water – astatine reacts with iodine / iodide solution to form AtI , whereas AtBr requires ( aside from astatine ) an iodine / iodine <unk> / bromide solution . The excess of iodides or bromides may lead to AtBr − 
 2 and AtI − 
 2 ions , or in a chloride solution , they may produce species like AtCl − 
 2 or <unk> − via equilibrium reactions with the chlorides . Oxidation of the element with dichromate ( in nitric acid solution ) showed that adding chloride turned the astatine into a molecule likely to be either AtCl or <unk> . Similarly , <unk> − 
 2 or AtCl − 
 2 may be produced . <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are known or presumed to have been precipitated . In a plasma ion source mass spectrometer , the ions [ AtI ] + , [ AtBr ] + , and [ AtCl ] + have been formed by introducing lighter halogen vapors into a helium @-@ filled cell containing astatine , supporting the existence of stable neutral molecules in the plasma ion state . No astatine fluorides have been discovered yet . Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds , including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non @-@ volatile product . Thus , although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible , it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent , as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluoride .

 In 1869 , when Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table , the space under iodine was empty ; after Niels Bohr established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements , it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there . Before its officially recognized discovery , it was called " eka @-@ iodine " ( from Sanskrit eka – " one " ) to imply it was one space under iodine ( in the same manner as eka @-@ silicon , eka @-@ boron , and others ) . Scientists tried to find it in nature ; given its rarity , these attempts resulted in several false discoveries . 
 The first claimed discovery of eka @-@ iodine was made by Fred Allison and his associates at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute ( now Auburn University ) in 1931 . The discoverers named element 85 " <unk> " , and assigned it the symbol Ab , designations that were used for a few years . In 1934 , H. G. MacPherson of University of California , Berkeley disproved Allison 's method and the validity of his discovery . There was another claim in 1937 , by the chemist <unk> De . Working in Dacca in British India ( now Dhaka in Bangladesh ) , he chose the name " dakin " for element 85 , which he claimed to have isolated as the thorium series equivalent of radium F ( polonium @-@ 210 ) in the radium series . The properties he reported for dakin do not correspond to those of astatine ; moreover , astatine is not found in the thorium series , and the true identity of dakin is not known . 
 In 1936 , a team of Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French physicist Yvette Cauchois claimed to have discovered element 85 via X @-@ ray analysis . In 1939 they published another paper which supported and extended previous data . In 1944 , Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time , claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers . He chose the name " dor " , presumably from the Romanian for " longing " [ for peace ] , as World War II had started five years earlier . As Hulubei was writing in French , a language which does not accommodate the " ine " suffix , dor would likely have been rendered in English as " <unk> " , had it been adopted . In 1947 , Hulubei 's claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist Friedrich Paneth , who would later chair the IUPAC committee responsible for recognition of new elements . Even though Hulubei 's samples did contain astatine , his means to detect it were too weak , by current standards , to enable correct identification . He had also been involved in an earlier false claim as to the discovery of element 87 ( francium ) and this is thought to have caused other researchers to downplay his work . 
 In 1940 , the Swiss chemist Walter Minder announced the discovery of element 85 as the beta decay product of radium A ( polonium @-@ 218 ) , choosing the name " <unk> " ( from Helvetia , " Switzerland " ) . Karlik and Bernert were unsuccessful in reproducing his experiments , and subsequently attributed Minder 's results to contamination of his radon stream ( radon @-@ 222 is the parent isotope of polonium @-@ 218 ) . In 1942 , Minder , in collaboration with the English scientist Alice Leigh @-@ Smith , announced the discovery of another isotope of element 85 , presumed to be the product of thorium A ( polonium @-@ 216 ) beta decay . They named this substance " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , but Karlik and Bernert were again unable to reproduce these results . 
 Later in 1940 , Dale R. Corson , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , and Emilio Segrè isolated the element at the University of California , Berkeley . Instead of searching for the element in nature , the scientists created it by bombarding bismuth @-@ 209 with alpha particles in a cyclotron ( particle accelerator ) to produce , after emission of two neutrons , astatine @-@ 211 . The name " astatine " comes from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " unstable " , because of its propensity for radioactive decay , with the ending " -ine " , found in the names of the four previously discovered halogens . Three years later , astatine was found as a product of two naturally occurring decay chains by Berta Karlik and <unk> Bernert , first in the so @-@ called uranium series , and then in the actinium series . Since then , astatine has been determined in a third decay chain , the neptunium series . 
 Corson and his colleagues classified astatine as a metal on the basis of its analytical chemistry . Subsequent investigators reported iodine @-@ like , cationic , or amphoteric behavior . In a 2003 retrospective , Corson wrote that " some of the properties [ of astatine ] are similar to iodine … it also exhibits metallic properties , more like its metallic neighbors Po and Bi . " 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 There are 39 known isotopes of astatine , with atomic masses ( mass numbers ) of 191 – 229 . Theoretical modeling suggests that 37 more isotopes could exist . No stable or long @-@ lived astatine isotope has been observed nor is one expected to exist . 
 Astatine 's alpha decay energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements . Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay , which become lower as the nuclei become heavier . Astatine @-@ 211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope , because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons , and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell . Despite having a similar half @-@ life to the previous isotope ( 8 @.@ 1 hours for astatine @-@ 210 and 7 @.@ 2 hours for astatine @-@ 211 ) , the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter : 41 @.@ 81 % against only 0 @.@ 18 % . The two following isotopes release even more energy , with astatine @-@ 213 releasing the most energy . For this reason , it is the shortest @-@ lived astatine isotope . Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy , no long @-@ lived astatine isotope exists , because of the increasing role of beta decay ( electron emission ) . This decay mode is especially important for astatine ; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay . Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine @-@ 213 , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Astatine @-@ 210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay ( positron emission ) , astatine @-@ 216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta ( minus ) decay , and astatine @-@ 212 decays via both modes , while astatine @-@ 211 undergoes electron capture . 
 The most stable isotope is astatine @-@ 210 , which has a half @-@ life of 8 @.@ 1 hours . The primary decay mode is beta plus , to the relatively long @-@ lived ( in comparison to astatine isotopes ) alpha emitter polonium @-@ 210 . In total , only five isotopes have half @-@ lives exceeding one hour ( astatine @-@ 207 to <unk> ) . The least stable ground state isotope is astatine @-@ 213 , with a half @-@ life of 125 nanoseconds . It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long @-@ lived bismuth @-@ 209 . 
 Astatine has 24 known nuclear isomers , which are nuclei with one or more nucleons ( protons or neutrons ) in an excited state . A nuclear isomer may also be called a " meta @-@ state " , meaning the system has more internal energy than the " ground state " ( the state with the lowest possible internal energy ) , making the former likely to decay into the latter . There may be more than one isomer for each isotope . The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine @-@ <unk> , which has a half @-@ life of about 3 minutes , longer than those of all the ground states bar those of isotopes 203 – 211 and 220 . The least stable is astatine @-@ <unk> ; its half @-@ life of 265 nanoseconds is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine @-@ 213 . 
 = = Natural occurrence = = 
 Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element . The total amount of astatine in the Earth 's crust ( quoted mass 2 @.@ 36 × 1025 grams ) is estimated to be less than one gram at any given time . 
 Any astatine present at the formation of the Earth has long since disappeared ; the four naturally occurring isotopes ( astatine @-@ 215 , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) are instead continuously produced as a result of the decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores , and trace quantities of neptunium @-@ 237 . The landmass of North and South America combined , to a depth of 16 kilometers ( 10 miles ) , contains only about one trillion astatine @-@ 215 atoms at any given time ( around 3 @.@ 5 × 10 − 10 grams ) . Astatine @-@ 217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium @-@ 237 . Primordial remnants of the latter isotope — due to its relatively short half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 14 million years — are no longer present on Earth . However trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores . Astatine @-@ 218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature . Astatine @-@ 219 , with a half @-@ life of 56 seconds , is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes . 
 Isotopes of astatine are sometimes not listed as naturally occurring because of misconceptions that there are no such isotopes , or discrepancies in the literature . Astatine @-@ 216 has been counted as a naturally occurring isotope but reports of its observation ( which were described as doubtful ) have not been confirmed . 
 = = Synthesis = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth @-@ 209 with energetic alpha particles , and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long @-@ lived isotopes astatine @-@ 209 through astatine @-@ 211 . Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities , with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6 @.@ 6 <unk> ( about 86 nanograms or 2 @.@ 47 × 1014 atoms ) . Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons and the prospect of melting the target . Solvent radiolysis due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem . With cryogenic technology , microgram quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of thorium or uranium to yield radon @-@ 211 , in turn decaying to astatine @-@ 211 . Contamination with astatine @-@ 210 is expected to be a drawback of this method .
