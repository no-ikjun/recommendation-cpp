 Thirsty Merc 's second album , Slideshows , was issued on 21 April 2007 via Warner Music Australia . It became the band 's most successful release yet , peaking at No. 4 in Australia , although it was less successful in New Zealand , only reaching No. 38 . To support the release of Slideshows , Thirsty Merc toured Australia , playing an album tour in theatres nationally and then various regional tours , the biggest of which had 38 shows booked across seven weeks . The album 's first single , " 20 Good Reasons " ( March 2007 ) , reached No. 4 in Australia and No. 17 in New Zealand . In June they supported Evermore on a tour of New Zealand , showcasing their " unique blend of pop rock dance @-@ able balladry " . The next three singles appeared in the top 100 in Australia , " The Hard Way " ( September ) , " Those Eyes " ( December ) , and " Homesick " ( May 2008 ) . 
 The band 's main songwriter , Thistlethwayte , inadvertently wrote a " break @-@ up album " , which The Sydney Morning Herald 's Brett <unk> noted was unusual , " that the articulate and intelligent 27 @-@ year @-@ old has strung together 12 such stock @-@ standard , radio @-@ friendly songs about broken hearts " . Thistlethwayte described his influences : " Jazz taught me about spontaneity ... Central to jazz is improvisation . It 's also great to get that knowledge of theory , an understanding of the geeky side of music " and writing advertising jingles had showed him how to " do a lot of things in differing genres and recording styles – but had to try to be authentic about it " . After writing the tracks , the other members " choose the songs that had the ultimate emotional impact " .

 On 14 January 2010 Thirsty Merc announced that Carey had left the band and was replaced on guitar by Matt Smith , from afrobeat and reggae band , The Strides . Carey wanted to work as a record producer and spend more time with his wife . On 18 June 2010 Thirsty Merc released their third album , Mousetrap Heart , which was recorded mostly in Los Angeles with Matt Wallace co @-@ producing , while two tracks were produced in Melbourne with Gravina . Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald opined that " we buy , or actively avoid , songs that excite a response in us but radio wants songs that fit in , that don 't provoke strong responses , that offend the fewest people ... this [ album ] is a collection of extremely professional , well @-@ considered , carefully targeted songs whose key performance indicators are ticked off one by one in a manner so efficient you suspect band meetings must have an agenda , notes secretary and double @-@ cream biscuits for <unk> " . 
 The band toured nationally in July 2010 to support the album , while its lead single , the title track , had appeared in May and charted in the Top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart . The second single , " Tommy and Krista " , was released in September , which peaked at No. 10 in New Zealand . Another single , " All My Life " , was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final . Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok , Thailand . The narrative is a ' heroic love ' set on a local military base and features Russian model @-@ actress Maria <unk> , together with 50 Thai army troops , an Iroquois helicopter , and a Chinook helicopter . In November Lip Magazine 's Shannon <unk> reviewed a live gig , " [ they ] are certainly no Pixies , Beatles or Sex Pistols . They 're not breaking any rules or boundaries in the revolutionary world of rock music . In fact they are perfectly happy and capable of playing within the parameters of radio friendly and commercially safe pop rock . But one thing is for sure ; they go the extra mile in giving a charmingly refined and hearty live performance and that in itself should be commended " .

 Laurentia Tan Yen Yi BBM PBM ( / <unk> / lo @-@ REN @-@ <unk> ; Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Chén <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ̌ n <unk> ̂ n í ] ) ( born 24 April 1979 ) , is a United Kingdom @-@ based Singaporean Para @-@ equestrian competitor . Tan developed cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth , and moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of three . She took up horse riding at age of five years as a form of physiotherapy . She subsequently completed her A @-@ levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School , a residential special school for the deaf , and graduated with an honours degree from Oxford Brookes University in hospitality management and tourism . 
 In March 2007 , the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore ( RDA ) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at Hartpury College in Hartpury , Gloucester , in England in July that year . At this event , her first international competition , she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games . In September 2008 , at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre at Sha Tin , she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests ( class Ia ) . These were Singapore 's first Paralympic medals and Asia 's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games . Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Medal ) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008 . 
 On 2 September 2012 , Tan won Singapore 's first medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London , a bronze in the dressage Individual Championship Test ( class Ia ) . She followed this up with a silver medal in the Individual Freestyle Test ( class Ia ) on 4 September . For her achievements , Tan was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Star ) by the President in November 2012 . 
 = = Early years and education = = 
 Laurentia Tan was born on 24 April 1979 in Singapore . She moved with her family to London at the age of three years due to her father 's work . Tan developed cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth , and doctors informed her parents that she would probably not be able to walk . Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as they felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there . When she was in school , she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her " Trouble " . At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly , and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders in London as a form of physiotherapy . This activity also helped her confidence and self @-@ esteem . 
 Tan completed her A @-@ levels at the Mary Hare Grammar School , a residential special school for the deaf , where she was a prefect . She also won an Elizabeth Dyson Prize for progress and achievement and a prize for business studies . From the age of 18 , she stopped horse riding for eight years to pursue an honours degree in hospitality management and tourism at Oxford Brookes University , and for a job as a mental health worker . However , she missed the sport and took it up again in 2005 . Tan said , " For me , riding a horse gives me the freedom , movement and energy that my own legs cannot do . " 
 = = Sporting career = = 
 Tan took up riding in October 2005 at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders , where she met her coach Heather " Penny " <unk> . Encouraged to participate in dressage competitions in March 2006 , she quickly progressed to the Riding for the Disabled Association ( RDA ) Nationals that year . In March 2007 , RDA Singapore contacted Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships 2007 , which was a qualifier for the 2008 Summer Paralympics . The event , Tan 's first international competition , was held at Hartpury College , Gloucester , in England in July 2007 . She achieved 63 % or higher in both her Team and Individual Tests , qualifying her to be selected for the 2008 Summer Paralympics . In the Freestyle to Music Test , despite her profound deafness , she was placed fourth in a field of 18 riders with a best score of 67 @.@ 94 % . In October 2007 , Tan went to Singapore for a visit and trained daily at Singapore 's RDA with volunteer coach Sally Drummond . Tan resigned her job in June 2008 to train full @-@ time with her coach Penny <unk> and physiotherapist Anthea Pell . 
 = = = 2008 Summer Paralympics = = = 
 Tan 's first Paralympic event was the para @-@ dressage Individual Championship Test ( class Ia ) . Riders in this event are categorized into classes I to IV , those in class I having the most severe disabilities . On 9 September , riding a 20 @-@ year @-@ old chestnut gelding loaned to her named Nothing to Lose ( also known as Harvey ) at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre in Sha Tin , Tan scored 68 @.@ 80 % to claim the bronze medal behind the United Kingdom 's Anne Dunham ( 73 @.@ 10 % ) and Sophie Christiansen ( 72 @.@ 80 % ) . She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal , and the holder of Asia 's first Paralympic equestrian medal . Two days after achieving the first medal , Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70 @.@ 167 % for the Individual Freestyle Event , in which she performed to music with Nothing To Lose . The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore , Melanie Chew , described her performance as " beyond our expectations " , and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport . 
 Tan 's win sparked discussion about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore . A correspondent to the Straits Times criticized the fact that the newspaper had not elaborated on Tan 's performance or what was involved in the event , but had " focused almost primarily on her disability " . Another letter writer to my paper expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan 's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the Singapore women 's table tennis team at the 2008 Summer Olympics . In addition , a Today reader noted that Tan would be receiving S $ 25 @,@ 000 for her bronze medal , a tenth of the S $ 250 @,@ 000 that table tennis players Feng Tianwei , Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu received for their silver medals . He felt that she should receive even more than them , given what she had achieved in spite of her disabilities . The President of the Society for the Physically Disabled , Ms Chia Yong Yong , commented that the disparity between the cash awards given to able @-@ bodied and disabled sportspeople was " disconcerting " and looked forward to a single common scheme , because : 
 If we persist in having two different standards , we reinforce the erroneous perception that disabled people are different , and strengthen the barriers against building an inclusive society . We cannot build a gracious inclusive society if we continue to deny the achievements of those perceived to be different and less able than we . 
 On 16 September , Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen asked in Parliament if there was a difference in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians , and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians . Teo Ser Luck , Senior Parliamentary Secretary ( Community Development , Youth and Sports ) , said that on a per capita basis disabled sportspeople received about S $ 106 @,@ 000 in the current financial year compared to S $ 54 @,@ 000 for each able @-@ bodied sportsperson as there were 794 registered able @-@ bodied sportspeople but only 16 disabled ones . Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition , since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes . Further , cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore <unk> Board and were not paid out of state funds . The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years , while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently . He said that the government was looking at how it could " develop a system to accommodate all athletes that represent Singapore " . 
 Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Medal ) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008 . At an appreciation dinner on 21 November 2008 , the Singapore National Paralympic Committee ( SNPC ) announced that it was increasing the monetary awards under its Athlete Achievement Award scheme for Paralympic Games medallists in individual and team events , a quarter of which would be paid to the SNPC towards developing elite athletes and sports . As a result , for her Paralympic win , Tan received a cash reward of S $ 37 @,@ 500 , S $ 12 @,@ 500 of which went to the SNPC . She made it into Today newspaper 's list of athletes of the year for 2008 in eighth place , and shared the Her World Young Woman Achiever 2008 award with Paralympian swimmer Yip Pin Xiu .

 On 2 September 2012 , Tan won Singapore 's first medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics , a bronze in the dressage Individual Championship Test ( class Ia ) . Riding on Ruben James 2 , a gelding from Germany she had only known for ten months , she scored 73 @.@ 650 percentage points . Two days later , on 4 September , she scored 79 @.@ 000 in the Individual Freestyle Test ( class Ia ) which brought her a silver medal . Her wins brought her prizes of $ 50 @,@ 000 ( for her bronze medal ) and $ 100 @,@ 000 ( silver ) from the SNPC 's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme , again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive . Twenty per cent of the prize money will be paid to the Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development . For her achievements , Tan won The Straits Times newspaper 's Star of the Month for September , and was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat ( Public Service Star ) by the President on 11 November 2012 .

 = The First Time ( Glee ) = 
 " The First Time " is the fifth episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the forty @-@ ninth overall . Written by Roberto Aguirre @-@ Sacasa and directed by co @-@ executive producer Bradley Buecker , it first aired on Fox in the United States on November 8 , 2011 . The episode features the preparations for performing West Side Story and the show 's opening night , and the various events leading to the decisions by two of the show 's student couples — Rachel ( Lea Michele ) and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) , and Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) and Blaine ( Darren Criss ) — to begin having sex . 
 While an advanced copy of the episode was released to several reviewers and was highly praised by them , the reviewers of the broadcast were not as generally enthusiastic . In particular , some of the plotting and resulting characterization came in for criticism . The performance of " America " , however , was widely acclaimed , especially that of Santana ( Naya Rivera ) in the role of Anita . While the advance publicity about the " first time " events drew some pre @-@ broadcast condemnation , many critics were enthusiastic about the fact that a gay couple was being given such a storyline . 
 All six songs were released in five singles , available for download . Of these , " Uptown Girl " , a song sung by the returning Dalton Academy Warblers , charted on the Billboard Hot 100 , and also on the Canadian Hot 100 . The remaining songs , all from West Side Story , did not chart . Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 6 @.@ 91 million American viewers , the lowest of the season , and garnered a 3 @.@ 1 / 10 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The total viewership for this episode was down somewhat from the previous episode , " Pot o ' Gold " , though ratings were fractionally higher . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Artie Abrams ( Kevin McHale ) has taken charge of directing the school musical , West Side Story , and he tells the two leads — Rachel ( Lea Michele ) , playing Maria , and Blaine ( Darren Criss ) , playing Tony — that they are not conveying enough emotion in their rendition of " Tonight " . He questions whether they can convincingly portray the roles if they are still virgins . Later , his co @-@ director Coach Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) confesses to him that she is attracted to football recruiter Cooter Menkins ( Eric Bruskotter ) , who is at McKinley to scout potential players for Ohio State , though she is sure he would never consider her . Artie thinks otherwise , and acting on his advice , Cooter arranges a date with her . 
 Blaine and Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) discuss their decision to postpone sex . Blaine goes to Dalton Academy to invite the Warblers to see him in West Side Story and arrives as they are performing " Uptown Girl " . Afterward , new Warbler Sebastian Smythe ( Grant Gustin ) makes a play for Blaine , intercut with Santana ( Naya Rivera ) and Rachel singing " A Boy Like That " from the musical . They later meet at a coffee shop , and Kurt arrives as Blaine is telling Sebastian that he already has a boyfriend . Sebastian convinces them to go with him to the local gay bar and supplies fake IDs . While Blaine and Sebastian are dancing , Kurt is surprised to see Dave Karofsky ( Max Adler ) , who has transferred to another school . When Blaine and Kurt leave , Blaine is drunk and aroused , and urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car ; Kurt refuses , and Blaine angrily walks home . 
 Rachel lets Finn ( Cory Monteith ) know that she is interested in having sex with him , but he balks when she admits her reason is to be a better Maria . Later , she asks advice from the other girls in the show . While Santana and Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) both urge her not to have sex with Finn , Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) reveals that she and Mike ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) had sex over the summer and says how wonderful it was with the boy she loved — her words are intercut with Rachel and Santana singing " I Have a Love " in rehearsal . Mike 's father ( Keong Sim ) confronts him about his participation in the musical , and Mike tells him he wants to be a professional dancer , not a doctor . His father disowns him . 
 Cooter recruits Shane ( LaMarcus Tinker ) for Ohio State , but not Finn , who is despondent about his future . Rachel comforts him , and promises that she will help him find a new future . Back at school , Blaine apologizes to Kurt for getting drunk , and says he cares nothing for Sebastian . Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine 's house for the night . 
 On opening night , Artie is assailed by self @-@ doubt , but he is thanked by the cast for his leadership , and he thanks them for trusting him . They perform " America " , which gets a standing ovation . Blaine and Rachel , waiting to go on and still virgins , are afraid they will not convey the necessary emotion , but Rachel reminds Blaine that they both have found their soulmates in Finn and Kurt , just like Maria and Tony had with each other . As they sing " One Hand , One Heart " on stage , they are also shown in scenes involving their first sexual encounters with their true soulmates .

 The episode began filming on September 23 , 2011 , and ended on October 14 , 2011 . The last nine days were shot in parallel with the sixth episode , which began shooting on October 6 , 2011 , and briefly with the seventh episode , which began shooting on October 13 , 2011 . 
 Grant Gustin makes his first appearance in this episode , playing a new " major " recurring character , Sebastian Smythe , a " gay Dalton Academy Warbler who sets his sights on Blaine " . Gustin won the role after " an exhaustive , weeks @-@ long casting search " , and the character is referred to as " promiscuous " and " scheming " . Gustin 's first day on the Glee set was September 26 , 2011 . He had been playing the role of Baby John in the touring company of Broadway revival of West Side Story since it opened on September 30 , 2010 , and left the show after performing on September 23 , 2011 to return for his first day with Glee . 
 Although the Dalton Academy Warblers also return in this episode , they are not voiced by the Tufts Beelzebubs , who sang backgrounds for Warblers numbers in the second season . According to Curt Mega , who sings lead on the Warblers track in this episode , the backgrounds were sung by " Jon Hall , Brock Baker and Luke <unk> and some others " , with the three named men having played on @-@ screen Warblers in the second season . Some of the actors who played Warblers in the second season , including Hall and Mega , returned for the third . After the Warblers were filmed on October 3 , 2011 , Dominic Barnes , who played Trent in season two , tweeted to Gustin , " very impressive moves today sir " , to which Gustin replied , " Thanks bro ! Fun stuff ! ! " 
 Another " major recurring role " debuts in this episode : Eric Bruskotter joins the cast as Cooter Menkins , " a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley , but finds he can ’ t take his eyes off the team ’ s gruff but big @-@ hearted coach . " Other recurring guest stars that appear in the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste ( Jones ) , the focus of Cooter 's eyes , former prom king Dave Karofsky ( Adler ) , exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan ( Damian McGinty ) , and Mike 's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang , Sr. ( Tamlyn Tomita and Sim ) . 
 This episode features six covers , five of which are from West Side Story , the stage musical being rehearsed and performed during the course of the episode : " A Boy Like That " and " I Have a Love " sung by Rivera and Michele , " Tonight " and " One Hand , One Heart " sung by Michele and Criss , and the number performed by the Sharks and Jets , " America " . The sixth cover , " Uptown Girl " , is sung by the Dalton Academy Warblers , with Mega on lead vocal .

 " The First Time " was first broadcast on November 8 , 2011 in the United States on Fox . It garnered a 3 @.@ 1 / 8 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic , and received 6 @.@ 91 million American viewers during its initial airing , the lowest number of viewers for a new episode in the third season . While the show 's viewership was down by over 7 % from the 7 @.@ 47 million for previous new episode , " Pot o ' Gold " , which was broadcast on November 1 , 2011 , the rating in the 18 – 49 demographic increased slightly from the 3 @.@ 0 / 8 rating / share received by that episode . 
 Viewership also decreased in other countries , and hit season lows in the United Kingdom and Australia as well .

 Like " Asian F " before it , screener copies of this episode were sent to a number of critics before the show aired . Michael Ausiello of TVLine called it " stellar " and a " standout episode " , and Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack wrote that it was " one of Glee 's best installments ever " and an " exceptional episode " . Both articles headlined the sexual theme of the episode , and made prominent mention of the fact that both couples would be " having sex for the first time " . 
 Prior to broadcast , Colfer anticipated that the episode 's sexual themes and content would prove controversial among television watchdog groups . He said , " I absolutely expect to hear from them , but I think it 's handled very sweetly and very emotionally . They 're expecting this big , raunchy , suggestive , brainwashing storyline when , really , it 's very sweet . " Before the episode aired , the conservative Parents Television Council called the show " reprehensible " and the Fox network reckless for " celebrating teen sex " . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 When the show aired , the reviewers were not as uniformly enthusiastic as the screeners . Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle called this " one of the better episodes in the show ’ s three @-@ season run , though not as good as ' Asian F ' " . Time 's James Poniewozik weighted them differently , calling " The First Time " the " best episode , overall , of Glee season three " . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal said it had " tasteful restraint , subtle playfulness and smoothly woven storylines " , and The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon said the episode " treats its characters realistically and send an important message " . Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a " good " grade of 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 . Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman wrote that it was " clinical and awkward " , and the " second flatline " episode in a row , though she complimented the four actors playing the two couples as " genuine and relatable " . John Kubicek of BuddyTV said that the episode infuriated him " on a grand scale " . Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that the episode was " far more nuanced , gentle @-@ hearted and romantic than it sounds — much more about love than about sex " , and a number of reviewers agreed , including AOLTV 's Crystal Bell . For Hankinson , however , " the teenage lust was played a touch too safe , a bit too romanticized " . 
 Canning said that Kurt and Blaine 's " attempts to get a little wild " , and " trying to grow up faster than they should " , were " the better parts of the episode as they felt the most realistic " . Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a " very faithful and honest scene " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club and Kubicek both had issues with Blaine 's characterization . The latter asserted that he " just behaves however the writers need him to behave in order for the scene to work " , while the former said that Blaine 's season three storyline " hasn ’ t been bad by any means , but it does feel like Darren Criss is playing someone who ’ s quite a bit different from the guy he was playing last season " . Bell was impressed by the way the characters ' relationship " inspires gay youth in a way that we haven 't seen on network television yet " and called them " amazing role models for all teens " , and Fallon said it was " remarkable " and a " milestone " that " the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple " . Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times characterized the scene with Kurt and Karofsky as " subtle " and " a home run " , and Entertainment Weekly 's Abby West called it a " perfect little nuanced scene " , while Ausiello said it was his " favorite scene of the episode " . 
 Poniewozik complimented the way " Monteith really sold Finn ’ s feeling of being helpless and overmatched " , and Canning said that Finn 's reaction to Rachel 's admission that she wanted to have sex because of the play was a " solid and true moment " . Rachel 's reasoning , however , came in for harsh criticism : Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was " neither believable nor even amusing " that she would try intercourse for such a reason , Bell called her a " dunce " , and VanDerWerff didn 't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn . The Star @-@ Ledger 's Vicki Hyman felt her decision to go all the way did not " ring quite true " , and Poniewozik called it " essentially pity sex " . Ausiello had a different view — " I would hardly call it pity sex " — and West said she was " going to choose to believe " that Rachel did not have her first time " just to make him feel better " . 
 Several of Artie 's scenes came in for criticism . The scene where he advised Rachel and Blaine to have sex was viewed by Poniewozik as " a forced conflict designed to drive the plot " and highly implausible for a number of reasons . Kubicek stated that " acting is about pretending , and if Rachel is really a great actress , she 'd be able to play the emotion without needing to have sex " . Bell and West made similar points . Rae Votta of Billboard commented on the " weird " plotline that involved Artie and Coach Beiste , for which Kubicek called Artie 's actions " inappropriate " . While Hyman " liked Artie coming into his own as a director " , she called his pre @-@ show jitters " jarring " , though she called his final speech " a nice moment " , and Benigno characterized it as " a kind of cheesy but actually appropriate speech " . Futterman felt it was a " valid and heartwarming point " , but " awkwardly slotted in " . Poniewozik credited Jones as Coach Beiste with " stunning work " , and Kubicek said Beiste 's " fragile lack of self @-@ esteem " was " believable and heartfelt " and that Jones was " brilliant " . 
 The scene where Mike is disowned by his father was characterized as " weird " and " tonally off " by VanDerWerff and " abrupt and unlikely " by Hyman . Kubicek was even more critical : " the most over @-@ the @-@ top , terribly cliched scene ever " . However , Votta gave " kudos to Glee for sticking with Mike 's story this season as he figures out his path " , and West wrote that Shum " played it well " , while Canning said it and the later scene with his mother " were mighty effective , if a bit stereotypical " . Hyman and West also approved of the latter scene . 
 Sue 's absence from the episode was applauded by Bell , who called it " exactly what the show needed " . Michael Slezak of TVLine said " the show might be at its best " when Sue and Will " are relegated to <unk> status " , and Poniewozik " did not miss them one bit " . The new Warbler , Sebastian , was said to be " instantly loathsome " by Benigno . His scene with Blaine that was blended with Santana and Rachel singing " A Boy Like That " was variously described as " <unk> intercut " by Hyman , " heavy @-@ handed " by Votta , and bringing " the dangers of teen love " to " ferocious life " by Slezak . 
 Of the ending , Futterman noted that " the final scenes actually wound up truthful to these characters " , and Kevin Sullivan of MTV wrote that " when the two separate moments finally did arrive at the end of the episode , it felt like the natural end and was quite touching " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 Supervising Music Editor David Klotz received a Best Sound Editing : Short Form Musical in Television nomination at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards for his work on the episode . The musical performances were generally well received by reviewers , though a few songs came in for some criticism . One that was given near @-@ universal plaudits was " America " , from Hankinson 's " awesome " to Hyman 's " killer rendition " to VanDerWerff 's " one of the best production numbers the show has ever done " . The most frequent caveat seemed to be the accents used by the singers ; Flandez thought they " could 've used a little finesse " , and Futterman characterized them as " questionable " , though both complimented the performance 's dance moves . Santana 's performance in the number and the show came in for particular comment : The Hollywood Reporter 's Lesley Goldberg called her " completely captivating as Anita " , and Rae Votta of Billboard mentioned her " two stand out vocal performances " . 
 Of the four other songs from West Side Story , " Tonight " was given an " A − " and called " pretty wonderful " by Benigno , while Futterman thought it " very sweet , yet very vanilla " and West gave it a " B " and noted it " was lacking something " . Slezak gave the musical 's songs a collective grade of " A " . Although others praised Santana as Anita , Futterman was not impressed with her rendition of " A Boy Like That " and wrote , " Santana 's part of the song is not nearly angry or urgent enough and sounds like a watered @-@ down version of what Santana is capable of " . West gave the song a " B + " , and stated that the song was " stellar for Rachel 's fire " . Futterman singled out Rachel for " I Have a Love " : " Rachel delivers the best vocals of the night with her powerful , yet incredibly high soprano that sounds effortless despite being out of her normal range . " Benigno and West both gave " One Hand , One Heart " an " A " ; the former called it " wonderful " , although he railed about the prevalence of show tunes in the episode , and the latter wrote , " This was the perfect soundtrack to the trio of first times .

 The one song that did not come from the musical was " Uptown Girl " . Votta said the performance by the Dalton Academy Warblers , with " leads by minor Warbler Nick , played by Curt Mega " , was " refreshing and nostalgic all at once , a bright pop musical spot in an episode devoted to Broadway and a reminder of the dominant Dalton presence last season " . Bell wrote that the " Warblers were totally born to sing ' Uptown Girl ' " , and Goldberg called it " among the young season ’ s best " performances . Flandez said it was a " terrific performance " , though Benigno was more restrained , and gave it a " B + " despite there being " less innovation " in the a cappella " gimmick " , and noted that " the barbershop @-@ quartet finish is actually pretty good " . Slezak , however , said the song was the only musical " weak link " in the episode , and Canning called it " too polished " . Futterman thought the lead singers were " grating and over @-@ the @-@ top " , and Poniewozik characterized the performance as " unfortunate " .

 The Alpine chough / ˈtʃʌf / , or yellow @-@ billed chough , ( Pyrrhocorax graculus ) is a bird in the crow family , one of only two species in the genus Pyrrhocorax . Its two subspecies breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal , and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird . The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take @-@ up and reduce water loss . 
 This bird has glossy black plumage , a yellow beak , red legs , and distinctive calls . It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers . The Alpine chough pairs for life and displays fidelity to its breeding site , which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face . It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown @-@ blotched whitish eggs . It feeds , usually in flocks , on short grazed grassland , taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter ; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food . 
 Although it is subject to predation and parasitism , and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines , this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally . Climate change may present a long @-@ term threat , by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Alpine chough was first described as Corvus graculus by Linnaeus in the Systema Naturae in 1766 . It was moved to its current genus , Pyrrhocorax , by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 Ornithologia Britannica , along with the only other member of the genus , the red @-@ billed chough , P. pyrrhocorax . The closest relatives of the choughs were formerly thought to be the typical crows , Corvus , especially the jackdaws in the subgenus Coloeus , but DNA and cytochrome b analysis shows that the genus Pyrrhocorax , along with the ratchet @-@ tailed <unk> ( genus <unk> ) , diverged early from the rest of the Corvidae . 
 The genus name is derived from Greek <unk> ( purrhos ) , " flame @-@ coloured " , and κόραξ ( korax ) , " raven " . The species epithet graculus is Latin for a jackdaw . The current binomial name of the Alpine chough was formerly sometimes applied to the red @-@ billed chough . The English word " chough " was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw , Corvus monedula , based on its call . The red @-@ billed chough , formerly particularly common in Cornwall and known initially as the " Cornish chough " , eventually became just " chough " , the name transferring from one genus to another . 
 The Alpine chough has two extant subspecies . 
 P. g. graculus , the nominate subspecies in Europe , north Africa , Turkey , the Caucasus and northern Iran . 
 P. g. digitatus , described by the German naturalists Wilhelm <unk> and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg as P. alpinus var. digitatus in 1833 , is larger and has stronger feet than the nominate race . It breeds in the rest of the depicted Asian range , mainly in the Himalayas . 
 Moravian palaeontologist Ferdinand Stoliczka separated the Himalayan population as a third subspecies , P. g. <unk> , but this has not been widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus . A Pleistocene form from Europe was similar to the extant subspecies , and is sometimes categorised as P. g. vetus . 
 The Australian white @-@ winged chough , Corcorax melanorhamphos , despite its similar bill shape and black plumage , is only distantly related to the true choughs . 
 = = Description = = 
 The adult of the nominate subspecies of the Alpine chough has glossy black plumage , a short yellow bill , dark brown irises , and red legs . It is slightly smaller than red @-@ billed chough , at 37 – 39 centimetres ( 14 @.@ 6 – 15 @.@ 3 in ) length with a 12 – 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) tail and a 75 – 85 cm ( 30 – 33 in ) wingspan , but has a proportionally longer tail and shorter wings than its relative . It has a similar buoyant and easy flight . The sexes are identical in appearance although the male averages slightly larger than the female . The juvenile is duller than the adult with a dull yellow bill and brownish legs . The Alpine chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species ; although the jackdaw and red @-@ billed chough share its range , the jackdaw is smaller and has <unk> grey plumage , and the red @-@ billed chough has a long red bill . 
 The subspecies P. g. digitatus averages slightly larger than the nominate form , weighing 191 – 244 grams ( 6 @.@ 8 – 8 @.@ 7 oz ) against 188 – 252 g ( 6 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 0 oz ) for P. g. graculus , and it has stronger feet . This is in accordance with Bergmann 's rule , which predicts that the largest birds should be found higher elevations or in colder and more arid regions . The extremities of the body , the bill and tarsus , were longer in warmer areas , in line with Allen 's rule . Temperature seemed to be the most important cause of body variation in the Alpine chough . 
 The flight of the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats . Its high manoeuvrability is accomplished by fanning the tail , folding its wings , and soaring in the <unk> at cliff faces . Even in flight , it can be distinguished from the red @-@ billed chough by its less rectangular wings , and longer , less square @-@ ended tail . 
 The rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls of the Alpine chough are quite different from the more typically crow @-@ like chee @-@ ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red @-@ billed chough . It also has a rolling churr alarm call , and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds . In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency , being higher @-@ pitched in smaller @-@ bodied populations . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Alpine Chough breeds in mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the Alps across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China . There are also populations in Morocco , Corsica and Crete . It is a non @-@ migratory resident throughout its range , although Moroccan birds have established a small colony near Málaga in southern Spain , and wanderers have reached Czechoslovakia , Gibraltar , Hungary and Cyprus . 
 This is a high @-@ altitude species normally breeding between 1 @,@ 260 – 2 @,@ 880 metres ( 4 @,@ 130 – 9 @,@ 450 ft ) in Europe , 2 @,@ 880 – 3 @,@ 900 m ( 9 @,@ 450 – 12 @,@ 800 ft ) in Morocco , and 3 @,@ 500 – 5 @,@ 000 m ( 11 @,@ 500 – 16 @,@ 400 ft ) in the Himalayas . It has nested at 6 @,@ 500 m ( 21 @,@ 300 ft ) , higher than any other bird species , even surpassing the Red @-@ billed chough which has a diet less well adapted to the highest altitudes . It has been observed following mountaineers ascending Mount Everest at an altitude of 8 @,@ 200 m ( 26 @,@ 900 ft ) . It usually nests in cavities and fissures on inaccessible rock faces , although locally it will use holes between rocks in fields , and forages in open habitats such as alpine meadows and scree slopes to the tree line or lower , and in winter will often congregate around human settlements , ski resorts , hotels and other tourist facilities . Its penchant for waiting by hotel windows for food is popular with tourists , but less so with hotel owners . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Alpine chough is socially monogamous , showing high partner fidelity in summer and winter and from year to year . Nesting typically starts in early May , and is non @-@ colonial , although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity . The bulky nests are composed of roots , sticks and plant stems lined with grass , fine <unk> or hair , and may be constructed on ledges , in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face , or in an abandoned building . The clutch is 3 – 5 glossy whitish eggs , averaging 33 @.@ 9 by 24 @.@ 9 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 33 in × 0 @.@ 98 in ) in size , which are tinged with buff , cream or light @-@ green and marked with small brown blotches ; they are incubated by the female for 14 – 21 days before hatching . The chicks hatch with a dense covering of natal down , in contrast to those of the red @-@ billed chough which are almost naked , and fledge in a further 29 – 31 days from hatching . The young birds are fed by both parents , and may also be fed by other adults when they have fledged and joined the flock . Breeding is possible in the high mountains because chough eggs have relatively fewer pores than those of lowland species , and lose less water by evaporation at low atmospheric pressure . The embryos of bird species that breed at high altitude also have haemoglobin with a genetically determined high affinity for oxygen . 
 In the western Italian Alps , the Alpine chough nests in a greater variety of sites than red @-@ billed chough , using natural cliffs , pot @-@ holes and abandoned buildings , whereas the red @-@ billed uses only natural cliffs ( although it nests in old buildings elsewhere ) . The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative , although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar . The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour . 
 A study of three different European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3 @.@ 6 eggs , producing 2 @.@ 6 chicks , of which 1 @.@ 9 fledged . Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92 % , with no significant difference detected between males and females . Survival of first @-@ year birds was , at 77 % , lower than that of adults . The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 In the summer , the Alpine chough feeds mainly on invertebrates collected from pasture , such as beetles ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> morio have been recorded from pellets ) , snails , grasshoppers , caterpillars and fly larvae . The diet in autumn , winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit , including berries such as the European Hackberry ( <unk> australis ) and Sea @-@ buckthorn ( <unk> <unk> ) , rose hips , and domesticated crops such as apples , grapes and pears where available . It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus <unk> <unk> , including the pistils , perhaps as a source of carotenoids . The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions , including ski resorts , refuse dumps and picnic areas . Where additional food is available , winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds . The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability , such as refuse dumps . Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures , concealing the cache with a few pebbles . 
 This bird always forages in groups , which are larger in winter than summer , and have constant composition in each season . Where food resources are restricted , adults dominate young birds , and males outrank females . Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year , depending on climatic factors , food availability and food quality . During the breeding season , birds remain above the tree line , although they may use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas . 
 Movement to lower levels begins after the first snowfalls , and feeding by day is mainly in or near valley bottoms when the snow cover deepens , although the birds return to the mountains to roost . In March and April the choughs frequent villages at valley tops or forage in snow @-@ free patches prior to their return to the high meadows . Feeding trips may cover 20 km ( 12 mi ) distance and 1 @,@ 600 m ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) in altitude . In the Alps , the development of skiing above 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) has enabled more birds to remain at high levels in winter . 
 Where their ranges overlap , the two chough species may feed together in the summer , although there is only limited competition for food . An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red @-@ billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs dug from the ground , whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips . In June , red @-@ billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae . Later in the summer , the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers , while the red @-@ billed chough added cranefly pupae , fly larvae and beetles to its diet . In the eastern Himalayas in November , Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries , differing ecologically from the red @-@ billed choughs in the same region and at the same time of year , which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages . 
 = = = Natural threats = = = 
 Predators of the choughs include the peregrine falcon , golden eagle and Eurasian eagle @-@ owl , while the common raven will take nestlings . Alpine choughs have been observed diving at a Tibetan red fox . It seems likely that this " mobbing " behaviour may be play activity to give practice for when genuine defensive measures may be needed to protect eggs or young . 
 The Alpine chough is a host of the widespread bird flea Ceratophyllus <unk> , two specialist chough fleas Frontopsylla frontalis and F. laetus , a cestode <unk> <unk> , and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia , Menacanthus and Philopterus . 
 = = Status = = 
 The Alpine chough has an extensive though sometimes fragmented range , estimated at 1 – 10 million square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 8 million sq mi ) , and a large population , including an estimated 260 @,@ 000 to 620 @,@ 000 individuals in Europe . The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2 @,@ 500 birds . Over its range as a whole , the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List ( i.e. , declining more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) , and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern . 
 At the greatest extent of the last glacial period around 18 @,@ 000 years ago , southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats , and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy , well outside its current range . Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently , only to disappear within the last couple of centuries . In the Polish Tatra Mountains , where a population had survived since the glacial period , it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century . In Bulgaria , the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period , and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller . The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased . Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows . Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists , but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced , such as Brittany , England , south @-@ west Portugal and mainland Scotland . 
 Choughs can be locally threatened by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils , heavy rain , shooting and other human disturbances , but a longer @-@ term threat comes from global warming , which would cause the species ' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher , more restricted areas , or locally to disappear entirely . Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands . The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red @-@ billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity . 
 = British contribution to the Manhattan Project = 
 Britain contributed to the Manhattan Project by helping initiate the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II , and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise . Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium , scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated , in March 1940 , that the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium @-@ 235 was as little as 1 to 10 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 2 to 22 @.@ 0 lb ) , and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite . The Frisch – Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create its own atomic bomb project , known as Tube Alloys . Mark Oliphant , an Australian physicist working in Britain , was instrumental in making the British results known in the United States , and this encouraged the expansion of the American Manhattan Project . Initially the British project was larger and more advanced , but after the United States entered the war , the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart . The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions , and participate in the American project . 
 In August 1943 , the prime minister , Winston Churchill , and President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Quebec Agreement , which provided for cooperation between the two countries . The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate the efforts of the United States , the United Kingdom and Canada . A British Mission led by Wallace Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology in New York . Britain also produced the powdered nickel required by the gaseous diffusion process . Another mission , led by Oliphant who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , assisted with the electromagnetic separation process . As head of the British Mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory , James Chadwick led a multinational team of distinguished scientists that included Sir Geoffrey Taylor , James Tuck , Niels Bohr , Peierls , Frisch , and Klaus Fuchs , who was later revealed to be a Soviet atomic spy . Four members of the British Mission became group leaders at Los Alamos . William Penney observed the bombing of Nagasaki and participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 . 
 Cooperation ended with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 , known as the McMahon Act , and Ernest Titterton , the last British government employee , left Los Alamos on 12 April 1947 . Britain then proceeded with its own nuclear weapons programme , and became the third country to test an independently developed nuclear weapon in October 1952 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The 1938 discovery of nuclear fission in uranium , by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn , raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created . Refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries were particularly alarmed by the notion of a German nuclear weapon project . In the United States , three of them , Leo Szilard , Eugene Wigner and Albert Einstein , were moved to write the Einstein – Szilárd letter to United States President Roosevelt warning of the danger . This led to the President creating the Briggs Advisory Committee on Uranium . In Britain , Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg were sufficiently concerned to take up the matter . Their concerns reached the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence , Major General Hastings Ismay , who consulted with Sir Henry Tizard . Like many scientists , Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed , reckoning the odds against success at 100 @,@ 000 to 1 . 
 Even at such long odds , the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously . Thomson , at Imperial College London , and Mark Oliphant , an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham , were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium . By February 1940 , Thomson 's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium , and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing . But at Birmingham , Oliphant 's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion . Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists , Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch , who could not work on the University 's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance . They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium @-@ 235 , the only fissile isotope found in significant quantity in nature , and found that instead of tons , as everyone had assumed , as little as 1 to 10 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 2 to 22 @.@ 0 lb ) would suffice , which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite . 
 Oliphant took the Frisch – Peierls memorandum to Tizard , and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further . It directed an intensive research effort , and in July 1941 , produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible , but could be produced before the war ended , perhaps in as little as two years . The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency , although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain . A new directorate known as Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort . Sir John Anderson , the Lord President of the Council , became the minister responsible , and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries ( ICI ) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys . 
 = = Early Anglo @-@ American cooperation = = 
 In July 1940 , Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research , and the Tizard Mission 's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments . He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British , and not as far advanced . As part of the scientific exchange , the Maud Committee 's findings were conveyed to the United States . Oliphant , one of the Maud Committee 's members , flew to the United States in late August 1941 , and discovered that vital information had not reached key American physicists . He met the Uranium Committee , and visited Berkeley , California , where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence , who was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory . Lawrence in turn spoke to James B. Conant , Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram . Oliphant 's mission was a success ; key American physicists became aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb . Armed with British data , Vannevar Bush , the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , briefed Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace in a meeting at the White House on 9 October 1941 . 
 The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information , but did not initially combine their efforts . British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project . In November 1941 , Frederick L. Hovde , the head of the London liaison office of OSRD , raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell , who demurred , ostensibly over concerns about American security . Ironically , it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union . 
 Yet the United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States , and despite its early and promising start , Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it . Britain was spending around £ 430 @,@ 000 per year on research and development , and Metropolitan @-@ Vickers was building gaseous diffusion units for uranium enrichment worth £ 150 @,@ 000 ; but the Manhattan Project was spending £ 8 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 on research and development , and had let construction contracts worth £ 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 at the fixed wartime rate of four dollars to the pound . On 30 July 1942 , Anderson advised the prime minister , Winston Churchill , that : " We must face the fact that ... [ our ] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that , unless we capitalise it quickly , we shall be outstripped . We now have a real contribution to make to a ' merger . ' Soon we shall have little or none . " 
 By then , the positions of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941 . The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war , and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942 , wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar . American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help . The Secretary of War , Henry L. Stimson , felt that since the United States was doing " ninety percent of the work " on the bomb , it would be " better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help " . In December 1942 , Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war , even if doing so slowed down the American project . In retaliation , the British stopped sending information and scientists to America , and the Americans then stopped all information sharing . 
 The British considered how they would produce a bomb without American help . A gaseous diffusion plant to produce 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of weapons @-@ grade uranium per day was estimated to cost up to £ 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in research and development , and anything up to £ 50 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to build in wartime Britain . A nuclear reactor to produce 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada . It would take up to five years to build and cost £ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water for the reactor costing between £ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 and £ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , and for producing uranium metal £ 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . The project would need overwhelming priority , as it was estimated to require 20 @,@ 000 workers , many of them highly skilled , 500 @,@ 000 tons of steel , and 500 @,@ 000 kW of electricity . Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable , and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe . The unanimous response was that before embarking on this , another effort should be made to obtain American cooperation . 
 = = Cooperation resumes = = 
 By March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project . In particular , the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from assistance from James Chadwick , the discoverer of the neutron , and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets . Bush , Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer , and Kellogg still wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant . 
 Churchill took up the matter with Roosevelt at the Washington Conference on 25 May 1943 , and Churchill thought that Roosevelt gave the reassurances he sought ; but there was no follow @-@ up . Bush , Stimson and William Bundy met Churchill , Cherwell and Anderson at 10 Downing Street in London . None of them were aware that Roosevelt had already made his decision , writing to Bush on 20 July 1943 with instructions to " renew , in an inclusive manner , the full exchange with the British Government regarding Tube Alloys . " 
 Stimson , who had just finished a series of arguments with the British about the need for an invasion of France , was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything , and spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post @-@ war relations between the two countries . For his part , Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology . The reason for British concern about the post @-@ war cooperation , Cherwell explained , was not commercial concerns , but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war . Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange , which Churchill re @-@ worded " in more majestic language " . News arrived in London of Roosevelt 's decision on 27 July , and Anderson was dispatched to Washington with the draft agreement . Churchill and Roosevelt signed what became known as the Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943 . 
 The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States , United Kingdom and Canada . Stimson , Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee , Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members , and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member . Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell , who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States , Lord Halifax , in early 1945 . Dill died in Washington , D.C. , in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson . 
 Even before the Quebec Agreement was signed , Akers had already cabled London with instructions that Chadwick , Peierls , Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America . They arrived on 19 August , the day it was signed , expecting to be able to talk to American scientists , but were unable to do so . Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement . Over the next two years , the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times . 
 The first occasion was on 8 September 1943 , on the afternoon after Stimson discovered that he was the chairman . The first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by Major General Wilhelm D. Styer . Because the Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background , Llewellin nominated Chadwick , whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project . The other members were Richard C. Tolman , who was Groves 's scientific adviser , and C. J. Mackenzie , the president of the Canadian National Research Council . It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous . The Technical Subcommittee held its first meeting on 10 September , but negotiations dragged on . The Combined Policy Committee ratified the proposals in December 1943 , by which time several British scientists had already commenced working on the Manhattan Project in the United States . 
 There remained the issue of cooperation between the Manhattan 's Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory . At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944 , Chadwick pressed for resources to build a nuclear reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories . Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project , but the United States had to supply the heavy water . At that time , the United States controlled , by a supply contract , the only major production site on the continent , that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail , British Columbia . Given that it was unlikely to have any impact on the war , Conant in particular was cool about the proposal , but heavy water reactors were of great interest . Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required , but with certain restrictions . The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge , but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site ; nor would they be given any information about plutonium . This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944 . The Canadian ZEEP ( Zero Energy Experimental Pile ) reactor went critical on 5 September 1945 . 
 Chadwick supported British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent , abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war . With Churchill 's backing , he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured . While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase , these scientists were still in great demand , and it fell to Anderson , Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton , the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research , which was responsible for Tube Alloys , to prise them away from the wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged . 
 The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post @-@ war period . Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent . In June 1945 , Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee . 
 = = Gaseous diffusion project = = 
 Tube Alloys made its greatest advances in gaseous diffusion technology , and Chadwick had originally hoped that the pilot plant at least would be built in Britain . Gaseous diffusion technology was devised by Simon and three expatriates , Nicholas Kurti from Hungary , Heinrich Kuhn from Germany , and Henry Arms from the United States , at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940 . The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment , two two @-@ stage models and two ten @-@ stage models , was manufactured by Metropolitan @-@ Vickers at a cost of £ 150 @,@ 000 for the four units . Two single @-@ stage machines were later added . Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single @-@ stage machine did not commence until June 1943 , and with the two @-@ stage machine until August 1943 . The two ten @-@ stage machines were delivered in August and November 1943 , but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events . 
 The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to meet with representatives of Kellex , who were designing and building K @-@ 25 , the American gaseous diffusion plant , Union Carbide and Carbon , who would operate it , and Harold Urey 's Substitute Alloy Materials ( SAM ) Laboratories at Columbia University , the Manhattan Project 's centre tasked with research and development of the process . The year 's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly . The corporations were committed to tight schedules , and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes . Nor would it be possible to build a second plant . Nonetheless , the Americans were still eager for British assistance , and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project . In the meantime , Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex . 
 The British mission consisting of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943 . This was a critical time . Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris @-@ Adler barrier . Nickel powder and electro @-@ deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories . A decision had to be made whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex . Up to this point , both were under development . The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900 . The British experts conducted a thorough review , and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior , but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time . Kellex 's technical director , Percival C. Keith , disagreed , arguing that his company could get it ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris @-@ Adler barrier . Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944 . 
 The United States Army assumed responsibility for procuring sufficient quantities of the right type of powdered nickel . In this , the British were able to help . The only company that manufactured it was the Mond Nickel Company at Clydach in Wales . By the end of June 1945 , it had supplied the Manhattan Project with 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) of nickel powder , paid for by the British government and supplied to the United States under Reverse Lend @-@ Lease . 
 The Americans planned to have the K @-@ 25 plant in full production by June or July 1945 . Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working , the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic , and felt that , barring a miracle , it would be unlikely to reach that point before the end of 1946 . This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation , and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944 . Armed with the British Mission 's report , Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K @-@ 25 's enrichment target ; the output of K @-@ 25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being fed into the electromagnetic plant . Despite the British Mission 's pessimistic forecasts , K @-@ 25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945 . 
 After the rest of the mission departed , Peierls , Kurti and Fuchs remained in New York , where they worked with Kellex . They were joined there by Tony Skyrme and Frank Kearton , who arrived in March 1944 . Kurti returned to England in April 1944 and Kearton in September . Peierls moved on to the Los Alamos Laboratory in February 1944 ; Skyrme followed in July , and Fuchs in August .

 On 26 May 1943 , Oliphant wrote to Appleton to say that he had been considering the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation , and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence 's , one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency , and make it more practical to use the process in Britain . His proposal was reviewed by Akers , Chadwick , Peierls and Simon , who agreed that it was sound . While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method , there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process , taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process , and enriching it to pure uranium @-@ 235 . Accordingly , Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys , conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham . 
 Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington , D.C. , on 18 September 1943 , and they attempted to persuade him to join the Los Alamos Laboratory , but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project . Accordingly , the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley , and later move on to Los Alamos . Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs , and that the American one was frozen , but Lawrence , who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942 , was eager for Oliphant 's assistance . Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist , Harrie Massey , who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines , along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke , who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron . This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B @-@ 24 Liberator bomber in November 1943 . Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills , particularly physicists , chemists and engineers . He prevailed on Sir David Rivett , the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia , to release Eric Burhop to work on the project . His requests for personnel were met , and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35 , two of whom , Robin Williams and George Page , were New Zealanders . 
 Members of the British mission occupied several key positions in the electromagnetic project . Oliphant became Lawrence 's de facto deputy , and was in charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent . His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence 's , and his involvement went beyond scientific problems , extending to policy questions such as whether to expand the electromagnetic plant , although in this he was unsuccessful . The British chemists made important contributions , particularly Harry <unk> and Philip Baxter , a chemist who had been research manager at ICI , was sent to the Manhattan Project 's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry , and became personal assistant to the general manager . His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves . The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project , both in Berkeley and at the Y @-@ 12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge . While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks , most stayed until the end of the war . Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945 , and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey .

 When cooperation resumed in September 1943 , Groves and Oppenheimer revealed the existence of the Los Alamos Laboratory to Chadwick , Peierls and Oliphant . Oppenheimer wanted all three to proceed to Los Alamos as soon as possible , but it was decided that Oliphant would go to Berkeley to work on the electromagnetic process and Peierls would go to New York to work on the gaseous diffusion process . The task then fell to Chadwick . The original idea , favoured by Groves , was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick , who would farm out work to them . This was soon discarded in favour of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory . They worked in most of its divisions , only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy . 
 First to arrive was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton and his wife Peggy , who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943 . At Los Alamos Frisch continued his work on critical mass studies , for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators , X @-@ ray generators , timers and firing circuits . Peggy Titterton , a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant , was one of the few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role . Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944 , but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington , D.C. 
 When Oppenheimer appointed Hans Bethe as the head of the laboratory 's prestigious Theoretical ( T ) Division , he offended Edward Teller , who was given his own group , tasked with investigating Teller 's " Super " bomb , and eventually assigned to Enrico Fermi 's F Division . Oppenheimer then wrote to Groves requesting that Peierls be sent to take Teller 's place in T Division . Peierls arrived from New York on 8 February 1944 , and subsequently succeeded Chadwick as head of the British Mission at Los Alamos . Egon Bretscher worked in Teller 's Super group , as did Anthony French , who later recalled that " never at any time did I have anything to do with the fission bomb once I went to Los Alamos . " Four members of the British Mission became group leaders : Bretscher ( Super Experimentation ) , Frisch ( Critical Assemblies and Nuclear Specifications ) , Peierls ( Implosion Hydrodynamics ) and George Placzek ( Composite Weapon ) . 
 Niels Bohr and his son Aage , a physicist who acted as his father 's assistant , arrived on 30 December on the first of several visits as a consultant . Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden . A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys . In America , he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos , where he found many of his former students . Bohr acted as a critic , a facilitator and a role model for younger scientists . He arrived at a critical time , and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation . He played an important role in the development of the uranium tamper , and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator . His presence boosted morale , and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army . 
 Nuclear physicists knew about fission , but not the hydrodynamics of conventional explosions . As a result , there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions in this area of physics . First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing . In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying to wrestle with the idea of the implosion issue . Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place . Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer . This work was crucial to the success of the plutonium atomic bomb : Italian @-@ American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck 's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945 . The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor , an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue . Taylor 's presence was desired so much at Los Alamos , Chadwick informed London , " that anything short of kidnapping would be justified " . He was sent , and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh – Taylor instability . The acute need for scientists with an understanding of explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty , and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory . Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses . Bethe considered Fuchs " one of the most valuable men in my division " and " one of the best theoretical physicists we had . " 
 William Penney worked on means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion , and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan . He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing , and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant . Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire , sent by Wilson as a British representative , he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big Stink . He also formed part of the Manhattan Project 's post @-@ war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs . 
 Bethe declared that : 
 For the work of the theoretical division of the Los Alamos Project during the war the collaboration of the British Mission was absolutely essential ... It is very difficult to say what would have happened under different conditions . However , at least , the work of the Theoretical Division would have been very much more difficult and very much less effective without the members of the British Mission , and it is not unlikely that our final weapon would have been considerably less efficient in this case . 
 From December 1945 on , members of the British Mission began returning home . Peierls left in January 1946 . At the request of Norris Bradbury , who had replaced Oppenheimer as laboratory director , Fuchs remained until 15 June 1946 . Eight British scientists , three from Los Alamos and five from the United Kingdom , participated in Operation Crossroads , the nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific . With the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 , known as the McMahon Act , all British government employees had to leave . Titterton was granted a special dispensation , and remained until 12 April 1947 . The British Mission ended when he departed . Carson Mark remained , as he was a Canadian government employee . He remained at Los Alamos , becoming head of its Theoretical Division in 1947 , a position he held until he retired in 1973 . He became a United States citizen in the 1950s .

 The Combined Development Trust was proposed by the Combined Policy Committee on 17 February 1944 . The declaration of trust was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 13 June 1944 . The trustees were approved at the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944 . The United States trustees were Groves , who was elected chairman , geologist Charles K. Leith , and George L. Harrison . The British trustees were Sir Charles Hambro , the head of the British Raw Materials Mission in Washington , D.C. , and Frank Lee from HM Treasury . Canada was represented by George C. Bateman , a deputy minister and member of the Canadian Combined Resources Board . Each of the three governments had its own raw materials resources staff , and the Combined Development Trust was a means of coordinating their efforts . 
 The role of the Combined Development Trust was to purchase or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project , and to avoid competition between the three . Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued , but was anxious to secure adequate supplies for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended . Half the funding was to come from the United States and half from Britain and Canada . The initial $ 12 @.@ 5 million was transferred to Groves from an account in the office of the United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau , Jr . , that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight . By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947 , he had deposited $ 37 @.@ 5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust . Payments were then made from this account . 
 Britain took the lead in securing control of the world 's major source of ore in the Belgian Congo . They also negotiated deals with Swedish companies to acquire ore from there . Oliphant had approached the Australian High Commissioner in London , Sir Stanley Bruce , in August 1943 about uranium supplies from Australia , and Anderson made a direct request to the prime minister of Australia , John Curtin , during the latter 's visit to Britain in May 1944 to initiate mineral exploration in Australia in places where uranium deposits were believed to exist . As well as uranium , the Combined Development Trust secured supplies of thorium from Brazil , Netherlands East Indies , Sweden and Portugal . At the time uranium was believed to be a rare mineral , and the more abundant thorium was seen as a possible alternative , as it could be irradiated to produce uranium @-@ 233 , another isotope of uranium suitable for making atomic bombs . 
 = = Intelligence = = 
 In December 1943 , Groves sent Robert R. Furman to Britain to establish a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project to coordinate scientific intelligence with the British government . Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District 's security activities , Captain Horace K. Calvert , to head the London Liaison Office with the title of Assistant Military Attaché . He worked in cooperation with Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh , the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6 , and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys . An Anglo @-@ American intelligence committee was formed by Groves and Anderson in November 1944 , consisting of Perrin , Welsh , Calvert , Furman and R. V. Jones . 
 At the urging of Groves and Furman , the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct intelligence in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project . The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission , but in the end agreed to participate in the Alsos Mission as a junior partner . In June 1945 , Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans , and Jones arranged for them to be moved to Farm Hall , a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) . The house was bugged , and the conversations of the scientists were recorded .

 Groves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists ' contributions to the Manhattan Project , but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them . He considered British assistance " helpful but not vital " , but at the same time , acknowledged that " without active and continuing British interest , there probably would have been no atomic bomb to drop on Hiroshima . " He considered Britain 's key contributions to have been encouragement and support at the intergovernmental level , scientific aid , the production of powdered nickel in Wales , and preliminary studies and laboratory work . 
 Cooperation did not long survive the war . Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945 , and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations . In fact , it was physically lost . When Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June , the American copy could not be found . The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945 . Even then , Groves questioned the document 's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown , Jr . , Roosevelt 's naval aide , apparently <unk> by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was , who thought it had something to do with naval guns . 
 Harry S. Truman , who had succeeded Roosevelt on the latter 's death , Clement Attlee , who had replaced Churchill as prime minister in July 1945 , Anderson and United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes conferred while on a boat cruise on the Potomac River , and agreed to revise the Quebec Agreement . On 15 November 1945 , Groves , Robert P. Patterson and George L. Harrison met a British delegation consisting of Anderson , Wilson , Malcolm MacDonald , Roger Makins and Denis Rickett to draw up a communiqué . They agreed to retain the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust . The Quebec Agreement 's requirement for " mutual consent " before using nuclear weapons was replaced with one for " prior consultation " , and there was to be " full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy " , but in the longer Memorandum of Intention , signed by Groves and Anderson , this was only " in the field of basic scientific research " . Patterson took the communiqué to the White House , where Truman and Attlee signed it on 16 November 1945 . 
 The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration , and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee . Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing , constructing and operating an atomic energy plant . Attlee 's response on 6 June 1946 " did not mince words nor conceal his displeasure behind the nuances of diplomatic language . " At issue was not just technical cooperation , which was fast disappearing , but the allocation of uranium ore . During the war this was of little concern , as Britain had not needed any ore , so all the production of the Congo mines and all the ore seized by the Alsos Mission had gone to the United States , but now it was also required by the British atomic project . Chadwick and Groves reached an agreement by which ore would be shared equally . 
 The McMahon Act , which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946 , and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947 , ended technical cooperation . Its control of " restricted data " prevented the United States ' allies from receiving any information . The remaining scientists were denied access to papers that they had written just days before . The terms of the Quebec Agreement remained secret , but senior members of Congress were horrified when they discovered that it gave the British a veto over the use of nuclear weapons . The McMahon Act fuelled resentment from British scientists and officials alike , and led directly to the British decision in January 1947 to develop its own nuclear weapons . In January 1948 , Bush , James Fisk , Cockcroft and Mackenzie concluded an agreement known as the modus vivendi , that allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States , Britain and Canada . 
 As the Cold War set in , enthusiasm in the United States for an alliance with Britain cooled as well . A September 1949 poll found that 72 per cent of Americans agreed that the United States should not " share our atomic energy secrets with England " . The reputation of the British Mission to Los Alamos was tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy . It damaged the relationship between the United States and Britain , and provided ammunition for Congressional opponents of cooperation like Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper . 
 British wartime participation in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was important to the subsequent success in October 1952 of the United Kingdom 's nuclear weapons programme , although it was not without important gaps , such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy . The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958 , and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US – UK Mutual Defence Agreement .

The building is located at 200 West Dallas Avenue , and functions as the meeting place for the county government . The building also houses all of the county records . The county 's first courthouse was built in 1873 , in Cooper . A courthouse was built to replace the original in 1898 . After the Great Depression , the new courthouse was built by the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) , helping the community to grow . The building has remained virtually unchanged since .

 During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868 , the delegates paid attention to northeastern portion of the state , especially the increasing need for the creation of new counties in the region . At the time , there were a total of twenty counties located in the region , compared to twenty @-@ three presently . The convention originally met to write a new state constitution , but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues . During the convention , the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals for the creation of three new counties in the region . They were to be called Delta , Webster , and Richland . Delta County was established on July 29 , 1870 , by the Twelfth State Legislature . The proposals for Webster and Richland counties , however , were not passed . 
 = = = Creation and development = = = 
 After Delta County was established , it held its first election on October 6 , 1870 . The first five members of the county commissioners board were chosen in the election . Cooper was established as the county seat for the newly formed county . However , a courthouse was not established for the county government until 1873 . Constructed in the county seat , the courthouse was built in the town square . Confederate and Union veterans of the Civil War planted pecan trees on the square around the courthouse , to symbolize the end of conflict . The building , which was two stories tall , was designed by architects R.C. Andrews and E. Blackwell , for a price of approximately $ 6000 ( equivalent to $ 118 @,@ 500 in 2016 ) . 
 In 1898 , the newly incorporated city of Cooper passed a $ 40 @,@ 000 bond ( equivalent to $ 1 @,@ 137 @,@ 800 in 2016 ) to begin construction of a new , three @-@ story brick courthouse . While construction of the new courthouse was underway , the original courthouse was destroyed in a fire . Construction of the second courthouse was completed in 1900 . 
 Delta County 's economy plummeted in 1926 when the local cotton crop failed . The county 's economy was slow to recover , finally reaching a steady level in the late 1930s . In 1940 , the Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) began working on improving several items in Delta County . Among these projects was the demolition of the existing courthouse and the construction of a new one . The new courthouse was built at a cost of $ 110 @,@ 450 ( equivalent to $ 1 @,@ 865 @,@ 600 in 2016 ) . The courthouse was designed by architect Hook Smith . The building was constructed in a modern architecture style , and is three stories tall . The present courthouse was constructed two blocks west of the previous building , on the site of the former Blackwell Livery Stable , which had closed in 1912 . The site of the former courthouse is still surrounded by the brick roads that were constructed for the courthouse and is now home to a gazebo .

 The present courthouse is located at 200 West Dallas Avenue , two blocks west of the center of the city of Cooper . The building and its property take up half of the city block . It is bordered by Texas State Highway 154 ( Dallas Avenue ) to the south , Bonham Avenue to the north , NW 2nd Street to the east , and a small alleyway to the west . The courthouse is located slightly south of the geographic center of Delta County . The courthouse serves as the offices for most of the county government , including the county judge , commissioners ' court , county auditor , clerk , sheriff , and the justice of the peace . The court also houses all of the county 's historical records . 
 = Yoga Yajnavalkya = 
 The Yoga Yajnavalkya ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> ् क ् य , Yoga @-@ Yājñavalkya ) is a classical Hindu yoga text in the Sanskrit language . The text is written in the form of a male @-@ female dialogue between the sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi . The text consists of 12 chapters and contains 504 verses . 
 Like Patanjali 's Yogasutras , the Yoga Yajnavalkya describes the eight limbs of yoga ; however , it has different goals . The text contains additional material that is not found in Yogasutras , such as the concept of kundalini . The Yoga Yajnavalkya contains one of the most comprehensive discussion of yoga limbs such as the Pranayama , Pratyahara Dhyana , and Dharana . The Yajnavalkya – Gargi ( man – woman ) dialogue structure of this ancient text is notable in implying that the Yoga Yajnavalkya teachings is universally applicable and encouraged for both women and men . 
 The text was influential in the development and practice of the yoga traditions of India before the 12th century . 
 = = Author = = 
 The text is attributed to Yajnavalkya , a revered Vedic sage in Hinduism . He is estimated to have lived in around the 8th century BCE , and is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit , namely the Shukla Yajurveda , the Shatapatha Brahmana , the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , the <unk> named Yājñavalkya <unk> , <unk> Yajnavalkya , and <unk> Yajnavalkya . He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas , as well as in ancient Jainism texts such as the <unk> . These references to Yajnavalkya in other texts , in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya , may be to different sages with the same name . 
 The actual author of Yoga Yajnavalkya text was probably someone who lived many centuries after the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya , and is unknown . Ian Whicher , a professor of Religion at the University of Manitoba , writes that the author of Yoga Yajnavalkya may be an ancient Yajnavalkya , but this Yajnavalkya is not to be confused with the Vedic @-@ era Yajnavalkya " who is revered in Hinduism for Brihadaranyaka Upanishad " . 
 David White , a professor of Comparative Religion at the University of California , suggests that the author – a 9th- to 12th @-@ century South Indian with the name of Yajnavalkya – was " the author of two works that combined the eight part practice with teachings on Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy " : the Yoga Yajnavalkya and the Yogi Yajnavalkya @-@ <unk> . 
 = = Chronology = = 
 The composition date of Yoga Yajnavalkya is unclear . Prahlad Divanji , an Indologist and Sanskrit scholar , states that the text was composed between the second century BCE and fourth century CE , because Yoga Upanishads and Hatha Yoga texts contain verses from Yoga Yajnavalkya . Divanji cites Tantra texts , Ayurveda tradition texts , and literature of Advaita Vedanta from the 4th century CE , which mention the Yoga Yajnavalkya , thereafter concluding that the text or some version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya text must have been in existence by the 4th century CE . However , adds Divanji , the text is likely to have been composed after Patanjali 's Yogasutra , which itself is variously estimated to have composed sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE . Divanji premises his dating proposal from the observation that Yoga Yajnavalkya expands on ideas in Patanjali 's text , such as its list of Yamas , which includes the Patanjali 's five plus five additional ones . 
 A. G. Mohan , an author and yoga teacher , states that the text was likely completed before the 4th century CE . David White , in contrast , suggests the date of composition to be much later , between the 10th and 12th centuries . White states that the 13th @-@ century Dattatreya Yoga @-@ shastra acknowledges Yajnavalkya , and describes its teachings as " supplementary to the eight part practice as taught by Yajnavalkya " , which means that the text was already established and accepted by then . Other manuscripts with devotional , " non @-@ mental " and " mental " yoga texts in the Hindu tradition also refer to teachings of the text , suggesting the text originated before many other yoga texts . 
 Ram Shankar Bhattacharya , an Indologist , dates the Pune version of a manuscript of the text to about the 13th or 14th century CE , and notes that this version of the Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts . He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript . However , no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya ; rather , Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives , leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text . 
 = = Manuscripts = = 
 Several versions of the Yoga Yajnavalkya manuscripts are known . The earliest published manuscript of Yoga Yajnavalkya was discovered in Bengal in 1893 . Since then , other manuscripts have been discovered with differing numbers of verses . The text published by Divanji in 1954 , for example , has over 500 verses , while the manuscript translated by Krishnamacharya and Desikachar , writers and teachers of yoga books , has 460 verses . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Yoga Yajnavalkya ( or <unk> ) text is structured as a conversation between a man ( Yajnavalkya ) and a woman ( Gargi ) , in the presence of an audience . It is organized into twelve chapters , and cumulatively contains 504 verses . 
 The text opens with a discussion of virtues and lifestyle of a yogi , with 70 verses in the first chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas . The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters , wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body . 
 Meditation discussions start in the eighth chapter of the text , where 40 verses discuss how to start and develop meditative practices with the help of Om and resonating sounds , followed by 44 verses in the ninth chapter for advanced meditation that is reflective on one 's mind , <unk> ( feelings ) and nature of one 's Atman ( self , soul ) . The text dedicates 23 verses in the tenth chapter on samadhi ( concentration ) to become aware of the equality of one 's Atman and Brahman ( Universal Ultimate Reality , God ) . 
 The final sections of the text discuss the need for a Guru ( teacher ) along with the duties of a yogin , and what to do when one realizes one has made a mistake . The last chapter briefly discusses the kundalini , the benefits of yoga and the nature of calmness , <unk> in one 's mind and consciousness .

 The text opens with reverence and introduction for Yajnavalkya and Gargi , and then gives its purpose : " to disclose the nature of yoga " . In verses 10 to 19 , Gargi remarks that yoga has been called the best karma , and asks Yajnavalkya to explain yoga to her . Yajnavalkya agrees , but first attributes his knowledge to the Hindu god Brahma who taught him this jnana ( knowledge ) and karma ( works ) .

One path is <unk> @-@ karma , wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards , forms his will , and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will . The second path is Nivritti @-@ karma , wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards , but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way . The <unk> @-@ karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth , while the Nivritti @-@ karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth . 
 Verses 1 @.@ 27 – 40 are a non @-@ yoga commentary on the duties of four social classes – this section is missing in manuscripts of Yoga Yajnavalkya that contain 460 verses . The commentary presents two theories on the duties of the four Varna in terms of ashrama <unk> of Brahmacharya , Grihastha , Vanaprastha and Sannyasa . One theory allows only the Brahmins , Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to enter Brahmacharya and study the Vedas , and the other states that Shudras can also enter Brahmacharya . 
 Neither theory is recommended , and according to Bhattacharya 's translation it adds that all four <unk> are required to " pay off the debts owed to the sages , men and gods " by practicing Brahmacharya , procreating offspring and performing karma . All four social classes should strive for Nivritti @-@ karma ( work without craving for rewards ) . According to Desikachar 's translation , yoga is open to all , without restrictions to varna or gender . 
 Verses 1 @.@ 41 – 49 state that " karma with knowledge is the means to liberation " . Yoga is the essence of this knowledge , and it has eight components : Yama , <unk> , Asana , Pranayama , Pratyahara , Dharana , Dhyana and Samadhi . 
 = = = Yamas : virtuous restraints of a yoga student = = = 
 The Yoga Yajnavalkya starts its description of yoga practice with a statement of virtuous self @-@ restraints that a yogi or yogini needs to adhere to . This list is longer than the five yamas listed by Patañjali in <unk> , but similar to those found in other Hindu texts such as the Shandilya Upanishad and other ancient and medieval @-@ era Yoga texts . Verses 1 @.@ 50 – 51 of Yoga Yajnavalkya list the following ten Yamas ( the restraints ) , while verses 1 @.@ 52 – 70 explain what these virtues mean and why they are necessary : 
 Ahiṃsā ( अहिंसा ) : nonviolence , <unk> by action , with word or in thought 
 Satya ( सत ् य ) : truthfulness 
 Asteya ( <unk> ् <unk> ) : not stealing 
 Brahmacharya ( ब ् रह ् <unk> ् य ) : celibacy , fidelity to one 's partner 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : kindness , compassion 
 Ārjava ( आर ् <unk> ) : no hypocrisy , sincerity 
 <unk> ( क ् षमा ) : forgiveness 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : fortitude 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : moderation in diet 
 Śauca ( <unk> ) : purity , cleanliness 
 Verse 1 @.@ 69 asserts that in a cleansed body resides a peaceful mind , and when this mind achieves purity , <unk> ( knowledge of soul ) becomes feasible . 
 = = = Niyamas : virtuous observances of a yoga student = = = 
 The chapter 2 begins with a list of ten Niyamas ( the Observance , Do @-@ these list , positive duties ) , followed by an explanation of each in the rest of the chapter . The list is again longer than the list of five found in Patanjali 's Yogasutras , but similar to those found in the Shandilya and Varaha Upanishads , the Hatha Yoga Pradipika , and verses 552 to 557 in Book 3 of the <unk> of <unk> , in the sense of positive duties , desirable behaviors and discipline . The list of the ten niyamas are : 
 Tapas : austerity , persistence and perseverance in one 's purpose 
 <unk> : contentment , acceptance of others and of one 's circumstances as they are , optimism for self 
 Āstika : faith in merit and demerit 
 Dāna : generosity , charity , sharing with others 
 <unk> : worship of the Ishvara ( Brahman , Vishnu , Rudra , God / Supreme Being , True Self ) 
 <unk> <unk> : listening to the Vedas and Upanishads , texts about virtues and principles 
 Hrī : shyness , modesty , remorse and acceptance of one 's past , humility 
 Mati : faith in self and duties , reflection to reconcile conflicting ideas 
 Japa : steady reading of the Vedas , repetition of mantras or sacred sounds set in poetic meters , either with sound or silently in one 's mind 
 <unk> : vows and self @-@ promise to focus and achieve appropriate self set goals on Dharma , Artha , Kama and Moksha . 
 Richard Rosen , yoga teacher and a contributing editor at Yoga Journal , states that the first two chapters provides the moral foundations of its yoga teachings , and are more detailed than many other yoga texts in the Indian traditions . 
 = = = Asanas : the yoga postures = = = 
 Chapter 3 is short , and opens with a list of eight asanas ( postures ) , followed by the description of each one . The asanas are of two types : one set is for meditative contemplation , and the other for cleansing the body . Both are said to be important in the journey of yoga . Different asanas focus on different organ groups . Of the eight asanas , the text discusses two variations each for the <unk> and the Mukta <unk> in verses 3 @.@ 3 – 5 and 3 @.@ 13 – 14 respectively , with claims that each asana helps cleanse the body when these are practiced with Yamas and Niyamas . 
 Cleansing asanas are those that when practiced for short periods of time help the body prevent or correct internal imbalances and tone inner organs ; while meditative asanas are those postures , either sitting or standing , that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time . In both , a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises . Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi ( blood vessels ) through the Pranayama stage of yoga . This view is shared by other yoga texts , such as in verse 5 @.@ 2 of Gheranda Samhita . The Padmasana ( lotus position ) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation . 
 = = = A theory of human body and inner fire = = = 
 Gargi inquires in chapter 4 about the nature of Nadis , the human body and how vital airs function in it . Yajnavalkya begins his reply by asserting that the height of every adult human being is about 96 times the width of his or her <unk> ( thumb ) . 
 The Prana ( breath , vital air ) of the body is dispersed within and outside the body . The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air , to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one 's body . This inner fire resides in the middle part of the body , and he calls it the <unk> ( center ) and a Chakra . This is the residence of the Jiva , and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive . Just above this <unk> is the kundalini which normally is dormant . Yoga awakens her , by bringing vital air and heat to her . 
 Verses 4 @.@ 26 – 35 state that the human body has fourteen nadis ( blood vessels ) , of which three are primary . Sushumna ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> ) is the most important , as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head , sustaining the whole body . Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4 @.@ 31 . On both sides of the Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels , the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun . These three drive the three Guṇas ( forces behind the innate character ) of a being , with Sushumna driving Sattva ( goodness ) , Pingala driving the Rajas ( action ) , and Ida driving the Tamas ( destructiveness ) . These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body , which pervade the whole body , and nourish it . 
 When one inhales or exhales , according to verses 4 @.@ 47 – 65 , the Nadis are loaded with vital airs . There are ten types of vital airs , corresponding to different stages of breathing , and they are named Prana , Apana , Samana , Udana , <unk> , Naga , Kurma , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . These affect the Nadis in different ways , and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is , depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts . 
 The body interacts with nature , and removes liquids and excretes waste through nine holes . The aim of pranayama ( breath control ) is to purify the channels and nourish the inner body with vital airs . This benefits a yogi and yogini in preventing and curing diseases , as well as preparing the mind for meditation . 
 = = = Breath control and meditation for self @-@ purification = = = 
 Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the means of cleansing the body and mind . The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self @-@ restraints ( Yamas ) , observances ( Niyamas ) , avoiding anger against anyone or anything , truthfully following Dharma , respecting and learning from the Guru ( teacher ) , and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for rewards of one 's action . 
 = = = = Location for yoga = = = = 
 Solitary places are the best venues for yoga . A matha ( hut ) in a forest is ideal , but any private place that is free from distractions , high winds or intense sunshine is a good location for yoga . Either a pad made of <unk> grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it , is desirable . Yoga can be learned , with the help of a teacher , within three to four months if practiced six times a day . If frequent practice is not possible , yoga can be mastered over a period of three to four years . 
 = = = = Mastering the breath = = = = 
 The text dedicates the largest number of verses to the discussion of breath and breath exercises . 
 Yajnavalkya dedicates significant amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing , that is inhalation , exhalation and stoppage between the two . Each stage is discussed in terms of its nature , speed , duration , depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing , regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind . In order to keep time for each stage without distraction , he recommends silently reciting time @-@ measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga . The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava ( Om ) , Gayatri with <unk> , or Gayatri with Siras . 
 The text classifies three levels of breath regulation , namely Puraka ( <unk> , satisfying ) , Kumbhaka ( <unk> ् भक , prominent ) and Rechaka ( <unk> , purging ) . The Puraka exercise is shortest and counts twelve moments ( <unk> , music beats ) ; the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty @-@ four moments , while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty @-@ six moments . The text then describes various combinations of Puraka , Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas for the purposes of energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body , asserting that , when mastered , Prana , Apana , Samana , Udana , <unk> and other vital airs help gain endurance , calmness , measured speed , ascension and inner healing . The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers . Yajnavalkya describes <unk> mudra , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in chapter 6 , asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind . 
 = = = Meditation = = = 
 Chapter 7 discusses the fifth limb of yoga , Pratyahara , which it says is of five forms . This stage is one where the focus of the mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness . The theory of <unk> ( joints ) is presented , and 18 vital points inside one 's body are listed that can be used as focal points to help initial stages of the meditative exercises . 
 Verses 1 – 10 of chapter 8 elaborate on the practice of Dharana or meditation to train the mind in the consciousness of the self . The five elements in the universe correspond to five body functional systems , and that systems are gods residing within the human body . The next level of meditation is to fix one 's <unk> attention to these five , while simultaneously performing the breath exercises mastered in the previous step . 
 The five deities are addressed by chanting the five letters or syllables ( <unk> which are the sounds of the Chakras ) which are <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) to become one with <unk> ( God ) . Verses 8 @.@ 11 – 15 state that a yogin should practice meditating on these respective body systems as deities , with the help of Om mantra , as this leads to dissolution , and realization of the Brahman @-@ Purusha . After mastery is achieved with the aid of envisioning the five deities within one 's body , the text mentions that the yogin overcomes three <unk> ( <unk> , faults ) . The chapter ends by reminding the yoga student to not forget the daily duties and works , the virtuous self @-@ restraints ( yamas ) and virtuous observances ( niyamas ) as he gains mastery to this level of yoga . 
 Chapter 9 discusses Dhyana limb of yoga . Dhyana can lead to freedom or bondage , depending on how and what one concentrates on . Freedom comes from realizing the oneness of individual self with the universal self . The Nirguna ( non @-@ qualified , attribute less ) form of meditation is best suited for those who have mastered the vital airs as well as all the Asanas with inner awareness of <unk> ( vital points ) and Nadis ( blood vessels ) . These yogins and yoginis can abstract , feel the Self within , and should meditate on " I am Brahman , who is all pervasive , all embracing , all perceiving and full of bliss " . 
 The Saguna meditation , that is qualified and with attributes , is for those who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti , or a visualization aid . They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva , Narayana or Purushottama . The meditation should concentrate on one 's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self . This is the path to the state of <unk> , or qualified Dhyana . 
 The text suggests variations to the Saguna meditation , such as perceiving the union of a golden disc with four @-@ faced golden Purusha , imagining a lustrous inner self inside oneself and then oneness with it , and other variations . Verses 9 @.@ 43 – 44 state that the inner self , whether meditated upon as Nirguna or Saguna , is one and the same . 
 = = = Concentration = = = 
 Chapter 10 states meditation practice perfects one 's ability to concentrate , wherein the object one concentrates on becomes the one of attachment , of oneness and one feels one 's identity with it . Verses 10 @.@ 6 – 15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self , oneness with Brahman in everything , and this process of attachment of one 's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation . 
 Verses 10 @.@ 19 – 23 advise that those who seek liberation in life or after death , should do yoga and reach the stage of Samadhi wherein one fixes one 's mind on the supreme self . This is recommended for those in their advanced years and seekers of inner liberation and peace . Yajnavalkya suggests to Gargi that she should meditate on the self in her through yoga , and thus attain nirvana . 
 = = = Dharma of a yogin , Astanga yoga = = = 
 Gargi , in chapter 11 asks Yajnavalkya whether a yogin in the state of Samadhi needs to perform Vedic duties . He replies , " No , any one in the state of yoga need not do Vedic duties " , because that state is the goal . However , anyone who leaves the state of Samadhi must perform Dharmic duties because " no living being can survive without performing any actions " . All duties should be performed until the end of one 's life , when the self unites with the supreme self . Gargi then asks Yagnavalkya to summarize the eight limbs of yoga . 
 = = = The theory of kundalini = = = 
 In the first 47 verses of chapter 12 , Yajnavalkya elucidates Siddha yoga and Kundalini . The aim of these yogic exercises , according to verses 12 @.@ 1 – 4 , is to reach the " internal fire " with Prana ( life force , breath energy ) ; these should be performed three times daily for ten days . With the vital air under control through the yoga , the yogin realizes signs of progress such as a relaxed state of body , manifested divine sound or nada inside . Verses 12 @.@ 10 – 14 state that this Kundalini fire is situated in the navel , and should be meditated upon by breathing exercises . This warms up the Kundalini , awakening her , and the warmth glows through the entire body , and at this stage the yogin must draw the breath above the navel . 
 Yagnavalkya explains that warm air inhaled passes to the <unk> via the navel which helps in curing diseases . When hot air is retained in the heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra , the thousand petaled lotus , that then emerges in an inverted form . When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman ( Atman ) , which is the heart , according to verses 12 @.@ 15 – 22 , the fire located in the region of <unk> , which is between the eyebrows glows . These exercises , which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire , lead to the perception of light internally and externally . At this stage one should behold with the mind 's eye , the fire @-@ like glowing moon in the forehead , and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta ( mind ) . 
 Verses 12 @.@ 23 – 31 state that the <unk> , which is the subtle body that is not visible , glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead . This shining Shakti ( force , energy , power ) , translates Bhattacharya , is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision . Atman is perceived when the mind located in the space between the eyebrows , becomes free of all distractions and activities . In this state , the yogin becomes aware of self within , and in the sages , in <unk> and others . If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye brows does not occur , the yogin should envision absolute bliss , alternatively the full moon inside the mouth . This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity , helping it reside in <unk> or the Akasha ( sky ) , and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation . This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge , the goal of the practice of yoga . 
 Brahman is the origin of all , it is all that exists and all that into which it will dissolve back , and the Vedas teach that this Brahman resides in the heart of a person . It is , translates Bhattacharya , " subtler than the subtle , greater than the great " and is perceived with the cleansing of one 's mind and intellect , one achievable with breathing exercises , sacred sound exercises and yoga .

 Following the complete exposition of all the principles of yoga , Yagnavalkya leaves for a secluded place to continue his meditative contemplation , while Gargi forsakes her world , retires to a forest hermitage , and seeks refuge in the practice of yoga . 
 = = Translations = = 
 Two English translations of the complete text are known , one by Desikachar and the other by Mohan , while Bhattacharya has published a condensed summary of the twelve chapters . 
 According to Desikachar 's translation : " In the 1960s only two [ Sanskrit ] versions of this valuable text were available [ Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society ( <unk> ) and Trivandrum editions ] , and both were incomplete or inaccurate . He [ Krishnamacharya ] took the pains of writing the whole manuscript . " Desikachar further states in his introduction : " However many verses of this twelve @-@ chapter text are missing in both versions ... He [ Krishnamacharya ] even corrected those manuscripts that were incomplete . " In The Heart of Yoga , Desikachar indicates : " There is one critical edition of the Yoga Yājñavalkya written by Śrī <unk> [ sic ] C. Divanji [ <unk> edition ] . " 
 According to A. G. Mohan 's English translation : " However , a comparative reading shows that the Desikachar edition is a faithful reproduction of the 1938 Trivandrum publication . The only edits made are to fill in a negligible number of missing words – around 60 words out of 6000 – in mostly obvious contexts . There are no significant corrections to existing verses . The Divanji publication is easily more complete and error free , containing copious footnotes comparing different versions of the text from sixteen manuscripts and five printed editions ( including the Trivandrum publication ) ... The Trivandrum publication offered by the Desikachar misses 39 1 ⁄ 2 verses that appear in the Divanji publication . " 
 = = Significance = = 
 According to David White , Yoga Yajnavalkya was more significant in practice than the Patanjali 's Yogasutras before the 12th century . Among the texts on asanas and meditation , it dominated the Indian yoga scene . Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha , chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga , Pashupata Yoga and Tantric Yoga , the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions . 
 Secondary Sanskrit language texts from the 9th to 12th centuries incorporate the ideas of Yoga Yajnavalkya into their own traditions . These include the <unk> ( commentary ) of <unk> and manuscripts of Vedanta schools such as Advaita Vedanta that discuss and incorporate yoga philosophy and practices as essential for their traditions . 
 The presence of Gargi in Yoga Yajnavalkya is significant in a historical sense , as encouraging yoga to women . According to Divanji , the text includes some yoga @-@ related verses exclusively addressed to women , such as those in verses 1 @.@ 21 – 40 , 2 @.@ 8 – 9 and 6 @.@ 11 – 20 . 
 The text was influential on many later yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika , and Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga @-@ kundalini Upanishad and Yogatattva Upanishad , because they make frequent references to it . 
 = = = Yoga Yajnavalkya versus Patanjali 's Yogasutra = = = 
 The philosophical premises of Yajnavalkya and Patanjali are different , according to Richard Rosen . Patanjali accepts the dualism premise , and defines yoga as cessation of mental activity associated with sensory interaction with nature , leading to Kaivalya ( aloneness ) of the self and a state of self @-@ awareness . Yajnavalkya accepts the Advaita Vedanta premise of non @-@ dualism , " essential oneness of self and nature " , and defines yoga as path to intense interconnectedness between Jiva and Paramatman , where the union of self and supreme self is realized . 
 = North Carolina @-@ class battleship = 
 The North Carolina class was a class of two fast battleships , North Carolina and Washington , built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s and early 1940s . The navy was originally uncertain whether the ships should be fast enough to counter the Japanese Kongō class , which was believed by the United States to be capable of 26 knots ( 30 mph ; 48 km / h ) , or should sacrifice speed for additional firepower and armor . The Second London Naval Treaty 's requirement that all capital ships have a standard displacement of under 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 35 @,@ 560 metric tons ) prevented the desired objectives from being fully realized within its limits , and the navy considered over fifty designs before one was chosen . 
 Towards the end of this lengthy design period the General Board of the United States Navy declared its preference for a battleship with a speed of 30 knots ( 35 mph ; 56 km / h ) , faster than any in US service or under construction , with a main battery of nine 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark B guns . The board believed that such ships could fulfill a multitude of roles , as they would have enough protection to be put into a battle line while also having enough speed to escort aircraft carriers or engage in commerce raiding . However , the acting Secretary of the Navy authorized a modified version of a different design , which in its original form had been rejected by the General Board . This called for a 27 @-@ knot ( 31 mph ; 50 km / h ) ship with twelve 14 @-@ inch guns in quadruple turrets and protection against guns of the same caliber . In a major departure from traditional American design practices , this design accepted lower speed and protection in exchange for maximum firepower . After construction had begun , the United States became concerned over Japan 's refusal to commit to the caliber limit of the Second London Naval Treaty , so they invoked the " escalator clause " of that pact and increased the class ' main armament to nine 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) / 45 Mark 6 caliber guns from the original twelve 14 @-@ inch guns . 
 Both North Carolina and Washington saw extensive service during the Second World War in a variety of roles , primarily in the Pacific theater where they escorted fast carrier task forces and conducted shore bombardments . North Carolina shot down between seven and fourteen Japanese aircraft in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons , and later sustained a torpedo hit from a Japanese submarine . During the naval battle of Guadalcanal , which was a chaotic night engagement , Washington 's radar @-@ directed main batteries fatally damaged the Japanese battleship Kirishima causing it to sink the next day . In February 1944 , Washington crushed its bow in a collision with battleship Indiana . Following repairs , Washington rejoined its sister for the Battle of the Philippine Sea . After the end of the war , both ships took part in Operation Magic Carpet , the withdrawal of American military personnel from overseas deployments . The vessels were laid up in the reserve fleet until the early 1960s , when North Carolina was sold to its home state as a museum ship , and Washington was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the end of the First World War , several navies continued and expanded naval construction programs that they had started during the conflict . The United States ' 1916 program called for six Lexington @-@ class battlecruisers and five South Dakota @-@ class battleships ; in December 1918 , the government of President Woodrow Wilson called for building an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers . 1919 – 20 General Board proposals planned for slightly smaller , but still significant , acquisitions beyond the 1916 plan : two battleships and a battlecruiser for the fiscal year 1921 , and three battleships , a battlecruiser , four aircraft carriers and thirty destroyers between the fiscal years 1922 and 1924 . The United Kingdom was in the final stages of ordering eight capital ships ( the G3 battlecruisers , with the first 's keel laying in 1921 , and N3 @-@ class battleships , to be laid down beginning in 1922 ) . Imperial Japan was , by 1920 , attempting to build up to an 8 @-@ 8 standard with the Nagato , Tosa , Amagi , Kii and Number 13 classes . Two ships from these designs would be laid down per year until 1928 . 
 With the staggering costs associated with such programs , the United States ' Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes invited delegations from the major maritime powers — France , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom — to come together in Washington , D.C. to discuss , and hopefully end , the naval arms races . The subsequent Washington Naval Conference resulted in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty . Along with many other provisions , it limited all future battleships to a standard displacement of 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) and a maximum gun caliber of 16 inches ( 406 mm ) . It also decreed that the five countries could not construct another capital ship for ten years and could not replace any ship that survived the treaty until it was at least twenty years old . 
 The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty , while superseding the 1922 agreement , nonetheless kept many of the same requirements , though it restricted gun size on new warships to 14 inches ( 356 mm ) . These treaties heavily influenced the design of the North Carolina class , as can be attested to in the long quest to find a ship that incorporated everything considered necessary while remaining under 35 @,@ 000 long tons . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Early = = = 
 The General Board began preparations for a new class of battleships in May – July 1935 . Three design studies were submitted to them : " A " would be 32 @,@ 150 long tons ( 32 @,@ 670 t ) armed with nine 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) guns in triple turrets — all forward of the bridge — capable of 30 knots ( 35 mph ; 56 km / h ) , and armored against 14 @-@ inch shells ; " B " and " C " would both be over 36 @,@ 000 long tons ( 37 @,@ 000 t ) , able to reach 30 @.@ 5 knots ( 35 @.@ 1 mph ; 56 @.@ 5 km / h ) and armored against 14 @-@ inch shells — the major difference between the two was the planned main battery , as " B " had twelve 14 @-@ inch guns in triple turrets , while " C " had eight 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) / 45 @-@ caliber guns in dual turrets . " A " was the only one to remain within the 35 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) displacement limit set in the Washington Naval Treaty and reaffirmed in the Second London Naval Treaty . When the Bureau of Ordnance introduced a " super @-@ heavy " 16 @-@ inch shell , the ships were redesigned ( " A1 " , " B1 " and " C1 " ) in an attempt to provide protection against it , but this introduced severe weight problems : " A1 " was only 500 long tons ( 510 t ) below the 35 @,@ 000 @-@ ton limit , while the other two were close to 40 @,@ 000 long tons ( 41 @,@ 000 t ) . 
 Although these original three studies were all fast battleships , the General Board was not definitively committed to the higher maximum speeds . It posed questions to the Naval War College , asking for their opinion as to whether the new class should be a " conventional " 23 @-@ knot ( 26 mph ; 43 km / h ) ship with an eight @-@ nine , 16 @-@ inch main battery , or rather one akin to " A " , " B " or " C " . 
 Five more design studies were produced in late September 1935 , which had characteristics of 23 – 30 @.@ 5 knots , eight or nine 14- or 16 @-@ inch guns , and a standard displacement between 31 @,@ 500 long tons ( 32 @,@ 000 t ) and 40 @,@ 500 long tons ( 41 @,@ 100 t ) . " D " and " E " were attempts at fast battleships with 16 @-@ inch guns and protections against the same , but their displacement was greater than the Washington Naval Treaty allowed . " F " was a radical attempt at a hybrid battleship @-@ carrier , with three catapults mounted fore and eight 14 @-@ inch guns aft . It was reportedly favored by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , but as aircraft launched from catapults were necessarily inferior to most carrier- or land @-@ based aircraft because of the floats used to land , nothing came of the design . " G " and " H " were slower 23 @-@ knot ships with nine 14 @-@ inch guns ; in particular , " H " was thought to be a very well balanced design by the Preliminary Design section of the Bureau of Construction and Repair . However , the General Board finally decided to use faster ships , which " G " and " H " were not . 
 These studies demonstrated the difficulty the designers faced . With a displacement of 35 @,@ 000 tons , there were two basic choices : a ship similar to " A1 " which was faster ( 30 knots ) but more lightly armed and armored than contemporary battleships or one which was slower but armed with heavier guns — although fitting in protection against 16 @-@ inch guns would be extremely difficult . Preliminary Design drew up five more studies in October , based upon either " A " with additional armor or a scaled @-@ down " B " ; all utilized 14 @-@ inch guns and called for 30 or 30 @.@ 5 knots . Two called for four turrets , but this would be too heavy and mount less armor . Another , " K , " 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) belt and 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) deck and a 19 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 yd ( 11 – 17 mi ; 17 – 27 km ) immune zone against the United States ' super @-@ heavy 14 @-@ inch shell . While " K " was liked by the naval constructors , its designed standard displacement of 35 @,@ 000 tons left little room for error or any modifications and improvements to the design . A final two , " L " and " M , " would use quadruple turrets to save weight ( similar to the French Dunkerque ) while still mounting 12 guns . 
 Many officers in the United States Navy supported the construction of three or four battlecruiser @-@ type ships for carrier escorts and to counter Japan 's Kongō class . These included the acting Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William Standley , the president of the Naval War College Admiral William S. Pye , a small majority ( 9 – 7 ) of senior officers at sea , and five of six line officers engaged in strategic planning as part of the War Plans Division , although at least one officer believed that an aerial attack would also be capable of sinking the Kongōs . With the above recommendations , the General Board selected " K " to undergo further development . 
 = = = Final = = = 
 At least 35 different final designs were proposed . All numbered with Roman numerals ( " I " through " XVI @-@ D " ) , the first five ( " I " – " V " , variations upon " K " ) were completed on 15 November 1935 . They were the first to employ so @-@ called " paper " weight reductions : not counting certain weights in the ship 's 35 @,@ 000 long ton limit that were not specifically part of the definition of standard displacement . In this case , even though there was designed storage room for 100 shells per main battery gun and an extra 100 rounds , the weight of the rounds did not figure toward the treaty @-@ mandated limit . 
 These designs varied greatly in everything but their standard displacements and speeds . " II " called for 35 @,@ 743 long tons ( 36 @,@ 317 t ) , every other design called for 35 @,@ 000 long tons , and only five planned for a top speed of under 27 knots ( 31 mph ; 50 km / h ) ; of those , only one was lower than 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 30 @.@ 5 mph ; 49 @.@ 1 km / h ) : " VII " , with 22 knots ( 25 mph ; 41 km / h ) . " VII " returned to a lower speed to obtain more firepower ( twelve 14 @-@ inch guns in triple turrets ) and protection ; as such , the design called for only 50 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( shp ) and a length of only 640 ft ( 200 m ) . Most other plans called for 710 ft ( 220 m ) or 725 ft ( 221 m ) , although six had lengths between 660 ft ( 200 m ) and 690 ft ( 210 m ) . The first eight designs ( " I " – " IV @-@ C " ) carried nine 14 @-@ inch guns , but many other combinations were tried , including eight 14 @-@ inch in two quadruple turrets ( one design , " V " , even planned for two quadruple 16 @-@ inch ) , eight 14 @-@ inch guns in four dual turrets ( " VIA " and " <unk> " ) , and ten , eleven or twelve 14 @-@ inch guns . 
 The " XVI " version of 20 August 1936 was a 27 @-@ knot , 714 ft ( 218 m ) -long ship that the Bureau of Ordnance found many problems in . Model tests showed at high speeds , waves generated by the design of the hull would leave some lower parts of the ship uncovered — including the magazines . To complicate the issue , the Bureau found low or underwater shell hits could be a serious problem when fighting at ranges between 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 10 nmi ( 12 mi ; 19 km ) ) and 30 @,@ 000 yd ( 15 nmi ( 17 mi ; 28 km ) ) . Other problems included the design 's defense against aircraft @-@ dropped bombs , as the Bureau thought the formula used to calculate its effectiveness was not realistic ; and the tapering of a fore bulkhead below the waterline could worsen underwater shell hit problems because the mostly unarmored bow could easily be penetrated . The solutions for these issues were all impractical ; added patches of armor around the magazines could neutralize the torpedo @-@ defense system 's effectiveness , and deepening the belt near the bow and stern would put the ships over the 35 @,@ 000 long ton limit . The General Board detested this design , saying it was " not ... a true battleship " due to its speed and armor problems . 
 To address these problems , a final set of designs , " XVI @-@ B " – " XVI @-@ D " , was presented by Preliminary Design in October 1936 . They were modifications of the " XVI " plan for a ship that was 714 ft. long , had twelve 14 in ( 356 mm ) guns in three quadruple turrets , a belt of 11 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 284 @.@ 5 mm ) sloped at 10 ° , and a deck 5 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 129 @.@ 5 mm ) to 5 @.@ 6 @-@ inch ( 142 @.@ 2 mm ) thick . In the final set , length was fixed at 725 ft ( 221 m ) for greater speed , but this meant only eleven 14 @-@ inch guns could be mounted with a thin 10 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 260 mm ) belt . Alternatively , one gun could be traded for a 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 342 @.@ 9 mm ) belt , and another could be swapped for a 30 @-@ knot speed and one more tenth of an inch of belt armor ; this became design " XVI @-@ C " . The General Board liked " XVI @-@ C " very much , seeing in it a ship that had enough protection to fight — and survive — in a battle line formed with the older battleships while also having enough speed to operate in a detached wing with , for example , aircraft carrier or cruiser commerce raiding groups . 
 However , one member of the Board , Admiral Joseph Reeves — who had previously been one of the principal developers of the United States ' aircraft carrier strategy — disliked " XVI @-@ C " because he believed that it was not fast enough to work with the 33 @-@ knot ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) fast carriers , and it was not powerful enough to justify its cost . Instead , he advocated a development of the previously rejected " XVI " , adding additional underwater protection and patches of armor within the ship to make the magazines immune to above- and below @-@ water shell hits from 19 @,@ 000 yd ( 9 @.@ 5 nmi ( 10 @.@ 9 mi ; 17 @.@ 6 km ) and beyond . The immune zone 's outer limit was increased from 28 @,@ 200 yd ( 14 nmi ( 16 mi ; 26 km ) ) ) to 30 @,@ 000 yd ( 15 nmi ( 17 mi ; 28 km ) ) . After further revisions , Reeves went to Admiral William Standley , the Chief of Naval Operations , who approved " XVI " in its newly modified form over the hopes of the General Board , who still thought that " XVI @-@ C " should be built . Standley 's only addition to the characteristics was provision for a switch from quadruple 14 @-@ inch to triple 16 in ( 406 mm ) turrets if the " escalator clause " in the Second London Naval Treaty was invoked . 
 = = = The " escalator clause " = = = 
 Although the Second London Naval Treaty stipulated that warship guns could be no larger than 14 inches , a so @-@ called " escalator clause " was included at the urging of American negotiators in case any country that had signed the Washington Naval Treaty refused to adhere to this new limit . The provision allowed signatory countries of the Second London Treaty — France , the United Kingdom and the United States — to raise the limit from 14 to 16 inches if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after 1 April 1937 . When figuring potential configurations for the North Carolinas , designers focused most of their planning on 14 @-@ inch weaponry ; Standley 's requirement meant that a switch from 14- to 16 @-@ inch , even after the ships ' keels had been laid , was possible . Japan formally rejected the 14 @-@ inch limit on 27 March 1937 , meaning that the " escalator clause " could be invoked . There were hurdles that still needed to be overcome , though : Roosevelt was under heavy political pressure and , as a result , was reluctant to allow the 16 @-@ inch gun . 
 I am not willing that the United States be the first naval power to adopt the 16 in. gun . ... Because of the international importance of the United States not being the first to change the principles laid down in the Washington and London Treaties , it seems to me that the plans for the two new battleships should contemplate the ... 14 @-@ inch gun . 
 Admiral Reeves also came out strongly in favor of the larger weapon . In a two @-@ page letter to Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson and indirectly to Roosevelt , Reeves argued that the 16 @-@ inch gun 's significantly greater armor penetration was of paramount importance , drawing examples from the First World War 's Battle of Jutland , where some battleships were able to survive ten or twenty hits from large guns , but other battlecruisers were blown up in three to seven hits because the shells were able to cut through the armor protecting magazines and turrets . Reeves also argued that the larger gun would favor the " indirect method " of shooting then being developed , where airplanes would be used to relay targeting information to allied battleships so that they could bombard targets that were out of their sight or over the horizon , because new battleships being built by foreign powers would have more armor . Reeves believed that if the 14 @-@ inch gun was adopted , it would not be able to penetrate this larger amount of protection , whereas the 16 @-@ inch would be able to break through . 
 In a final vain attempt , Roosevelt 's Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a telegram on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew instructing him that the United States would still accept a cap of 14 @-@ inch guns if he could get Japan to as well . The Japanese replied that they could not accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited ; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan , but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept . On 24 June , the two North Carolinas were ordered with the 14 @-@ inch weapons , but on 10 July , Roosevelt directed that they be armed with triple 16 @-@ inch instead .

 = = = Armament = = = 
 The two North Carolinas were principally armed with nine 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) / 45 caliber ( cal ) Mark 6 and twenty 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) / 38 cal Mark 28 Mod 0 guns . Their lighter armament consisted of varying numbers of 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 mm ) , .50 caliber machine guns , Bofors 40 mm and Oerlikon 20 mm . 
 = = = = Main battery = = = = 
 Mounted on both the North Carolina class and the follow @-@ up South Dakota class , the nine 16 in / 45 were improved versions of the guns mounted on the Colorado @-@ class battleships , hence the designation of " Mark 6 " . A major alteration from the older guns was the Mark 6 's ability to fire a new 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 200 @-@ kilogram ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shell developed by the Bureau of Ordnance . At full charge with a brand @-@ new gun , the heavy shell would be expelled at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 feet per second ( 701 m / s ) ; at a reduced charge , the same shell would be fired at 1 @,@ 800 f / s ( 549 m / s ) . Barrel life — the approximate number of rounds a gun could fire before needing to be relined or replaced — was 395 shells when using AP , although if only practice shots were used this figure was significantly higher : 2 @,@ 860 . Turning at 4 degrees a second , each turret could train to 150 degrees on either side of the ship . The guns could be elevated to a maximum inclination of 45 degrees ; turrets one and three could depress to − 2 degrees , but due to its superfiring position , the guns on turret two could only depress to 0 degrees . 
 Each gun was 736 inches ( 18 @,@ 700 mm ) long overall ; its bore and rifling length were 720 @-@ inch ( 18 @,@ 000 mm ) and 616 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 15 @,@ 670 mm ) , respectively . Maximum range with the heavy AP shell was obtained at an inclination of 45 degrees : 36 @,@ 900 yards ( 21 @.@ 0 mi ; 33 @.@ 7 km ) . At the same elevation a lighter 1 @,@ 900 @-@ pound ( 860 @-@ kilogram ) high capacity ( HC ) shell would travel 40 @,@ 180 yards ( 22 @.@ 83 miles ; 36 @.@ 74 kilometres ) . The guns weighed 192 @,@ 310 lb ( 87 @,@ 230 kg ; 86 long tons ) not including the breech ; the turrets weighed slightly over 3 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 lb ( 1 @,@ 410 @,@ 000 kg ; 1400 long tons ) . 
 When firing the same shell , the 16 in / 45 Mark 6 had a slight advantage over the 16 in / 50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor — a shell from a 45 cal gun would be slower , meaning that it would have a steeper trajectory as it descended . At 35 @,@ 000 yards ( 20 miles ; 32 kilometres ) , a shell from a 45 cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45 @.@ 2 degrees , as opposed to 36 degrees with the 50 cal . 
 = = = = Secondary battery = = = = 
 The North Carolinas carried ten twin enclosed base ring mounts supporting 5 in / 38 caliber Mark 28 Mod 0 guns . Originally designed to be mounted upon destroyers built in the 1930s , these guns were so successful that they were added to a myriad of American ships during the Second World War , including every major ship type and many smaller warships constructed between 1934 and 1945 . They were considered to be " highly reliable , robust and accurate " by the Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance . 
 The 5 in / 38 functioned as a dual purpose gun ; that is , it was able to fire at both surface and air targets with reasonable degrees of success . However , this did not mean that it possessed inferior anti @-@ air abilities ; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board North Carolina , the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at 12 @,@ 000 – 13 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 5 miles ; 3 @.@ 7 – 4 @.@ 0 kilometres ) , which was twice as far as the effective range of the earlier single purpose 5 in / 25 anti @-@ air gun . 
 Each 5 in / 38 weighed almost 4 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @,@ 800 kg ) without the breech ; the entire mount weighed 156 @,@ 295 pounds ( 70 @,@ 894 kilograms ) . It was 223 @.@ 8 inches ( 5 @,@ 680 mm ) long overall , had a bore length of 190 inches ( 4 @,@ 800 mm ) , and had a rifling length of 157 @.@ 2 inches ( 3 @,@ 990 mm ) . The gun could fire shells at about 2 @,@ 500 – 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 762 – 792 m / s ) ; about 4 @,@ 600 could be fired before the barrel needed to be replaced . Minimum and maximum elevations were − 15 and 85 degrees , respectively . The guns ' elevation could be raised or lowered at about 15 degrees per second . The mounts closest to the bow and stern could aim from − 150 to 150 degrees ; the others were restricted to − 80 to 80 degrees . They could be turned at about 25 degrees per second .

 The remaining weaponry on board the two North Carolinas was composed of differing numbers of 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 @-@ millimetre ) , .50 caliber machine guns , Bofors 40 mm and Oerlikon 20 mm guns . Although the ships were originally designed to carry only four quadruple 1 @.@ 1 in and twelve .50 caliber , this was greatly increased and upgraded during the war . 
 On both ships , two more quadruple sets of 1 @.@ 1 in guns were added in place of two searchlights amidships . After it was torpedoed in 1942 , North Carolina had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40 mm guns added . Fourteen were present by June 1943 , while a fifteenth mount was added on top of the third main turret that November . Washington retained its six 1 @.@ 1 in quads until the middle of 1943 , when ten quad 40 mm guns replaced them . By August , it had fifteen . The two ships carried these through to the close of the war . 
 The .50 caliber machine guns did not have the range or power needed to combat modern aircraft and were scheduled for replacement by equal numbers of 20 mm guns , but nothing immediately came of the proposal . In fact , both North Carolina and Washington carried 20 mm and .50 caliber guns for most of 1942 . In April , North Carolina had , respectively , forty and twelve , while Washington had twenty and twelve . Two months later , the number of 20 mm guns remained the same , but twelve .50 caliber guns had been added . By September , Washington had twenty more 20 mm guns added , for a total of forty , but five were removed — along with all of the .50 caliber guns — shortly thereafter when two quadruple sets of 1 @.@ 1 in guns were added . In its refit after being torpedoed , North Carolina had an additional six 20 mm guns added and all of its .50 caliber weapons removed . Washington had sixty @-@ four 20 mm weapons by April 1943 , prior to one single mount being replaced by a quadruple mount , and North Carolina had fifty @-@ three by March 1944 . In April 1945 , North Carolina was assigned to have fifty @-@ six 20 mm , while Washington was assigned seventy @-@ five . In August 1945 , the ships both had eight twin 20 mm mounts ; North Carolina also carried twenty single , while Washington carried one quad and sixty @-@ three single . 
 = = = Electronics = = = 
 Both North Carolina and Washington , designed prior to radar , were originally fitted with many fire @-@ control and navigational optical range @-@ finders . The former lasted until 1944 , when it was replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar — though it was supplemented by a Mark 3 main armament fire control radar . The range @-@ finders were removed in favor of additional 20 mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid @-@ 1942 . In addition , the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search , two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament . 
 By November 1942 , North Carolina had an additional Mark 4 and a SG surface search radar added . The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944 , with SK and SG radars ( air and surface search , respectively ) , a backup SG , and Mark 8s to direct its main battery . All of the Mark 4s remained for the secondary battery , and one of the older Mark 3s was still present , possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s . An SK @-@ 2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year . Aside from never receiving an SK @-@ 2 , Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades . 
 Both ships underwent extensive refits near the end or after the war ; North Carolina received a secondary air search set ( SR ) and a SCR @-@ 720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel . At the end of the war , it had an SP surface @-@ search , a SK @-@ 2 air @-@ search , a Mark 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars , a Mark 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12 , 22 and 32 radars , and a Mark 57 smaller weaponry fire control system , with a Mark 34 radar . In March 1946 , Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft , a SG both fore and aft , and a <unk> jammer ( which could scramble radar on other ships ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships in the North Carolina class were equipped with four General Electric geared turbines and eight Babcock & Wilcox three @-@ drum express type boilers . The ships ' powerplant incorporated several recent developments in turbine equipment , including double helical reduction gears and high @-@ pressure steam technology . North Carolina 's boilers supplied steam at 575 pounds per square inch and as hot as 850 ° F ( 454 ° C ) . To meet the design requirement of 27 knots , the engine system was originally designed to supply 115 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( shp ) , but the new technologies increased this output to 121 @,@ 000 shp . Despite this increase , the maximum speed for the ships did not change , since the modifications to the powerplant were incorporated later in the design process . The turbines that had already been installed could not fully take advantage of the higher pressure and temperature steam , and so the level of efficiency was not as high as it should have been . When going astern , the engines provided 32 @,@ 000 shp . 
 The engine system was divided into four engine rooms , all on the centerline . Each room contained a turbine and two boilers , without any division between the boilers and turbines . This was done to limit the risk of capsizing should the ship sustain heavy flooding in the engine rooms . The engine rooms alternated in their layout : the first and third engine rooms were arranged with the turbine on the starboard side and its corresponding boilers on the port , this was reversed in the second and fourth rooms . The forward @-@ most engine room powered the starboard outer shaft , the second turbine drove the outer screw on the port side , the third engine supplied power to the inner starboard propeller , and the fourth turbine drove the port @-@ side inner screw . All four screws had four blades ; the two outer propellers were 15 ft 4 in ( 4 @.@ 674 m ) in diameter and the inner pair were 16 ft 7 @.@ 5 in ( 5 @.@ 067 m ) wide . Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders . 
 At the time of their commissioning , the ships had a top speed of 28 knots ( 32 mph ; 52 km / h ) , though by 1945 , with the addition of other equipment , such as anti @-@ aircraft weaponry , their maximum speed was reduced to 26 @.@ 8 knots ( 30 @.@ 8 mph ; 49 @.@ 6 km / h ) . The increases in weight also reduced the ships ' cruising range . In 1941 , the ships could steam for 17 @,@ 450 nautical miles ( 32 @,@ 320 km ; 20 @,@ 080 mi ) at a cruising speed of 15 knots ( 17 mph ; 28 km / h ) ; by 1945 , the range at that speed was reduced to 16 @,@ 320 nmi ( 30 @,@ 220 km ; 18 @,@ 780 mi ) . At 25 knots ( 29 mph ; 46 km / h ) , the range was considerably lower , at 5 @,@ 740 nmi ( 10 @,@ 630 km ; 6 @,@ 610 mi ) . 
 Electrical power was supplied by eight generators . Four were turbo @-@ generators designed for naval use ; these provided 1 @,@ 250 kilowatts each . The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850 kilowatts each . Two smaller diesel generators — each provided 200 kilowatts — supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged . Total electrical output was 8 @,@ 400 kilowatts , not including the emergency generators , at 450 volts on an alternating current . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 North Carolina and Washington incorporated " all or nothing " armor which weighed 41 % of the total displacement ; it consisted of an " armored raft " that extended from just forward of the first gun turret to just aft of the rear gun turret . They had a main armored belt that was 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick amidships , inclined at 15 ° , and backed by 0 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 19 mm ) Special Treatment Steel ( STS ) . This tapered down to 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) on the lower edge of the belt . The ships had three armored decks ; the main deck was 1 @.@ 45 @-@ inch ( 37 mm ) thick , the second , thickest deck was 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) , and the third and thinnest deck was 0 @.@ 62 @-@ inch ( 16 mm ) thick . The first deck was designed to cause delay @-@ fuzed projectiles to detonate , while the thicker second belt would protect the ships ' internals . The third deck was intended to protect against shell splinters that might have penetrated the second deck ; it also acted as the upper support for the torpedo bulkheads . The conning tower was connected to the armored citadel by a 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) thick communications tube . Armor thickness for the conning tower itself ranged from 16 inches ( 410 mm ) on both sides to 14 @.@ 7 inches ( 370 mm ) on the front and rear . The roof was 7 inches ( 180 mm ) thick and the bottom was 3 @.@ 9 inches ( 99 mm ) thick . 
 The main battery turrets were heavily armored : the turret faces were 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) thick , the sides were 9 @-@ inch ( 230 mm ) thick , the rear sides were 11 @.@ 8 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick , and the roofs were 7 @-@ inch ( 180 mm ) thick . 16 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 410 mm ) armor was the maximum width factories were able to produce at the time of the ships ' design ; by 1939 , however , it was possible to create 18 in @-@ thick plates . These were not installed because it was estimated that the conversion would delay completion of the ships by 6 to 8 months . The barbettes that held the turrets were also strongly protected . The front portion was 14 @.@ 7 inches ( 370 mm ) , the sides increased to 16 inches ( 410 mm ) , and the rear portion reduced to 11 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 290 mm ) . The 5 @-@ inch gun turrets , along with their ammunition magazines , were armored with 1 @.@ 95 @-@ inch ( 50 mm ) STS plates . 
 The side protection system incorporated five compartments divided by torpedo bulkheads and a large anti @-@ torpedo bulge that ran the length of the " armored raft " . The outer two compartments , the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty , while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid . The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets . In these areas , the fifth compartment was deleted ; instead , there was an outer empty compartment and two liquid @-@ filled spaces , backed by another empty compartment . To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system , these sections received additional armor plating , up to 3 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 95 mm ) in thickness . The complete system was designed to withstand warheads of up to 700 lb ( 320 kg ) of TNT . Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was 5 @.@ 75 ft ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) deep . The bottom layer was 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick and was kept filled with fluid , while the upper 2 @.@ 75 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 84 m ) thick layer was kept empty . The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated .

 Two ships , each to cost about $ 50 million , were authorized in January 1937 . Five shipyards submitted bids to build one of the two planned ships . Three were privately run corporations : Bethlehem Shipbuilding , New York Shipbuilding and Newport News Shipbuilding . The other two , the New York Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , were run by the government . When bids were reviewed , the privately run shipyards ' submissions ranged from $ 46 to 50 million , while their government counterparts came in at $ 37 million . Newport News was unique among these in refusing any fixed monetary value in favor of a " cost @-@ plus 3 1 ⁄ 2 % " price , but this led to the rejection of their bid out of hand . 
 The bids from private companies were heavily influenced by the legislation of the New Deal . The Vinson @-@ Trammell Act limited profit from a ship 's construction to 10 percent , while the Walsh @-@ Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers . The latter act greatly affected the ability of the navy to acquire steel , as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry , who greatly disliked the forty @-@ hour work week and minimum wage requirements , and their workers — who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers , the American Federation of Labor , against the union of the unskilled , the Congress of Industrial Organizations . Amid the unrest , the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18 million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines ; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships . 
 The private shipyards , however , had their own labor problems , so much so that one author described the navy 's issues as " minimal " compared to their shipbuilding counterparts . This increased the price of the battleships to $ 60 million each , so the Bureau of Steam Engineering and Bureau of Construction and Repair recommended to their superiors that the $ 37 million tenders from the two navy yards be accepted . This was confirmed by Roosevelt , as the private shipyards ' bids were seen as unjustly inflated . The contracts for North Carolina and Washington — names had been officially chosen on 3 May 1937 — were sent to the New York and Philadelphia yards , respectively , on 24 June 1937 . Shortly after this announcement , Roosevelt was bombarded with heavy lobbying from citizens and politicians from Camden and the state of New Jersey , in an ultimately futile attempt to have the construction of North Carolina shifted to Camden 's New York Shipbuilding ; such a contract would keep many men employed in that area . Roosevelt refused , saying that the disparity in price was too great . Instead , the company was awarded two destroyer tenders in December 1937 , Dixie and Prairie . 
 Construction of the North Carolina class was slowed by the aforementioned material issues , the changes made to the basic design after this date — namely the substitution of 16 @-@ inch for 14 @-@ inch guns — and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards . Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design , as it could have reduced the ships ' structural weight by 10 % , but it was only utilized in about 30 % of the ship . The costs associated with welding and an increase in the time of construction made it impractical .

 USS North Carolina ( BB @-@ 55 ) was laid down on 27 October 1937 , the first battleship begun by the United States since the never @-@ completed South Dakota class of the early 1920s . Although North Carolina was launched on 13 June 1940 and commissioned on 9 April 1941 , it did not go on active duty because of acute longitudinal vibrations from its propeller shafts . A problem shared with its sister Washington and some other ships like Atlanta , it was only cured after different propellers were tested aboard North Carolina , including four @-@ bladed and cut @-@ down versions of the original three @-@ bladed . This testing required it to be at sea , and the many resulting trips out of New York Harbor to the Atlantic Ocean caused it to be nicknamed " The Showboat " . 
 After a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea and participation in war exercises , North Carolina transited the Panama Canal en route to the Pacific War . Joining Task Force ( TF ) 16 , the battleship escorted the aircraft carrier Enterprise during the invasions of Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August 1942 , and continued to accompany the carrier when it moved to be southeast of the Solomons . The Battle of the Eastern Solomons began when Japanese carriers were spotted on 24 August ; although American planes were able to strike first by sinking the light carrier Ryūjō , a strike group from a different force , formed around the fleet carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku , attacked TF 16 . In an intense eight @-@ minute battle , North Carolina shot down 7 – 14 aircraft and was relatively undamaged , though there were seven near @-@ misses and one crewman was killed by strafing . Enterprise took three bomb hits . 
 North Carolina then joined the carrier Saratoga 's screen , and protected it while support was rendered to American troops fighting on Guadalcanal . Although it dodged one torpedo on 6 September , it was not able to avoid another on the 15th . Out of a six @-@ torpedo salvo from a Japanese submarine , three hit the carrier Wasp , one hit O 'Brien , one missed , and one struck North Carolina . A 660 lb ( 300 kg ) warhead hit on the port side 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline at a point that was just behind the number one turret . It created a 32 x 18 ft ( 9 @.@ 8 x 5 @.@ 5 m ) hole , allowed about 970 long tons ( 990 t ) of water into the ship — which had to be offset with counter @-@ flooding , meaning that another 480 long tons ( 490 t ) entered — killed five men , and wounded twenty . Although North Carolina could steam at 24 knots ( 28 mph ; 44 km / h ) soon after the explosion , it was later forced to slow to 18 knots ( 21 mph ; 33 km / h ) to ensure that temporary shoring did not fail . Structural damage beneath the first turret rendered it unable to fire unless in absolute need , and the main search radar failed . As this was the first torpedo to strike a modern American battleship , it elicited a large amount of interest from various officers and bureaus within the navy . It was seen as a vindication by some who believed that too much had been sacrificed in the design of the ships — the torpedo defense system had come close to breaking near one of the most important areas of the ship ( a magazine ) , after all — and the General Board called for the fifth and sixth Iowa @-@ class battleships , Illinois and Kentucky , to have a torpedo bulge added outside its magazines . However , the new Bureau of Ships opposed this on the basis that the system performed as it was supposed to ; in any case , no modifications were made . 
 Repaired and refitted at the facilities in Pearl Harbor , North Carolina operated as a carrier escort for Enterprise and Saratoga for the remainder of 1942 and the majority of 1943 while they provided cover for supply and troop movements in the Solomons . In between , it received advanced fire control and radar gear in March , April and September 1943 at Pearl Harbor . In November , North Carolina escorted Enterprise while the carrier launched strikes upon Makin , Tarawa and <unk> . On 1 – 8 December it bombarded Nauru before returning to carrier screening ; it accompanied Bunker Hill while that carrier launched attacks on Kavieng and New Ireland . 
 Joining Task Force 58 in January 1944 , North Carolina escorted aircraft carriers as the flagship of Admiral Willis A. Lee for much of the year , providing support for airborne strikes on Kwajalein , Namur , Truk ( twice ) , Saipan , Tinian , Guam , Palau , Woleai , and Hollandia in January – April . Also in April , North Carolina destroyed defensive installations on Ponape before setting course for Pearl Harbor for repairs to a damaged rudder . With repairs completed , the battleship joined with Enterprise on 6 June for assaults within the Marianas ; as part of these , North Carolina used its main battery to bombard Saipan and <unk> . 
 In late June , North Carolina was one of the American ships which took part in the so @-@ called " Marianas Turkey Shoot " , where a majority of attacking Japanese aircraft were shot down out of the air at little cost to the American defenders . Problems with its propeller shafts then caused the battleship to sail to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to receive an overhaul . It returned to active duty in November and to its carrier escort tasks in time to be hit by a typhoon . North Carolina protected carriers while they provided air cover for invasion fleets and launched attacks on Leyte , Luzon , and the Visayas . Surviving another typhoon , one which sank three destroyers , North Carolina continued escort duty when naval aircraft struck Formosa , Indo @-@ China , China , the Ryukyus and Honshu in January and February 1945 . During the invasion of Iwo Jima , the battleship provided bombardment support for troops ashore . 
 During the assault on Okinawa , North Carolina screened carriers and bombarded targets ashore . Although it was able to shoot down three kamikazes on 6 April , it also was struck by a 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) shell during that time in a friendly fire incident ; three were killed and forty @-@ four injured . The battleship shot down a plane on the 7th and two on the 17th . After receiving another overhaul from 9 May to 28 June , this one in the naval yard at Pearl Harbor , North Carolina operated as both a carrier escort and shore bombardier for the remainder of the war . Of note was a 17 July bombardment of the industrial area in Hitachi , Ibaraki in company with fellow battleships Alabama , Missouri , Wisconsin and HMS King George V , along with smaller warships . 
 In August , members of North Carolina 's crew and Marine contingent were sent ashore to assist in occupying Japan . After the official surrender , these men were brought back aboard and the battleship sailed to Okinawa . As part of Operation " Magic Carpet " , soldiers were embarked to be returned to the United States . Passing through the locks of Panama Canal on 8 October , it weighed anchor in Boston on the 17th . After an overhaul in the New York Naval Yard , it participated in exercises off New England before beginning a midshipman training cruise in the Caribbean . 
 North Carolina was decommissioned in Bayonne , New Jersey on 27 June 1947 ; it remained in the reserve fleet in until 1 June 1960 , when it was struck from the Naval Vessel Register . Instead of the scrapping that faced most of the United States ' battleships , North Carolina was sold to the state of North Carolina for $ 250 @,@ 000 on 8 August 1961 to be a museum ship. it was dedicated in Wilmington on 29 April 1962 as a memorial to the citizens of the state who died in the Second World War . Listed on the United States ' National Register of Historic Places and designated as a National Historic Landmark on 1 January 1986 , it remains there today , maintained by the USS North Carolina Battleship Commission . 
 = = = Washington = = = 
 USS Washington ( BB @-@ 56 ) was laid down on 14 June 1938 , launched on 1 June 1940 and commissioned on 15 May 1941 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard . Although commissioned , its engine had not been run at full power — like its sister , Washington had major problems with longitudinal vibrations , which were only tempered after many tests conducted aboard North Carolina . The fixes made it possible to run builder 's trials , which Washington did on 3 August 1941 ; loaded at about 44 @,@ 400 long tons ( 45 @,@ 100 t ) , the propulsion plant was run up to 123 @,@ 850 shp , and repeated the performance again in February 1942 , achieving 127 @,@ 100 and 121 @,@ 000 shp . 
 In early 1942 Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox chose Washington as the flagship of Task Force 39 . On 26 March 1942 , Washington , along with Wasp , Wichita , Tuscaloosa and various smaller ships , sailed to bolster the British Home Fleet . During the voyage , Wilcox fell into the ocean ; he was seen soon after by the destroyer Wilson , face down in the water , but due to rough seas was unable to retrieve the body . It is not known what exactly happened ; he could have simply been caught by a wave and washed overboard , but there has been speculation that he suffered a heart attack . The force reached the main anchorage of the Home Fleet , Scapa Flow , on 4 April . 
 Washington and the other ships of TF 39 participated in exercises with the Home Fleet until late April . Along with certain British units , the task force departed the British Isles as TF 99 . They escorted some of the Arctic convoys which were carrying vital cargo to the Soviet Union . While carrying out this duty , an accompanying British battleship , HMS King George V , accidentally rammed a destroyer , cutting it in two . Directly behind King George V , Washington passed through the same stretch of sea and received damage from exploding depth charges . Though damage to the hull was minimal — limited to only one leaking fuel tank — many devices on board the ship were damaged , including main battery range finders , circuit breakers , three fire @-@ control and the search radars . The American ships then put in at an Icelandic port , Hvalfjörður , until 15 May ; they returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June . On 4 June , Washington hosted the commander of naval forces in Europe , Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark , who set up a temporary headquarters on the ship for the next few days . On 7 June , King George VI of the United Kingdom inspected the battleship . 
 Washington left the North Sea bound for the United States on 14 July with an escort of four destroyers ; upon arrival at the New York Naval Yard on the 23rd , it was given a full overhaul which took a month to be <unk> it set sail for the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean on 23 August and reached its destination , Tonga Island , on 14 September , where it became the flagship of Admiral Willis " Ching " Lee . Over the coming months , Washington would be focused upon the safe arrival of supply convoys to the men fighting on Guadalcanal . On 13 November , three formations of Japanese ships were discovered on course for Guadalcanal , one of them aiming to bombard Henderson Field while night gave them protection from aircraft . The first Japanese bombardment force was driven back by an American cruiser @-@ destroyer force . On 14 November , the Japanese organized another sortie to neutralize the airfield . Washington , South Dakota , and four destroyers were sent to intercept the Japanese force that night . The Japanese , composed of the fast battleship Kirishima , two heavy cruisers , two light cruisers , and nine destroyers , initially sank three US destroyers and inflicted significant topside damage to South Dakota . However , Washington remained undetected and at midnight fired on Kirishima from 5 @,@ 800 yards ( 5 @,@ 300 m ) , point blank range for Washington 's 16 @-@ inch / 45 @-@ caliber guns . Washington fired seventy @-@ five 16 @-@ inch and one hundred and seven 5 @-@ inch rounds during the melee , scoring 20 main and seventeen secondary battery hits , knocking out its steering and main battery and causing uncontrollable progressive flooding . Kirishima capsized at 03 : 25 on the morning of 15 November 1942 , with 212 crewmen lost . Radar @-@ directed fire from Washington 's secondary battery also damaged destroyer Ayanami so severely it had to be scuttled . Soon after the battle , the Japanese began evacuating Guadalcanal . 
 Until April 1943 , Washington stayed near its base in New Caledonia , providing protection for convoys and battle groups that were supporting the Solomons campaign . Returning to Pearl Harbor , it practiced for battle and underwent an overhaul before returning to the combat zone in late July . From August to the end of October , Washington operated out of <unk> it then joined with four battleships and six destroyers as Task Group ( TG ) 53 @.@ 2 for exercises ; Enterprise , Essex and Independence also participated . TG 52 @.@ 2 then voyaged to the Gilbert Islands to add additional firepower to the strikes currently hitting them . Departing in late November , Washington steamed to first Makin to provide protection for ships there , then Ocean Island to prepare to bombard Nauru with its sister North Carolina , all four South Dakota @-@ class battleships , and the carriers Bunker Hill and Monterey . All of the capital ships struck before dawn on 8 December ; the aircraft carriers struck again soon after . The ships then sailed back to Efate , arriving on 12 December . On Christmas , Washington , North Carolina , and four destroyers left Efate for gunnery practice . By late January , it was made part of TG 50 @.@ 1 to escort the fast carriers in that group as they launched strikes on <unk> and <unk> it also moved in to hit Kwajalein with its guns on 30 January . 
 Before dawn on 1 February , with the sky still shrouded in darkness , Washington collided with Indiana when the latter left formation to fuel four destroyers . Indiana had radioed that it was going to make a turn to port out of the formation , but soon after starting the turn , its captain ordered a reversal , back to starboard . About seven minutes later , it came into view of lookouts aboard Washington at a range of 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ; 910 m ) . Although crews on both ships frantically tried to avoid the other , it was to no avail ; Washington gave Indiana a glancing blow , scraping down a large aft portion of the ship 's starboard side . Washington 's fore end was severely damaged , with about 60 ft ( 18 m ) of its bow hanging down and into the water . Ten men , six from Washington , were killed or listed as missing . After temporary reinforcements to the damaged section , it was forced to sail to Pearl Harbor to be fitted with a false bow to make possible a voyage to Puget Sound . Once there , it received a full overhaul , along with a new bow ; this work lasted from March until April . Washington did not enter the war zone again until late May . 
 Washington next participated in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign , serving again as a carrier escort ship , though it was detached on the 13th to fire on Japanese positions on Saipan and Tinian . With the sortie of a majority of the remaining ships in the Imperial Japanese Navy spotted by American submarines , Washington , along with six other battleships , four heavy cruisers and fourteen destroyers covered the aircraft carriers of TF 58 ; on the 19th , with the attack of many aircraft , the Battle of the Philippine Sea began . Able to beat off the attacks , Washington refueled and continued escorting carriers until she , with three battleships and escorts , formed a new task group . After a lengthy stop at Enewetak Atoll , it supported troops assaulting Peleliu and Angaur before returning to screening duties . This duty lasted from 10 October to 17 February 1945 . 
 The battleship bombarded Iwo Jima from 19 – 22 February in support of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of Kyūshū . On 24 March and 19 April , Washington bombarded Okinawa ; it then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit , having been in action for the majority of the time since its refit in March – April 1944 . This lasted through V @-@ J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard Missouri , so Washington received orders to voyage to Philadelphia , where it arrived on 17 October . Here it was modified to have an additional 145 bunks , so that it could participate in Operation Magic Carpet . Sailing to Southampton with a reduced crew of 84 officers and 835 crew , it brought 185 army officers and 1 @,@ 479 enlisted men back to the United States ; this was the only voyage it would make in support of the operation . The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne , New Jersey on 27 June 1947 , after only a little more than six years of service . Washington was never reactivated . Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960 — exactly 21 years to the day since its launch — she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be scrapped . 
 = = Post @-@ war alterations and proposals = = 
 North Carolina and Washington remained in active duty in the years immediately after the war , possibly because they were more comfortable and less cramped than the four South Dakotas . The ships received alterations during this period ; the Ship Characteristics Board ( SCB ) directed in June 1946 that four of the quadruple @-@ mounted 40 mm guns be removed , though only two were actually taken off each ship . The 20 mm weapons were also reduced at some point so that both ships were decommissioned with sixteen twin mounts . North Carolina and Washington were decommissioned on 27 June 1947 and subsequently moved to the reserve fleet . 
 In May 1954 , SCB created a class improvement plan for the North Carolinas which included twenty @-@ four 3 in / 50 guns directed by six Mark <unk> . A month later , the SCB chairman voiced his belief that the North Carolinas and South Dakotas would be excellent additions to task forces — if they could be faster . The Bureau of Ships then considered and discarded designs that would move these ships at 31 knots ( 36 mph ; 57 km / h ) , four knots faster than their current attainable speed . In order for a North Carolina to obtain 31 knots , 240 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( shp ) would be required . This , in turn , would necessitate the installation of an extremely large power plant , one which would not fit into the ship even if the third turret was removed . If the outer external belt armor were removed , 216 @,@ 000 shp would still be required . However , no matter if the belt was taken off or not , all of the hull form aft would have to be greatly modified to accept larger propellers . The last strike against the project was the high estimated cost of $ 40 million — which did not include the cost of activating battleships that had been out of commission for ten years . 
 Later calculations proved that the North Carolinas could be lightened from 44 @,@ 377 to around 40 @,@ 541 long tons ( 41 @,@ 192 t ) , at which 210 @,@ 000 shp would suffice . At the trial displacement figure of 38 @,@ 400 long tons ( 39 @,@ 000 t ) , even 186 @,@ 000 shp would be enough ; the 210 @,@ 000 figure was derived from a 12 @.@ 5 % overestimation to account for a fouled bottom or bad weather . A similar power plant to the one used in the Iowa class ( generating 212 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ) would be enough , and if the third turret was removed there would be no problems with weight , but there was not enough space within the North Carolinas . When compared , the current power plant measured 176 × 70 × 24 , but the Iowa 's was 256 × 72 × 26 . Lastly , there would be an issue with the propellers ; the Iowa class ' were 19 ft ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) wide , while the North Carolina 's were 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) . In the end , no conversions were undertaken . 
 Designs for helicopter carriers also contained a plan for a conversion of the North Carolinas . At a cost of $ 30 @,@ 790 @,@ 000 , the ships would have been able to embark 28 helicopters , 1 @,@ 880 troops , 530 long tons ( 540 t ) of cargo and 200 @,@ 000 US gal ( 760 @,@ 000 L ) of oil . All of the 16 @-@ inch and 5 @-@ inch guns would have been removed , though the number one turret would have remained so that weights added on the stern half of the ship could be balanced . In place , the ships would have received sixteen 3 @-@ inch guns in twin mounts . Displacement would be lowered slightly to a fully loaded weight of about 41 @,@ 930 long tons ( 42 @,@ 600 t ) , while speed would not have changed . It was estimated that the ships could serve for about fifteen to twenty years at a cost of about $ 440 @,@ 000 a year for maintenance . However , it was found that a purpose @-@ built helicopter carrier would be more economical , so the plans were shelved .

 Shadow of the Colossus , released in Japan as Wander and the Colossus ( Japanese : ワンダと巨像 , Hepburn : Wanda to Kyozō ) , is an action @-@ adventure video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment ( SCEI ) for the PlayStation 2 . The game was released in North America and Japan in October 2005 and PAL territories in February 2006 . It was directed by Fumito Ueda and developed at SCEI 's International Production Studio 1 , also known as Team Ico ; the same development team responsible for the cult hit Ico . , which the game is considered a spiritual successor to . An HD remastered version developed by Bluepoint Games , that collects both games was released as The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection ( ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Classics HD in the PAL region ) for the PlayStation 3 in September 2011 ; it features high @-@ definition ( HD ) graphics , content previously missing from the North American version , PlayStation Network Trophies , and 3D support . The HD version was released separately in Japan . 
 The game 's storyline focuses on a young man named Wander who enters a forbidden land . Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings , known simply as colossi , in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono . The game is unusual within the action @-@ adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore , no characters with which to interact , and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi . Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game , as each colossus ' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated . 
 Cited as an influential title in the video game industry , Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs , immersive gameplay and emotional journey . It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico , due in part to a larger marketing campaign . The soundtrack was also widely praised . The game won several awards for its audio , design , and overall quality . Today , the game is widely regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time . Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 = = = Basics = = = 
 Progression through Shadow of the Colossus occurs in cycles . Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape , the player seeks out and defeats a colossus , and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process . To find each colossus , Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light , which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter . The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter : stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way . Most colossi are located in remote areas , such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures . 
 Once a colossus is found , the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it . Each colossus dwells in a unique lair , and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment . Every colossus has at least one weak point , indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword 's reflected light . Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges , which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him . While scaling a colossus , the player must act quickly , as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature . 
 Wander and the colossi have life bars to indicate their remaining health . A colossus ' health will decrease significantly when its weak points are attacked , while Wander can be harmed by a colossus ' attacks or a fall from great height . Throughout the game , Wander is equipped with only a sword and a bow with arrows , but may obtain other weapons from completing the Time Attack trials . 
 While the colossi are the only enemies , there are natural animals in the environment . Only one species , however , has any effect on gameplay : eating the tail of a certain kind of lizard increases Wander 's stamina gauge . Likewise , the player may find fruit that increases Wander 's maximum health . 
 = = = Agro and the environment = = = 
 Wander 's horse , Agro , plays a large role in the game . In addition to serving as a means of transportation , fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi . There are , however , many environments that cannot be traversed by horse , and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled . Agro cannot travel beyond these , and when separated from Wander by such obstacles , cannot participate in the following battle . Agro is referred to as a male in the English @-@ language version of the game , though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander 's horse as female . 
 The environment must be used to the player 's advantage more often as the game progresses . The first two battles take place on simple , large , flat areas of land , with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points . However , the majority of the following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used . 
 = = Plot and setting = = 
 During Shadow of the Colossus , the player receives little information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another . The game takes place in a fantasy setting , with most of the game 's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula , known as the Forbidden Land , separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east . The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement . 
 The region is only accessible via a small cleft in the mountains to the north , leading to a massive stone bridge . This bridge spans half the distance of the landscape and terminates at a large temple called the " Shrine of Worship " located at its center . It is , however , forbidden to enter the land , which is characterized by diverse geographical features , such as lakes , plateaus , canyons , caves , and deserts in addition to human @-@ made structures . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The protagonist of the game is Wander ( <unk> , Wanda , voiced by Kenji Nojima ) , a young man whose goal is to resurrect a girl named Mono ( <unk> , voiced by Hitomi <unk> ) . Little is known about Mono other than that she was a maiden who was somehow sacrificed because she was believed to have a cursed destiny . Wander and Mono were designed with long hair from the start of the design process , with Mono 's long hair specifically as a contrast to Yorda of Ico , who has short hair . Assisting Wander in his quest to revive her is his loyal horse , Agro ( <unk> , <unk> ) , who serves as his only ally in defeating the colossi . Wander also receives aid from an entity called Dormin ( <unk> , <unk> , voiced by Kazuhiro Nakata and Kyōko Hikami ) . The story revolves around these characters but features a small supporting cast including Lord Emon ( <unk> , voiced by Naoki Bandō ) . 
 Speaking with two voices at once ( one male and one female ) , Dormin is a mysterious , disembodied entity . In legends of the game 's world , it is said that Dormin has the power to revive the dead ; it is for this reason that Wander enters the forbidden land , seeking its assistance in reviving Mono . Dormin offers to revive her in exchange for Wander destroying the sixteen colossi . " Dormin " , which spells " Nimrod " backwards , has been speculated to be a reference to the body of the biblical King Nimrod which was cut up and scattered . 
 Lord Emon is a shaman who narrates a vision in the game 's introduction , vaguely explaining the origin of the land Wander has come to , and emphasising that entry to this place is forbidden . He is portrayed as having extensive knowledge regarding the containment of Dormin , and the ability to use powerful magic . He has a small group of warriors at his command , and is pursuing Wander to prevent the use of " the forbidden spell " , the ritual involving the destruction of the sixteen colossi and the restoration of Dormin 's power . 
 The colossi are armored , most often enormous creatures with forms ranging from various humanoids to predatory animals , and live in all manner of surroundings and environments including beneath water and flying through the air . Their bodies are a fusion of organic and inorganic parts such as rock , earth , fur , and architectural elements , some of which are weathered or fractured . Some colossi are peaceful and will only attack when provoked , while others are aggressive and will attack on sight . Inhabiting specific locations in the forbidden land , they do not venture outside their own territory . Once slain they will remain where fallen , as a mound of earth and rock vaguely resembling the original colossus . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land , traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse , Agro . According to Lord Emon later in the game , prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword , which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land . Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region , Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono . A moment later , several man @-@ like shadowy creatures appear and prepare to attack Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession . After vanquishing the shadow creatures , the voice of the disembodied entity known as " Dormin " echoes from above , expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon . Wander requests that Dormin return Mono 's soul to her body , which it states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple 's hall by using the ancient sword to kill the sixteen colossi located throughout the land . Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono , Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them . 
 What Wander does not know is that the colossi contain portions of Dormin 's own essence that was scattered long ago to render the entity powerless . As Wander kills each colossus , a released fragment of Dormin enters his body . In time , after slaying his eighth colossus , the signs of Wander 's deterioration from the gathered essence is shown clearly — his skin becoming paler , his hair darker , and dark streaks growing across his face . After the death of the twelfth colossus , it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon . Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin , Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus . On the way to this confrontation , he travels on horseback across a long bridge which begins to collapse as he is halfway across . At the last second when it seems he will not make it , Wander is thrown to the other side by Agro as the steed saves her master while falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way . 
 Soon after , Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus as Emon 's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship to witness the last temple idol crumble . With a paled and horned Wander appearing soon , Emon orders his warriors to kill the " possessed " man as he approaches Mono and finally falls once stabbed through the heart . However , Emon finds a newly whole Dormin possessing Wander 's body and transforming its host into a shadowy giant . While his men flee , Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple 's hall to evoke a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander . After fleeing with the bridge connecting to the temple collapsing behind them , forever isolating the forbidden land from the rest of the world , Emon expresses hope that Wander may be able to atone for his crimes should he have survived . Back in the temple , the revived Mono awakens and finds Agro limping into the temple with an injured hind leg . Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon 's spell , finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head . She takes the child with her , following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship , and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends . 
 = = = Connections to Ico = = = 
 Shadow of the Colossus is considered both a spiritual successor and prequel to Ico . For several months during and after the game 's release , the game 's director and lead designer , Fumito Ueda , maintained that the game 's status as a prequel was simply his personal take on the game and not necessarily its canon nature , as he largely intended for players to decide the specifics of the story for themselves , but he confirmed the two do have a connection . Moreover , the shadowy figures which appear in the Shrine of Worship are connected to the shadows which the player must fight in Ico . Both games feature " horned " characters for protagonists ( Wander sprouts horns at the end of the game ) . The Queen 's Sword from Ico is also available as a bonus unlockable item . Both games also use unique fictional languages . 
 = = Development = = 
 With a team of thirty @-@ five people , Shadow of the Colossus began development in 2002 under the project name Nico ( a portmanteau of " Next Ico " ) and was intended to be a sequel to Ico . An early technology demo for the project shown at the DICE Summit in 2003 depicted a group of masked , horned boys riding horses while attacking and defeating a colossus . However , Fumito Ueda expressed that , at the time , it was simpler to reuse the character design of Ico 's protagonist , and that he never explicitly desired a sequel to Ico . Japanese pre @-@ orders of Shadow of the Colossus later included a bonus DVD with the concept video , a trailer describing Nico 's plot , and an introduction the development team states they wanted to use in Shadow of the Colossus . 
 Ueda and producer Kenji Kaido held their team to a high standard throughout production . An admitted perfectionist , Ueda felt that only one or two out of 500 artists who applied to work on Shadow of the Colossus met his criteria , and often demanded thorough changes in design until it matched his vision . For his part , Kaido challenged the programmers to meet the concept of realistic physics in relation to the movement of the colossi and the subsequent effect this movement would have for Wander , both in terms of how he might be displaced and how he may be able to use this movement to his advantage . For instance , if a colossus were to shake , Kaido wanted Wander 's position to shift realistically in response . Additionally , if a colossus ' limb was currently horizontal , Kaido wanted the player to be able to run across the limb as though it were any other flat surface . He referred to these two concepts as " player dynamics and reactions " and " organic collision deformation " . The realistic physics engine produced as a result required that faster colossi had to be smaller as well . 
 Ueda wished the game to have a unique presentation and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what bosses should be in video games . To achieve this , he ensured that the game 's only enemies would be the sixteen colossi , that they could only be approached one at a time , and that they would have various behavior patterns . Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others , Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers ' focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible . In accordance with this focus upon the colossi — and his preference for simple controls — he intended that one button on the game controller be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles . 
 A theme of companionship between the player and an AI @-@ controlled partner was a concern for Ueda . In Ico , this theme was presented through the protagonist and the character Yorda , whom the player was required to work with and protect while navigating the game 's environments . Similarly , a key element in Shadow of the Colossus is the relationship between Wander and his horse , Agro . Intended to be a realistic representation of a horse , Agro will occasionally ignore commands . In Ueda 's words , " a real horse ... doesn 't always obey . It 's not like a car or a motorcycle , it won 't always turn when you say ' turn ! ' " However , he has admitted that the team had to seek a balance in how often Agro did not respond to commands so as to not sacrifice playability in the pursuit of realism . 
 All elements of the game — including audio , gameplay and visuals — were used to achieve an atmosphere of a " lonely hero " , which Ueda considered important in the development of the game . Lighting , in particular , was used to establish a dark , fearsome setting for the forbidden land , while the protagonist 's sword would provide a means of navigation that was " direct and only expressible visually " . Like Ico , Shadow of the Colossus uses a distinct style of lighting . The game 's engine uses elements such as desaturated colors , motion blur and partial high dynamic range rendering , with a heavy emphasis on bloom lighting . 
 A PlayStation 3 remastered version of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2010 and released in September 2011 . Developed by Bluepoint Games , both were improved graphically to take advantage of the PlayStation 3 's hardware and HDTVs , and now run in up to 1920x1080 ( Ico ) or upscaled from <unk> ( Shadow of the Colossus ) , with numerous other improvements implemented . 
 = = Audio = = 
 While the game has an extensive orchestral soundtrack , the music is only heard during cut scenes and colossus encounters , while time spent at the Shrine of Worship and traversing the landscape is silent save for the sounds made by the protagonist , his horse and their surroundings . The open nature of the game world and lack of life , coupled with this limited use of music , aids in establishing an atmosphere of solitude , similar to that of Ico . 
 On December 7 , 2005 , a soundtrack album containing music from the game was released only in Japan , titled Wander and the Colossus Original Soundtrack : Roar of the Earth ( Japanese : ワンダと巨像 オリジナル <unk> , Hepburn : Wanda to Kyozō Original Soundtrack : Daichi no Hōkō ) . There are currently no announced plans to release the album in other territories . The game 's score was composed by Kow Otani , whose previous video game work included the soundtracks to the PlayStation 2 flight simulator Sky Odyssey and the PlayStation shooter <unk> . He has also worked on several of the 1990s @-@ era Gamera films , as well as a variety of anime . Roar of the Earth won the award for " Soundtrack of the Year " in the US @-@ based video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly . 
 All music composed by Kow Otani . 
 = = PAL release = = 
 The PAL version of the game was released in February 2006 . Much like the PAL release for Ico , the game came in cardboard packaging displaying various pieces of artwork from the game , and contained four art cards . 
 The game also came with a " making of " documentary , a trailer for Ico and a gallery of concept art , accessible from the game 's main menu . Sony Computer Entertainment also re @-@ released Ico in PAL territories at the time of Shadow of the Colossus 's release , both to promote the game through Ico 's reputation , and to allow players who did not buy Ico during its original limited release to " complete their collections " . 
 Some confusion has arisen in PAL regions concerning the official name of the protagonist primarily because of the manual 's usage of " Wanda " , while the North American manual and the game itself uses the name " Wander " . In fact , the Japanese version of the game spells the name " Wander " as <unk> ( Wanda ) , which is also the common transliteration of the English name " Wanda " , hence the mistake in the manual . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Shadow of the Colossus 's commercial reception was positive , with sales of 140 @,@ 000 copies in its first week at retail in Japan , reaching number one in the charts . Almost 80 % of the initial Japanese shipment was sold within two days . These figures compare favorably with Ico , which was well received by critics but failed to sell a significant number of units . The game was placed on Sony 's list of Greatest Hits titles on August 6 , 2006 . 
 Unlike Ico , Shadow of the Colossus received far more exposure , due in part to Sony putting its weight behind a massive advertising campaign . It was advertised in game magazines , on television and on the internet , including a viral marketing campaign launched in October 2005 . The site posted links to several websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world . The website has since been taken down . Some speculate that Ico 's sales figures could have been improved if similar advertising efforts were made before its release . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Shadow of the Colossus received critical acclaim , with an average critic score of 91 % at GameRankings , making it the 11th @-@ highest rated game of 2005 . These include the Japanese magazine Famitsu , who rated the game 37 / 40 , the UK @-@ based Edge , who awarded an 8 / 10 , and Electronic Gaming Monthly , who granted 8 @.@ 8 / 10 . GameSpot 's review gave it an 8 @.@ 7 , commenting that " the game 's aesthetic presentation is unparalleled , by any standard " , while multimedia website IGN hailed the game as " an amazing experience " and " an absolute must @-@ have title " , rating it 9 @.@ 7 / 10 . GameSpy described it as " possibly the most innovative and visually arresting game of the year for the PS2 " . A retrospective Edge article described the game as " a fiction of unquestionable thematic richness , of riveting emotional power , whose fundamental artistic qualities are completely fused with its interactivity . " Dave <unk> , a literature lecturer at the University of Otago , praised the game for its use of long cutscenes and stretches of riding to make the player engage in self @-@ reflection and feel immersed in the game world . 
 Many reviewers consider the game 's soundtrack to be one of its greatest aspects . In addition to Electronic Gaming Monthly 's award of " Soundtrack of the Year " , GameSpot commented that the musical score conveyed , and often intensified , the mood of any given situation , while it was described as " one of the finest game soundtracks ever " by a reviewer from Eurogamer . 
 However , the game has been criticised for its erratic frame rate , which is usually smooth while traversing the landscape , but often slows down in fast @-@ paced situations , such as colossus battles . Concern was also expressed about the game 's camera , which was described by GameSpy as being " as much of an opponent as the <unk> " , " manag [ ing ] to re @-@ center itself at the worst and most inopportune times " . Reviewers are often mixed about Agro 's AI and controls ; while gaming website Thunderbolt insists the realism of Agro 's movement and behaviour " create [ s ] a videogame experience unlike any other " , Edge commented that the controls were " clumsy , crude , and unpredictable " . Other critics like Game Revolution and GameSpot felt the game was too short ( average playthrough time estimated 6 to 8 hours ) , with little replay value given the puzzle elements to each colossus battle .

 Shadow of the Colossus has received several awards , including recognition for " Best Character Design " , " Best Game Design " , " Best Visual Arts " and " Game of the Year " , as well as one of three " Innovation Awards " at the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards . At the 2006 DICE Summit , the game won the award for " Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction " at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences , while it received one of two " Special Rookie Awards " at the Famitsu Awards 2005 . It was nominated for " Best Original Music " , " Best Artistic Graphics " and " Best PS2 Game " , yet also " Most <unk> Frame Rate " in GameSpot 's awards for 2005 , while it won " Best Adventure Game " and " Best Artistic Design " in IGN 's Best of 2005 awards , who cited Agro as the best sidekick in the history of video games . Two years after its release IGN listed Shadow as the second greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time . Games Radar awarded it Best Game of the Year 2006 ( being released in the UK in early 2006 , later than the US ) , and appears in the site 's " The 100 best games ever " list at number ten . The game 's ending was selected as the fourth greatest moment in gaming by the editors of GamePro in July 2006 . The readers of PlayStation Official Magazine voted it the 8th greatest PlayStation title ever released . Destructoid named the game # 1 in their list of the top 50 video games of the decade . IGN named Shadow of the Colossus the best game of 2005 , and the second best game of the decade , behind Half @-@ Life 2 . In 2012 , Complex magazine named Shadow of the Colossus the second @-@ best PlayStation 2 game of all time , behind God of War II .

 The game plays a significant role in the 2007 Mike Binder film Reign Over Me as one of the ways Adam Sandler 's character copes with his primary struggle – with aspects of the game mirroring the tragedy that befell Sandler 's character ; Shadow of the Colossus falling giants mirroring the crashing towers of the September 11 attacks in which his wife and children died , and the game 's lead character trying to resurrect his deceased love are two of the main themes which strike a similarity .

 = Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women = 
 The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( OP @-@ CEDAW ) is an international treaty which establishes complaint and inquiry mechanisms for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) . Parties to the Protocol allow the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to hear complaints from individuals or inquire into " grave or systematic violations " of the Convention . The Protocol has led to a number of decisions against member states on issues such as domestic violence , parental leave and forced sterilization , as well as an investigation into the systematic killing of women in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez , Chihuahua . 
 The Protocol was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 6 October 1999 , and in force from 22 December 2000 . As of May 2016 , the Protocol has 80 signatories and 107 parties . 
 = = Genesis = = 
 In 1979 , the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) . The Convention outlawed discrimination against women , but did not include any mechanism by which this prohibition could be legally enforced . 
 An individual complaints mechanism was suggested during the original drafting of CEDAW , but was rejected at the time . Fifteen years later , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights suggested that new procedures were needed to implement the Convention , and suggested a " right of petition " . An independent expert group produced a draft in 1994 , containing a complaint procedure and an inquiry procedure , and this was adopted for further study by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in early 1995 . The idea of an Optional Protocol was further endorsed by the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 , which called for " the elaboration ( of ) a draft optional protocol to the Women 's Convention that could enter into force as soon as possible . " 
 In March 1996 the Commission on the Status of Women established an open @-@ ended working group to produce a formal draft . This reported back after three years of deliberation in early 1999 . The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women outlaws discrimination on the basis of gender , and obliges its parties to repeal discriminatory laws and guarantee equality in the fields of health , employment , and education . The Optional Protocol is a subsidiary agreement to the Convention . It does not establish any new rights , but rather allows the rights guaranteed in the Convention to be enforced . 
 Articles 1 – 7 create an individual complaints mechanism similar to those of the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination . Parties agree to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to consider complaints " by or on behalf of " individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Convention have been violated . If a complaint is submitted on behalf of a victim , then this requires their consent , unless the <unk> can justify acting without it . What constitutes " justification " in such a case is up to the Committee . The ability for complaints to be submitted on behalf of victims is seen as vital in allowing NGOs such as women 's organizations and human rights groups to use the Protocol to enforce the Convention . 
 <unk> must have exhausted all domestic remedies , and anonymous complaints and complaints referring to events which occurred before the country concerned joined the Optional Protocol are not permitted . The Committee can request information from and make recommendations to a party , though these are not binding . 
 Articles 8 – 10 create an inquiry mechanism . Parties may permit the Committee to investigate , report on and make recommendations on " grave or systematic violations " of the Convention . The Committee may invite the relevant party to respond and inform it of any measures taken as a result of such an inquiry , either directly or through the normal reporting process under the Convention . Parties may opt out of this obligation on signature or ratification , but only Bangladesh , Belize and Colombia have done so . 
 Article 11 requires parties to ensure that those complaining under the Optional Protocol are not subjected to ill @-@ treatment or intimidation . 
 Article 13 requires parties to inform their citizens about the Convention , the Optional Protocol , and the rulings of the Committee , so as to facilitate complaints . 
 Articles 12 and 14 govern the procedure and reporting of the Committee in handling complaints . 
 Articles 15 – 21 govern ratification , entry into force , and amendment of the Optional Protocol . 
 = = Reservations and membership = = 
 A number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Protocol . Bangladesh , Belize and Colombia have exercised their right under Article 10 of the Protocol not to recognise the jurisdiction of the Committee to investigate " grave or systematic violations " of the Convention . Colombia declares that neither the Protocol nor the Committee can require it to decriminalise " offences against life or personal integrity " . 
 Not every state which is a party to CEDAW is a party to the Protocol , and several major states still remain outside the Protocol . The United States has not become a signatory because it has not yet ratified CEDAW . Japan does not participate in any of the individual communications mechanisms for human rights treaties , but is currently considering joining while observing how these procedures are functioning . China is currently " studying the problem of accession to the Optional Protocol " . 
 = = Individual complaints = = 
 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has considered eleven complaints against seven countries since the Optional Protocol came into force , on subjects such as domestic violence , division of property , forced sterilization and parental leave . Six complaints were rejected for lack of jurisdiction or because the complainants had not exhausted all domestic remedies . The other five decisions are summarised below : 
 In 2005 , in the case of A.T. v. Hungary , the Committee ruled that Hungary had violated numerous articles of the Convention by failing to adequately protect women against domestic violence . It recommended that the complainant be immediately protected from her abusive former partner , and that Hungary improve its handling of domestic violence cases and immediately adopt the Committee 's previous recommendation for a law allowing protection and exclusion orders . The recommendations were implemented by the time of Hungary 's sixth periodic report to the Committee in 2006 . 
 In 2006 , in the case of Dung Thi Thuy Nguyen v. The Netherlands , the Committee expressed concerns about aspects of parental leave provisions in The Netherlands . It recommended the Dutch government collect further information on the number of women combining part @-@ time salaried employment with self @-@ employment , and review the law if this revealed that a significant number of women were disadvantaged . 
 In 2006 , in the case of A.S. vs Hungary , the Committee ruled that the forced sterilization of a Romani woman in Hungary violated the Convention . It recommended compensating the complainant for the breach of her rights , a full review of legislation surrounding informed consent in cases of sterilisation to ensure it complied with international human rights standards , and ongoing monitoring of Hungarian medical facilities to ensure that any changes were put into practice . 
 In 2007 , in the cases of <unk> <unk> ( deceased ) v. Austria and Fatma Yildirim ( deceased ) v. Austria , the Committee ruled that the Austrian government was failing to protect women from domestic violence . It recommended strengthening the implementation and monitoring of existing domestic violence laws and greater training for police . 
 = = Inquiries = = 
 The Committee has also conducted one inquiry into " grave or systematic violations " under Article 8 , in relation to the systematic killing of women in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez , Chihuahua . This found " serious lapses in compliance " by the Mexican government and tolerance of severe and systematic abuses of women 's rights . The Committee recommended the involvement of federal as well as state authorities in the investigation of the murders , the punishment of negligent or complicit officials and those involved in the persecution of victims ' relatives , and increased violence prevention plans . 
 = = Impact and criticism = = 
 The impact of an international treaty can be measured in two ways : by its acceptance , and by its implementation . On the first measure , the Optional Protocol has gained widespread international acceptance . Most major states are parties , and the Protocol is the second most @-@ accepted enforcement mechanism after the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
 On the second measure , the number of complaints dealt with by the Committee has been limited . A 2008 assessment for the UK government found that the Protocol had hardly been used by NGOs as originally expected , that the reasoning of the Committee was unpredictable , and that it had not had an impact on policy @-@ making . It found that there had been some limited success in highlighting the importance of effective policies to protect women from domestic violence and forced sterilization , but that outside these areas , the Protocol " has not led to a breakthrough in advancing women 's rights . " It concludes that unless greater efforts are made to highlight awareness of the Optional Protocol and build trust in the rulings of the Committee , the complaints mechanism will remain under @-@ utilized . 
 The Protocol has been criticised by legal academics such as Bal <unk> @-@ <unk> and feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon who view the complaints mechanism as difficult , lengthy , and lacking transparency . The voluntary nature of the Protocol and the non @-@ binding nature of its " recommendations " are seen as key limits on its effectiveness . Despite this , these critics tend to view the Protocol as a valuable , if flawed , instrument for realizing women 's rights .

 North Carolina Highway 68 ( NC 68 ) is a north – south state highway in North Carolina . It serves as a connector between Interstate 40 ( I @-@ 40 ) and Piedmont Triad International Airport ( via Bryan Boulevard ) . On its routing from Thomasville to Stokesdale , NC 68 passes through urban High Point , the western outskirts of Greensboro , and the town of Oak Ridge . The segment from just north of the I @-@ 40 interchange to Pleasant Ridge Road in Guilford County is a limited access freeway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Beginning in the south at Business I @-@ 85 / US 29 / US 70 , the route travels north out of Thomasville in Davidson County as National Highway , a name which referred to the former routing of US 29 / 70 ( later US 29A / 70A ) along this segment . Crossing from Davidson County into neighboring Guilford County and the city of High Point , NC 68 is cosigned with English Road . Approximately one mile within the city limits , NC 68 turns left onto Westchester Drive , a boulevard that bypasses High Point 's downtown area . Arriving at the Main Street interchange , the city 's busiest , NC 68 continues onto Eastchester Drive , another boulevard . After passing Oak Hollow Mall , I @-@ 74 / US 311 ( High Point East Belt ) , and the Wendover Avenue interchange , NC 68 and Eastchester Drive continue north into neighboring Greensboro . 
 Shortly after entering Greensboro , NC 68 meets Interstate 40 / US 421 , and becomes a limited access freeway after a traffic signal at Triad Center Drive . Continuing north as a divided four @-@ lane highway , NC 68 has junctions with W. Market Street ( Colfax exit ) and Bryan Boulevard , the exit for Piedmont Triad International Airport . The road downgrades to an undivided primary road at the Pleasant Ridge Road junction . From there , the route heads north through the heart of Oak Ridge , North Carolina , passing the Oak Ridge Military Academy at the route 's intersection with NC 150 . After crossing the Haw River into Stokesdale , NC 68 crosses US 158 and joins NC 65 for a short 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) concurrency , before splitting to the northeast en route to its northern terminus at NC 220 in Rockingham County . 
 = = History = = 
 The first NC 68 was an original state highway that traversed from NC 60 , in Millers Creek ( west of Wilkesboro ) , northwest through Glendale Springs , Jefferson and Crumpler , before crossing into Virginia . By 1928 , NC 68 was rerouted west of Jefferson onto new primary routing west to the Tennessee state line ; the old alignment becoming NC 681 . In 1929 , all of NC 68 was replaced by an extension of NC 16 . 
 The second and current NC 68 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing from US 70 / US 170 / NC 10 , northeast of High Point , to NC 65 , in Stokesdale . In 1936 , NC 68 was rerouted south through High Point to US 29A / US 70A ( Lexington Avenue ) ; its old alignment , along Penny Road , became a secondary road . In 1941 , NC 68 was extended north on new primary routing to US 220 ( Sylvania Road ) . 
 In 1952 , NC 68 was extended north to its current terminus with US 220 , replacing part of old US 220 . Between 1950 @-@ 1953 , NC 68 was extended south to English Street . In 1956 or 1957 , NC 68 was extended to its current southern terminus , sharing a concurrency with US 29A / US 70A , until 1991 . In 1982 , NC 68 was placed on new freeway connecting I @-@ 40 and the Piedmont Triad International Airport , its old alignment along Bull Road ( today 's Regional Road ) a secondary road .

 = Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact = 
 The cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science , technology , religion , politics , and ecosystems resulting from contact with an extraterrestrial civilization . Although closely related to it , the study of the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact is distinct from the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) , which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life . 
 The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type , based on the extraterrestrial civilization 's level of technological advancement , degree of benevolence or malevolence , and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity . The medium through which humanity is contacted , be it electromagnetic radiation , direct physical interaction , extraterrestrial artefact , or otherwise , may also influence the results of contact . Incorporating these factors , various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact . 
 The implications of extraterrestrial contact , particularly with a technologically superior civilization , have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth , a historical precedent being the Columbian Exchange . Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact ( as opposed to the " <unk> " , which initiates contact ) , and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome . However , the absence of verified public contact to date means such conjecture is largely speculative . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Search for extraterrestrial intelligence = = = 
 To detect extraterrestrial civilizations with radio telescopes , one must identify an artificial , coherent signal against a background of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves . Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek , California . Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past . Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate the most effective way to search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources , but the report 's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra @-@ Terrestrial Intelligence ( METI ) , the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept . NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs , which have since turned to private donations to continue their search . 
 With the discovery in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of numerous extrasolar planets , some of which may be habitable , governments have once more become interested in funding new programs . In 2006 the European Space Agency launched <unk> , the first spacecraft dedicated to the search for exoplanets , and in 2009 NASA launched the Kepler space observatory for the same purpose . By February 2013 Kepler had detected 105 of the 3 @,@ 472 confirmed exoplanets , and one of them , Kepler @-@ <unk> , is potentially habitable . After it was discovered , the SETI Institute resumed the search for an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization , focusing on Kepler 's candidate planets , with funding from the United States Air Force . 
 Newly discovered planets , particularly ones that are potentially habitable , have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence . In 2009 A Message From Earth ( <unk> ) was sent toward the Gliese 581 system , which contains two potentially habitable planets , the confirmed Gliese 581 d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581 g . In the <unk> project , which began in 2012 , human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference . The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope . 
 In addition to radio @-@ based methods , some projects , such as <unk> ( Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations ) at the University of California , Berkeley , are using other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals . Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals , but want to rather use electromagnetic radiation to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence , such as <unk> astroengineering projects . 
 Several signals , such as the Wow ! signal , have been detected in the history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , but none have yet been confirmed as being of intelligent origin . 
 = = = Impact assessment = = = 
 The implications of extraterrestrial contact depend on the method of discovery , the nature of the extraterrestrial beings , and their location relative to the Earth . Considering these factors , the Rio Scale has been devised in order to provide a more quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact . More specifically , the scale gauges whether communication was conducted through radio , the information content of any messages , and whether discovery arose from a deliberately beamed message ( and if so , whether the detection was the result of a specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations ) or by the detection of occurrences such as radiation leakage from astroengineering installations . The question of whether or not a purported extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed as authentic , and with what degree of confidence , will also influence the impact of the contact . The Rio Scale was modified in 2011 to include a consideration of whether contact was achieved through an interstellar message or through a physical extraterrestrial artifact , with a suggestion that the definition of artifact be expanded to include " <unk> " , including all indications of intelligent extraterrestrial life other than the interstellar radio messages sought by traditional SETI programs . 
 A study by astronomer Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar significance in the history of science . The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received , if any . It distinguishes short @-@ term and long @-@ term impact . Seeing radio @-@ based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft , the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information @-@ only contact , preferring events of profound scientific significance , such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions , as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact . 
 The physical distance between the two civilizations has also been used to assess the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact . Historical examples show that the greater the distance , the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture . Therefore , contact occurring within the Solar System , and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth , is likely to be the most disruptive and negative for humanity . On a smaller scale , people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away , and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter . Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence , one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history . 
 The beliefs of the general public about the effect of extraterrestrial contact have also been studied . A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about , inter alia , the participants ' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe , that such life may be intelligent , and that humans will eventually make contact with it . The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants ' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are . The more conservative the respondents , the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be . Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful . 
 = = = Post @-@ detection protocols = = = 
 Various protocols have been drawn up detailing a course of action for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact . Post @-@ detection protocols must address three issues : what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source ; whether or not to send a reply ; and analyzing the long @-@ term consequences of the message received . No post @-@ detection protocol , however , is binding under national or international law , and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs . 
 One of the first post @-@ detection protocols , the " Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence " , was created by the SETI Permanent Committee of the International Academy of Astronautics ( IAA ) . It was later approved by the Board of Trustees of the IAA and by the International Institute of Space Law , and still later by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , the Committee on Space Research , the International Union of Radio Science , and others . It was subsequently endorsed by most researchers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , including the SETI Institute . 
 The Declaration of Principles contains the following broad provisions : 
 Any person or organization detecting a signal should try to verify that it is likely to be of intelligent origin before announcing it . 
 The discoverer of a signal should , for the purposes of independent verification , communicate with other signatories of the Declaration before making a public announcement , and should also inform their national authorities . 
 Once a given astronomical observation has been determined to be a credible extraterrestrial signal , the astronomical community should be informed through the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the IAU . The Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations and various other global scientific unions should also be informed . 
 Following confirmation of an observation 's extraterrestrial origin , news of the discovery should be made public . The discoverer has the right to make the first public announcement . 
 All data confirming the discovery should be published to the international scientific community and stored in an accessible form as permanently as possible . 
 Should evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence take the form of electromagnetic signals , the Secretary @-@ General of the International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) should be contacted , and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the electromagnetic frequency bands in which the signal was detected . 
 Neither the discoverer nor anyone else should respond to an observed extraterrestrial intelligence ; doing so requires international agreement under separate procedures . 
 The SETI Permanent Committee of the IAA and Commission 51 of the IAU should continually review procedures regarding detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and management of data related to such discoveries . A committee comprising members from various international scientific unions , and other bodies designated by the committee , should regulate continued SETI research . 
 A separate " Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence " was subsequently created . It proposes an international commission , membership of which would be open to all interested nations , to be constituted on detection of extraterrestrial intelligence . This commission would decide whether to send a message to the extraterrestrial intelligence , and if so , would determine the contents of the message on the basis of principles such as justice , respect for cultural diversity , honesty , and respect for property and territory . The draft proposes to forbid the sending of any message by an individual nation or organization without the permission of the commission , and suggests that , if the detected intelligence poses a danger to human civilization , the United Nations Security Council should authorize any message to extraterrestrial intelligence . However , this proposal , like all others , has not been incorporated into national or international law . 
 Paul Davies , a member of the SETI Post @-@ Detection <unk> , has stated that post @-@ detection protocols , calling for international consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection , are unlikely to be followed by astronomers , who would put the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law . 
 = = Contact scenarios and considerations = = 
 Scientific literature and science fiction put forward various models of the ways in which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact . Their predictions range widely , from sophisticated civilizations that could advance human civilization in many areas to imperial powers that might draw upon the forces necessary to subjugate humanity . Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology , living instead inside of advanced computers . 
 The implications of discovery depend very much on the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity , its ethics , and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common . These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place . The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long @-@ term implications of contact . In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals , the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact , as would the extent of mutual comprehension . 
 = = = Friendly civilizations = = = 
 Many writers have speculated on the ways in which a friendly civilization might interact with humankind . Albert Harrison , a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California , Davis , thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything , how to use zero @-@ point energy , or how to travel faster than light . They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences , and even that artists may spearhead collaboration . Seth D. Baum , of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute , and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity . In contrast to these views , however , Paolo Musso , a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics ( IAA ) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences , took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess , like humans , a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well , thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile . 
 Futurist Allen Tough suggests that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization , recalling its own past of war and plunder and knowing that it possesses superweapons that could destroy it , would be likely to try to help humans rather than to destroy them . He identifies three approaches that a friendly civilization might take to help humanity : 
 Intervention only to avert catastrophe : this would involve occasional limited intervention to stop events that could destroy human civilization completely , such as nuclear war or asteroid impact . 
 Advice and action with consent : under this approach , the extraterrestrials would be more closely involved in terrestrial affairs , advising world leaders and acting with their consent to protect against danger . 
 Forcible corrective action : the extraterrestrials could require humanity to reduce major risks against its will , intending to help humans advance to the next stage of civilization . 
 Tough considers advising and acting only with consent to be a more likely choice than the forceful option . While coercive aid may be possible , and advanced extraterrestrials would recognize their own practices as superior to those of humanity , it may be unlikely that this method would be used in cultural cooperation . Lemarchand suggests that instruction of a civilization in its " technological adolescence " , such as humanity , would probably focus on morality and ethics rather than on science and technology , to ensure that the civilization did not destroy itself with technology it was not yet ready to use . 
 According to Tough , it is unlikely that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio , as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action . However , cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System , as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity . 
 Even if an ancient and advanced extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity , humans could suffer from a loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization . However , a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity in such a way as to minimize unintended consequences . Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity , to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace . 
 = = = Hostile civilizations = = = 
 Science fiction films often depict humans successfully repelling alien invasions , but scientists more often take the view that an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth would be able to destroy human civilization with minimal effort . Operations that are enormous on a human scale , such as destroying all major population centers on a planet , bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation , or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it , may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization . 
 Deardorff speculates that a small proportion of the intelligent life forms in the galaxy may be aggressive , but the actual aggressiveness or benevolence of the civilizations would cover a wide spectrum , with some civilizations " policing " others . According to Harrison and Dick , hostile extraterrestrial life may indeed be rare in the Universe , just as belligerent and autocratic nations on Earth have been the ones that lasted for the shortest periods of time , and humanity is seeing a shift away from these characteristics in its own sociopolitical systems . In addition , the causes of war may be diminished greatly for a civilization with access to the galaxy , as there are prodigious quantities of natural resources in space accessible without resort to violence . 
 SETI researcher Carl Sagan believed that a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to be able to avoid self @-@ destruction . Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect , and humanity , with its relatively backward technology , would have no choice but to reciprocate . Seth Shostak , an astronomer at the SETI Institute , disagrees , stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species , and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive . Similarly , <unk> <unk> claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth , an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity , much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia . 
 <unk> these analyses , David Brin states that while an extraterrestrial civilization may have an imperative to act for no benefit to itself , it would be naïve to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy . Brin points to the fact that in many moral systems on Earth , such as the Aztec or Carthaginian one , non @-@ military killing has been accepted and even " exalted " by society , and further mentions that such acts are not confined to humans but can be found throughout the animal kingdom . 
 Baum et al. speculate that highly advanced civilizations are unlikely to come to Earth to enslave humans , as the achievement of their level of advancement would have required them to solve the problems of labor and resources by other means , such as creating a sustainable environment and using mechanized labor . Moreover , humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials because of marked differences in biochemistry . For example , the chirality of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings . 
 Politicians have also commented on the likely human reaction to contact with hostile species . In his 1987 speech to the United Nations General Assembly , Ronald Reagan said , " I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world . " 
 = = = Equally advanced and more advanced civilizations = = = 
 Robert Freitas speculated in 1978 that the technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization , measured either relative to another civilization or in absolute terms by its rating on the Kardashev scale , may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact . Given the infeasibility of interstellar space flight for civilizations at a technological level similar to that of humanity , interactions between such civilizations would have to take place by radio . Because of the long transit times of radio waves between stars , such interactions would not lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations , nor any significant future interaction at all , between the two civilizations . 
 According to Freitas , direct contact with civilizations significantly more advanced than humanity would have to take place within the Solar System , as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space . Consequently , such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale , as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel . Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity . 
 However much planning an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity , the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival , especially as they would lack any understanding of the contacting civilization . Ben Finney compares the situation to that of the tribespeople of New Guinea , an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the last glacial period but saw little contact with the outside world until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The huge difference between the indigenous stone @-@ age society and the Europeans ' technical civilization caused unexpected behaviors among the native populations known as cargo cults : to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed , the natives created wooden " radio stations " and " airstrips " as a form of sympathetic magic . Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth , much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies . He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study , rather than as fast , sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines . 
 Billingham has suggested that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced , and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization . Such projects could include Dyson spheres , which completely enclose stars and capture all energy coming from them . Even if well within the capability of an advanced civilization and providing an enormous amount of energy , such a project would not be undertaken . For similar reasons , such civilizations would not readily give humanity the knowledge required to build such devices . Nevertheless , the existence of such capabilities would at least show that civilizations have survived " technological adolescence " . Despite the caution that such an advanced civilization would exercise in dealing with the less mature human civilization , Sagan imagined that an advanced civilization might send those on Earth an Encyclopædia Galactica describing the sciences and cultures of many extraterrestrial societies . 
 Whether an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message is a matter of debate in itself . Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message . Arguing against this view , astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that an advanced civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content , such as an Encyclopædia Galactica , in order to ensure that only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it . 
 = = = Interstellar groups of civilizations = = = 
 Given the age of the galaxy , Harrison surmises that there exist several " galactic clubs " , groupings of multiple civilizations from across the galaxy . Such clubs could begin as loose confederations or alliances , eventually developing into powerful unions of many civilizations . If humanity could enter into a dialogue with one extraterrestrial civilization , it might be able to join such a galactic club . As more extraterrestrial civilizations , or unions thereof , are found , these could also become assimilated into such a club . Sebastian von Hoerner has suggested that entry into a galactic club may be a way for humanity to handle the culture shock arising from contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization . 
 Whether a broad spectrum of civilizations from many places in the galaxy would even be able to cooperate is disputed by Michaud , who states that civilizations with huge differences in the technologies and resources at their command " may not consider themselves even remotely equal " . It is unlikely that humanity would meet the basic requirements for membership at its current low level of technological advancement . A galactic club may , William Hamilton speculates , set extremely high entrance requirements that are unlikely to be met by less advanced civilizations . 
 Michaud suggests that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might take the form of an empire , which need not necessarily be a force for evil , but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction . Owing to the distances between the stars , such an empire would not necessarily maintain control solely by military force , but may rather tolerate local cultures and institutions to the extent that these would not pose a threat to the central imperial authority . Such tolerance may , as has happened historically on Earth , extend to allowing nominal self @-@ rule of specific regions by existing institutions , while maintaining that area as a puppet or client state to accomplish the aims of the imperial power . However , particularly advanced powers may use methods , including faster @-@ than @-@ light travel , to make centralized administration more effective . 
 In contrast to the belief that an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire , Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward . In such an equilibrium , a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars , aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures . This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization , which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion . According to this view , advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction , but might more closely reflect the small , independent Greek city @-@ states , with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth . 
 = = = Extraterrestrial artifacts = = = 
 An extraterrestrial civilization may choose to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio , for various reasons . While probes may take a long time to reach the Solar System , once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light @-@ years away . Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization , and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity , artifacts may be the only option other than to send large , crewed spacecraft to the Solar System . 
 Although faster @-@ than @-@ light travel has been seriously considered by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre , Tough speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications . 2013 research at NASA 's Johnson Space Center , however , shows that faster @-@ than @-@ light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought , needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass @-@ energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light , in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter @-@ mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster @-@ than @-@ light spacecraft . 
 According to Tough , an extraterrestrial civilization might want to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts , such as an Encyclopædia Galactica , containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures , or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them . A civilization that sees itself on the brink of decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy , with its cultures , values , religions , sciences , technologies , and laws , so that they may not die along with their civilization . 
 Freitas finds numerous reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth . A civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy might , he speculates , send probes to a large number of star systems , rather than using radio , as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can ( he says ) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey . Furthermore , probes would enable the surveying of non @-@ intelligent populations , or those not yet capable of space navigation ( like humans before the 20th century ) , as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations . In addition , the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would , according to Michaud , be only used for purposes such as a one @-@ way migration . 
 Freitas points out that probes , unlike the interstellar radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches , could store information for long , perhaps geological , timescales , and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin , rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon . Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in , which would be impossible for a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system . Moreover , the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems , rather than a small number of powerful , centralized beacons , would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them . Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised , decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have . 
 Given the age of the Milky Way galaxy , an ancient extraterrestrial civilization may have existed and sent probes to the Solar System millions or even billions of years before the evolution of Homo sapiens . Thus , a probe sent may have been nonfunctional for millions of years before humans learn of its existence . Such a " dead " probe would not pose an imminent threat to humanity , but would prove that interstellar flight is possible . However , if an active probe were to be discovered , humans would react much more strongly than they would to the discovery of a probe that has long since ceased to function . 
 = = Further implications of contact = = 
 = = = Theological = = = 
 The confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence could have a profound impact on religious doctrines , potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries . However , a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence , and another study , conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary , shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it . Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion . Gabriel Funes , the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science , has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly . 
 Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion . The Peters study showed that most non @-@ religious people , and a significant majority of religious people , believe that the world could face a religious crisis , even if their own beliefs were unaffected . Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions , in particular traditionalist Christianity , because of the geocentric nature of western faiths . The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God , however , and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past , for example with the theory of evolution and the teachings of Giordano Bruno , it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances . In the view of Musso , however , a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths , as the studies of himself and others on Christianity , the most " anthropocentric " religion , see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence . In addition , the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio , meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity , such information would be viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts . 
 Funes speculates that a decipherable message from extraterrestrial intelligence could initiate an interstellar exchange of knowledge in various disciplines , including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host . Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might put an end to present @-@ day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide . On the other hand , Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all @-@ encompassing faith . 
 = = = Political = = = 
 Tim Folger speculates that news of radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization would prove impossible to suppress and would travel rapidly , though Cold War scientific literature on the subject contradicts this . Media coverage of the discovery would probably die down quickly , though , as scientists began to decipher the message and learn its true impact . Different branches of government ( for example legislative , executive , and judiciary ) may pursue their own policies , potentially giving rise to power struggles . Even in the event of a single contact with no follow @-@ up , radio contact may prompt fierce disagreements as to which bodies have the authority to represent humanity as a whole . Michaud hypothesizes that the fear arising from direct contact may cause nation @-@ states to put aside their conflicts and work together for the common defense of humanity . 
 Apart from the question of who would represent the Earth as a whole , contact could create other international problems , such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal . The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes , which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence . Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity , what format they should take , how to convey the cultural history of the Earth , and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail . 
 According to Luca <unk> of the University of Genoa , contact with a powerful extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another , such as the arrival of Christopher Columbus and Hernán Cortés into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life . However , the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations , and that specific interpretation of the arrival of the European colonists to the Americas , have been disputed . Even so , any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society . Being discovered by a " superior " extraterrestrial civilization , and continued contact with it , might have psychological effects that could destroy a civilization , as is claimed to have happened in the past on Earth . 
 Even in the absence of close contact between humanity and extraterrestrials , high @-@ information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock . Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions . The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher . 
 = = = Legal = = = 
 Contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would raise legal questions , such as the rights of the extraterrestrial beings . An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth would only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes . Much as various classes of human being , such as women , children , and indigenous people , were initially denied human rights , so might extraterrestrial beings , who could therefore be legally owned and killed . If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal , there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal , considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence . 
 Freitas considers that even if an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood , problems of nationality and immigration would arise . An extraterrestrial being would not have a legally recognized earthly citizenship , and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals . 
 If contact were to take place through electromagnetic signals , these issues would not arise . Rather , issues relating to patent and copyright law regarding who , if anyone , has rights to the information from the extraterrestrial civilization would be the primary legal problem . 
 = = = Scientific and technological = = = 
 The scientific and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small , especially at first . However , if the message contains a large amount of information , deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself , which may greatly advance our technology and science . A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization . 
 On the other hand , extraterrestrial civilizations with malicious intent could send information that could enable human civilization to destroy itself , such as powerful computer viruses or information on how to make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly . While the motives for such an action are unknown , it would require minimal energy use on the part of the extraterrestrials . According to Musso , however , computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures , which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security . Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose , bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth . In addition , humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement , thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology . 
 Extraterrestrial technology could have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization . Just as television provided a new outlet for a wide variety of political , religious , and social groups , and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe , allowing them to interpret it for themselves , so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent . Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress , leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology . He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution , which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order . Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution , or anything previously experienced by humanity . 
 Michaud suggests that humanity could be impacted by an influx of extraterrestrial science and technology in the same way that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists . Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species , and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species , but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science , technology , and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization . 
 The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology . The discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form , intelligent or non @-@ intelligent , would give humanity greater insight into the nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized . Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth . This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth . 
 = = = Ecological and biological @-@ warfare impacts = = = 
 An extraterrestrial civilization might bring to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do not harm its own biosphere . Alien pathogens could decimate the human population , which would have no immunity to them , or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts , causing indirect harm to humans . Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere 's lack of defenses against them . 
 On the other hand , pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology to have no adverse effects . Furthermore , pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments , to which extraterrestrial pathogens would have had no opportunity to adapt . 
 If an extraterrestrial civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota , it might be able to create extremely potent biological weapons . Even a civilization without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions . 
 According to Baum , even if an extraterrestrial civilization were to communicate using electromagnetic signals alone , it could send humanity information with which humans themselves could create lethal biological weapons . 
 = Australian blacktip shark = 
 The Australian blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus tilstoni ) is a species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae , endemic to northern and eastern Australia . Favoring the upper and middle parts of the water column , it can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 50 m ( 160 ft ) . Appearance @-@ wise this species is virtually identical to the common blacktip shark ( C. limbatus ) , from which it can be reliably distinguished only by its lower vertebra number and by genetic markers . Generally reaching 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 8 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 ft ) in length , it is a fairly stout @-@ bodied , bronze @-@ colored shark with a long snout and black @-@ tipped fins . 
 Primarily piscivorous , the Australian blacktip shark forms large groups of similar size and sex that tend to remain within a local area . It exhibits vivipary , meaning that the unborn young are provisioned through a placental connection . There is a well @-@ defined annual reproductive cycle with mating occurring in February and March . Females bear one to six pups around January of the following year , after a 10 @-@ month gestation period . The Australian blacktip shark is among the sharks most commonly caught by northern Australian commercial fisheries . It is mainly valued for its meat , which is sold as " flake " . This species was an important catch of a Taiwanese gillnet fishery that operated from 1974 to 1986 , and of the Australian Northern Shark Fishery that continues to the present day . As current fishing levels are not thought to threaten this shark 's population , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed it as Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The Australian blacktip shark was described by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1950 issue of the scientific journal Western Australian Naturalist . He named it Galeolamna <unk> tilstoni in honor of Richard Tilston , assistant surgeon at Port Essington , Northern Territory . The type specimen is a 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) long female caught from Van <unk> Reef in Joseph Bonaparte Gulf . Later authors have regarded Galeolamna as a synonym of the genus Carcharhinus . This shark may also be referred to as blacktip whaler , Tilston 's whaler shark , and Whitley 's blacktip shark . 
 After Whitley 's initial description , C. tilstoni was generally regarded as synonymous with C. limbatus , the common blacktip shark . In the 1980s , additional morphological and life history data again favored the recognition of C. tilstoni as a separate species , which was eventually confirmed by allozyme studies performed by Shane Lavery and James <unk> . Several molecular phylogenetic studies based on allozymes , mitochondrial DNA , and nuclear DNA have found that that the Australian and common blacktip sharks form a closely related clade with the graceful shark ( C. amblyrhynchoides ) and the smoothtooth blacktip shark ( C. leiodon ) . The interrelationships between them have not been fully resolved , but available data suggest that C. tilstoni and C. limbatus are not the most closely related species within the clade despite their similarity .

 Physically , the Australian blacktip shark can only reliably be distinguished from the common blacktip shark by the number of vertebrae ( 174 – 182 total , 84 – 91 before the tail in C. tilstoni , 182 – 203 total , 94 – 102 before the tail in C. limbatus ) . It has a moderately robust , spindle @-@ shaped body and a long , pointed snout . The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps . The large , circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes . The furrows at the corners of the mouth are barely evident . There are 32 – 35 upper and 29 – 31 lower tooth rows ; each upper tooth has a slender , upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base , while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely serrated . The five pairs of gill slits are long . 
 The long and narrow pectoral fins are falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) with pointed tips . The large first dorsal fin is also falcate and originates over or slightly behind the rear of the pectoral fin bases . The second dorsal fin is moderately tall and positioned about opposite the anal fin . There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins . A crescent @-@ shaped notch is present on the caudal peduncle just before the upper caudal fin origin . The caudal fin is asymmetrical , with a strong lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip . The roughly diamond @-@ shaped dermal denticles are placed closely together and slightly overlapping ; each bears five to seven ( three in juveniles ) horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . The Australian blacktip shark is bronze above ( gray after death ) and whitish below , with a pale stripe on the flanks . Some individuals have black tips on all fins , while others have unmarked pelvic and anal fins . It typically reaches 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 8 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 ft ) long ; the maximum length and weight on record are 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) and 52 kg ( 115 lb ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Inhabiting the continental shelf , the Australian blacktip shark is found from <unk> Island in Western Australia to Sydney in New South Wales . Within its range , it co @-@ occurs with the common blacktip shark ; the ratio between C. limbatus and C. tilstoni was once thought to be 1 : 300 , but recent genetic studies have found it to be closer to 50 : 50 . This species has been reported from the intertidal zone to a depth of 150 m ( 490 ft ) ; larger sharks tend to occur in deeper water . Though it occupies the entire water column , it is most common close to the surface or in midwater . Genetic data suggest Australian blacktip sharks across northern Australia are all members of a single population . Tagging studies have found this species mostly moves only short distances along the coastline and rarely enters offshore waters . However , some individuals have been recorded traveling longer distances , up to 1 @,@ 348 km ( 838 mi ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The Australian blacktip shark is known to form large groups , segregated by size and sex . It preys mainly on teleost fishes , including <unk> , grunters , tunas , and herring . Cephalopods are a secondary food source , which are particularly important around April . This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks , including <unk> sharks ( <unk> <unk> ) , spottail sharks ( C. sorrah ) , and sharpnose sharks ( Rhizoprionodon ) . Their diets shift with age : smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom @-@ dwelling fish , while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods . Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms <unk> <unk> and Platybothrium sp . , and the copepod Perissopus dentatus . 
 Like other requiem sharks , the Australian blacktip shark is viviparous : once the embryos exhaust their yolk supply , the depleted yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother provides sustenance . Females bear litters of one to six pups ( average three ) every year . Mating takes place in February and March , with the females storing the sperm until ovulation in March and April . After a gestation period of 10 months , the young are born around January of the following year . Near @-@ term females move into shallow , coastal nurseries , such as Cleveland Bay in northern Queensland , to give birth . Such nursery areas appear to be widespread , as newborns have been recorded throughout the range of the species . The newborns are relatively large , measuring about 60 cm ( 24 in ) long . They grow rapidly in their first year , increasing in length by an average of 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) . The growth rate subsequently slows , averaging 8 – 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) per year by age five . Both sexes attain sexual maturity at three to four years of age , at lengths of roughly 1 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 6 and 3 @.@ 9 ft ) for males and females , respectively . The maximum lifespan is estimated to be 20 years . 
 Hybrids between the Australian blacktip shark and the common blacktip shark , comprising both F1 and <unk> individuals , have been discovered all along the eastern coast of Australia . Despite the widespread incidence of hybridization , there is no evidence that the two parental lineages are merging and the mechanisms preventing introgression are unclear . This is the first confirmed case of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes .

 Along with the spottail shark , the Australian blacktip shark is one of the most economically important sharks off northern Australia . It was historically fished for its meat and fins by a Taiwanese gillnet fishery , which began operating off northern Australia in 1974 . The annual catch initially averaged around 25 @,@ 000 tons ( live weight ) , with approximately 70 % consisting of Australian blacktip sharks , spottail sharks , and longtail tuna ( Thunnus <unk> ) . Following the establishment of the Australian Fishing Zone ( AFZ ) in November 1979 , the Australian government progressively excluded Taiwanese gillnet vessels from large portions of Australian waters and imposed fishing quotas . The fishery eventually became uneconomical when Australia restricted gillnet lengths to 2 @.@ 5 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) in May 1986 , and Taiwanese vessels ceased fishing in Australian waters that year . At end of the fishery , Australian blacktip shark numbers were estimated to have been diminished by around 50 % . Given its relatively high reproductive rate , its population has likely since recovered . 
 Since 1980 , the Australian blacktip shark has also been targeted by Australian commercial <unk> and longliners in the Northern Shark Fishery . It is additionally caught incidentally by other commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes or prawns . The contemporary northern Australian shark catch is estimated to be between 100 and 900 tons ( live weight ) annually , of which most are Australian blacktip and spottail sharks . The meat of this species is sold in Australia as " flake " , though it may contain high concentrations of mercury . The fins are exported to Asia , while the cartilage , liver oil , and skin may also be used . Since fishing pressure on the Australian blacktip shark is now much lower than historical levels , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it under Least Concern . However , of potential concern are Indonesian fishers in the Arafura Sea , who are increasingly trespassing into the AFZ . 
 = Freedom Monument = 
 The Freedom Monument ( Latvian : <unk> <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ) is a memorial located in Riga , Latvia , honouring soldiers killed during the Latvian War of Independence ( 1918 – 1920 ) . It is considered an important symbol of the freedom , independence , and sovereignty of Latvia . Unveiled in 1935 , the 42 @-@ metre ( 138 ft ) high monument of granite , travertine , and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga . 
 The sculptures and bas @-@ reliefs of the monument , arranged in thirteen groups , depict Latvian culture and history . The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other , decreasing in size towards the top , completed by a 19 @-@ metre ( 62 ft ) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars . The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister , <unk> Anna <unk> , ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a " memorial column " . After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme " Shine like a star ! " submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis <unk> . Construction works were financed by private donations . 
 Following the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition , but no such move was carried out . Soviet sculptor Vera <unk> is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument , because she considered it to be of high artistic value . Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology , but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public . Indeed , on June 14 , 1987 , about 5 @,@ 000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate the victims of the Soviet regime and to lay flowers . This rally renewed the national independence movement , which culminated three years later in the re @-@ establishment of Latvian sovereignty after the fall of the Soviet regime .

 The sculptures and bas @-@ reliefs of the Freedom Monument , arranged in thirteen groups , depict Latvian culture and history . The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other , decreasing in size towards the top . A red granite staircase of ten steps , 1 @.@ 8 meters ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) in height , winds around the base of the monument between two travertine reliefs 1 @.@ 7 meters ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) high and 4 @.@ 5 meters ( 15 ft ) wide , " Latvian riflemen " ( 13 ; Latvian : <unk> <unk> ) and " Latvian people : the Singers " ( 14 ; Latvian : <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) , which decorate its 3 meters ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) thick sides . Two additional steps form a round platform , which is 28 meters ( 92 ft ) in diameter , on which the whole monument stands . At the front of the monument this platform forms a rectangle , which is used for ceremonial proposes . The base of the monument , also made of red granite , is formed by two rectangular blocks : the lower one is a monolithic 3 @.@ 5 meters ( 11 ft ) high , 9 @.@ 2 meters ( 30 ft ) wide and 11 meters ( 36 ft ) long , while the smaller upper block is 3 @.@ 5 meters ( 11 ft ) high , 8 @.@ 5 meters ( 28 ft ) wide and 10 meters ( 33 ft ) long and has round niches in its corners , each containing a sculptural group of three figures . Its sides are also paneled with travertine . 
 On the front of the monument , in between the groups " Work " ( 10 ; depicting a fisherman , a craftsman and a farmer , who stands in the middle holding a scythe decorated with oak leaves and acorns to symbolize strength and manhood ) and " Guards of the Fatherland " ( 9 ; depicting an ancient Latvian warrior standing between two kneeling modern soldiers ) , a dedication by the Latvian writer Kārlis <unk> is inscribed on one of the travertine panels : For Fatherland and Freedom ( 6 ; Latvian : <unk> un <unk> ) . On the sides the travertine panels bear two reliefs : " 1905 " ( 7 ; Latvian : <unk> in reference to the Russian Revolution of 1905 ) , and " The Battle against the Bermontians on the Iron Bridge " ( 8 ; Latvian : <unk> <unk> <unk> uz <unk> <unk> , referring to the decisive battle in Riga during the Latvian War of Independence ) . On the back of the monument are another two sculptural groups : " Family " ( 12 ; Latvian : <unk> ) ( a mother standing between her two children ) and " Scholars " ( 11 ; Latvian : Gara <unk> ( a Baltic pagan priest , holding a crooked stick standing between figures of modern scientist and writer ) . On the red granite base there is yet another rectangular block , 6 meters ( 20 ft ) high and wide , and 7 @.@ 5 meters ( 25 ft ) long , encircled by four 5 @.@ 5 – 6 meters ( 18 – 20 ft ) high gray granite sculptural groups : " Latvia " ( 2 ; Latvian : <unk> ) , " <unk> " ( 3 ; English : Bear @-@ Slayer , an epic Latvian folk hero ) , " <unk> " ( 5 ; a Baltic pagan priest ) and " Chain breakers " ( 4 ; Latvian : <unk> <unk> ) ( three chained men trying to break free from their chains ) . 
 The topmost block serves also as the foundation for the 19 meters ( 62 ft ) high monolithic travertine column , which is 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) by 3 meters ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) at the base . To the front and rear a line of glass runs along the middle of the column . The column is topped by a copper figure of Liberty ( 1 ) , which is 9 meters ( 30 ft ) tall and in the form of a woman lifting three gilded stars , symbolizing the constitutional districts of Latvia : <unk> , <unk> and Courland . The whole monument is built around a frame of reinforced concrete and was originally fastened together with lead , bronze cables and lime mortar . However , some of the original materials were replaced with polyurethane filler during restoration . There is a room inside the Monument , accessed through a door in its rear side , which contains a staircase leading upwards in the Monument that is used for electrical installation and to provide access to the sewerage . The room cannot be accessed by the public and is used mainly as storage , however it has been proposed that the room could be redesigned forming a small exhibition , which would be used to introduce foreign officials visiting Latvia with the history of the Monument after the flower @-@ laying ceremony . 
 = = Location = = 
 The monument is located in the center of Riga on <unk> <unk> ( English : Freedom Boulevard ) , near the old town of Riga . In 1990 a section of the street around the monument , about 200 meters ( 660 ft ) long , between <unk> and <unk> boulevards , was pedestrianized , forming a plaza . Part of it includes a bridge over the city 's canal , once a part of the city 's fortification system , which was demolished in the 19th century to build the modern boulevard district . The canal is 3 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) long and surrounded by parkland for half of its length . The earth from the demolition of the fortifications was gathered in the park and now forms an artificial hill with a cascade of waterfalls to the north of the monument . The Boulevard district east of the park is the location of several embassies and institutions , of which the closest to the Freedom Monument are the German and French embassies , the University of Latvia and Riga State Gymnasium No.1. 
 Situated in the park near the monument to the south is the National Opera House with a flower garden and a fountain in front of it . Opposite the opera house on the western part of plaza near the old town , is a small café and the Laima clock . The clock was set up in 1924 , and in 1936 it was decorated with an advertisement for the Latvian confectionery brand " Laima " , from which it took its name ; it is a popular meeting spot . 
 Originally it was planned that an elliptical plaza would be built around the foot of the monument , enclosed by a granite wall 1 @.@ 6 meters ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) high , with benches placed inside it , while a hedge of <unk> was to be planted around the outside . This project was however not carried out in the 1930s . The idea was reconsidered in the 1980s but shelved again . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The idea of building a memorial to honor soldiers killed in action during the Latvian War of Independence first emerged in the early 1920s . On July 27 , 1922 , the Prime Minister of Latvia , <unk> Anna <unk> , ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a " memorial column " . The winner of this contest was a scheme proposing a column 27 meters ( 89 ft ) tall with reliefs of the official symbols of Latvia and bas @-@ reliefs of <unk> Barons and <unk> <unk> . It was later rejected after a protest from 57 artists . In October 1923 , a new contest was announced , using for the first time the term " Freedom Monument " . The contest ended with two winners , and a new closed contest was announced in March 1925 , but , due to disagreement within the jury , there was no result . 
 Finally in October 1929 , the last contest was announced . The winner was the design " Shine like a star ! " ( Latvian : " <unk> kā <unk> ! " ) by sculptor Kārlis <unk> , who had had success in the previous contests as well . After minor corrections made by the author and supervising architect Ernests <unk> , construction began on November 18 , 1931 . Financed by private donations , the monument was erected by the entrance to the old town , in the same place where the previous central monument of Riga , a bronze equestrian statue of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great had stood from 1910 until the outbreak of World War I. It was calculated in 1935 , the year when the monument was unveiled , that in four years of construction 308 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours were required to work the stone materials alone : 130 years would have been required if one person were to carry out the work using the most advanced equipment of the time . The total weight of materials used was about 2 @,@ 500 tons : such a quantity of materials would have required about 200 freight cars if transported by railway . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 The monument is endangered by the climate ( which has caused damage by frost and rain ) and by air pollution . Although in 1990 the area around the monument was pedestrianized , there are still three streets carrying traffic around it . High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument , which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument . In addition , water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the fastenings of the monument , which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic . The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand , causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms , such as moss and lichens . Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument . To prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001 . It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years . 
 The monument was restored twice during the Soviet era ( 1962 and 1980 – 1981 ) . In keeping with tradition the restorations and maintenance after the renewal of Latvia 's independence are financed partly by private donations . The monument underwent major restoration in 1998 – 2001 . During this restoration the statue of Liberty and its stars were cleaned , restored and gilded anew . The monument was formally re @-@ opened on July 24 , 2001 . The staircase , column , base and inside of the monument were restored , and the stone materials were cleaned and re @-@ sealed . The supports of the monument were fixed to prevent subsidence . Although the restorers said at the time that the monument would withstand a hundred years without another major restoration , it was discovered a few years later that the gilding of the stars was damaged , due to the restoration technique used . The stars were restored again during maintenance and restoration in 2006 ; however , this restoration was rushed and there is no warranty of its quality . 
 = = Guard of honor = = 
 The guard of honor was present from the unveiling of the monument until 1940 , when it was removed shortly after the occupation of Latvia . It was renewed on November 11 , 1992 . The guards are soldiers of The Company of Guard of Honor of the Headquarters Battalion of the National Armed Forces ( Latvian : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Goda <unk> rota ) . The guard is not required to be on duty in bad weather conditions and if the temperatures are below − 10 ° C ( 14 ° F ) or above 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) . The guards work in two weekly shifts , with three or four pairs of guards taking over from each other hourly in a ceremony commanded by the chief of the guard . Besides them there also are two watchmen in each shift , who look out for the safety of the guards of honor . 
 Normally the guard changes every hour between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. After an hour on watch the guards have two hours free that they spend in their rooms at the Ministry of Defence . Since September 2004 the guards also patrol every half hour during their watch : they march off from the base of the monument and march twice along each side of it and then return to their posts . The guards are required to be at least 1 @.@ 82 meters ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) tall and in good health , as they are required to stand without moving for half an hour . 
 = = Political significance = = 
 After the end of World War II , there were plans to demolish the monument , although little written evidence is available to historians and research is largely based on oral testimony . On September 29 , 1949 ( although according to oral testimony , the issue was first raised as early as October 1944 ) the Council of People 's Commissars of the Latvian SSR proposed the restoration of the statue of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great . While they did not expressly call for the demolition of the Freedom Monument , the only way to restore the statue to its original position would have been to tear down the monument . The result of the debate is unrecorded , but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected . The Soviet sculptor Vera <unk> ( 1889 – 1953 ; designer of the monumental sculpture Worker and <unk> Woman ) is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument , although there is no written evidence to support the fact . According to her son , she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed , at which her opinion , as reported by her son , was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition might hurt the most sacred feelings of the Latvian people . 
 The Freedom Monument remained , but its symbolism was reinterpreted . The three stars were said to stand for the newly created Baltic Soviet Republics – Estonian SSR , Latvian SSR , and Lithuanian SSR – held aloft by Mother Russia , and the monument was said to have been erected after World War II as a sign of popular gratitude toward the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin for the liberation of the Baltic States . In the middle of 1963 , when the issue of demolition was raised again , it was decided that the destruction of a structure of such artistic and historic value , the building of which had been funded by donations of the residents of Latvia , would only cause deep indignation , which in turn would cause tension in society . Over time the misinterpretation of symbolism also was toned down and by 1988 the monument was said , with somewhat more accuracy , to have been built to " celebrate the liberation from bondage of the autocracy of the tsar and German barons " , although withholding the fact that the Bolshevik Red Army and the Red Latvian Riflemen were also adversaries in the Latvian War of Independence . 
 Despite the Soviet government 's efforts , on June 14 , 1987 , about 5 @,@ 000 people rallied to commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations . This event , organized by the human rights group Helsinki @-@ 86 , was the first time after the Soviet occupation that the flower @-@ laying ceremony took place , as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities . In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place . Helsinki @-@ 86 organized another flower @-@ laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year to commemorate the anniversary of the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact , at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water . Yet the independence movement grew in size , amounting in some events to more than half a million participants ( about one quarter of Latvia 's population ) and three years later , on May 4 , 1990 , the re @-@ establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared . 
 Since the re @-@ establishment of independence the monument has become a focal point for a variety of events . One of these – on March 16 , the commemoration day of veterans of the Latvian Legion of the Waffen @-@ SS , who fought the Soviet Union during World War II – has caused controversy . The date was first celebrated by Latvians in exile before being brought to Latvia in 1990 and for a short time ( 1998 – 2000 ) was the official remembrance day . In 1998 the event drew the attention of the foreign mass media and in the following year the Russian government condemned the event as a glorification of Nazism . The event evolved into a political conflict between Latvians and Russians , posing a threat to public safety . 
 The Latvian government took a number of steps in order to try to bring the situation under control , and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved , but the monument was fenced off , according to an announcement by Riga city council , for restoration . The monument was indeed restored in 2006 , but this statement was later questioned , as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date , the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration , and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work . Therefore , the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech . The unapproved events took place despite the ban . On November 23 , 2006 , the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional . In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful .

 The Special Boat Service ( SBS ) is the special forces unit of the Naval Service of the United Kingdom . Together with the Special Air Service , Special Reconnaissance Regiment and the Special Forces Support Group , they form the United Kingdom Special Forces and come under joint control of the same Director Special Forces . 
 The Special Boat Service is described as the naval special forces of the United Kingdom and the sister unit of the SAS . The operational capabilities of both units are broadly similar , however , the SBS ( being the principal Royal Navy contribution to UKSF ) has the additional training and equipment to lead in the maritime , amphibious and riverine environments . Both units come under the operational command of HQ Directorate of Special Forces ( DSF ) and undergo an identical selection process , enjoy significant interoperability in training and on operations . 
 In times of armed conflict and war , the Special Boat Service ( SBS ) and 22 Special Air Service Regiment ( 22 SAS ) are required to operate in small parties in enemy @-@ controlled territory . Operations of this nature require men of courage and high morale who have excellent tactical awareness be it knowledge of special tactics or simply knowing one 's place in a polyvalent unit . Self @-@ discipline neatly ties into this . Intelligence , reliability , determination and also being physically fit are key skills . These men possess mental , moral and physical stamina . 
 Principal roles of the SBS are Surveillance Reconnaissance ( SR ) , including information reporting and target acquisition ; Offensive Action ( OA ) , including direction of air strikes , artillery and naval gunfire , designation for precision guided munitions , use of integral weapons and demolitions ; and Support and Influence ( SI ) , including overseas training tasks . The SBS also provide immediate response Military Counter Terrorism ( CT ) and Maritime Counter Terrorism ( MCT ) teams . 
 The SBS can trace its origins to the Second World War , when they were formed as the Special Boat Section in 1940 . They became the Special Boat Squadron after the Second World War and the Special Boat Service in the 1980s . 
 The SBS is manned by ranks drawn mostly from the Royal Marines and carries out a role that is similar to the Special Air Service , but with a traditionally stronger focus on amphibious operations . Their training involves parachute exercises , helicopter training and boat training , which recruits will get the chance to earn their licence for . 
 All of the SBS 's four squadrons , C , Z , M and X , are configured for general <unk> and rotate through the Maritime Counter Terrorism Role , also known as Black Role . The SBS also operates on land , with recent operations in the mountains of landlocked Afghanistan and in the deserts of Iraq . Their main tasks include intelligence gathering , counter @-@ terrorism operations ( surveillance or offensive action ) , sabotage and the disruption of enemy infrastructure , capture of specific individuals , close protection of senior politicians and military personnel , plus reconnaissance and direct action in foreign territory .

 The Special Boat Section was founded in July 1940 by a Commando officer , Roger Courtney . Courtney became a commando recruit in mid @-@ 1940 , and was sent to the Combined Training Centre in Scotland . He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett , commander of the Combined Training Centre , that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective . He decided to infiltrate HMS Glengyle , a Landing Ship , Infantry anchored in the River Clyde . Courtney paddled to the ship , climbed aboard undetected , wrote his initials on the door to the captain 's cabin , and stole a deck gun cover . He presented the soaking cover to a group of high @-@ ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel . He was promoted to captain , and given command of twelve men , the first Special Boat Service / Special Boat Section . 
 It was initially named the Folboat Troop , after the type of folding canoe employed in raiding operations , and then renamed No. 1 Special Boat Section in early 1941 . Attached to Layforce , they moved to the Middle East , they later worked with the 1st Submarine Flotilla based at Alexandria and carried out beach reconnaissance of Rhodes , evacuated troops left behind on Crete and a number of small @-@ scale raids and other operations . In December 1941 Courtney returned to the United Kingdom where he formed No2 SBS , and <unk> SBS became attached to the Special Air Service ( SAS ) as the Folboat Section . In June 1942 , they took part in the Crete airfield raids . In September 1942 , they carried out Operation Anglo , a raid on two airfields on the island of Rhodes , from which only two men returned . Destroying three aircraft , a fuel dump and numerous buildings , the surviving SBS men had to hide in the countryside for four days before they could reach the waiting submarine . After the Rhodes raid , the SBS was absorbed into the SAS due to the casualties they had suffered . 
 In April 1943 , 1st SAS was divided into two with 250 men from the SAS and the Small Scale Raiding Force , forming the Special Boat Squadron under command Major the Earl Jellicoe . They moved to Haifa and trained with the Greek Sacred Regiment for operations in the Aegean . 
 They later operated among the Dodecanese and Cyclades groups of islands in the Dodecanese Campaign and took part in the Battle of Leros and the Battle of Kos . They with Greek Sacred Band took part in the successful Raid on <unk> in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured . In August 1944 , they joined with the Long Range Desert Group in operations in the Adriatic , on the Peloponnese , in Albania , and , finally , Istria . So effective were they that , by 1944 , 200 – 300 SBS men held down six German divisions . 
 Throughout the war , No.2 SBS did not use the Special Boat Squadron name , but instead retained the name Special Boat Section . They accompanied Major General Mark Clark ashore before the Operation Torch landings in November 1942 . Later , one group , Z SBS , which was based in Algiers from March 1943 , carried out the beach reconnaissance for the Salerno landings and a raid on Crete , before moving to Ceylon to work with the Special Operations Executives , Force 136 and later with Special Operations Australia . The rest of No. 2 SBS became part of South @-@ East Asia Command 's Small Operations Group , operating on the Chindwin and Irrawaddy rivers , and in the Arakan , during the Burma campaign .

 In 1946 , the SBS , whether of Commando or SAS parentage , were disbanded . The functional title SBS was adopted by the Royal Marines . It became part of the school of Combined Operations under the command of " Blondie " Hasler . Their first missions were in Palestine ( ordnance removal ) and in Haifa ( limpet mine removal from ships ) . The SBS went on to serve in the Korean War deployed on operations along the North Korean coast as well as operating behind enemy lines destroying lines of communication , installations and gathering intelligence . It was during the Korean War that the SBS first started operating from submarines . In 1952 , SBS teams were held at combat readiness in Egypt in case Gamal Abdel Nasser 's coup turned more violent than it did . The SBS were also alerted during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and coup against King Idris I of Libya ( 1959 ) , but in both cases they did not see action . In 1961 , SBS teams carried out reconnaissance missions during the Indonesian Confrontation ( see Operation Claret ) . In the same year , Iraq threatened to invade Kuwait for the first time , and the SBS put a detachment at Bahrain . In 1972 , the SBS and SAS came into prominence when members of a combined SBS and SAS team parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean after a bomb threat on board the cruise liner RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 . A thorough search of the ship found no evidence of any device drawing the conclusion that it was a hoax .

 In 1977 , their name was changed to the Special Boat Squadron and in 1980 the SBS relinquished North Sea oil rig protection to Comacchio Company . In 1982 , after the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands , they deployed to South Georgia . The only losses to the SBS during the Falklands War occurred when the SBS and SAS were operating behind the lines and two members of the SBS were shot by an SAS patrol , who had mistaken them for Argentinians .

 In 1987 , they were renamed Special Boat Service , and became part of the United Kingdom Special Forces Group alongside the Special Air Service and 14 Intelligence Company . In the Gulf War , there was no amphibious role assigned to the SBS , an " area of operations line " was drawn down the middle of Iraq , the SAS would operate west of the line and the SBS to the east . As well as searching for mobile scuds , their area contained a mass of fibre @-@ optic cable that provided Iraq with intelligence , the location of the main junction was 32 miles from Baghdad ; On 22 January 1991 , 36 SBS operators were inserted by 2 chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron RAF , into an area full of Iraqi ground and air forces as well as spies and <unk> , they avoided them and destroyed a 40 @-@ yard section of the cable with explosives @-@ destroying what was left of the Iraqi communication grid . The SBS carried out one of its most high profile operations when it liberated the British Embassy in Kuwait , abseiling from helicopters hovering above the embassy . They were also responsible for carrying out diversionary raids along the Kuwaiti coast which in effect diverted a number of Iraqi troops to the SBS area of operations and away from the main thrust of the coalition build up . In September 1999 the SBS were involved in operations in East Timor . A small SBS team landed and drove out the back of a C @-@ 130 Hercules transport aircraft in Land Rover Defenders at Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport in Dili .
