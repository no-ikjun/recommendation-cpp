 Feminism was challenged by various minority groups for not entirely addressing the needs of minority populations . It was suggested that ' mainstream ' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women . This led to the formation of the Awaaz @-@ e @-@ <unk> ( The Voice of Women ) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city . The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women . The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not <unk> .

 Western @-@ educated Indians introduced equality in the early nineteenth century . However , the term did not gain meaning or become an operational principle in Indian life until the country gained independence in 1947 and adopted a democratic government . The Indian Constitution then granted equality , freedom from discrimination based on gender or religion , and guaranteed religious freedoms . Also , seven five @-@ year plans were developed to provide health , education , employment , and welfare to women . The sixth five @-@ year plan even declared women " partners in development . " 
 = = = Employment = = = 
 In general , in the uneducated and rural sections of Indian society , which form a major percentage of the total population , women are seen as economic burdens . Their contributions to productivity are mostly invisible as their familial and domestic contributions are overlooked . Indian women were contributing nearly 36 percent of total employment in agriculture and related activities , nearly 19 percent in the service sector , and nearly 12 @.@ 5 in the industry sector as of the year 2000 . High illiteracy rates among women confine them to lower paying , unskilled jobs with less job security than men . Even in agricultural jobs where the work of men and women are highly similar , women are still more likely to be paid less for the same amount and type of work as men . 
 In 1955 the Bollywood group Cine Costume Make @-@ Up Artist & Hair <unk> ' Association ( <unk> ) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists . However , in 2014 the Supreme Court of India ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 ( right to equality ) , 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) ( freedom to carry out any profession ) and Article 21 ( right to liberty ) . The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no " rationale nexus " to the cause sought to be achieved and was " unacceptable , impermissible and inconsistent " with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens . The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist , female or male , to work in the industry , they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work . In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make @-@ Up Artist & Hair <unk> ' Association . 
 = = = Globalisation = = = 
 Feminists are also concerned about the impact of globalisation on women in India . Some feminists argue that globalisation has led to economic changes that have raised more social and economical challenges for women , particularly for working @-@ class and lower @-@ caste women . Multinational companies in India have been seen to exploit the labour of ' young , underpaid and disadvantaged women ' in free trade zones and sweat shops , and use " Young lower middle class , educated women , " in call centres . These women have few effective labour rights , or rights to collective action . 
 In addition to this , multinational corporations are seen to advertise a homogenous image of ideal women across the country is argued to cause an increase in the commodification of women 's bodies . This is also manifested in the form of nationalist pride exhibited through Indian women winning international beauty pageants . According to some feminists , such developments have offered women greater sexual autonomy and more control over their bodies . However , many other feminists feel that such commodification of female bodies has only served the purpose of feeding to male fantasies . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Some of the main reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of education include the fact that girls are needed to assist their mothers at home , have been raised to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation , have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children , have an economic dependency on men , and are sometimes subject to child @-@ marriage . Many poor families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education . 
 In 1986 , the National Policy on Education ( <unk> ) was created in India , and the government launched the programme called Mahila <unk> , whose focus was on the empowerment of women . The programme 's goal is to create a learning environment for women to realise their potential , learn to demand information and find the knowledge to take charge of their own lives . In certain areas of India , progress is being made and an increase in the enrolment of girls in schools and as teachers has begun to increase . By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50 % of the overall female population , though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India . Efforts are still being made to improve the level of education that females receive to match that of male students . 
 = = = Modernisation = = = 
 Modern influences are affecting the younger generations in parts of India , where girls are beginning to forgo the more traditional ways of Indian life and break gender stereotypes . In more flourishing parts of the country , the idea of " dating " , or more specifically openly dating , has come into play , and the terms " girlfriend " and " boyfriend " are being used . Some women have landed highly respectable careers , and can be seen across Bollywood billboards and advertisements . However , this is not the norm throughout the country ; such modernisations and the women behind them face serious resistance from anti @-@ <unk> . The country is still severely male @-@ dominant and unwelcoming to such movements that go against sex and gender traditions in India .

 Jason McElwain , nicknamed " J @-@ Mac " , ( born October 1 , 1987 ) is an American high @-@ functioning autistic amateur athlete , in both basketball and marathon , and public speaker . McElwain came to fame on national news , in 2006 , when he played during a high school basketball game , and scored twenty points . 
 Jason McElwain was appointed as the manager of the Greece Athena High School by basketball coach Jim Johnson . On February 15 , 2006 , he played in a basketball game against Spencerport High School , for a division title . Greece Athena got a large lead , so Coach Johnson decided to let McElwain play in the last four minutes and nineteen seconds of the game . After initially missing two shots , McElwain made six three @-@ point shots and one two @-@ pointer , finishing with twenty points . After the final buzzer rang , the crowd dashed onto the court in celebration . 
 Ten years later , McElwain made his professional basketball debut with the Rochester Razorsharks .

 Jason McElwain was born on October 1 , 1987 , to David and Debbie McElwain , and was diagnosed with autism at the age of two years . Jason and his family lived in Greece , New York , a suburb of Rochester , New York . He initially struggled when interacting with other children , but began to develop social skills as he grew older . Although he was placed in special education classes , McElwain enjoyed basketball , to which he was introduced by his older brother Josh , and was appointed manager of Greece Athena High School 's varsity basketball team .

 Greece Athena High School basketball coach Jim Johnson decided to add McElwain to the roster for the team 's February 15 game against Spencerport High School , so McElwain could be given a jersey and sit on the bench for the team 's last home game of the season , and allow McElwain to play a few minutes if Greece Athena got a comfortable lead . With four minutes left in the game , Greece Athena had a double @-@ digit lead , so Johnson decided to let McElwain play out the last minutes of the game . When teammates first passed the ball to McElwain he attempted a three @-@ point shot and missed . McElwain got a second chance to score with a lay @-@ up which he also missed . McElwain then got " hot as a pistol " , sinking six three @-@ pointers and one two @-@ point shot , before the game ended . The final score was Greece Athena 79 , Spencerport 43 . As soon as the final buzzer rang , fans from the stands stormed the court in celebration . 
 McElwain 's performance was videotaped by fellow Greece Athena student Marcus Luciano , who was substituting for the team 's normal videographer . Before the game , Johnson gave Luciano strict instructions to track only the game formations . However , according to ESPN writer Elizabeth Merrill , Luciano " had a well @-@ deserved reputation for breaking the rules " ; when he saw McElwain make his first shot , he ignored Johnson 's instructions and instead panned the crowd reaction to McElwain 's performance . Johnson was initially angry , but soon changed his mind , calling Luciano 's decision " a brilliant move " .

 Teacher Andy McCormack was in the audience that night to see the game . McCormack was Jason 's Speech / Language Pathologist throughout high school , and the day after the game he got a copy of the video to local sports newscaster John <unk> who put it on the news that night . Others followed suit , and within days the tape reached a national audience . McCormack continued to support Jason over the next few months in school , helping coin alternative language expressions to his now @-@ famous " hot as a pistol " phrase and helping him construct an introduction speech when Magic Johnson came to Greece Athena to speak to the student body . 
 In his hometown of Greece , New York , McElwain quickly became a celebrity . The family 's home phone was always ringing , and when the <unk> went out for a meal , a group of fans ran into the family , praising Jason . 
 McElwain met President George W. Bush on March 14 , 2006 , when Bush stopped by a nearby airport on his way to Canandaigua , New York , so he could meet McElwain . Standing next to McElwain , Bush told reporters " As you can see , a special person has greeted us at the airport , Jason " , and then jokingly asked " Can I call you J @-@ Mac ? " Bush went on to praise McElwain , saying " Our country was captivated by an amazing story on the basketball court . It 's the story of a young man who found his touch on the basketball court , which , in turn , touched the hearts of citizens all around the country . " Bush also stated that upon seeing McElwain on television , he " wept , just like a lot of other people did " . Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning visited Rochester , where he was introduced to McElwain . Manning invited McElwain and Steve Kerr , another Greece Athena High School athlete to the Colts ' training camp for a week , which McElwain accepted . McElwain later said that Peyton was " one of the nicest guys in sports " and when the Colts won the Super Bowl and Manning raised the Vince Lombardi Trophy , McElwain " had a tear in [ his ] eye . " 
 McElwain threw out the opening pitch for the Rochester Red Wings ' game against the Charlotte Knights . The Red Wings also gave away 3 @,@ 500 free bobblehead dolls that were modeled after McElwain .

 = Leucopholiota decorosa = 
 Leucopholiota decorosa is a species of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family of mushrooms . Commonly known as the decorated Pholiota , it is distinguished by its fruit body which is covered with pointed brown , curved scales on the cap and stem , and by its white gills . Found in the eastern United States , France , and Pakistan , it is saprobic , growing on the decaying wood of hardwood trees . L. decorosa was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Agaricus <unk> in 1873 , and the species has been transferred to several genera in its history , including Tricholoma , <unk> , Armillaria , and <unk> . Three American mycologists considered the species unique enough to warrant its own genus , and transferred it into the new genus Leucopholiota in a 1996 publication . <unk> species with similar colors and scaly fruit bodies include Pholiota squarrosoides , Phaeomarasmius <unk> , and Leucopholiota lignicola . L. decorosa is considered an edible mushroom . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species now known as Leucopholiota decorosa was first described by Charles Peck in 1873 , based on a specimen he found in New York State ; he placed it in Tricholoma , then considered a subgenus of Agaricus . In 1947 , Alexander Smith and Walters transferred the species into the genus Armillaria , based on its apparent close relationship to Armillaria <unk> ; the presence of clamp connections in the hyphae , the amyloid spores , and the structure of the veil and its remnants . The genus Armillaria , as it was understood at the time , would later be referred to as a " taxonomic refugium for about 270 white @-@ spored species with attached gills and an annulus . " Smith later transferred the species to the genus <unk> ; however , he neglected the amyloid spores , the recurved scales of the cap cuticle , and the lack of cells known as pleurocystidia , features which should have ruled out a taxonomic transfer into the genus . In 1987 , the species was transferred yet again , this time to the genus <unk> . 
 The appearance of a specimen at a 1994 mushroom foray in North Carolina resulted in a collaboration between mycologists Tom Volk , Orson K. Miller , Jr. and Alan Bessette , who renamed the species Leucopholiota decorosa in a 1996 Mycologia publication . Leucopholiota was originally a subgenus of Armillaria , but the authors raised it to generic level to accommodate L. decorosa , which would become the type species . In 2008 , Henning Knudsen considered L. decorosa to be the same species as what was then known as <unk> lignicola , and considered the two names to be synonymous . However , Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja rejected this interpretation . Originally , Harmaja believed Lepiota lignicola sufficiently distinct from other similar taxa to deserve its own genus <unk> , which he described in a 2002 publication . He changed his mind in 2010 , writing " the differences between the type species of both genera are small and are thus best considered as differences at the species level " ; with this he transferred the taxon to Leucopholiota , and it is now known as Leucopholiota lignicola , the second species in genus Leucopholiota . 
 The genus name Leucopholiota means " white Pholiota " ( from <unk> , <unk> ) , referring to the gills and the spores ; it was proposed in 1980 by Henri Romagnesi who originally described it as a subgenus of Armillaria . The specific epithet decorosa , though intended for " elegant " or " handsome " , actually means " decent " , " respectable " , " modest " , or " decorous " . L. decorosa is commonly known as the " decorated Pholiota " . 
 = = Phylogenetics = = 
 Phylogenetic analysis based on evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family . However , the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to <unk> aurea , a species of unclear status in the Agaricales , and it confirms that L. decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae . According to the species authors , L. decorosa would fit best in the <unk> tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales . This tribe also contains the genera <unk> and Armillaria . 
 = = Description = = 
 The caps of L. decorosa , initially conic or hemispherical in shape , later expand to become convex or flattened in maturity . The caps are typically between 2 to 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , with surfaces covered with many small curved brown scales . The edge of the cap is typically curved inwards and may have coarse brown fibers attached . The cap is cinnamon brown , darker in the center . The gills are spaced together closely ; they have a narrow ( adnexed ) attachment to the stem , and their edges are " finely scalloped " . The stem is 2 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 0 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall by 0 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 5 in ) thick , and like the cap , is covered with scales from the bottom to the level of the annular zone ; above this point the stipe is smooth . The partial veil is made up of brown fibers " that flare upward as an annulus . " It is roughly the same thickness throughout the length of the stem , or may be slightly thinner near the top . The flesh is white and thick , and has a firm texture ; its odor is indistinct , and the taste either mild or bitter . The spore deposit is white . 
 The spores are hyaline ( translucent ) , roughly elliptical in shape , have thin walls , and are amyloid , meaning they absorb iodine stain in Melzer 's reagent . Additionally , in acetocarmine stain , they appear binucleate ( having two nuclei ) . They have dimensions of 5 @.@ 5 – 6 ( more rarely 7 ) by 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 0 µm . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia , are club @-@ shaped , translucent , and four @-@ spored . The <unk> ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are club @-@ shaped and 19 @-@ 24 by 3 – 5 µm . The cap cuticle is a trichodermium — a type of tissue composed of erect , long , threadlike hyphae of same or different lengths , and originating from an interwoven layer of hyphae that ascends gradually until terminal cells are somewhat parallel to each other . The <unk> hyphae are thin @-@ walled , measuring 7 @.@ 6 – 22 @.@ 0 µm , and stain yellowish in Melzer 's reagent . The hyphae comprising the cap tissue are thin @-@ walled and 5 – 10 µm in diameter , while those of the gill tissue are also thin @-@ walled , and 3 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 0 µm , and interspersed with oleiferous cells ( characterized by strongly refractive , homogeneous contents ) . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 According to one field guide published in 2006 , Leucopholiota decorosa is edible , based on the following comment by McIlvaine and MacAdam , written in 1900 : " it is of good consistency and flavor , having a decided mushroom taste . " Other older sources report the edibility as unknown . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The species Pholiota squarrosoides has a similar outward appearance , but it may be distinguished by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales . In the hedgehog <unk> ( Phaeomarasmius <unk> ) , the overall size is smaller — cap diameter 1 to 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) — and the spores are cinnamon @-@ brown . Some species in the genus <unk> also appear similar , but can be distinguished by microscopic features , like the presence of spherical ( rather than club @-@ shaped ) cells in the cuticle of the cap , and also their habitat — <unk> usually grows on soil , rather than wood . 
 The only other species of Leucopholiota , L. lignicola , may be distinguished from L. decorosa by the following characteristics : free gills in L. lignicola compared with adnexed gills in L. decorosa ; L. lignicola tends to grow on the wood of Birch , and preferably in old @-@ growth forests ; L. lignicola is restricted to boreal forest , compared to L. decorosa that grows in temperate regions ; L. lignicola has a wide distribution throughout northern coniferous forests in Eurasia . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Leucopholiota decorosa is a saprobic species , deriving nutrients from decaying organic matter , particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees . One field guide notes a preference for sugar maple . It grows singly or in bunches , clustered together at the base of the stem . In Ohio , it typically fruits from late September to mid November . 
 In addition to its known distribution in mostly eastern North America , Leucopholiota decorosa has also been collected from France . In 2007 , it was reported from the Astore District of Pakistan , at an altitude of about 3 @,@ 600 m ( 11 @,@ 800 ft ) . 
 = Smolensk War = 
 The Smolensk War ( 1632 – 1634 ) was a conflict fought between the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia . 
 Hostilities began in October 1632 when Russian forces tried to capture the city of Smolensk . Small military engagements produced mixed results for both sides , but the surrender of the main Russian force in February 1634 led to the Treaty of Polyanovka . Russia accepted Polish @-@ Lithuanian control over the Smolensk region , which lasted for another 20 years . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1632 , Sigismund III Vasa , the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania , died . Although the Commonwealth nobility quickly elected Sigismund 's son Władysław IV Vasa as their new ruler , Poland 's neighbours , expecting delays in the electoral process , tested the Commonwealth 's perceived weakness . Swedish king Gustav II Adolph sent envoys to Russia and the Ottoman Empire to propose an alliance and war against the Commonwealth . 
 The Commonwealth was not ready for war . In 1631 , the royal army numbered barely 3 @,@ 000 men ; the Smolensk garrison was about 500 strong , and most garrisons in the border area were composed not of regular or mercenary soldiers but of 100 to 200 local volunteers . Aware that Russia was preparing for war , in the spring of 1632 the Sejm ( Polish @-@ Lithuanian parliament ) increased the army by recruiting an additional 4 @,@ 500 men ; by mid @-@ 1632 the deputy voivode ( <unk> ) of Smolensk , Samuel <unk> @-@ <unk> , had about 500 volunteers from pospolite ruszenie and 2 @,@ 500 regular army soldiers and Cossacks . In May the Senate of Poland agreed to increase the size of the army , but Grand Lithuanian Hetman Lew Sapieha objected , arguing that the current forces were enough and that war was not likely . Nonetheless the Field Lithuanian Hetman Krzysztof Radziwiłł recruited an additional 2 @,@ 000 soldiers . 
 Russia , having recovered to a certain extent from the Time of Troubles , agreed with the assessment that the Commonwealth would be weakened by the death of its king , and unilaterally attacked without waiting for the Swedes and the Ottomans . Russia 's aim was to gain control of Smolensk , which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino , ending the last Russo @-@ Polish War . Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth 's Smoleńsk Voivodeship , but it had often been contested , and it changed hands many times during the 15th , 16th and 17th centuries ( from the days of the Muscovite @-@ Lithuanian Wars ) . A major supporter of the war was the Tsar 's father , Patriarch Filaret , who represented the anti @-@ Polish camp at court . Inspired by the <unk> Sobor 's ( Russian parliament 's ) call for vengeance and reclamation of lost lands , the Russian army sallied west . 
 = = Hostilities = = 
 The Russian army that crossed the Lithuanian border in early October 1632 had been carefully prepared and was under the experienced command of Mikhail <unk> Shein , who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 1609 – 1611 siege . Several towns and castles fell as the Russians advanced , and on 28 October 1632 ( the same day that the historic town of Dorogobuzh was taken ) , Shein moved to begin the siege of Smolensk . 
 Former Polish estimates of the size of the Russian forces varied from 25 @,@ 000 through 30 @,@ 000 to 34 @,@ 500 , with 160 artillery pieces . Recent research on 17th @-@ century Russian archive documents showed that the size of the Russian army was 23 @,@ 961 . Compared to former Russian armies , Shein 's army was significantly modernised . Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket @-@ equipped infantry ( the <unk> ) , the Russians looked to foreign officers to update the equipment and training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars , dragoons , and reiters . Eight such regiments , totaling 14 @,@ 000 to 17 @,@ 000 men , comprised part of Shein 's army . 
 = = = Siege of Smolensk = = = 
 Commonwealth forces in Smolensk were composed of the Smolensk garrison ( about 1 @,@ 600 men with 170 artillery pieces under the command of the Voivode of Smolensk , Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski ) , strengthened by the local nobility , which formed a pospolite ruszenie force of about 1 @,@ 500 strong . The city 's fortifications had also recently been improved with Italian @-@ style bastions . 
 Shein constructed lines of circumvallation around the fortress . Using tunnels and mines , his forces damaged a long section of the city wall and one of its towers . Russian heavy artillery , mostly of Western manufacture , reached Smolensk in December 1632 with even heavier guns arriving the following March . After a preliminary artillery bombardment , Shein ordered an assault , which was repulsed by the Polish defenders . Nonetheless the siege was progressing ; Smolensk 's fortifications were being eroded , and the defenders were suffering heavy casualties and running out of supplies . By June 1633 , some soldiers started to desert , and others talked of surrender . 
 Despite these difficulties , the city , commanded by Deputy Voivode Samuel <unk> @-@ <unk> , held out throughout 1633 while the Commonwealth , under its newly elected King Władysław IV , organised a relief force . The Sejm had been informed about the Russian invasion by 30 October 1632 , and , starting in November , had discussed the possibility of relief . However , the process was delayed until the spring of 1633 , when the Sejm officially sanctioned a declaration of war and authorised a large payment ( 6 @.@ 5 million zlotys , the highest tax contribution during Władysław 's entire reign ) for the raising of a suitable force . The intended relief force would have an effective strength of about 21 @,@ 500 men and would include : 24 <unk> of Winged Hussars ( ~ 3 @,@ 200 horses ) , 27 <unk> of light cavalry — also known as Cossack cavalry but not composed of Cossacks — ( 3 @,@ 600 horses ) , 10 squadrons of raitars ( ~ 1 @,@ 700 horses ) , 7 Lithuanian <unk> regiments ( ~ 780 horses ) , 7 large regiments of dragoons ( ~ 2 @,@ 250 horses ) , and ~ 20 regiments of infantry ( ~ 12 @,@ 000 men ) . Over 10 @,@ 000 of the infantry would be organized based on the Western model , previously not common in Commonwealth armies . 
 Meanwhile , Field Hetman of Lithuania and Voivode of Vilnius , Krzysztof Radziwiłł , and Voivode Gosiewski established a camp about 30 kilometres ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) from Smolensk , moving from Orsha to <unk> and later , Krasne . By February 1633 , they had amassed around 4 @,@ 500 soldiers , including over 2 @,@ 000 infantry , and were engaged in raiding the rear areas of the Russian besiegers to disrupt their logistics . Hetman Radziwiłł also managed to break through the Russian lines on several occasions , bringing about 1 @,@ 000 soldiers and supplies into Smolensk to reinforce the fortress and raising the defenders ' morale . 
 By the summer of 1633 , the relief force , led personally by the king and numbering about 25 @,@ 000 ( 20 @,@ 000 in the Polish @-@ Lithuanian army , according to Jasienica ) , arrived near Smolensk ; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633 . By the first days of September , the main body of the relief forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14 @,@ 000 . The Russian army , recently reinforced , numbered 25 @,@ 000 . Only when Cossack reinforcements , led by <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> and numbering between 10 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 , arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority . The Cossacks under <unk> and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines , freeing the Polish @-@ Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege . 
 Władysław 's brother , John II Casimir , commanded one of the regiments in the relief army . Another notable commander was the Field Crown Hetman , Marcin Kazanowski . King Władysław IV , a great supporter of the modernization of the Commonwealth army , proved to be a good tactician , and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual Polish @-@ Lithuanian success . He had replaced the old arquebusiers with musketeers , and standardized the Commonwealth artillery ( introducing 3- to 6 @-@ pounder regimental guns ) , both to great effect . 
 Commonwealth 's cavalry , including the Winged Hussars , significantly restricted Russian mobility , forcing them to stay in their trenches . In a series of fierce engagements , Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications , and the siege reached its final stages by late September . On 28 September 1633 , Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points , and by 4 October the siege had broken . 
 Shein 's army retreated to its main camp , which was in turn surrounded by Commonwealth forces in mid @-@ October . The besieged Russians waited for relief , but none arrived , as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry had been sent to disrupt the Russian rear . Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness . ( Jasienica blames the Russian warlords , and Parker the foreign mercenaries . ) The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor , with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homeland . Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side . 
 Shein began surrender negotiations in January 1634 , and by February they were in full swing . The Russians finally signed a surrender treaty on 25 February 1634 , and on 1 March they vacated their camp . ( Some scholars , such as Rickard and Black , give the date of 1 March for Shein 's capitulation . ) Under the surrender terms , the Russians had to leave behind most of their artillery but were allowed to retain their banners after a ceremony in which they were laid before King Władysław . They also had to promise not to engage Commonwealth forces for the next three months . Shein 's forces numbered around 12 @,@ 000 at the time of their capitulation , but over 4 @,@ 000 , including most of the foreign contingent , immediately decided to defect to the Commonwealth . 
 = = = Other engagements = = = 
 Several other towns and fortresses in the region were the site of smaller battles . Russian forces captured several significant locations during their advance in 1632 , but Nagielski speculates that the delay in the arrival of their main force and artillery at Smolensk caused by this dilution of effort may have cost them the siege and consequently the war . In July 1633 , the Russians took the towns of Polatsk , Velizh , <unk> , and <unk> . Polatsk was the scene of particularly heavy fighting as the Russians captured the city and part of the fortress . However , attacks on Vitebsk and <unk> were successfully repulsed . Polish forces laid siege to <unk> , but due to the desertion of their Cossack allies they were forced to withdraw . 
 In the autumn of 1633 , Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh , an important Russian supply point after its capture the year before . This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein 's army , although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army for that purpose until January 1634 . Also that autumn , Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion in the south of the Commonwealth , freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk ; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress , he tied down large Russian forces , preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk . 
 After the relief of Smolensk in the spring of 1634 , the Commonwealth army moved towards the fortress Belaya . However , the siege of Belaya turned to a fiasco although the king manage to capture Vyazma . 
 = = Treaty of Polyanovka = = 
 By the spring of 1634 , the Russians had not only lost Shein 's army but were threatened by Tatar raids that ravaged southern Russia . Patriarch Filaret had died the previous year , and without him the war fervour lessened . Even before the end of 1633 , Tsar Michael of Russia was considering how best to end the conflict . Because he had once been elected Tsar of Russia and could realistically lay claim to the Russian throne , King Władysław wanted to continue the war or , because the Polish @-@ Swedish Treaty of Altmark would soon be expiring , ally with the Russians to strike against Sweden . However , the Sejm wanted no more conflict . As Stanisław Łubieński , the Bishop of Płock , wrote two weeks after Shein 's surrender : " Our happiness is in remaining within our borders , guaranteeing health and well @-@ being . " With neither side keen on prolonging the war , they began negotiating , not for an armistice but for " eternal peace . " 
 Talks began on 30 April 1634 , and the Treaty of Polyanovka was signed in May , putting an end to hostilities . The treaty confirmed the pre @-@ war status quo , with Russia paying a large war indemnity ( 20 @,@ 000 rubles in gold ) , while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow . Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław 's abnegation of his claim was more important , in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability , than the loss of disputed borderland . Despite not winning militarily , the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph . Other authors , such as <unk> , support this interpretation . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Already during the later stages of the war , when the Commonwealth army moved from Smolensk to Bely , a new threat begun to loom on the southern borders , where the Ottoman Empire was massing an invasion force . Thus Władysław begun redirecting his reinforcements to that theater . Later that year , the Commonwealth forces under Stanisław Koniecpolski scored a victory in the south , ending a war against the Ottomans . 
 Both sides introduced new tactics , units and equipment based on Western models , but the Polish @-@ Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians . However , the main factors that kept the Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry . A scapegoat was nevertheless needed : Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and , together with his second @-@ in @-@ command <unk> <unk> and the latter 's son Vasily , executed in Moscow on April 28 , 1634 . Learning from this defeat , the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish @-@ Russian War ( 1654 @-@ 1656 ) . 
 After the war , Władysław gave the Russians the border town of <unk> and nearby territories , hoping to persuade the Tsar to join in an anti @-@ Swedish alliance . However , the king was ultimately unable to overcome objections from the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Sejm , who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś . The Russians , unable to see benefit in such an alliance , were also unenthusiastic , and the proposed alliance came to nothing . 
 The war cost the Commonwealth treasury about 4 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 zloties . 
 The Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , Warsaw , with the inscription " <unk> 18 X 1632 @-@ 25 II 1634 " .

 = Dawson Creek = 
 Dawson Creek is a city in northeastern British Columbia , Canada . The municipality of 24 @.@ 37 square kilometres ( 9 @.@ 41 sq mi ) had a population of 11 @,@ 583 in 2011 . Dawson Creek derives its name from the creek of the same name that runs through the community . The creek was named after George Mercer Dawson by a member of his land survey team when they passed through the area in August 1879 . Once a small farming community , Dawson Creek became a regional centre when the western terminus of the Northern Alberta Railways was extended there in 1932 . The community grew rapidly in 1942 as the US Army used the rail terminus as a transshipment point during construction of the Alaska Highway . In the 1950s , the city was connected to the interior of British Columbia via a highway and railway through the Rocky Mountains . Since the 1960s , growth has slowed . 
 Dawson Creek is located in the dry and windy prairie land of the Peace River Country . As the seat of the Peace River Regional District and a service centre for the rural areas south of the Peace River , the city has been called the " Capital of the Peace " . It is also known as the " Mile 0 City " , referring to its location at the southern end of the Alaska Highway . It also has a heritage interpretation village , an art gallery , and a museum . Annual events include a fall fair and rodeo . 
 = = History = = 
 Dawson Creek is named after the watercourse of the same name , itself named after George Mercer Dawson who led a surveying team through the area in August 1879 ; a member of the team labelled the creek with Dawson 's name . The community that formed by the creek was one of many farming communities established by European @-@ Canadian settlers moving west through the Peace River Country . When the Canadian government began issuing homestead grants to settlers in 1912 , the pace of migration increased . With the opening of a few stores and hotels in 1919 and the incorporation of the Dawson Creek Co @-@ operative Union on 28 May 1921 , Dawson Creek became a dominant business centre in the area . After much speculation by land owners and investors , the Northern Alberta Railways built its western terminus 3 km ( 2 mi ) from Dawson Creek . The golden spike was driven on 29 December 1930 , and the first passenger train arrived on 15 January 1931 . The arrival of the railway and the construction of grain elevators attracted more settlers and business to the settlement . The need to provide services for the rapidly growing community led Dawson Creek to incorporate as a village in May 1936 . A small wave of refugees from the Sudetenland settled in the area in 1939 as World War II was beginning . The community exceeded 500 people in 1941 . 
 Upon entering the war , the United States decided to build a transportation corridor to connect the US mainland to Alaska . In 1942 , thousands of US Army personnel , engineers , and contractors poured into the city – the terminal of rail transport – to construct the Alaska Highway . The highway was completed in less than a year ; even after the workers involved in its construction departed , population and economic growth continued . In February 1943 , a major fire and explosion in a livery barn , packed with road @-@ building supplies including dynamite , caused serious damage to the center of town ; five people were killed and 150 injured . 
 By 1951 , Dawson Creek had more than 3 @,@ 500 residents . In 1952 , the John Hart Highway linked the town to the rest of the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains ; a new southbound route , known locally as Tupper Highway , made the town a crossroads with neighbouring Alberta . The next year , western Canada 's largest propane gas plant was built and federal government offices were established in town . In 1958 , the extension of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed , and the village was re @-@ incorporated as a city . Between 1951 and 1961 , the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled . 
 Growth slowed in the 1960s , with the population reaching its all @-@ time high in 1966 . In the 1970s , the provincial government moved its regional offices from Pouce Coupe to the city , Northern Lights College opened a Dawson Creek campus , and the Dawson Creek Mall was constructed . Several modern grain elevators were built , and the town 's five wooden grain elevators , nicknamed " Elevator Row " , were taken out of service . Only one of the historic elevators remains , converted to an art gallery . Since the 1970s , with the nearby town of Fort St. John attracting much of the area 's industrial development and Grande Prairie becoming a commercial hub , the town 's population and economy have not significantly increased . 
 Since 1992 , the city has undergone several boundary expansions . One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana @-@ Pacific Canada veneer factory . The city extended sewer and water lines to the location ; however , the area was not developed and with the factory only half @-@ built , L @-@ P Canada abandoned its plans . A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005 . Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in the northwest corner of the city , while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north .

The city is located on the Pouce Coupe Prairie in the southwestern part of the Peace River Country , 72 km ( 44 @.@ 7 mi ) southeast of Fort St. John , and 134 km ( 83 @.@ 3 mi ) northwest of Grande Prairie , Alberta . According to the Canada Land Inventory , the city is on soil that has moderate limitations , due to an adverse climate , that restrict the range of crops or require moderate conservation practices . The land is flat , but slopes upwards in the northeastern corner elevating a residential area over the rest of the city . 
 The city is in the British Columbia Peace Lowland <unk> of the Canadian Boreal Plains ecozone on the continental Interior Platform . Located in the Cordillera Climatic Region , it lies at the southern end of a subarctic climate ( Köppen Dfc ) . In the summer , the city is often dusty and arid ; temperatures during the day are warm , but cool at night , typically falling below 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . Highs reaching 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) occur only twice per year on average . Heavy rain showers are sporadic , lasting only a few minutes . In the winter , the city can get bitterly cold and dry , with 17 to 18 days of − 30 ° C ( − 22 ° F ) lows per year . It is subject to very strong winds year round . Unlike most of the province , the city and its region use Mountain Standard Time ( UTC − 07 : 00 ) all year round , since the area already has long daylight hours in the summer and short daylight hours in the winter . In other words , residents of the region never change their clocks - they use Pacific Daylight Time during the spring and summer , and Mountain Standard Time during the fall and winter . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Dawson Creek is based on four major industries : agriculture , retail , tourism , and oil and gas . Agriculture has historically been the most important industry to Dawson Creek , as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities . The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve , where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops , such as canola , hay , oats , alfalfa , wheat , and sweet clover . The service and retail sector caters to the city 's inhabitants , smaller nearby towns , and rural communities . However , there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie , the closest major Alberta city , where there is no provincial tax on retail purchases , while British Columbia charges 7 % . In 2006 , the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province 's border communities to 4 % . The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large @-@ format retail stores into the small city . Residents still cross the border for high @-@ priced items but now also purchase medium- and low @-@ priced items from foreign @-@ owned large @-@ format chain stores . 
 Dawson Creek has a large tourism industry as Mile " 0 " of the Alaska Highway . Thousands of people drive on the highway every year , starting in Dawson Creek and ending in Fairbanks , Alaska . The trek is often made with recreational vehicles , sometimes in convoys which gather in the city . In the winter , the hospitality industry caters to workers from the oil patches . Discoveries south of Dawson Creek and higher energy prices have spurred oil and gas activities , which have in turn driven the nearby Fort St. John economy to spill over to the Dawson Creek economy . British Columbia 's first wind farm , Bear Mountain Wind Park , was constructed southwest of the city in 2009 . 
 = = Transportation and infrastructure = = 
 Dawson Creek 's road network was laid out in the mid @-@ 20th century as the town rapidly expanded . The city maintains 88 km ( 55 mi ) of paved and 11 km ( 7 mi ) of unpaved roads . The primary roads generally follow a grid pattern around large blocks of land . Because the grid contains many internal intersections with stops signs , traffic is forced onto two arterial roads : 8 Street going north – south and Alaska Avenue going southeast – northwest . These two roads meet at a traffic circle where a metal statue marks the beginning of the Alaska Highway . Officially designated British Columbia Highway 97 , it runs north from Dawson Creek to Fort St. John and the Yukon – where it becomes Highway 1 – before reaching Alaska . The other highways emanating from Dawson Creek are the John Hart Highway , also 97 ( southwest to Chetwynd and Prince George ) , Highway 2 ( south to Grande Prairie and southern Alberta ) , and Highway 49 ( east to Peace River and northern Alberta ) . A road with few intersections along the southern and western borders of the city , incorporating a stretch of Highway 2 , is designated as a " dangerous goods route " for heavy trucks so that they can avoid traveling through the city . However , Highway 49 has no direct access to such a ring road , so many trucks bound to or from the east use the city arterials , slowing traffic and damaging roads . 
 Dawson Creek is a regional node for air , rail , and bus services . The Dawson Creek Airport , which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air , was built in 1963 ; its 1 @,@ 524 m ( 5 @,@ 000 ft ) runway was paved in 1966 . There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules . Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974 . Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways ( NAR ) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains . Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains , oil and gas by @-@ products , and forestry products became more important in the resource @-@ based economy . Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver , Edmonton ( via Grande Prairie ) , and Whitehorse ( via Fort Nelson ) . 
 The city draws its water supply from the <unk> River , 18 km ( 11 mi ) west of town . Before reaching the city , the water is pumped through a settling pond , two storage ponds , and a treatment plant where it is <unk> , filtered , and chlorinated . The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents . Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River . 
 = = Education = = 
 Dawson Creek is located in School District 59 Peace River South which maintains four elementary schools ( Tremblay , Frank Ross , Crescent Park , and <unk> elementary schools ) , and one high school ( Dawson Creek Secondary School ) . 
 Mountain Christian School , and Ron Pettigrew Christian School are K @-@ 12 private schools located in the <unk> is also Notre Dame which is a K @-@ 7 Catholic school . 
 Established in 1975 , Northern Lights College has a campus in Dawson Creek that houses its Regional Administration and two Centres of Excellence . At Northern Lights College , students can earn a one @-@ year certificate , a two @-@ year diploma or associate degree , or complete upgrading courses to get their high school diploma . 
 = = Culture and recreation = = 
 The cultural identity of Dawson Creek rests on its designation as Mile " 0 " of the Alaska Highway . The Mile " 0 " post , depicted in the city flag , is located in the historic downtown area , one block south of the Northern Alberta Railways Park . This four @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 6 ha ) , mostly paved park is the gathering point for travellers . The park includes the Dawson Creek Art Gallery , which exhibits work by local artists and craftsmen . The Station Museum , connected to the art gallery , displays artifacts and exhibits associated with the construction of the NAR railway and the Alaska Highway . Other parks in Dawson Creek include the Mile Zero Rotary Park and the Walter Wright Pioneer Village . Annual events in the city include the Dawson Creek <unk> and Choir performance , the Dawson Creek Art Gallery auction , the Dawson Creek Spring Rodeo , and the Peace Country Blue Grass Festival . The largest event , held annually since 1953 , is the Dawson Creek Fall Fair & Exhibition — a five @-@ day professional rodeo , with a parade , fairgrounds , and exhibitions . 
 City recreation facilities include two ice hockey arenas , a curling rink , an indoor swimming pool , an outdoor ice rink , and a speed skating oval . The South Peace Community Multiplex , a new facility completed in 2010 , boasts a pool , indoor rodeo grounds and ice rink . Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected its cost at C $ 21 @.@ 6 million . The project became controversial when construction began and the cost projection was raised to $ 35 million . The facility is located close to the city 's exhibition grounds , away from residential uses . It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ seat convention centre / ice arena with skyboxes . Nearby Bear Mountain , located south of the city , provides over 20 km ( 12 mi ) of snowshoeing and cross @-@ country skiing trails , as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500 km ( 300 mi ) of trails for snowmobiles , mountain bikes , and all @-@ terrain vehicles . The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team , the Dawson Creek Rage , beginning in the 2010 – 11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties .

Concurrent with municipal elections , residents also elect two school board trustees to School District 59 which consists of seven trustees . 
 The city government administered a 2015 operating budget of approximately $ 36 million which predominantly went towards fire and police protection , recreational facilities and services , water treatment and distribution , sewage collection and treatment , road maintenance , snow removal , library services , parks , public transportation , and the airport . For creating its Community Energy Plan , which involved the installation of low @-@ voltage street lights and solar @-@ powered hot water heaters , the city was awarded the Federation of Canadian Municipalities ' 2007 Sustainable Community Award . 
 Dawson Creek is situated in the Peace River South provincial electoral district and is represented by Mike Bernier of the British Columbia Liberal Party in the provincial assembly . Bernier served as mayor of Dawson Creek between 2008 and 2013 . His predecessor , Blair Lekstrom , also served as mayor of Dawson Creek , between 1996 and 2001 , before being elected as the MLA for the BC Liberals . Bernier became a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 provincial election with 46 % support . Before Bernier and Lekstrom , Peace River South was represented by Dawson Creek resident Jack Weisgerber . Weisgerber was first elected in 1986 as a member of the Social Credit Party and served as the province 's Minister of Energy , Mines and Petroleum Resources and Minister of Native Affairs . While the Social Credit Party lost power in 1991 , Weisgerber was re @-@ elected and served as interim party leader . He joined the Reform Party of British Columbia in 1994 and won re @-@ election in 1996 as party leader , even though Dawson Creek polls put him in third place behind the BC Liberal Party and New Democratic Party candidates . 
 Federally , Dawson Creek is located in the Prince George — Peace River riding . The riding is represented in the Canadian House of Commons by Conservative Bob Zimmer . Bob Zimmer was elected to this seat in 2011 after Jay Hill retired . Before Hill , who was first elected in 1993 , the riding was represented by Progressive Conservative Frank Oberle . Oberle served as its Member of Parliament for 20 years . 
 = Write amplification = 
 Write amplification ( WA ) is an undesirable phenomenon associated with flash memory and solid @-@ state drives ( SSDs ) where the actual amount of physical information written is a multiple of the logical amount intended to be written . 
 Because flash memory must be erased before it can be rewritten , with much coarser <unk> of the erase operation when compared to the write operation , the process to perform these operations results in moving ( or rewriting ) user data and metadata more than once . Thus , rewriting some data requires an already used portion of flash to be read , updated and written to a new location , together with initially erasing the new location if it was previously used at some point in time ; due to the way flash works , much larger portions of flash must be erased and rewritten than actually required by the amount of new data . This multiplying effect increases the number of writes required over the life of the SSD which shortens the time it can reliably operate . The increased writes also consume bandwidth to the flash memory which mainly reduces random write performance to the SSD . Many factors will affect the write amplification of an SSD ; some can be controlled by the user and some are a direct result of the data written to and usage of the SSD . 
 Intel and <unk> ( acquired by Western Digital in 2009 ) used the term write amplification in their papers and publications as early as 2008 . Write amplification is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system . Without compression , write amplification cannot drop below one . Using compression , SandForce has claimed to achieve a typical write amplification of 0 @.@ 5 , with best @-@ case values as low as 0 @.@ 14 in the SF @-@ 2281 controller . 
 = = Basic SSD operation = = 
 Due to the nature of flash memory 's operation , data cannot be directly overwritten as it can in a hard disk drive . When data is first written to an SSD , the cells all start in an erased state so data can be written directly using pages at a time ( often 4 – 8 kilobytes ( KB ) in size ) . The SSD controller on the SSD , which manages the flash memory and interfaces with the host system , uses a logical @-@ to @-@ physical mapping system known as logical block addressing ( LBA ) and that is part of the flash translation layer ( FTL ) . When new data comes in replacing older data already written , the SSD controller will write the new data in a new location and update the logical mapping to point to the new physical location . The data in the old location is no longer valid , and will need to be erased before the location can be written again . 
 Flash memory can only be programmed and erased a limited number of times . This is often referred to as the maximum number of program / erase cycles ( P / E cycles ) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory . Single @-@ level cell ( SLC ) flash , designed for higher performance and longer endurance , can typically operate between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 cycles . As of 2011 , multi @-@ level cell ( MLC ) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 . Since 2013 , triple @-@ level cell ( TLC ) flash has been available , with cycle counts dropping to 1 @,@ 000 program @-@ erase ( P / E ) cycles . A lower write amplification is more desirable , as it corresponds to a reduced number of P / E cycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life . 
 = = Calculating the value = = 
 Write amplification was always present in SSDs before the term was defined , but it was in 2008 that both Intel and <unk> started using the term in their papers and publications . All SSDs have a write amplification value and it is based on both what is currently being written and what was previously written to the SSD . In order to accurately measure the value for a specific SSD , the selected test should be run for enough time to ensure the drive has reached a steady state condition . 
 A simple formula to calculate the write amplification of an SSD is : 
 <formula> 
 = = Factors affecting the value = = 
 Many factors affect the write amplification of an SSD . The table below lists the primary factors and how they affect the write amplification . For factors that are variable , the table notes if it has a direct relationship or an inverse relationship . For example , as the amount of over @-@ provisioning increases , the write amplification decreases ( inverse relationship ) . If the factor is a toggle ( enabled or disabled ) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship . 
 = = Garbage collection = = 
 Data is written to the flash memory in units called pages ( made up of multiple cells ) . However , the memory can only be erased in larger units called blocks ( made up of multiple pages ) . If the data in some of the pages of the block are no longer needed ( also called stale pages ) , only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block . Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data . This is a process called garbage collection ( GC ) . All SSDs include some level of garbage collection , but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process . Garbage collection is a big part of write amplification on the SSD . 
 Reads do not require an erase of the flash memory , so they are not generally associated with write amplification . In the limited chance of a read disturb error , the data in that block is read and rewritten , but this would not have any material impact on the write amplification of the drive . 
 = = = Background garbage collection = = = 
 The process of garbage collection involves reading and rewriting data to the flash memory . This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block , a write of the parts of the block which still include valid data , and then a write of the new data . This can significantly reduce the performance of the system . Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection ( BGC ) , sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle @-@ time garbage collection ( ITGC ) , where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data . This enables the performance of the device to remain high . 
 If the controller were to background garbage collect all of the spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary , new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance , letting the performance operate at its peak speed . The trade @-@ off is that some of those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted , but the OS did not tell the controller this information . The result is that the soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory , increasing the write amplification . In some of the SSDs from <unk> the background garbage collection only clears up a small number of blocks then stops , thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes . Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes . This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle . The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability . 
 = = = <unk> @-@ aware garbage collection = = = 
 In 2010 , some manufacturers ( notably Samsung ) introduced SSD controllers that extended the concept of BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD , to identify recently deleted files and <unk> space . The manufacturer claimed that this would ensure that even systems ( operating systems and SATA controller hardware ) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance . The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system . It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers . Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives if they are not formatted properly using MBR and NTFS . 
 = = Over @-@ provisioning = = 
 Over @-@ provisioning ( sometimes spelled as OP , over provisioning , or <unk> ) is the difference between the physical capacity of the flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system ( OS ) as available for the user . During the garbage collection , wear @-@ leveling , and bad block mapping operations on the SSD , the additional space from over @-@ provisioning helps lower the write amplification when the controller writes to the flash memory . 
 The first source of over @-@ provisioning comes from the computation of the capacity and use of gigabyte ( GB ) as the unit instead of <unk> ( GiB ) . Both HDD and SSD vendors use the term GB to represent a decimal GB or 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( = 109 ) bytes . Like most other electronic storage , flash memory is assembled in powers of two , so calculating the physical capacity of an SSD would be based on 1 @,@ 073 @,@ 741 @,@ 824 ( = 230 ) per binary GB or GiB . The difference between these two values is 7 @.@ 37 % ( 
 = ( 230 − 109 ) / 109 × 100 % ) . Therefore , a 128 GB SSD with 0 % additional over @-@ provisioning would provide 128 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 bytes to the user ( out of 137 @,@ 438 @,@ 953 @,@ 472 total ) . This initial 7 @.@ 37 % is typically not counted in the total over @-@ provisioning number , and the true amount available is usually less as some storage space is needed for the controller to keep track of non @-@ operating system data such as block status flags . The 7 @.@ 37 % figure may extend to 9 @.@ 95 % in the terabyte range , as manufacturers take advantage of a further grade of binary / decimal unit divergence to offer 1 or 2 TB drives of 1000 and 2000 GB capacity ( 931 and 1862 GiB ) , respectively , instead of 1024 and 2048 GB ( as 1 TB = 
 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 bytes in decimal terms , but 1 @,@ 099 @,@ 511 @,@ 627 @,@ 776 in binary ) . 
 The second source of over @-@ provisioning comes from the manufacturer , typically at 0 % , 7 % or 28 % , based on the difference between the decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user . As an example , a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100 , 120 or 128 GB based on 128 GB of possible capacity . This difference is 28 % , 7 % and 0 % respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28 % of over @-@ provisioning on their drive . This does not count the additional 7 @.@ 37 % of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte . 
 The third source of over @-@ provisioning comes from known free space on the drive , gaining endurance and performance at the expense of reporting unused portions , and / or at the expense of current or future capacity . This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command . Alternately , some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over @-@ provisioning . Furthermore , if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100 % of the available space , that <unk> space will be automatically used by the SSD as over @-@ provisioning as well . Yet another source of over @-@ provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits ; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive , particularly on the boot or main drive . If this additional space can be identified by the SSD , perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command , then this acts as semi @-@ permanent over @-@ provisioning . Over @-@ provisioning often takes away from user capacity , either temporarily or permanently , but it gives back reduced write amplification , increased endurance , and increased performance . 
 A simple formula to calculate the over @-@ provision of an SSD is : 
 <formula> 
 = = TRIM = = 
 TRIM is a SATA command that enables the operating system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed as a result of file deletions or volume formatting . When an LBA is replaced by the OS , as with an overwrite of a file , the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection . If the user or operating system erases a file ( not just remove parts of it ) , the file will typically be marked for deletion , but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased . Because of this , the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file , so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection . 
 The introduction of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7 , Mac OS ( latest releases of Snow Leopard , Lion , and Mountain Lion , patched in some cases ) , FreeBSD since version 8 @.@ 1 , and Linux since version 2 @.@ 6 @.@ 33 of the Linux kernel mainline . When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted , the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs that no longer contain valid data . This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused . This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection . The result is the SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance . 
 = = = Limitations and dependencies = = = 
 The TRIM command also needs the support of the SSD . If the firmware in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command , the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid . Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid . SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user , or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately <unk> the SSD . The benefit would only be realized after each run of that utility by the user . The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task . 
 Just because an SSD supports the TRIM command does not necessarily mean it will be able to perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command . The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD . It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance . 
 Even after the OS and SSD are configured to support the TRIM command , other conditions might prevent any benefit from TRIM . As of early 2010 , databases and RAID systems are not yet TRIM @-@ aware and consequently will not know how to pass that information on to the SSD . In those cases the SSD will continue to save and garbage collect those blocks until the OS uses those LBAs for new writes . 
 The actual benefit of the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD . If the user capacity on the SSD was 100 GB and the user actually saved 95 GB of data to the drive , any TRIM operation would not add more than 5 GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling . In those situations , increasing the amount of over @-@ provisioning by 5 GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5 GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS . 
 = = Free user space = = 
 The SSD controller will use any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling . The portion of the user capacity which is free from user data ( either already <unk> or never written in the first place ) will look the same as over @-@ provisioning space ( until the user saves new data to the SSD ) . If the user only saves data consuming 1 / 2 of the total user capacity of the drive , the other half of the user capacity will look like additional over @-@ provisioning ( as long as the TRIM command is supported in the system ) . 
 = = Secure erase = = 
 The ATA Secure Erase command is designed to remove all user data from a drive . With an SSD without integrated encryption , this command will put the drive back to its original out @-@ of @-@ box state . This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best ( lowest number ) possible write amplification , but as soon as the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels . Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well . One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called <unk> . <unk> and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase . 
 Drives which encrypt all writes on the fly can implement ATA Secure Erase in another way . They simply <unk> and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done . In this way the old data cannot be read anymore , as it cannot be decrypted . Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command be sent to the drive to put the drive back to its original out @-@ of @-@ box state . 
 = = Wear leveling = = 
 If a particular block was programmed and erased repeatedly without writing to any other blocks , that block would wear out before all the other blocks — thereby prematurely ending the life of the SSD . For this reason , SSD controllers use a technique called wear leveling to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD . 
 In a perfect scenario , this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time . Unfortunately , the process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing ( cold data ) to be moved , so that data which are changing more frequently ( hot data ) can be written into those blocks . Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system , this increases the write amplification and thus reduces the life of the flash memory . The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both . 
 = = Separating static and dynamic data = = 
 The separation of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification is not a simple process for the SSD controller . The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting ( dynamic data ) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites ( static data ) . If the data is mixed in the same blocks , as with almost all systems today , any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data ( which caused the rewrite initially ) and static data ( which did not require any rewrite ) . Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification . Therefore , separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data . The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P / E cycles . 
 = = Sequential writes = = 
 When an SSD is writing large amounts of data sequentially , the write amplification is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification . The reason is as the data is written , the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file . If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted , the entire block can be marked as invalid , and there is no need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block . It will only need to be erased , which is much easier and faster than the read @-@ erase @-@ modify @-@ write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection . 
 = = Random writes = = 
 The peak random write performance on an SSD is driven by plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected , secure erased , 100 % <unk> , or newly installed . The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller , the efficiency of the firmware , and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page . During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one . Once the blocks are all written once , garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process . Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience . 
 = = Impact on performance = = 
 The overall performance of an SSD is dependent upon a number of factors , including write amplification . Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it . An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance . If the SSD has a high write amplification , the controller will be required to write that many more times to the flash memory . This requires even more time to write the data from the host . An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification .

 Reginald Hugh Hickling ( 2 August 1920 – 11 February 2007 ) , known as Hugh Hickling , was a British lawyer , civil servant , law academic , and author , and author of the controversial Internal Security Act of colonial Malaysia . 
 Born in Derby , England , Hickling served from 1941 until 1946 in the British Royal Navy during World War II , and then joined the Colonial Legal Service . In 1955 , Hickling was posted to Malaya ( now Malaysia ) , where he gained prominence as a lawmaker . He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia , and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) of 1960 , which provided for the detention of persons without trial . The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non @-@ violent activities , which Hickling later said was not his intention . 
 In 1972 , Hickling retired from the civil service , and subsequently lectured in law in Australia , Malaysia , Singapore , and the United Kingdom . Hickling later wrote many books and law journal articles , and also wrote novels and short stories throughout his career . Hickling died in 2007 in Malvern , Worcestershire . 
 = = Early life 1920 – 1950 = = 
 Hickling was the son of Frederick Hickling , a police inspector , and his wife Elsie , of Malvern , Worcestershire . Hickling was born on 2 August 1920 in Derby , and educated at Buxton College . He applied to study at the University of Oxford , but was unsuccessful at his interview , because he shocked his examiner by rating the poetry of A. E. Housman over that of William Wordsworth . He studied instead at the University of Nottingham , where he became the youngest student to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws ( LL.B. ) . After graduation , Hickling joined a law firm as an articled clerk , and then enrolled for one year of approved academic study at the East Midlands School of Law . 
 Between 1941 and 1946 Hickling served as an ordinary seaman in World War II with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on board HMS La <unk> , a 29 @-@ metre French corvette taken over by the British . The ship was part of Convoy PQ @-@ 17 , carrying matériel from Britain and the US to the USSR . PQ @-@ 17 sailed in June – July 1942 and suffered the heaviest losses of any Russia @-@ bound convoy , with 25 vessels out of 36 lost to enemy action . On D @-@ Day , he was a sub @-@ lieutenant commanding an Mk IV Landing Craft Tank 1013 with LCT 1018 of the 43rd LCT flotilla , which carried several hundred tons of ammunition to Sword Beach , Normandy . 
 Hickling married Beryl ( Bee ) Dennett in 1945 , and the following year he resumed his legal career as deputy solicitor with the Evening Standard in London . After the death of their firstborn son , they emigrated despite his wife 's uncertainty about moving as far from England as possible . 
 = = Crown colony 1950 – 1972 = = 
 Hickling joined the Colonial Legal Service , and in 1950 was posted to Sarawak , then a British colony , as assistant attorney general and , as he put it , " cheerfully assisted in the dissolution of Empire " . In 1954 , he spent two months in the sultanate of Brunei to research its constitutional status and to brief colonial officials on its history and traditions before the introduction of a written constitution , and submitted his memorandum on the matter in 1955 . 
 Immediately thereafter , Hickling was transferred to Malaya as its first parliamentary draftsman , and in that capacity he helped to prepare the Malayan ( now Malaysian ) constitution for that country 's independence from Britain in 1957 . Subsequently , as Commissioner of Law Revision he drafted the Internal Security Act of 1960 , based on the Emergency Ordinance 1948 which had been enacted to provide the British colonial authorities with powers to tackle a communist insurgency . For his contributions to Malaya , Hickling was made a Companion of the Order of the Defender of the Realm ( known in Malay as the Johan <unk> Negara or <unk> ) by the Malaysian head of state , the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong , in 1960 . 
 The Internal Security Act allows persons to be detained without trial for acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life . It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution , which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons , whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property , the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong or the government , or the promotion of feelings of ill @-@ will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties . Upon Singapore 's independence from Malaysia in 1965 , the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book . 
 According to the New Straits Times , Hickling later wrote in 1989 , " I could not imagine then that the time would come when the power of detention , carefully and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution , would be used against political opponents , welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent , peaceful activities . " However , he commented that it was not for him to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped . " As a lawyer , I 'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped , I don 't know . You 've got a multi @-@ racial society [ in Malaysia ] in which emotions can run high very quickly . " Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's radio programme PM in April 2001 , Hickling agreed with the interviewer , Geoff Thompson , that he supported the law 's continued existence and said he was " sorry to say that , in the light of my own experience , I 'm inclined to think you couldn 't really safely get rid of it at the moment " . Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9 / 11 confirmed his views on the matter . 
 Hickling later served with the Commonwealth Office in 1964 , and as legal adviser to the High Commissioner in Aden and the Federation of South Arabia between 1964 and 1967 . He was also Maritime Law Adviser in Thailand ( 1968 – 1969 ) , Malaysia ( 1969 ) , Sri Lanka ( 1970 ) and the Yemen Arab Republic ( 1984 and 1986 ) . His last colonial post was that of Attorney General of Gibraltar between 1970 and 1972 . 
 = = Academia and later life 1972 – 2007 = = 
 After retiring from the civil service , Hickling became a law academic . He was a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London ( which awarded him a Doctor of Philosophy ( Ph.D. ) in Law ) from 1976 to 1978 and from 1981 to 1982 where he taught Southeast Asian law , and a visiting lecturer at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1978 to 1980 . He was also adjunct Professor of Southeast Asian Law at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia ( National University of Malaysia ) in Bangi , Selangor , for six years . 
 He authored books and law journal articles , particularly about public law in Malaysia and Singapore ; some of the latter were collected into two works , Essays in Malaysian Law ( 1991 ) and Essays in Singapore Law ( 1992 ) . In 1995 , in recognition of his reputation and standing in the legal profession , he was appointed adjunct professor of law at the Centre of South East Asian Law at Charles Darwin University in Darwin in the Northern Territory , Australia . Until 2006 , Hickling continued travelling to the Far East and Australia , delivering lectures , reviewing examination papers and visiting friends , colleagues and students . Despite his many accolades , he lived simply and impressed staff and students with his disarming humility . In addition to his legal writings , Hickling wrote novels and short stories , mostly drawing on his experiences of life in different British colonies . Hickling was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George ( CMG ) in 1968 and a Queen 's Counsel ( Gibraltar ) in 1970 . 
 Upon his retirement , Hickling chose to settle in Malvern , Worcestershire , because of family connections to the town , and indulged his lifelong passion for the music of Mozart . He died after a short illness on 11 February 2007 in St. Richard 's Hospice , Malvern , survived by his wife , two sons and a daughter , and 12 grandchildren .

 In 1973 – 1974 , while waiting for a Foreign Office posting , Hickling wrote an unpublished personal memoir recalling his time as legal adviser to the High Commissioner in Aden and the Federation of South Arabia between 1964 and 1967 . Hickling deposited documents relating to this memoir at the Churchill Archives Centre of Churchill College , University of Cambridge , in 1996 , where they may be accessed under the title " The Papers of ( Reginald ) Hugh Hickling " ( reference <unk> / 0014 / <unk> ) .

 = California State Route 198 = 
 State Route 198 ( SR 198 ) is an east – west state highway that begins at U.S. Route 101 ( US 101 ) south of King City and ends in Sequoia National Park . It connects the California Central Coast to the mid – Central Valley through Hanford and Visalia , although the most developed portion is in the Central Valley itself . SR 198 intersects the major north – south routes in the Central Valley , including Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) , SR 33 , and SR 99 . The highway that would become SR 198 was approved for construction in the 1910s through three bond issues , and was added to the state highway system in 1934 . Parts of the highway were upgraded to freeway during the 1960s . Another portion is being converted to an expressway in between Hanford and Visalia , with completion scheduled for late 2012 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The road begins at a remote interchange with US 101 south of King City in the Salinas River Valley . Leaving US 101 , SR 198 passes through the Priest Valley , climbs the Diablo Range as a two @-@ lane road and crosses over an unnamed pass . It then descends along Warthan Canyon to the town of Coalinga in the agricultural Central Valley , where it briefly runs concurrently with SR 33 . On both sides of Coalinga the road passes through the enormous Coalinga Oil Field . 
 SR 198 then intersects Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in Fresno County near the Harris Ranch Airport before becoming a freeway west of Lemoore . The landscape becomes a bit less rural as it goes through Hanford and passes near the Hanford Municipal Airport , where it continues as a four @-@ lane expressway from the intersection with SR 43 until SR 198 encounters a freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange with SR 99 as it enters Visalia , the largest city it passes through , and goes by the Visalia Municipal Airport . It remains a freeway until east of Visalia , intersecting SR 65 and passing by College of the <unk> . The road starts to climb the forested Sierra Nevada and ends at Sequoia National Park , near Lake Kaweah . This is one of the main routes providing access to Sequoia National Park , the other being SR 180 to the north . 
 SR 198 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System as designated by the California State Legislature ; however , it is not a scenic highway as defined by Caltrans . 
 = = History = = 
 All of SR 198 was added to the state highway system in the three bond issues floated to pay for the construction of the system . The first bond issue , approved by the state 's voters in 1910 , included the road from Visalia west to Hanford , connecting the two county seats with the central north – south highway ( Route 4 , now SR 99 ) . As part of the 1916 bond issue , the route was extended west from Hanford through Coalinga to the coast trunk highway ( Route 2 , now US 101 ) near San Lucas , and assigned it the Route 10 designation . The third bond issue , passed in 1919 , included a further extension east from Visalia to Sequoia National Park . The entire length of Route 10 was marked as Sign Route 198 in 1934 , and this number was adopted legislatively in the 1964 renumbering . The portion east of Interstate 5 near Coalinga was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 , and parts of it have been built as such . The construction of the freeway east of Visalia to Road 192 was approved in January 1961 , with the remainder of the freeway unplanned at that time as contingent on the routing of SR 65 . The projected cost in 1958 of the entire freeway east of Visalia was $ 13 million ( $ 262 million in today 's dollars ) and was scheduled to be completed by 1964 . The freeway through Visalia was completed by 1965 , with an expressway connecting it to US 99 . Also completed was the expressway heading west out of Hanford , with part of it access @-@ controlled west of Lemoore . 
 Construction began in November 2009 on a project to widen a two @-@ lane , 10 @-@ mile section of SR 198 between SR 43 and SR 99 into a four @-@ lane expressway . The $ 60 million project was completed in December 2012 .

 The Kings County Association of Governments has plans to improve the state highways within the county . Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas , but they are currently turned off by the lack of freeway access . For SR 198 , the plan is to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I @-@ 5 . However , Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects .

 = Nittany Furnace = 
 Nittany Furnace , known earlier as Valentine Furnace , was a hot blast iron furnace located in Spring Township , Centre County , Pennsylvania , United States . Placed in operation in 1888 on the site of an older furnace , it was an important feature of Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911 , no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers . 
 = = Centre Iron Company = = 
 The preliminaries to the furnace 's construction began in 1885 , when Valentine and Thomas , an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte , decided to sell off its properties . These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge , on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte , and Bellefonte Furnace , a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town , also on Logan Branch , as well as holdings in local iron ore mines . Both plants were served by the Bellefonte , Nittany and Lemont Railroad , a subsidiary of the PRR . The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2 , 1886 , for $ 400 @,@ 000 , by the Valentine Ore Land Association , whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace , which was to be torn down . A $ 600 @,@ 000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties , to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace . The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard , W. M. Stewart , and B. K. Jamison , a Philadelphia banker . The plant was built in 1887 , and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore . It became necessary to raise additional funds , and in 1887 , the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $ 75 @,@ 000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace . The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28 , 1888 , and the furnace went into blast on March 4 , 1888 . The company was originally headed by Jamison , but by 1890 , James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice @-@ president . At this time , the furnace had one 70 @-@ foot ( 21 @-@ meter ) stack and three hot @-@ blast stoves , with a capacity of 30 @,@ 000 tons ( 27 @,@ 200 tonnes ) of iron per year . Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits , and the furnace was fuelled by <unk> coke . In the same year , however , the failure of Jamison 's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15 , 1890 . It was subsequently sold under foreclosure . 
 = = Valentine Iron Company = = 
 The Valentine Iron Company was organized by the bondholders of the Centre Iron Company to take over the furnace , and was incorporated on January 28 , 1891 . The president was J. Wesley Gephart , Bellefonte lawyer and industrialist , and the treasurer and manager was Robert Valentine , of the original ironmaking family . A report just prior to the charter records the permanent board of directors as James H. Campbell , of Wayne , Oliver Hazard <unk> , of Williamsport , Charles W. Wilhelm , of Reading , Daniel Rhoades , Valentine , and Gephart . ( <unk> was connected with another Valentine Iron Company , later the Williamsport Iron and Nail Works . ) 
 Gephart was not only president of the iron company ( and the Nittany Valley Railroad , still an affiliate ) , but an active railroad promoter in another direction . He became president of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania , which , on December 2 , 1893 , opened its line from Mill Hall to Bellefonte , crossing and connecting with the Nittany Valley about a mile east of Bellefonte . The new line connected with the Beech Creek Railroad , controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad 's rival , the New York Central Railroad . 
 At the beginning of this year , the iron furnace had " re @-@ opened " , presumably the result of an upswing in the depressed iron market as the rival Bellefonte Furnace did the same . With the construction of the new railroad , the furnace 's traffic was rapidly diverted over that line , prompting a lawsuit from the Pennsylvania Railroad to enforce the contract made with the Centre Iron Company . While a lower court initially held the contract not to be binding on Valentine Iron , the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1895 , and the furnace was forced to remove its traffic from the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania . Due to this serious setback , Gephart was compelled to step down as president of Valentine Iron and the Nittany Valley , and thereafter devoted himself to the management of the Central Railroad . He was replaced at Valentine Iron by John P. Harris , and by Mortimer O 'Donoghue at the Nittany Valley . O 'Donoghue also became superintendent of Valentine Iron the next year . 
 The furnace operated only intermittently under Valentine Iron management , and in early 1899 , it was bought by the Empire Steel and Iron Company , along with the Nittany Valley RR and the associated ore lands . Empire Steel renamed the plant " Nittany Furnace , " and sent Walter Kennedy , vice @-@ president of engineering , to survey the local ore resources in March 1899 . Empire decided to use a mixture of local and Lake Superior ores , and relit the furnace in May 1899 . However , Empire shut down the furnace again in April 1900 , closing it indefinitely . The furnace and railroad were bought at a sheriff 's sale on December 21 , 1900 by a Harrisburg bank with a lien on the property . 
 = = Nittany Iron Company = = 
 Once again , Gephart appeared on the scene to save the furnace . With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors , he formed the Nittany Iron Company , which bought and rehabilitated the furnace , returning it to blast on June 5 , 1902 , under Frank H. Clemson ( former chief of mining at Gephart 's Bellefonte Furnace Company ) . Other organizers included Lorenzo <unk> Munson , Gephart 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ( who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works ) , Archer Brown , and William Sampson . However , prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business . The furnace was idle for two months in 1904 . As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace ( a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore , while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore ) , Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit . The death of Gephart on February 14 , 1905 also dealt a blow to the company , which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company . 
 When in operation , the furnace continued to receive ore over the Nittany Valley RR , but the Nigh and Taylor ore banks served by that road had begun to play out . Most Lake Superior ore was delivered directly by the PRR , but some was routed from the PRR onto the Central RR of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte , hauled up to Nittany Valley Junction , and delivered over the Nittany Valley . Other local ore from Scotia arrived from pits on the Bellefonte Central Railroad , which was originally delivered to the PRR at Bellefonte . When the PRR raised rates in fall 1906 , trying to collect Scotia ore traffic via its <unk> Branch , the Bellefonte Central responded by delivering the cars directly to the Central RR of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte Furnace , whence they could travel over the Central and Nittany Valley to Nittany Furnace . In 1905 , the furnace began to receive lime from the <unk> Quarries in Pleasant Gap , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) along the PRR Bellefonte Branch ; a partner in the quarries was Noah H. Swayne II , who had been made general manager of the furnace the previous year when Gephart resigned on grounds of health . 
 The furnace continued in anemic health until the Panic of 1907 . As a result of that crisis , it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909 . It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore , and went out of blast on January 23 , 1911 . Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December . The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary , but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate , and no buyer willing to operate them could be found . Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912 – 1913 . The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished . The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Passing through the hands of four owners during its troubled 23 @-@ year history , Nittany Furnace never fulfilled the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated ( charcoal ) Bellefonte Furnace . It should arguably never have been built : by the time it went into blast in 1888 , the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $ 22 , a historic low , and it would almost never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh , fed by Mesabi Range ore , could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could . The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined , high @-@ grade Mesabi ore , hauled by rail . 
 Wes Gephart , though his personal brilliance and ability to attract investment , was able to cover the decline to some extent . By his death in 1905 , he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces , extensive ore mines , and two railroads . But even during his lifetime , Bellefonte had seen the end of its glory : after 1890 , its population , heretofore steadily growing , would decline for the next thirty years . Nor did Gephart 's empire long survive him ; little more than a decade after his death , the furnaces were demolished , the mines shut down , and one railroad scrapped . Only the Central Railroad remained , staggering to a pauper 's grave in 1918 , sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring . The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of ironmaking in Bellefonte . Though not fully apparent at the time , neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace ironmaking as the guarantor of the town 's prosperity . The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County . 
 = Ontario Highway 129 = 
 King 's Highway 129 , commonly referred to as Highway 129 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . Located in the Algoma and Sudbury districts , the highway extends for 221 kilometres ( 137 mi ) from a junction with Highway 17 in Thessalon to the town of Chapleau , just north of Highway 101 . The route is isolated and lightly travelled throughout its length ; while providing access to several remote settlements , the only sizable communities along the route are the two termini . The highway was established in 1956 along the Chapleau Road . From the early @-@ 1960s to mid @-@ 1970s , Highway 129 was designated as the Chapleau Route of the Trans @-@ Canada Highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 129 is one of the most isolated in Ontario and among the least @-@ used of the King 's Highways . Although the highway is an important access route for several isolated communities , including Little Rapids , Sultan , <unk> and <unk> , as well as provincial parks such as Aubrey Falls , Five Mile Lake and <unk> Lake , the only community located directly on the highway 's route between its termini is Wharncliffe . There are few services along Highway 129 between Wharncliffe and Highway 667 . Tunnel Lake Trading Post and Aubrey Falls Trading Post & Resort offer some basic goods , fuel and lodging for travelers and local residents . 
 The route begins in the town of Thessalon at Highway 17 , north of Lake Huron . It travels northeast through the Municipality of Huron Shores , passing the Thessalon Township Heritage Museum southeast of Little Rapids . <unk> between Basswood Lake and the Byrnes Lake White Birch Provincial Conservation Reserve , it enters the unorganized portions of Algoma District . It passes through Wharncliffe , crosses the Mississagi River and encounters Highway 554 , which travels east to Kynoch . 
 North of Highway 554 , the route is generally parallel to the river and Mississagi River Provincial Park . After passing west of <unk> Lake on its journey through completely undeveloped forest and muskeg , it reaches a junction with Highway 556 southwest of Aubrey Falls Provincial Park . Thereafter , the highway roughly follows the Wenebegon River through Wenebegon River Provincial Park to Wenebegon Lake . Highway 129 encounters the entrance to Five Mile Provincial Park and meets Highway 667 , which travels east through Sultan , becoming the Sultan Industrial Road and connecting with Highway 144 . 
 From this junction , the route travels northwest towards Highway 101 , where drivers must turn right to continue north on the route . Both highways travel concurrently northeast for 7 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) , at which point Highway 101 branches off to the east . Highway 129 continues north alongside the Sudbury – White River CPR line . It ends at the southern town limits of Chapleau , continuing north as a local road through the town and into the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve , the largest game preserve in the world . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 129 was first designated between Aubrey Falls and Chapleau in 1956 , following the Thessalon – Chapleau Highway , a dirt road along the banks of the Mississagi River that opened to traffic on January 28 , 1949 . Though opened , this initial road was almost impassable , and certainly dangerous . Despite this , it quickly gained notoriety for its breathtaking scenery and seemingly limitless hunting and fishing potential . However , the poor condition of the road often left a terrible impression on tourists . John Austin Moore described his voyage up the road during the summer of 1951 : 
 " Our first trip by car took us over the famed Chapleau Road , the scenery and unique loneliness of which have been often reported in magazines . And surely its condition not long after it had opened to travel , when we first drove it in June 1951 , was unforgettable . One trip over its 145 miles was almost guaranteed to shorten your life " 
 The route was extended south on February 27 , 1957 , absorbing the entire length of Highway 559 , itself designated in 1956 . The Highway 559 designation has since been reused in Parry Sound District . In 1961 , the partially gravel surfaced highway was designated as the Chapleau Route of the Trans @-@ Canada Highway , despite being only a spur in the network at that time . This designation lasted until as early as 1974 and as late as 1978 . 
 Highway 129 was the last King 's Highway to be paved ; the section immediately south of Aubrey Falls remained a gravel road as late as 1982 . The one @-@ lane Rapid River Bridge was replaced by an adjacent two @-@ lane bridge in the second quarter of 2010 .

 = Marcus Lindblom = 
 Marcus Lindblom is an American video game developer known for his English localization of the 1995 video game EarthBound . Lindblom spent his youth in the United States , and dropped out of college to move to Japan with his wife . After four years , he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America 's call center . He eventually worked on Japanese @-@ to @-@ English game localization projects such as Wario 's Woods and EarthBound . Lindblom worked with a translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience . He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi 's script , but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he wanted , and so added in American cultural allusions . Lindblom considers the localization his highest achievement . 
 He worked at Nintendo until 1996 , when he left to work at other developers including Electronic Arts , Vivendi Games , Midway Games , and THQ . He established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009 , and as of 2013 , runs mobile games studio Carried Away Games . After following the fan community from afar , he came out to fans in mid 2012 and the press began to show greater interest in his work . He had planned to write a book about the game 's development , release , and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Marcus Lindblom was raised in " a traditional , middle @-@ class family " . He dropped out of college , married , and moved with his spouse to Japan in the late 1980s . They planned to stay several months , but stayed four years before returning in 1990 . 
 = = EarthBound = = 
 In the United States , Lindblom returned to college and , in 1990 , began to work at Nintendo of America 's customer service and game assistance call center in Redmond , Washington . He would wake up at four a.m. to work before class , a schedule he considered " energizing " . Upon his graduation , Lindblom became a Software Analyst at Nintendo , where he worked on their games . 
 Lindblom later transitioned to work as a localizer , where he translated Nintendo 's Japanese games into English for Western audiences . As standard for the time , he worked without a department and in direct contact with the headquarters , which gave him wide decision @-@ making latitude . Lindblom worked on Wario 's Woods before coming to the EarthBound project around January 1995 . He took over for Nintendo 's Dan Owsen , who had localized a tenth of the game 's script before moving to another project . The game was roughly translated from Japanese by a translator , and Lindblom received a paper script with the translation . Masayuki Miura , a Japanese writer , worked with Lindblom to contextualize the English script for the mood and message intended by the game 's original development team . 
 Lindblom found his task of translating an " outsider 's view of the U.S. " for an American audience the hardest part of the localization . Nintendo did not want a direct translation , but a more American version of the script . He recalled that he was given latitude to make the script " as weird as [ he ] wanted " but also sought to stay true to the original text 's translation , though he never communicated with Shigesato Itoi ( the game 's creator ) directly . Lindblom 's own humor and office in @-@ jokes worked their way into the script alongside cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny , comedian Benny Hill , and This Is Spinal Tap . Outside the game 's script , Lindblom 's in @-@ game text includes the item and weapon names as well as the combat prompts . His writing contains multiple Easter eggs , such as in some of the character 's names . One character is named for his daughter , Nico , who was born during development . After taking the day off for her birthday , Lindblom recalled working for the next 30 days straight , without weekends off . He remembered the workload as large , and recalled " grinding @-@ out " for about 14 hours a day . The localization process took four months . 
 Lindblom credited Miura and the game 's affirming " tone " as what helped him manage the magnitude of the project . He remembers the game as " very [ positive at its heart ] " and wrote it to be " a glass half full kind of game " . When asked of his favorite contribution to the final work , Lindblom remembered the character Pokey 's mother , <unk> . He described the name choice as " just the most ridiculous thing to have picked " . Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan , an original reviewer , wrote that EarthBound was translated " impeccably " and praised the game 's humor . In the period following its release , the game 's English localization has found praise . Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese @-@ to @-@ English conversion as " top @-@ notch for its time " . Kotaku found the localization " funny , clever , and evocative " . 
 The American development team was devastated by the release 's poor critical response and sales . Lindblom recalled that the game 's reception was hurt by appearing " simplistic " in an age that revered graphics quality . He felt that the game 's changes to the RPG formula — e.g. , the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies — were ignored in the following years . At the time of the game 's Virtual Console rerelease , he felt the game had aged well . 
 = = After EarthBound = = 
 Lindblom worked on several other Nintendo games and left in 1996 . He later worked at studios such as Electronic Arts , Vivendi Games , Midway Games , and THQ . Lindblom established Partly Cloudy Games with friends around 2009 . The company has contracted with Microsoft and is also developing a real @-@ time strategy Facebook game named The Robot Apocalypse . As of 2013 , Lindblom runs Carried Away Games , a mobile games studio . He described many of the games he worked on in his career as " forgettable " and the eventual popularity of EarthBound as " satisfying " . He cited the example of a wedding proposal done through hacked text in EarthBound as something he appreciated . After following the fan community from afar , in mid @-@ 2012 , Lindblom approached the Fangamer booth at the Penny Arcade Expo and explained his involvement in the game . When EarthBound was announced for the Wii U Virtual Console , the press began to show greater interest in Lindblom 's work . Lindblom had planned a book about the game 's development , release , and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea . He did not plan to profit from the book , but felt he " owed " the fan community for its dedication . In response , he said he plans to continue his ongoing dialogue with the community . Lindblom told Kotaku that he thinks of EarthBound as his " finest accomplishment " .

 = Ellen Southard = 
 Ellen Southard was an American full @-@ rigged merchant ship from Bath , Maine that was built in 1863 by prominent shipbuilder T.J. Southard . She plied international trade routes for twelve years , calling at ports as far away as Sydney . 
 On 27 September 1875 , the ship wrecked in the mouth of the Mersey River at Liverpool during a hurricane @-@ strength storm . Shore @-@ based lifeboats crewed mainly by volunteers set out from several lifeboat stations to the aid of the distressed ship after it foundered on a sandbank . One of the lifeboats capsized in heavy seas after picking up the ship 's crew , resulting in nine people from the ship as well as three rescuers losing their lives . 
 Following the advice of the US consul at Liverpool , the United States Congress recognised the acts of bravery by issuing 27 Gold Lifesaving Medals to the lifeboat men who attempted to save her crew , after a two @-@ year delay during which US law first had to be changed to allow the newly instituted medals to be awarded to non @-@ US citizens . Debate about lifeboat designs continued for many years until a self @-@ righting design was eventually adopted . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ellen Southard was built in 1863 in Richmond , Maine , by prominent local shipbuilder T. J. Southard . She was named after the builder 's daughter , Ellen , to whom he also gave a one @-@ sixteenth share of the vessel . The ship was classified " A1 " in the Lloyds Register , meaning that her hull and fittings were of the highest grade . 
 Ellen Southard plied international trade routes from her homeport in Bath , Maine , with visits documented in ports as far away as Sydney , Australia . In 1864 , she recorded the longest duration voyage of any ship transporting railway locomotives from the east to the west coast of the United States . The ship took 205 days to complete the passage after she was delayed for 48 days by unfavourable winds off Cape Horn . 
 In June 1867 , shortly after departing Hong Kong for California with 360 Chinese passengers , Ellen Southard 's master , Captain Howe , died at sea . His wife took charge of the ship , but the passengers and crew became mutinous when the water supply dwindled ; she resorted to using a revolver to keep them at bay until a passing ship encountered Ellen Southard adrift 80 miles ( 130 km ) from Santa Cruz , California . The captain raised the alarm upon reaching port , whereupon the USRC <unk> went to the assistance of the distressed ship . 
 = = Wrecking = = 
 On 12 August 1875 , Ellen Southard set sail for Liverpool in England from Saint John , New Brunswick , under the command of Captain Henry Woodworth with a load of tropical deal ( softwood timber ) . The captain 's wife and fifteen crew members were on board . She was approaching the River Mersey on 26 September 1875 when the most violent storm to hit the region in 36 years struck . It began at 9 pm , increasing rapidly in intensity to hurricane strength by midnight ; the storm remained at this level until 2 am . Buildings were damaged ashore , with two people killed by falling masonry , while on the river , vessels were blown from their moorings and damaged by colliding with one another or with the quays . 
 Ellen Southard had rounded the northern tip of Wales , passing Point Lynas at 1 pm on the day of the storm . After receiving the pilot on board , she was taken in tow by the <unk> United Kingdom under the command of Captain Griffiths for the final leg of her journey into the port of Liverpool . By 9 pm , conditions had become very stormy , and her sails were taken down ; by the time she reached Formby , the ship could no longer be steered , and the tow line was also lost . Ellen Southard dropped her anchors , but they did not hold in the ever @-@ strengthening storm . Finding that it was unable to offer further assistance , the tug set off for Liverpool with the purpose of returning with a lifeboat , but was soon grounded , thereby leaving the stricken American ship to fend for herself . By midnight when the storm reached its peak , Ellen Southard was dismasted and grounded on Jordan Flats about a mile from Crosby lighthouse . The waves crashed heavily on her , and she started to break up as she thumped on the sandbank . The crew were unable to signal for assistance until first light as the vessel did not carry any signal flares — in the interim , they lashed themselves to what remained of the ship to prevent being swept away by the heavy sea . 
 = = Lifeboat disaster = = 
 At just after 5 am , the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board 's lifeboat station received a telegraph stating that a ship was in distress . Nine minutes later , the three @-@ year @-@ old tubular lifeboat set out with fourteen volunteers under the command of Captain James Martin . The steam tug Rattler initially took the Liverpool boat in tow , as the properties that made it suitable as a lifeboat also made it very heavy to row . At approximately the same time that the Liverpool lifeboat was departing Mersey Docks , the New Brighton , Formby and Hoylake boats also got underway , with the New Brighton RNLI boat in tow behind <unk> . The hurricane had abated somewhat , but the sea was still heavy , which made the rowers ' work very difficult in shallower water where the tugs could no longer assist them . 
 When the Liverpool lifeboat came alongside the wreck , some of those aboard were able to jump directly into the lifeboat , but others had to be roped in . The steward , who was the last person on the doomed ship , decided to go back to recover his bag ; minutes passed while the people in the lifeboat waited anxiously until he eventually re @-@ appeared and joined them . Finally , the lifeboat was able to get clear of the wreck and navigate its way though the floating debris to start its return journey to the dock . The New Brighton lifeboat was still about 500 yards ( 460 m ) away when the Liverpool boat left the wreck , and thus the coxswain turned her around once it became apparent that everyone had already been taken off the ship successfully . 
 The wind , tide and sea made it impossible for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow , so the men were forced to start rowing home . About twenty minutes later , as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel , the master elected to raise the foresail to help steady the vessel . People in the lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape , when Captain Martin noticed a huge wave " like a high wall " approaching . He instructed everyone to hold on , fearing that someone might be washed overboard . However rather than breaking over the boat , the wave lifted it and flipped it over . The boat was not self @-@ righting , so the remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to the upturned boat . Rattler 's master witnessed the incident , signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat , Willie and Arthur , which promptly turned around to come to the rescue . The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea . After picking up the survivors and one casualty , the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler , which brought her back to New Brighton . Six of Ellen Southard 's crew , the captain and his wife , as well as the pilot and three lifeboat men from Mersey Docks drowned or died of exposure ( 12 fatalities in total ) . 
 Labourers were employed to salvage the valuable wood that was subsequently washed up on Crosby Beach ; among the items washed up were a hat belonging to the captain 's wife , and a concertina belonging to one of the crew . Two bodies were also seen in the water . 
 A court of enquiry was held the following month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade , and focused particularly on the roles of the captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat . The court found that no @-@ one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat . Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship , and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat . The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role , but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self @-@ righting one , as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered . 
 = = Lifesaving medals = = 
 General Lucius Fairchild , the United States consul at Liverpool , wrote to his government recommending that the gallantry of the Englishmen who were involved in the rescue effort be recognised . The Secretary of State supported his recommendation and the United States Congress moved to award the newly instituted Lifesaving Medal to the lifeboat men . However , a delay of 17 months followed during which a change in legislation had to be enacted to allow the medals to be issued to non @-@ US nationals . Finally in 1877 , the United States government awarded first @-@ class Gold Lifesaving Medals to the twenty @-@ seven men of the Mersey Docks and New Brighton RNLI lifeboat station who survived the incident , while the families of the three deceased lifeboat men were awarded a sum of $ 200 @.@ 00 in gold in lieu of a medal . The medals were conferred in a public ceremony in Liverpool Town Hall on 27 February 1877 . 
 The citation accompanying the New Brighton medals read as follows : 
 Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith a life @-@ saving medal of the first class which has been awarded to you , under the authority of the provisions of the seventh section of the Act of the Congress of the United States , approved June 20 , 1874 , for the extreme and heroic daring manifested by you in the rescue , under circumstances of peculiar danger and difficulty , of eight persons from the wreck of the American ship " Ellen Southard , " at the mouth of the river Mersey , near Liverpool . 
 In transmitting this offering to you , as to each member of the crew of the Life @-@ Boat of the Royal National Life @-@ Boat Institution stationed at New Brighton , it is proper to remark that it is the first time an opportunity has arisen for bestowing the medal of the life @-@ saving service of this country upon subjects of a foreign nation . It was the fortune of your crew to arrive upon the scene of disaster after the Liverpool life @-@ boat men had effected a deliverance , and been in turn subjected to a dreadful casualty , whereby nine of the persons they had rescued and three of their own number were drowned : and the remaining eight persons from the vessel and the twelve men of the Liverpool crew , clinging to the capsized boat in a fearful sea , owe their lives to you and your comrades . The extreme jeopardy and hardships you encountered upon the occasion of their rescue are deeply appreciated , and , in behalf of the United States , I beg you to accept this testimonial , provided by law in recognition of such deeds of bravery and compassion . In sending it , allow me to add the expression of the sense of the gallantry and the devotion to high human duty which marked the conduct of yourself and of your comrades upon the occasion under notice , and of the assurance that each member of your crew , in his own person , by this deed of valor and mercy , confers fresh and just honor upon the great name of England . 
 I have the honor to be , Sir , your obedient servant ,

 Blas Fajardo Ople ( February 3 , 1927 – December 14 , 2003 ) was a Filipino journalist and politician who held several high @-@ ranking positions in the executive and legislative branches of the Philippine government , including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000 , and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death . Perceived as a leftist @-@ nationalist at the onset of his career in public service , Ople was , in his final years , a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines , and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq . 
 Ople 's most enduring role was his nineteen years as Secretary ( later Minister ) of Labor and Employment during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , when Philippine labor laws were overhauled through the enactment of the Labor Code of the Philippines that he had helped author . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Ople was born in Hagonoy , Bulacan on February 3 , 1927 to Felix Antonio Ople , a craftsman who repaired boats , and his wife <unk> Fajardo . He graduated valedictorian of his grade school class at the Hagonoy Elementary School in 1941 . Upon the invasion of the Philippines by Japan during World War II , he also had been to Hagonoy Institute during his secondary schooling , the teenage Ople joined the guerilla movement and fought under the Del Pilar Regiment and the Buenavista Regiment of the Bulacan Military Area founded by Alejo Santos . 
 In 1948 , he finished his high school studies at the Far Eastern University . He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia ( formerly Quezon College ) in Manila . After graduation , Ople pursued a career in journalism . He became a desk editor at the Daily Mirror and the author of its Jeepney Tales column . Still in his twenties , Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era . Ople also established a public relations consulting firm . 
 He soon became known for his nationalist views . He co @-@ founded the <unk> <unk> ( National Progress Movement ) , an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s . In 1953 , he joined the Magsaysay @-@ for @-@ President Movement , a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay , heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party . After Magsaysay 's election , he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs . 
 = = Secretary of Labor = = 
 In 1965 , Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President Ferdinand E. Marcos . In 1967 , he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment ( in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment ) . He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Philippine Senate , but was re @-@ appointed to his post in 1972 , retaining the position until 1986 . At the time of his appointment , Ople was perceived as a " leftist Nationalist " . His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co @-@ founded , in 1972 , the Philippine @-@ Soviet Friendship Society . 
 As Labor Secretary Ople was instrumental in the framing of the Labor Code of the Philippines , which codified the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the termination of workers without legal cause . Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers . In 1976 , Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers . It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created . Ople obtained recognition from the International Labor Organization during his stint as Labor Minister . In 1975 , he was elected president of the 60th general assembly of the ILO , the first Filipino to hold that post . In 1983 , that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation . He was a close adviser of President Marcos , though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos ' government and was perceived as " not corrupt " . He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the lupus @-@ stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable " to take major initiatives " , and that the President 's illness had placed the Philippines in " a kind of interregnum " . Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery . 
 In 1978 , Ople was elected an Assemblyman of the Interim Batasang Pambansa representing Central Luzon , and reelected in 1984 . During the 1986 presidential elections , Ople served as a political campaign manager of President Marcos , who was running against Corazon Aquino . Shortly before the outbreak of the 1986 People Power Revolution , Marcos dispatched Ople to Washington D.C. to lobby the American government on behalf of the President . Ople was in Washington D.C. upon the outbreak of the revolt , and was advised by U.S. Secretary of State , George P. Shultz , to call on Marcos to resign . Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on This Week with David Brinkley .

 Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of Corazon Aquino , Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post . Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino . Nonetheless in May 1986 , Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution . 
 In the 1987 congressional elections , Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate , under the banner of the nationalist @-@ led Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition . He was defeated in this attempt , and returned to private life , serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy ( <unk> ) , a policy research institute .

 Ople won a re @-@ election for the senate in 1998 , under the Laban ng <unk> <unk> Pilipino . In 1999 , upon the resignation of the terminally @-@ ill Marcelo <unk> , Ople became the President of the Senate . In that capacity , he was a key proponent of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States , which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short @-@ term training exercises . He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon . 
 Later that year , he sat as one of the senator @-@ judges in the impeachment trial of his ally , President Joseph Estrada . He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada . Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001 , leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice @-@ President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo to the presidency . 
 = = Secretary of Foreign Affairs = = 
 In July 2002 , President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo appointed Ople , a member of the political opposition in the Senate , as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in her cabinet . The appointment was with some controversy .

Ople , who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement , was perceived to be more amenable to the plan . In addition , left @-@ wing labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople , citing his Marcos @-@ era role in promoting overseas employment of Filipino workers which , they said , had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad . 
 During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines , though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions . Under his watch , the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided immunity to each other 's citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court . Ople was also a vocal supporter of the Iraq War , and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq . He predicted in November 2003 , " Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new , shining symbol of human freedom . The sacrifices invested in the liberation of Iraq , to which Filipinos made a significant contribution , will be fully vindicated and cherished for all time . " 
 = = Death = = 
 In the months prior to his death , Ople , a longtime chain smoker , had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair . On the night of December 13 , 2003 , Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo . The flight was diverted to Chiang Kai @-@ shek International Airport in Taoyuan County , Taiwan ( now Taoyuan City ) , and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival , but given medical treatment nonetheless . Efforts to revive him were futile , and his death on Sunday , December 14 , 2003 was announced by his family . 
 President Arroyo mourned Ople as " an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy " , while U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell hailed him as " one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history " . More critical of Ople , Teddy Casiño , secretary @-@ general of the leftist coalition <unk> , called him a " political chameleon " who " tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [ was ] most pro @-@ American " . Nonetheless , Casiño acknowledged that Ople was " a consistent , brilliant and very astute politician " . 
 Ople was eulogized in Time Magazine , which recalled his erudition , his skill at political survival , and his trademark " extraordinary baritone " . The eulogy also said that at the height of the People Power Revolution , Ople in Washington , D.C. had reported to Marcos in Manila that the President 's support within the Reagan administration was falling . Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the Soviet government . Ople rebuffed Marcos , and as Time noted , declined " to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell " . 
 Ople is buried at the <unk> ng mga Bayani . In 2004 , President Arroyo named Ople 's daughter , Susan Ople , as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment . 
 = Transport in the Soviet Union = 
 Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) was an important part of the nation 's economy . The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace . Before the Soviet Union 's collapse in 1991 , there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land , water and air . However , because of government policies before , during and after the Era of Stagnation , investments in transport were low . By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget . The Civil aviation industry , represented by Aeroflot , was the largest in the world , but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR 's collapse . The road network remained underdeveloped , and dirt roads were common outside major cities . At the same time , the attendance of the few roads they had were ill equipped to handle this growing problem . By the late @-@ 1980s , after the death of Leonid Brezhnev , his successors tried , without success , to solve these problems . At the same time , the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than the construction of new roads . By the mid @-@ 1970s , only 0 @.@ 8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car . 
 Despite improvements , several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure , lack of investment , corruption and bad decision @-@ making by the central authorities . The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising , but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people . The underdeveloped Soviet road network , in a chain reaction , led to a growing demand for public transport . The nation 's merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world . 
 = = Civil aviation = = 
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation was , according to the Air Code of the USSR , responsible for all air transport enterprises and airlines established by it . Soviet civil air transport was the largest by total destinations and vehicles during most of its post @-@ war existence . In the USSR , Aeroflot had a monopoly on all air transport . This ranged from civil transport and cargo to transporting political prisoners to the gulags , and more . 
 The Soviet Union covered over one sixth of the entire earth 's landmass , and in the early 1920s its government decided to invest in the aviation industry . They concluded that expanding it in the Soviet Union would not only make travel more efficient and faster , it would also help build and develop the mostly farmland , enormously spread out nation that it was . At this time , most travel required taking trains ( or , as was often the case , by off road travel in cars , buses or trucks ) . Many of the northern and eastern territories in the Soviet Union were completely inaccessible during much of the year ; most of these vast expanses of land lacked roads and railroads because of the huge distances between them and the nearest population centers . The practically uninhabitable weather also made travel and construction nearly impossible . The absence of " surface transportation facilities " also meant that very little equipment was available to use for road construction — making the process even more daunting . Consequently , the Soviet government , always eager to save money in the transportation sector , concluded that building a series of airports scattered throughout the more desolate and isolated parts of the country would be far more economically efficient to than to build thousands of miles of roads ( and / or railroads ) for automobile / train travel . Air travel would be the best means of transportation for people and cargo . First , a fleet was necessary ; between 1928 and 1932 , the number of aircraft manufacturing facilities grew from twelve to thirty @-@ one , while the nation 's annual output of airplanes increased from a mere 608 to 2 @,@ 509 . After combing a number existing fleets , the Soviet government founded the national airline and air service of the Soviet Union , renaming the " USSR Civil Air Fleet " Aeroflot . 
 Aeroflot , at its formation in March 1932 , had three main purposes . They were : to operate and maintain an air transportation system , to provide different types of services ( such as aerial surveying , forest @-@ fire fighting , and agricultural spraying ) and to promote educational , recreational , athletic and other such activities for the public . Aeroflot , which literally translates to or air fleet , originally consisted of an amalgam of existing air transportation fleets in the Soviet Union in the 1920s . By creating Aeroflot , the Soviet government was , much like many industries in the young Soviet Union at the time , expanding and centralizing fleets like the " Red Air Fleet . " To the general public , the aviation industry did not represent modernization ; rather , it represented the means to achieve modernization and future glory . 
 During Joseph Stalin 's Second Five @-@ Year Plan ( 1933 @-@ 1938 ) , the Communist Party Congress ( and Stalin himself ) devised the development and further expansion of the aviation industry , soon making air transport one of the primary means of transportation in the Soviet Union . Their strategy involved creating a network of cities and towns to deliver people , whether they were politicians , military officials , prisoners or travelers , and , most importantly , mail and freight . Stalin also recognized that with a strong civil aviation sector he could supply necessary equipment and materials to prisoners in the Gulag , increasing their efficiency and production output . By 1933 , Soviet aviation delegations and engineers , some for as long as six months at a time , were regular visitors at the United States ' most prominent aircraft developers , such as Boeing , Douglas , Pratt & Whitney and Curtiss @-@ Wright ( to name only a few ) . These engineers would play a key role in the origins of Soviet aircraft manufacturer , Ilyushin . For much of the Soviet Union 's existence , air travel served to deliver freight . In the 1930s , freight made up 85 percent of Aeroflot 's services . In fact , at this time , air travel in the Soviet Union existed as less of a means to travel , but rather a way for the government to develop remote areas of the nation for industrialization needs and resource acquisition . The public rarely flew as flights were often very expensive ( 350 rubles — maybe half of a workers ' monthly salary ) and service was poor . 
 Aeroflot , as the single state owned and governed airline , operated without any competitors and expanded according to the Soviet central government and central planning . By the beginning of World War II , Aeroflot , and the entirety of the Soviet civil aviation industry , was primarily a domestic freight carrier . In fact , in 1939 , they surpassed the U.S. in volume of <unk> . Despite Stalin 's strong xenophobia , Aeroflot commenced its first international route in 1936 , operating between Moscow and Prague . After World War II , the Soviet government wanted to continue expansion by starting and increasing services from Moscow to the capitals of other Soviet republics . The ever @-@ growing Soviet air transportation network began to shrink the railroad 's importance in Soviet nations . As years passed , the Soviet regime recognized the aviation industry 's increasing value , and officials in transportation planning attempted to establish regular air service to nearly every city in the union . By 1968 , after Soviet engineers helped pioneer the introduction of jets and the jet age , Aeroflot and its subsidiaries served roughly 3 @,@ 500 cities . At that time , " the thirty largest Soviet cities were connected with all cities with a population of 500 @,@ 000 or more " ( including nearly 80 percent of those with populations from 100 @,@ 000 to 499 @,@ 999 , and 60 percent of the cities with 50 @,@ 000 to 99 @,@ 999 people ) . By joining these cities , infrastructure and industry benefitted heavily . The jet age and the introduction of new , faster and more reliable ways of air travel greatly changed Soviet aviation . Jets not only further shortened travel times ; they allowed nonstop service between cities that had been otherwise out of reach for nonstop flights . Before the jet age , the longest nonstop service from Moscow was Yekaterinburg ( Sverdlovsk ) ( roughly 1 @,@ 100 miles ) ; sometime after the introduction of jets , mail could be delivered from Moscow to Vladivostok ( nearly 4 @,@ 000 miles east ) , the same day . The Soviet Union put the first jet in the world into service in 1956 on a Moscow to Irkutsk route ( of about 2 @,@ 600 miles ) using a Soviet built Tupolev Tu @-@ 104 . The Soviet government established a " <unk> " system unlike the West ; in the Soviet Union , most cities had a direct link with Moscow . In the United States , most small cities were ( and still are today ) connected to larger cities and their airports ; airlines then use these larger airports — or " hubs " — to connect passengers to their flight and onto their destination . Because the Soviet Union essentially revolved around Moscow , this networking technique proved effective . 
 By the early 1980s , Aeroflot had experienced massive growth in the aviation market . They carried 116 @.@ 1 million passengers and millions of pounds of cargo . Still , because of travel restrictions , only 3 @.@ 4 million passengers were international travelers . The airline remained an almost entirely domestic carrier , getting freight and people to far off remote cities , many of which had been built by Stalin @-@ era Gulag prisoners . Aeroflot also remained in charge of other non @-@ delivery or transportation services such as : " ice patrol in the Arctic Ocean and escorting of ships through frozen seas , oil exploration , power line surveillance , and transportation and heavy lifting support on construction projects . " Further , because nearly every single non @-@ military airplane permitted to fly in the Soviet Union was registered as an Aeroflot airframe , Aeroflot suffered from the worst safety reputation in the worldwide industry , recording between four hundred and five hundred incidents since its creation in 1932 . Many blamed Ilyushin and their engineers for the airplanes ' poorer reliability when compared to its Western counterparts — namely Boeing , McDonnell Douglas and Airbus . 
 By the mid @-@ late 1980s , Aeroflot 's domestic flights were noted consistently as " harrowing " experiences for both Western and Soviet passengers . At the airport , passengers complained of long waits , poor and indifferent service at ticket offices , poorly designed and set up waiting areas at airport terminals coupled with inadequate food and toilet facilities . On board , passengers complained of being forced to sit in " hot airplane cabins without air conditioning " , and " indifferent " cabin crews . 
 By the time Mikhail Gorbachev introduced perestroika and its reforms , permitting free speech and pluralism , Aeroflot had shown considerable growth . In 1950 , air transportation only accounted for 1 @.@ 2 percent of the total passenger transportation turnover in the Soviet Union , yet , by 1987 , air travel accounted for 18 @.@ 7 of that . It continues growing today . After the Soviet Union broke up , Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new , free market economy . Foreign airlines were permitted to land in Russia and Aeroflot split into several sectors , including today 's airline that bears the same name . It became a privatized company , and soon other airlines found their way into the Russian spotlight . Transaero Airlines and S7 ( Sibir ) Airlines commenced operations in mid @-@ 1992 . In 1993 , Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes . Transaero only operated three Russian built Tu @-@ 124 airplanes , the rest of their fleet consists of only Boeing types ( 747 , 777 , 767 ) — modernizing and Westernizing Russian aviation . S7 , though originally operating more Soviet @-@ built airplanes , currently fly only Airbus and Boeing types . Aeroflot , too , followed suit . Beginning in 1994 , Aeroflot began taking deliveries of Western Airplanes . Aeroflot uses its Airbus and Boeing fleet primarily on Western routes to encourage Western passenger travel . In 2006 , Aeroflot joined the global airline alliance SkyTeam , and in 2010 , S7 joined a different global alliance , <unk> . The Soviet aviation industry has unequivocally shifted to adapt more modern and Western philosophies of air travel , although it was the inventive Soviet style of air transportation that helped build Russia , its industries and its widespread global influence into what it is today . 
 = = = Airports = = = 
 The Soviet Union had 7 @,@ 192 airports , of which 1 @,@ 163 had paved surface . By the 1980s most airports were having capacity problems , an example being the Lviv airport which had to cope with an average of 840 passengers each day , while the airport was built to handle 200 . Another daunting problem was the lack of modernisation , with the Sheremetyevo International Airport ( Moscow 's main airport ) being the only airport in the USSR to have been fully computerised . 
 = = Pipeline network = = 
 The Soviet Union had , at its height , a pipeline network of 82 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 51 @,@ 000 mi ) for crude oil and another 206 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 128 @,@ 300 mi ) for natural gas . The Soviet authorities , under Leonid Brezhnev , began focusing on the national pipeline system in the 1970s . Soviet pipelines experienced a fast growth in the 1970s ; by the late 1970s the pipeline network was the largest in the world . The average moving distance for oil and natural gas increased from 80 km in 1970 to 1 @,@ 910 km in 1980 , and 2 @,@ 350 in 1988 . Just as with many other sectors of the Soviet economy , bad maintenance led to deterioration . By the late 1980s only 1 @,@ 500 km pipelines were under maintenance , half of what was minimally needed . Also , the storage facilities were inadequate to handle the growing Soviet oil supply . Failures in the pipelines network became , in the 1980s , a common feature of the system . Oil pipeline ruptures at oil fields were increasing up to an all @-@ time high in 1990 and reached a 15 percent failure rate that year alone . 
 Among the better known pipelines were the Northern Lights line from the Komi petroleum deposit to Brest on the Polish border , the <unk> line running from <unk> to <unk> near the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders , and the Export pipeline from the <unk> gas field to L <unk> and thence to First World countries , including Austria , Italy , West Germany , France , Belgium , and the Netherlands . The 1 @,@ 420 @-@ millimeter Export pipeline was 4 @,@ 451 kilometers long . It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers , including the Ob ' , Volga , Don , and Dnepr . It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas . 
 = = Rail network = = 
 The Soviet Union had a non @-@ industrial railway network of 147 @,@ 400 kilometres ( 91 @,@ 600 mi ) , of which 53 @,@ 900 kilometres ( 33 @,@ 500 mi ) were electrified . As the quality of rail transport continued to deteriorate , in part because of the Russian Civil War , some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if <unk> continued to increase . Those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis . The majority agreed on increasing investments , but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used . There were even some who believed in the recapitalisation of the railways . Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated for the rationalisation of the railways , coupled with tariffs based on actual cost , which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment . The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate . In 1931 , in a Central Committee ( CC ) resolution , it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis . This resolution was never carried out , and yet again , the system continued to deteriorate . 
 The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich to solve the railway crisis in 1935 . Kaganovich first prioritised bottleneck areas over other less @-@ traveled areas ; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines , and thirdly , the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves . Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities . The industrialisation proved to be a heavy burden on the railways , and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress . Even so , the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany , which became reality in 1941 . 
 Soviet rail transport became , after the Great Patriotic War , one of the most developed in the world , surpassing most of its First World counterparts . The Soviet railway system was growing in size , at a rate of 639 km a year from 1965 to 1980 , while the growth of rail transport in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating . This steady growth in rail transport can be explained by the country 's need to extract its natural resources , most of which were located close to , or in Siberia . While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press , the Soviet Union could boast of controlling one of the most electrified railway systems at the time . During much of the country 's later lifespan , trains usually carried coal , oil , construction material ( mostly stone , cement and sand ) and timber . Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place . 
 The efficiency of the railways improved over time , and by the 1980s it had many performance indicators superior to that of the United States . By the 1980s Soviet railways had become the most intensively used in the world . Most Soviet citizens did not own private transport , and if they did , it was difficult to drive long distances due to the poor conditions of many roads . Another explanation has to do with Soviet policy , the first being the autarkic model created by Joseph Stalin 's regime . Stalin 's regime had little interest in rail transport , or any other form for transport , and instead focused most of the country 's investments in rapid industrialisation . Stalin 's regime was not interested in establishing new railway lines , but decided to conserve , and later expand , much of the existing railways left behind by the Tsars . However , as Lev Voronin , a First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union , noted in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1989 ; the railway sector was the " main negative sector of the economy in 1989 " . As industrial output declined in the late @-@ 1980s so did the demand for transportation , which led to a decline in freight transport in return . 
 = = = Rail transit = = = 
 The Soviet rapid transit system was seen as the quickest , cleanest and cheapest way of urban transport , and eventually another point acquired greater significance ; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country 's diesel and petrol . Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming , the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide , with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed . Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985 . The country 's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world . 
 = = Road network = = 
 The Soviet Union had a road network of 1 @,@ 757 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 092 @,@ 000 mi ) , of which 1 @,@ 310 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 814 @,@ 400 mi ) were paved and 446 @,@ 400 kilometres ( 277 @,@ 400 mi ) were dirt roads . Road transport played a minor role in the Soviet economy , compared to domestic rail transport or First World road transport . According to historian Martin Crouch , road traffic of goods and passengers combined was only 14 percent of the volume of rail transport . It was only late in its existence that the Soviet authorities put emphasis on road construction and maintenance because of the vital role road transport usually played in the regional economies of the USSR . Road transport was of vital importance to agriculture , mining and the construction industry , but it also played a significant role in the urban economy . The road network had problems meeting the people 's demand , a problem which the Soviet leadership publicly acknowledged . A resolution by the Central Committee laid down a plan for the improvement in planning , organisation and the efficiency of local road transport enterprises . 
 Freight transport by motor vehicles , commonly called " motor transport " by the Soviet authorities , due to the underdeveloped nature of the nation 's road network , was of considerable significance to certain areas of the economy . In the 1980s , there were 13 million laborers employed in the transport sector . Of those , about 8 @.@ 5 million were employed in motor transport . Inter @-@ city freight transport remained underdeveloped during the whole Soviet epoch , with it constituting less than 1 percent of the motor @-@ borne freight average . These developments can again be blamed on cost and administrative inefficiencies . Road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport ; the average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was 16 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 10 @.@ 2 mi ) , while the average for railway transport was 930 km per ton and 435 km per ton for water freight . In 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport , and more than a thirtyfold increase since 1940 . Inter @-@ city transport and the volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly . Motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances ( defined as less than 200 km ) than rail transport . There were many Soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from the railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles . But in 1975 , road transport was 27 @-@ times more expensive than railway transport , due to long distances between starting points and destinations . 
 The deteriorating quality of roads was due to bad attendance , and the then ongoing growth in road transport made it even harder for the Soviet authorities to focus their resources on attendance and maintenance projects . The transport of freight by road had increased by 4 @,@ 400 percent in the past thirty years , while the growth of hardcore surfaced roads had grown only by 300 percent . Growth of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in the 1980s , while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent . As Soviet economists in the early to mid @-@ 1980s said , the Soviet Union had 21 percent of the world 's industrial output , but only a meager 7 percent of the world 's top quality roads . The Eleventh Five @-@ Year Plan ( 1981 – 85 ; spanned through the rules of Leonid Brezhnev , Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko ) called for the construction of an additional 80 @,@ 000 km hardcore surfaced roads , but this was far from adequate in solving the serious shortage , and the planners needed to build at least twice as many roads to meet consumer demand . Another obstacle was that Five @-@ Year Plans in the USSR 's later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions . Many roads were not paved , and because of this shortage , several dirt roads were created . By 1975 only 0 @.@ 8 percent of households owned a car . Productions of cars , however , had increased dramatically in the late 1970s . From 1924 to 1971 the USSR produced 1 million vehicles , and the government passed another milestones five years later when it had produced 2 million vehicles . 
 = = = Bus transport = = = 
 Only a very small proportion of the population in the USSR owned cars . Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport , most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport . Due to a relative shortage of cars and good @-@ quality roads , the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus , train and rapid transit as people in the First World . Soviet bus @-@ transport , throughout most of the history of the Soviet Union , was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport . Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel , Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity @-@ driven , rather than fuel @-@ consuming transport . In the mid @-@ 1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed @-@ gas energy for buses . By 1988 only 1 @.@ 2 percent of buses used gas energy , while 30 percent used diesel . Soviet bus @-@ enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1980s . 
 = = Water transport = = 
 The Soviet Union had 42 @,@ 777 kilometres ( 26 @,@ 580 mi ) of coastline and 1 @,@ 565 ships in the merchant marine . Marine industry was under the control of the Ministry of Merchant Marine of the USSR . 
 = = = Merchant marine = = = 
 The Russian Empire concentrated much of its investment on constructing new shipbuilding facilities , and not enlarging their merchant marine ; this policy continued in the prewar USSR . By 1913 85 percent of all merchant ships were foreign built . The merchant marine was overlooked during the regime of Joseph Stalin , because the USSR traded mostly with its neighbouring countries in the Eastern Bloc . Soviet trade later expanded to its neighbouring countries in Asia . When Stalin died in 1953 , his successor started to increase trade with non @-@ communist countries , most of which were on other continents . Due to this policy , the merchant marine increased from 2 million deadweight tonnage in the early 1950s to 12 million in 1968 . By 1974 it had reached 14 @.@ 1 million deadweight tons , about 3 percent of the world 's total . Of the 114 million tons moved by the Soviet merchant marine in 1974 , 90 million of it was export and import . 
 While the merchant marine was technologically outdated , and slower than that of the First World , it still attracted a consistent volume of cargo . The reason for the technological backwardness of the merchant marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping . This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry , and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers . Under Mikhail Gorbachev 's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world . Because of the size of its navy , the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea . 
 By 1990 Soviet Union operated a large merchant fleet with more than 2400 ships of all types — the world 's second largest in number of ships and seventh largest in carrying capacity . 
 = = = Ports = = = 
 The Soviet Union had 26 major ports , eleven of them inland ports . There were 70 ports in total . None of the ports could be considered major by world standards . By the 1980s the majority of Soviet ports were lagging behind the First World technologically . There were also a high number of surplus workers , many of whom would become redundant if the USSR would introduce new , more advanced , technology . Also , in the northeast territories of the USSR most ports were closed down due to cold climate . 
 = Battle of the Heligoland Bight ( 1939 ) = 
 The Battle of the Heligoland Bight was the first " named " air battle of the Second World War , which began the longest air campaign of the war , the Defence of the Reich . On 3 September 1939 , the United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany after the German invasion of Poland , which started the European War . The British did not assist Poland by land or sea , but over the ensuing weeks , RAF Bomber Command flew several missions against German targets . A number of these air raids were directed at Kriegsmarine ( German Navy ) warships in German ports to prevent their use in the Battle of the Atlantic . With the front lines static between September 1939 and May 1940 , a period known as the " Phoney War " set in , with little fighting on land or in the air . However , at sea , German U @-@ boat ( submarine ) forces were taking a considerable toll on Allied shipping . The Air Ministry decided to launch an attack on German surface ships to prevent them supporting the U @-@ boats in the North Atlantic . On 18 December 1939 , a force of three RAF bomber squadrons were sent to engage German ships in the Heligoland Bight and sink or damage as many as possible . Originally 24 Vickers Wellingtons took off . Two turned back owing to engine trouble before reaching German airspace . The German reaction was slow . Eventually they scrambled strong fighter aircraft forces to intercept . Just over 120 aircraft , 80 – 100 German and 22 British , were involved but only 44 German fighters made contact with the British bombers . 
 The Germans inflicted more damage on the RAF than the Luftwaffe received , but its influence on both sides ' future strategy was profound . The battle forced the RAF to abandon daylight missions in favour of night bombing as casualties were too high . In the build @-@ up to the war , the RAF had adopted the mantra that " the bomber will always get through " ; but in daylight the Heligoland battle had shown this was not the case and it forced a reappraisal of future bombing operations . The failure of the raid led the Luftwaffe to believe its base in Germany proper was invulnerable to enemy attack . This belief was reinforced with the Wehrmacht 's success in 1939 – 41 , which meant that opposing air forces were then too far away for effective bombing attacks on the German homeland . Neglecting their day fighter force had serious strategic consequences in later years . By the time the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( OKL ; Luftwaffe High Command ) had begun organising an air defence to combat the United States Army Air Forces ' ( USAAF ) strategic bombing campaign , they were already engaged in a war of attrition for which they were not prepared . This oversight was one of the contributing factors in the defeat of the Luftwaffe in the Defence of the Reich campaign . The German official history called the battle " amongst the most important actions of the entire war " . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = RAF strategy = = = 
 Before the outbreak of war , RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars without the need for naval and land fighting . It was thought the bomber would always get through . Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort . However , the RAF lacked a four @-@ engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets . The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr . 
 The Netherlands and Belgium wished to remain neutral and refused to allow the RAF to establish bases , to fly deeper into Germany . They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany . After the outbreak of war , the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields . The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line , but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a pre @-@ emptive strike against the Luftwaffe . French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either . A fear of retaliation was the main French reason . The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach . This state of affairs suited the British , in particular , the Admiralty . 
 The most immediate threat to the Allies during the Phoney War period was the U @-@ Boat . Some German submarines had been sent to sea before the British declaration of war and began operations against British shipping , bringing in vital supplies from North America and other areas of the British Empire , as soon as war was declared . In one notable action , German submarine U @-@ 47 sank the battleship HMS Royal Oak at Scapa Flow in October 1939 , with the loss of 786 crew . As a consequence the Admiralty pressed for the RAF 's efforts to concentrate on RAF Coastal Command rather than a strategic striking force . This was heavily debated within the British establishment well into 1941 . In keeping with a request from the United States of America to avoid the bombing of civilian targets , the British formulated the Western Air Plan 7B ( WAP 7B ) , which planned for attacks on German warships . The Germans also complied with the American request , albeit only after the 18 September 1939 , when victory in Poland was assured . German ships were legitimate targets , and at sea or in port , were far enough away from civilian areas to avoid unnecessary casualties . The Plan revolved around their elimination to prevent their possible use as supplements to the U @-@ Boat fleet . 
 = = = Prior operations = = = 
 To fit in with this strategy , the RAF 's initial plans involved launching raids against German shipping on receipt of the results of aerial reconnaissance . This was attempted on 3 September , when a Bristol Blenheim ( flown by Flying Officer Andrew McPherson of No. 139 Squadron RAF ) — on a reconnaissance flight over the North Sea — spotted a large naval force in the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven . The Blenheim 's radio failed , however , so an attack could not be launched until McPherson returned to base , when 15 Handley Page Hampdens and nine Vickers Wellington bombers were launched against the German ships . The weather was poor , however , and the bombers failed to find any targets . 
 A similar attempt was made on 4 September , when McPherson again spotted warships off Brunsbüttel , Wilhelmshaven and in the Schillig Roads . The Blenheim 's radio failed again and no attack could be launched , until after McPherson 's return . A force of 10 Blenheims from No. 110 Squadron RAF and No. 107 Squadron RAF along with five more from 139 Squadron and eight Wellingtons of No. 149 Squadron RAF took off to locate the German warships Gneisenau , Scharnhorst and Admiral Scheer , which some did manage to locate . No. 149 Squadron was not prepared for war . At least one of the crews — Flying Officer ( F / O ) Bill McRae — nearly took off without a bomb load . Looking in , he noticed the bomb bay empty . On the way to the target , Squadron Leader Paul Harris ordered his gunners to test their weapons . They all failed and he was heading into German territory defenceless . Not wanting to turn back on his first raid , he pressed ahead . No. 9 Squadron RAF also bombed the same targets later in the day , attacking targets in and around Brunsbüttel . Results were poor , however , with five Blenheims and two Wellingtons being lost and only minimal damage caused to the German warships . Admiral Scheer was hit by three bombs that failed to explode , while the light cruiser Emden — while not one of the priority targets — was present , and also damaged by a Blenheim that crashed into the forecastle of the ship . The crash killed 11 sailors and injured 30 . 
 The II . / Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 ; II Group Fighter Wing 77 ) — under the command of Oberstleutnant Carl @-@ August Schumacher — took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted No. 9 Squadron . <unk> Hans <unk> and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another . These aircraft from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to have been shot down by enemy fighters during the war and <unk> was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down . Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft artillery fire . The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack . Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach . 
 It was felt that too long had elapsed in both cases between the German warships being spotted and the arrival of the strike force , and to rectify matters , it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force , with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships . Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port , infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships . A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s , of II . / JG 77 , but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of No. 149 , No. 38 Squadron RAF and No. 115 Squadron RAF on 3 December was more successful , claiming a German minesweeper sunk ( confirmed by German archives ) , while defensive fire from the Wellington gun turrets repelled attacks by German fighters , shooting one down without loss to the bombers . The German pilot shot down was future German ace Günther Specht . He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF . The German ships were the Brummer and the minesweeper <unk> both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship . A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed from out of the sun and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas . 
 An armed reconnaissance by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation , at very low level because of the low cloud base , was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti @-@ aircraft artillery . The RAF believed that none of the lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters , however , and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations . This summation was odd considering the evidence available . The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory . Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds , making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect .

 The Luftwaffe 's air defence organisation went through a number of changes in the first months of the war . The defence of the northern German ports and vital strategic targets was given to the local or nearest <unk> ( Air Defence Command ) . In this case the unit responsible for the protection of German warships of the Kriegsmarine was the <unk> Hamburg ( Air Defence Command Hamburg ) . 
 The system was impractical . The Hamburg air defence district controlled both air and ground defences , but each was geographically in no position to help the other . There was no combined arms synthesis , meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence . Instead , fighter units protecting the coast were held there , with Kriegsmarine FlaK units , while the Hamburg air defence artillery was held too far inland . The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too far apart to coordinate . 
 The defence coordination was not helped by the poor relations between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Commanders @-@ in @-@ Chief , Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Großadmiral ( Grand Admiral ) Erich Raeder . The system required both services to work together , but it produced co @-@ operation difficulties . A solution to the problem was twofold . Fighter units defending the North Sea coast were subordinated to Luftgaukommando XI ( Air District Command 9 ) in Hannover . These fighter units would function as an autonomous fighter command , or Jagdfliegerführer ( Fighter Flyer Leaders ) . The command of Fighter Command unit was given to Carl @-@ August Schumacher , an Oberstleutnant and former commander of II . / Jagdgeschwader 77 . Schumacher had served in the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial German Navy ) during the First World War and as an officer cadet had seen combat at the Battle of Jutland . It was hoped with his naval background and easy personality it would ease any difficulties with naval service cooperation . Nevertheless , Schumacher and his counterpart in the Navy were of the same rank , so each lacked authority over the other , an arrangement that lacked the needed unity of command .

 = = = Luftwaffe = = = 
 Schumacher was given a new command which was designated Stab . / Jagdgeschwader 1 ( Command . / Fighter Wing 1 , or JG 1 ) , sometimes referred to as JG Nord ( Fighter Wing North ) or JG Schumacher . In addition to the Bf <unk> and E variants , the force was also equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 . The lack of action during the Phoney War period meant that these aircraft , usually in demand by offensive air fleets ( Luftflotte ) , were available for defensive roles . 
 Stab . / JG 1 controlled all the following Gruppen ( groups ) which had a combined strength of 80 – 100 aircraft : 
 II . / Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 ) commanded by Hilmer von Bülow @-@ Bothkamp 
 II . / <unk> 186 ( Carrier Air Group 186 ; <unk> 186 ) which was officially attached to Zerstörergeschwader 1 ( Destroyer Wing 1 ; ZG 1 ) but placed under Stab . / JG 1 for defensive duties under Major Heinrich <unk> 
 10 . ( Nacht ) . / Jagdgeschwader 26 ( JG 26 ) under Staffelkapitän ( Squadron Leader ) Johannes Steinhoff 
 I. / Zerstörergeschwader 76 ( ZG 76 ) under the command of Hauptmann Günther Reinecke , and 2 Staffel 
 I. / Zerstörergeschwader 26 ( ZG 26 ) under the command of Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) Wolfgang Falck . 
 JGr . 101 was attached to ZG 1 and eventually became II . / ZG 1 . It was commanded by Major Hellmuth Reichardt .

 The RAF committed No. 3 Group RAF to the attack . Usually the group consisted of No. 9 Squadron RAF , No. 37 Squadron RAF , No. 38 Squadron RAF , No. 99 Squadron RAF , No. 115 Squadron RAF , No. 149 Squadron RAF together with No. 214 Squadron RAF and No. 21 Squadron RAF in reserve . However , the Group was hastily set up for daylight missions , having been intended for night bombing attacks . The quality of the training was dubious , many of the crews had not been given proper tuition for formation flying . Only 9 and 214 squadrons were able to fly in perfect formations . In an effort to improve formation flying and give crews experience of combat conditions , No. 3 Group 's No. 37 Squadron practised mock combats with RAF Fighter Command Supermarine Spitfires from RAF Tangmere . Warnings were given by the Spitfire pilots that they could have decimated the squadron within ten minutes because of their poor formation flying and lack of fighter escort , but were ignored . 
 Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett were the only experienced combat leaders . However , Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and had never had a chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons . He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets , whether as a group , squadron , or even as flight sections . Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack . He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced . For the 18 December mission , 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9 , 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to <unk> . The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation .

 On the morning of 18 December 1939 , The Times of London published the story of the Battle of the River Plate and the demise of Admiral Graf Spee , and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship . In accordance with Operational Order B. 60 , dated 17 December , the targets were German warships either in port or at sea . The RAF bombers were ordered to overfly the Heligoland Bight and the port of Wilhelmshaven , attacking ships but avoiding civilian living quarters , merchant shipping or land itself . 
 = = = Bombers on route = = = 
 The first Wellington <unk> took off from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09 : 27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls . No. 9 Squadron took off from the nearby RAF <unk> and formed up over King 's Lynn and started out over the North Sea . Feltwell 's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the rendezvous and caught up with the main formation an hour later over the North Sea . Once over the Wash they set a course of 040 ° true , as far as latitude 55 ° north . The plan was to avoid heavy anti @-@ aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands . However , as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky . Two bombers , <unk> and <unk> , piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back ; the first due to engine trouble , the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base . The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south , continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft . 
 Reaching the German — Danish border at 55 ° N 05 ° E , they turned south . The formation headed towards Schleswig @-@ Holstein and then planned to turn due west to Wilhelmshaven . The move was designed to initiate the attack from the east , through the " back door " . The plan worked , as the bombers arrived without being intercepted , but the southward journey had given the Germans a one @-@ hour warning , as the Freya radar had picked up the bombers 30 mi ( 48 km ) off the coast . As the bombers passed down the coast , anti @-@ aircraft artillery fire from ships and harbour defences was noted . Once in the target area they also came under heavy anti @-@ aircraft artillery fire from Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven . Ships near Schillig Roads also opened fire . The bombers replied with their machine guns to throw the gunners off . German fire was at the correct height but exploded behind the bombers . Soon after , the formation was over Wilhelmshaven harbour , with Gneisenau and Scharnhorst at anchor beneath them . However , the ships were too close to shore and Kellett chose not to risk dropping bombs to avoid civilian casualties . Kellett — commanding the formation — had been ordered to attack at minimum altitude ( about 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) ) . The belief that the greatest danger would come from anti @-@ aircraft fire , not German fighters , had by then become part of RAF operational doctrine . 
 Poor Luftwaffe administration meant the German defence took time to get the information from their radar sites . Major Harry von Bülow @-@ Bothkamp — commanding II . / JG 77 — stated that it was the naval Freya , rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave the alert . Owing to this , the RAF made landfall without interception . The first air @-@ to @-@ air shots were not traded until one hour after the Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report . 
 As Wing Commander Kellett was taking off , Schumacher was dismissing any idea that the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather . On the island of Wangerooge , Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3 , battery LN @-@ Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer . Diehl was using Falck 's 2 . / ZG 76 to test the set . After some demonstration , he swung the set north , pointing to the <unk> Bight . As soon as he did so he picked up an echo . He telephoned Schumacher 's <unk> at Jever . They were told that the naval radar reported nothing , and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies . Diehl spoke to von Bülow @-@ Bothkamp . No one wanted to know . Some 20 minutes later , naval <unk> also picked up the formation , but still no fighters were scrambled . German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart . The problem lay in communication . The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system . The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped , creating confusion over who was responsible . Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter . Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled . The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft , twice its actual strength . 
 = = = Aerial engagement = = = 
 At 13 : 10 , the RAF formation flew over the mud flats to the west of Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions , 214 , 244 and 264 . As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti @-@ aircraft units 212 , 222 , 252 , 262 and 272 opened fire . Scharnhorst , Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support . In the distance , at Schillig Point , the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip . In a quick briefing , JG 1 's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington . A stern attack was dangerous , as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire . One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self @-@ sealing fuel tanks . This meant if the German fighters hit the wings , the bomber was liable to burn . 
 <unk> by the Luftwaffe , Squadron Leader , No. 149 Squadron Harris 's section was the only section to drop bombs on the ships in Wilhelmshaven harbour . Six 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bombs fell and the results were unknown . It was all the RAF had to show for its first major raid on a German target . As the bombers emerged from the anti @-@ aircraft barrage , the RAF formation was disorganised . Kellett 's and Harris 's formations were intact , but Squadron Leader Guthrie was ahead of his No. 9 Squadron and No. 37 Squadron at the rear was straggling . Its commander , Squadron Leader Hue @-@ Williams , was struggling to catch up with the main formation and was forging ahead of his formation without keeping it together . Other members of Hue @-@ Williams 's squadron increased their speed to keep up with their leader . 
 Oberleutnant Johannes Steinhoff flying with Bf <unk> of 10 . ( Nacht ) . / JG 26 took off escorted by a Rotte from II . / JG 77 . At 13 : 30 , they attacked one group after the anti @-@ aircraft fire lifted . The Bf 109s claimed seven bombers , with Steinhoff claiming two . The first kill was credited to Unteroffizier <unk> . At 13 : 40 , a Rotte of Bf 110s from ZG 26 , led by Hauptmann Wolfgang Falck , claimed four bombers . Falck 's aircraft was severely damaged , forcing him to disengage . Falck managed to glide back to base and make a " dead @-@ stick " landing without power . Unteroffizier Fresia also made two claims . Fresia 's second victim was Flying Officer Allison . No. 149 Squadron Leader Harris came under attack from a Bf 109 piloted by Oberleutnant Johann Fuhrmann . Fuhrmann failed to hit the bomber in beam attacks . He then tried a stern attack , against earlier advice , only to get shot down . Fuhrmann managed to land in the sea a few hundred yards from the island of <unk> . Witnesses on the beach saw him attempt to swim to shore only for Fuhrmann to drown . It is likely he was shot down by Aircraftman Second Class <unk> from Riddlesworth 's Wellington . During the battle a Bf 110 piloted by Oberleutnant Gordon Gollob shot down and killed Squadron Leader Archibald Guthrie , of No. 9 Squadron . Hue @-@ Williams , Squadron Leader of No. 37 Squadron was also shot down , possibly by Hauptmann Reinecke . Soon afterward , the Germans suffered a casualty when Leutnant Roman Stiegler crashed into the sea in pursuit of Flying Officer Lemon . Stiegler was killed . At the same time , Jagdgruppe 101 claimed two more bombers . Bf 110s from ZG 76 had also attacked the bombers claiming five more . 
 Among the German claimants was Helmut Lent who was credited with two victories . After landing at Jever from a patrol , Lent took off to intercept . He engaged Herbie Ruse 's Wellington , killing most of the crew . The Wellington was pouring black smoke , and Lent broke off believing it about to crash . Lent then pursued Officer Thompson 's Wellington , which crashed just off the coast of Borkum . Lent 's third claim was not granted : he attacked and downed Flying Officer Wimberley 's aircraft , but because the aircraft was already badly damaged and judged to be about to crash , Lent was refused the victory . Instead , Stab . / JG 1 's Geschwaderkommodore Schumacher was given the credit . Schumacher also shot down Pilot Officer Lewis 's aircraft , close to Borkum . At 13 : 45 , the German fighters — at the limit of their endurance — returned to base . By 14 : 05 , the other bomber formation was beyond interception range and the last shots were fired . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Overclaiming by both sides = = = 
 The German fighter units heavily <unk> RAF losses , with German pilots claiming 38 aircraft shot down , but actual RAF losses were 12 aircraft . RAF gunners claimed 12 German fighters , as well as another 12 severely damaged . Actual German losses were three destroyed plus four severely damaged . 
 To back up their claims , the Luftwaffe insisted that 44 bombers were in the air , which was later increased by the OKL to 52 . Some hours later these claims were reduced to 34 , but months later the report was analysed and reduced to 27 " confirmed " victories . This was still over twice the number that was actually shot down and five more than the true number of the formation . German historians have claimed that official British figures were lessened to hide losses , but careful examination of the records reveals no deception . Obituaries from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission record the identity of all service personnel who died during the war and have no known grave ; as would be the case for airmen downed over the sea . No other airmen were reported missing that day other than those from No. 9 , 37 and 149 Squadron . 
 German casualties amounted to three Bf 109s destroyed , two severely damaged , and two Bf 110s severely damaged . Seven Bf 110s and one Bf 109 suffered light damage . Johann Fuhrmann and Roman Stiegler were the only pilots to die in this action . A third — Dietrich <unk> from Jagdgruppe 101 — wrote @-@ off a Bf 109 but was uninjured . Two pilots were wounded : Feldwebel Hans <unk> ( Bf 109 ) and Leutnant Gustav <unk> ( Bf 110 ) . 
 = = = British assessment = = = 
 The tactical assessment of both sides was radically different . Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure as a result of poor formation flying and leadership . It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self @-@ sealing fuel tanks were needed . These tactical considerations might , they believed , still salvage the day @-@ bomber concept . On 22 December , an unsigned No. 3 Group RAF report stated : 
 There is every reason to believe that a very close formation of six Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft . A loose formation is however liable to suffer very heavy casualties under the same conditions . 
 On 19 December 1939 , Air Vice @-@ Marshal Jackie Baldwin reported that Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue @-@ Williams were to blame for racing ahead of their formations and breaking up a cohesive defence pattern . Baldwin sent his report to RAF Bomber Command 's Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Edgar Ludlow @-@ Hewitt . Hewitt replied on 23 December and joined Baldwin in condemning the leaders of No. 9 and 37 Squadrons for abandoning their flight . Hewitt called this action an " unforgivable crime " , although Leader of No. 149 Squadron , Harris , later stated that this was unfair , as Guthrie and Hue @-@ Williams were untrained and had never faced the enemy before . Harris also blamed No. 3 Group Headquarters , stating that there had been no prior planning or liaison between the squadrons . Harris also noted the Group Operations Staff had not provided any formation lessons . 
 In the Operations notes , Formation Flying , orders specifically stated that the formation , as a whole , was not to stay together , saying each six aircraft section was to be a self @-@ contained defensive unit , flying at different heights , stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader . Even so , the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one 's own section . If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader ( Wing Commander <unk> ) to the detriment of their section , the formation would break apart . Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection ; if the formation came apart , each bomber would have to fend for itself , which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one . Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue @-@ Williams did not heed this advice during the battle . Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes , and he lost only one aircraft . Harris had also kept his formation together , and lost none of his Wellingtons . Within a few weeks , a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness , with Hewitt favouring this alternative . 
 = = = German assessment = = = 
 Tactically , the Germans noted lessons and weaknesses they were already aware of , particularly the poor beam defences of Wellington bombers , but admitted that the bombers ' rigid formation flying had worked in their favour , allowing them to choose the position and angle of attack . The German report also regarded the attempt by the RAF to attack in clear conditions at altitudes of 10 @,@ 000 – 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 900 m ) as " criminal folly " . The post @-@ battle analysis of anti @-@ aircraft fire was also noted . Schumacher stated that it proved effective at breaking up formations and damaging bombers which provided better opportunities for the fighter pilots . 
 After the recent Polish Campaign , the German Army staff analysis had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle . The Army 's General Staff had assessed the problems of leadership , tactics , command and control to improve effectiveness . It appears that Schumacher 's fighter units did not do the same and were too busy congratulating themselves on their success . There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army 's approach in Poland , following their own victory at Heligoland Bight . The historian for the Luftwaffe 's General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda , despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender . 
 The progress of the war from September 1939 to the summer of 1941 , with a few exceptions , seemed to validate the Luftwaffe 's pre @-@ war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm . The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands , Belgium , France , Yugoslavia , and Greece had vindicated this method . The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany 's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies . The occupation of its opponent 's territory denied Germany 's enemies the bases to effectively strike at German targets by air . German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time . This run of events , and the knowledge that the RAF was only capable of short penetrations over France in daylight , led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack . To maintain the offensive on the front line , bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority . 
 However , in late 1941 the United States entered the war after Adolf Hitler 's declaration of war on 11 December 1941 . The failure of Operation Barbarossa by that time had meant the Luftwaffe 's method of concentrating all its resources on the front line was coming unstuck . The RAF began its campaign of night bombing in early 1942 and later that same year United States Army Air Force ( USAAF ) would enter the air war in force . Even so , the OKL continued to resist sending its forces to defend Germany and weakening the front lines . It was only in May 1942 — when the Luftwaffe faced the USAAF for the first time in daylight engagements — that the danger of Allied strategic bombing by day gave the OKL cause for concern . Nevertheless , even by the end of 1942 the measures taken to strengthen daylight anti @-@ aircraft defences remained piecemeal and counter productive . Hans Jeschonnek summed up the attitude of the OKL when he stated that the Luftwaffe could deal with the Western Allies ' daylight raids with " one " fighter wing . The events of 1943 — 1944 would prove this assumption wrong . Adolf Galland — General der Jagdflieger ( General of the Fighter Force ) , 1941 — 1945 — gave lack of organisation and of planning for air defence as one of the greatest mistakes made by the Luftwaffe during the war . 
 = Roman Empire = 
 The Roman Empire ( Latin : Imperium <unk> ; Classical Latin : [ <unk> <unk> ] Koine and Medieval Greek : Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr . Basileia tōn Rhōmaiōn ) was the post @-@ Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization , characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , Africa and Asia . The city of Rome was the largest city in the world c . 100 BC – c . 400 AD , with Constantinople ( New Rome ) becoming the largest around 500 AD , and the Empire 's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20 % of the world 's population at the time ) . The 500 @-@ year @-@ old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict , during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and executions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt . Octavian 's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic . 
 The imperial successor to the republic lasted approximately 1400 years . The first two centuries of the empire 's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana , or " Roman Peace " . Following Octavian 's victory , the size of the empire was dramatically increased . After the assassination of Caligula in 41 , the senate briefly considered restoring the republic , but the Praetorian Guard proclaimed Claudius emperor instead . Under Claudius , the empire invaded Britannia , its first major expansion since Augustus . After Claudius ' successor , Nero , committed suicide in 68 , the empire suffered a period of brief civil wars , as well as a concurrent major rebellion in Judea , during which four different legionary generals were proclaimed emperor . Vespasian emerged triumphant in 69 , establishing the Flavian dynasty , before being succeeded by his son Titus , who opened the Colosseum shortly after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius . His short reign was followed by the long reign of his brother Domitian , who was eventually assassinated . The senate then appointed the first of the Five Good Emperors . The empire reached its greatest extent under Trajan , the second in this line . 
 A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of Commodus . Commodus ' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors , of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious . The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty @-@ year period . It was not until the reign of Diocletian that the empire was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy , which saw four emperors rule the empire at once . This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful , leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine I , who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of the empire . Constantine subsequently shifted the capital to Byzantium , which was renamed " Constantinople " in his honour . It remained the capital of the east until its demise . Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of the empire . This eastern part of the empire ( known later as the " Byzantine Empire " ) remained one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch @-@ rival the Sassanid Empire , which had inherited a centuries @-@ old Roman @-@ Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians . Following the death of Theodosius I , the last emperor to rule a united Roman Empire , the dominion of the empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power , civil wars , barbarian migrations and invasions , military reforms and economic depression . The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire 's decay , while the deposition of the emperor , Romulus Augustulus , in 476 by Odoacer , is generally accepted to mark the end of the empire in the west . However , Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague , and separate rule in the Western part of the empire only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos , in 480 . The Eastern Roman Empire endured for another millennium , eventually falling to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . 
 The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic , cultural , political and military forces in the world of its time . It was the largest empire of the ancient history era , and one of the largest empires in world history . At its height under Trajan , it covered 5 million square kilometers , a territory composed of 48 nations in the 21st century . It held sway over an estimated 70 million people , at that time 21 % of the world 's entire population . The longevity and vast extent of the empire ensured the lasting influence of Latin and Greek language , culture , religion , inventions , architecture , philosophy , law and forms of government on the empire 's descendants . Throughout the European medieval period , attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire , including the Empire of Romania , a Crusader state , and the Holy Roman Empire . By means of European colonialism following the Renaissance , and their descendant states , Greco @-@ Roman culture was exported on a worldwide scale , playing a crucial role in the development of the modern world . 
 = = History = = 
 Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the republic in the 6th century BC , though it did not expand outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC . Then , it was an " empire " long before it had an emperor . The Roman Republic was not a nation @-@ state in the modern sense , but a network of towns left to rule themselves ( though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate ) and provinces administered by military commanders . It was ruled , not by emperors , but by annually elected magistrates ( Roman Consuls above all ) in conjunction with the senate . For various reasons , the 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval , which ultimately led to rule by emperors . The consuls ' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium , which literally means " command " ( though typically in a military sense ) . Occasionally , successful consuls were given the honorary title imperator ( commander ) , and this is the origin of the word emperor ( and empire ) since this title ( among others ) was always bestowed to the early emperors upon their accession . 
 Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts , conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC onwards , while greatly extending its power beyond Italy . This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this period , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( " first citizen " ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name " Augustus " ( " the venerated " ) . Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place , Augustus came to predominate it . Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome . Since his rule ended a century of civil wars , and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity , he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure . During the years of his rule , a new constitutional order emerged ( in part organically and in part by design ) , so that , upon his death , this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor . The 200 years that began with Augustus 's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ( " Roman Peace " ) . During this period , the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced . Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent , but put down " mercilessly and swiftly " when they occurred . The sixty years of Jewish – Roman wars in the second half of the 1st century and the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence . 
 The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs . The Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors — Tiberius , Caligula , Claudius and Nero — before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife @-@ torn Year of Four Emperors , from which Vespasian emerged as victor . Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty , to be followed by the Nerva – Antonine dynasty which produced the " Five Good Emperors " : Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian , Antoninus Pius and the philosophically @-@ inclined Marcus Aurelius . In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent " from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron " — a famous comment which has led some historians , notably Edward Gibbon , to take Commodus ' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire . 
 In 212 , during the reign of Caracalla , Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire . But despite this gesture of universality , the Severan dynasty was tumultuous — an emperor 's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution — and , following its collapse , the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century , a period of invasions , civil strife , economic disorder , and plague . In defining historical epochs , this crisis is sometimes viewed as marking the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity . Aurelian ( reigned 270 – 275 ) brought the empire back from the brink and stabilized it . Diocletian completed the work of fully restoring the empire , but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine , " master " or " lord " . This marked the end of the Principate , and the beginning of the Dominate . Diocletian 's reign also brought the empire 's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity , the " Great Persecution " . The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453 . 
 Diocletian divided the empire into four regions , each ruled by a separate emperor , the Tetrarchy . Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome , he abdicated along with his co @-@ emperor , and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed . Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great , who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity , and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire . During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties , the empire was divided along an east – west axis , with dual power centers in Constantinople and Rome . The reign of Julian , who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion , only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors . Theodosius I , the last emperor to rule over both East and West , died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire . 
 The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed the capacity of the Empire to assimilate the migrants and fight off the invaders . The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders , most famously Attila , though the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself . Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 , when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer . By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor , rather than naming himself Emperor ( as other Germanic chiefs had done after deposing past emperors ) , Odoacer ended the Western Empire by ending the line of Western emperors . 
 The empire in the East — often known as the Byzantine Empire , but referred to in its time as the Roman Empire or by various other names — had a different fate . It survived for almost a millennium after the fall of its Western counterpart and became the most stable Christian realm during the Middle Ages . During the 6th century , Justinian I reconquered Northern Africa and Italy . But within a few years of Justinian 's death , Byzantine possessions in Italy were greatly reduced by the Lombards who settled in the peninsula . In the east , partially resulting from the destructive Plague of Justinian , the Romans were threatened by the rise of Islam , whose followers rapidly conquered the territories of Syria , Armenia and Egypt during the Byzantine @-@ Arab Wars , and soon presented a direct threat to Constantinople . In the following century , the Arabs also captured southern Italy and Sicily . Slavic populations were also able to penetrate deep into the Balkans . 
 The Romans , however , managed to stop further Islamic expansion into their lands during the 8th century and , beginning in the 9th century , reclaimed parts of the conquered lands . In 1000 AD , the Eastern Empire was at its height : Basil II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia , culture and trade flourished . However , soon after the expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert . The aftermath of this important battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline . Two decades of internal strife and Turkic invasions ultimately paved the way for Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to send a call for help to the Western European kingdoms in 1095 . 
 The West responded with the Crusades , eventually resulting in the Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade . The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented what remained of the Empire into successor states , the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea . After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces , the Empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast . The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453 . 
 = = Geography and demography = = 
 The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history , with contiguous territories throughout Europe , North Africa , and the Middle East . The Latin phrase imperium sine fine ( " empire without end " ) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire . In Vergil 's epic poem the Aeneid , limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity Jupiter . This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century . 
 In reality , Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic , though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD , when Roman control in Europe , Africa and Asia was strengthened . During the reign of Augustus , a " global map of the known world " was displayed for the first time in public at Rome , coinciding with the composition of the most comprehensive work on political geography that survives from antiquity , the Geography of the Pontic Greek writer Strabo . When Augustus died , the commemorative account of his achievements ( Res Gestae ) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of peoples and places within the Empire . Geography , the census , and the meticulous keeping of written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration . 
 The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan ( reigned 98 – 117 ) , encompassing an area of 5 million square kilometers that as of 2009 was divided among forty different modern countries . The traditional population estimate of 55 – 60 million inhabitants accounted for between one @-@ sixth and one @-@ fourth of the world 's total population and made it the largest population of any unified political entity in the West until the mid @-@ 19th century . Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak ranging from 70 million to more than 100 million . Each of the three largest cities in the Empire — Rome , Alexandria , and Antioch — was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century . 
 As the historian Christopher Kelly has described it : 
 Then the empire stretched from Hadrian 's Wall in drizzle @-@ soaked northern England to the sun @-@ baked banks of the Euphrates in Syria ; from the great Rhine – Danube river system , which snaked across the fertile , flat lands of Europe from the Low Countries to the Black Sea , to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the Nile Valley in Egypt . The empire completely circled the Mediterranean ... referred to by its conquerors as mare nostrum — ' our sea ' . 
 Trajan 's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire . Borders ( fines ) were marked , and the frontiers ( limites ) patrolled . The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable . Hadrian 's Wall , which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever @-@ present barbarian threat , is the primary surviving monument of this effort . 
 = = Languages = = 
 The language of the Romans was Latin , which Virgil emphasizes as a source of Roman unity and tradition . Until the time of Alexander Severus ( reigned 222 – 235 ) , the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin . Latin was the language of the law courts in the West and of the military throughout the Empire , but was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule . This policy contrasts with that of Alexander the Great , who aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language . As a consequence of Alexander 's conquests , koine Greek had become the shared language around the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor . The " linguistic frontier " dividing the Latin West and the Greek East passed through the Balkan peninsula . 
 Romans who received an elite education studied Greek as a literary language , and most men of the governing classes could speak Greek . The Julio @-@ Claudian emperors encouraged high standards of correct Latin ( <unk> ) , a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as Classical Latin , and favoured Latin for conducting official business . Claudius tried to limit the use of Greek , and on occasion revoked the citizenship of those who lacked Latin , but even in the Senate he drew on his own bilingualism in communicating with Greek @-@ speaking ambassadors . Suetonius quotes him as referring to " our two languages " . 
 In the Eastern empire , laws and official documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin . The everyday interpenetration of the two languages is indicated by bilingual inscriptions , which sometimes even switch back and forth between Greek and Latin . After all freeborn inhabitants of the empire were universally enfranchised in 212 AD , a great number of Roman citizens would have lacked Latin , though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge , and Latin remained a marker of " Romanness . " 
 Among other reforms , the emperor Diocletian ( reigned 284 – 305 ) sought to renew the authority of Latin , and the Greek expression <unk> <unk> <unk> attests to the continuing status of Latin as " the language of power . " In the early 6th century , the emperor Justinian engaged in a quixotic effort to reassert the status of Latin as the language of law , even though in his time Latin no longer held any currency as a living language in the East . 
 = = = Local languages and linguistic legacy = = = 
 References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages other than Greek and Latin , particularly in Egypt , where Coptic predominated , and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube . Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic , Gaulish , and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths . In the province of Africa , <unk> @-@ Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions and for legends on coins during the time of Tiberius ( 1st century AD ) . <unk> @-@ Berber and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century , some bilingual with Latin . In Syria , Palmyrene soldiers even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions , in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military . 
 The <unk> Archive is a suggestive example of <unk> in the Empire . These papyri , named for a Jewish woman in the province of Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD , mostly employ Aramaic , the local language , written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences ; a petition to the Roman governor , however , was written in Greek . 
 The dominance of Latin among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages , since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral . In the West , Latin , referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin , gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages that were related to it by a shared Indo @-@ European origin . <unk> in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin . 
 After the decentralization of political power in late antiquity , Latin developed locally into branches that became the Romance languages , such as Spanish , Portuguese , French , Italian and Romanian , and a large number of minor languages and dialects . Today , more than 900 million people are native speakers worldwide . 
 As an international language of learning and literature , Latin itself continued as an active medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century , and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present . 
 Although Greek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire , linguistic distribution in the East was more complex . A Greek @-@ speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands , western Anatolia , major cities , and some coastal areas . Like Greek and Latin , the Thracian language was of Indo @-@ European origin , as were several now @-@ extinct languages in Anatolia attested by Imperial @-@ era inscriptions . Albanian is often seen as the descendant of Illyrian , although this hypothesis has been challenged by some linguists , who maintain that it derives from Dacian or Thracian . ( Illyrian , Dacian , and Thracian , however , may have formed a subgroup or a <unk> ; see Thraco @-@ Illyrian . ) Various Afroasiatic languages — primarily Coptic in Egypt , and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia — were never replaced by Greek . The international use of Greek , however , was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity , as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the Epistles of Paul . 
 = = Society = = 
 The Roman Empire was remarkably multicultural , with " a rather astonishing cohesive capacity " to create a sense of shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples within its political system over a long span of time . The Roman attention to creating public monuments and communal spaces open to all — such as forums , amphitheaters , racetracks and baths — helped foster a sense of " Romanness " . 
 Roman society had multiple , overlapping social hierarchies that modern concepts of " class " in English may not represent accurately . The two decades of civil war from which Augustus rose to sole power left traditional society in Rome in a state of confusion and upheaval , but did not effect an immediate redistribution of wealth and social power . From the perspective of the lower classes , a peak was merely added to the social pyramid . Personal relationships — patronage , friendship ( amicitia ) , family , marriage — continued to influence the workings of politics and government , as they had in the Republic . By the time of Nero , however , it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen , or an equestrian who exercised greater power than a senator . 
 The blurring or diffusion of the Republic 's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire , both upward and downward , to an extent that exceeded that of all other well @-@ documented ancient societies . Women , freedmen , and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them . Social life in the Empire , particularly for those whose personal resources were limited , was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities ( collegia and <unk> ) formed for various purposes : professional and trade guilds , veterans ' groups , religious <unk> , drinking and dining clubs , performing arts troupes , and burial societies . 
 Infanticide has been recorded in the Roman Empire and may have been widespread . 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 According to the jurist Gaius , the essential distinction in the Roman " law of persons " was that all human beings were either free ( <unk> ) or slaves ( <unk> ) . The legal status of free persons might be further defined by their citizenship . Most citizens held limited rights ( such as the ius <unk> , " Latin right " ) , but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by those who lacked citizenship . Free people not considered citizens , but living within the Roman world , held status as <unk> , non @-@ Romans . In 212 AD , by means of the edict known as the Constitutio <unk> , the emperor Caracalla extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire . This legal egalitarianism would have required a far @-@ reaching revision of existing laws that had distinguished between citizens and non @-@ citizens . 
 = = = = Women in Roman law = = = = 
 Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens throughout the Republic and Empire , but did not vote , hold political office , or serve in the military . A mother 's citizen status determined that of her children , as indicated by the phrase ex <unk> <unk> Romanis <unk> ( " children born of two Roman citizens " ) . A Roman woman kept her own family name ( nomen ) for life . Children most often took the father 's name , but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother 's name part of theirs , or even used it instead . 
 The archaic form of manus marriage in which the woman had been subject to her husband 's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era , and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage . Technically she remained under her father 's legal authority , even though she moved into her husband 's home , but when her father died she became legally emancipated . This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period : although she had to answer to her father in legal matters , she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life , and her husband had no legal power over her . Although it was a point of pride to be a " one @-@ man woman " ( <unk> ) who had married only once , there was little stigma attached to divorce , nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce . 
 Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will . A Roman mother 's right to own property and to dispose of it as she saw fit , including setting the terms of her own will , gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults . 
 As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order , moral legislation attempted to regulate the conduct of men and women as a means of promoting " family values " . Adultery , which had been a private family matter under the Republic , was criminalized , and defined broadly as an illicit sex act ( <unk> ) that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman , or between a married woman and any man other than her husband . <unk> was encouraged by the state : a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom ( the ius <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated , women could own property , enter contracts , and engage in business , including shipping , manufacturing , and lending money . Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works , an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes ; for instance , the Arch of the <unk> was funded by Salvia <unk> , a female member of the family honoured , and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by <unk> , a priestess of Venus . 
 = = = = Slaves and the law = = = = 
 At the time of Augustus , as many as 35 percent of the people in Italy were slaves , making Rome one of five historical " slave societies " in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy . Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility . In urban settings , slaves might be professionals such as teachers , physicians , chefs , and accountants , in addition to the majority of slaves who provided trained or unskilled labour in households or workplaces . Agriculture and industry , such as milling and mining , relied on the exploitation of slaves . Outside Italy , slaves made up on average an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the population , sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas . Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries would have affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces . Although the institution of slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries , it remained an integral part of Roman society until the 5th century . Slavery ceased gradually in the 6th and 7th centuries along with the decline of urban centres in the West and the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy that had created the demand for it . 
 Laws pertaining to slavery were " extremely intricate " . Under Roman law , slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood . They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens , sexual exploitation , torture , and summary execution . A slave could not as a matter of law be raped , since rape could be committed only against people who were free ; a slave 's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the <unk> Law . Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called <unk> , but their unions were sometimes recognized , and if both were freed they could marry . Following the Servile Wars of the Republic , legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups , and for hunting down fugitive slaves . 
 Technically , a slave could not own property , but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual account or fund ( peculium ) that he could use as if it were his own . The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co @-@ operation between owner and slave : a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit , and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household . Within a household or workplace , a hierarchy of slaves might exist , with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves . 
 Over time slaves gained increased legal protection , including the right to file complaints against their masters . A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution , as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves . The burgeoning trade in eunuch slaves in the late 1st century AD prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will " for lust or gain . " 
 Roman slavery was not based on race . Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean , including Gaul , Hispania , Germany , Britannia , the Balkans , Greece ... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians , with a minority of foreigners ( including both slaves and freedmen ) born outside of Italy estimated at 5 % of the total in the capital at its peak , where their number was largest . Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent , while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society , remaining an identifiable minority . These slaves ( especially the foreigners ) had higher mortality rates and lower birth rates than natives , and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions . The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was extraordinarily low : seventeen and a half years ( 17 @.@ 2 for males ; 17 @.@ 9 for females ) . 
 During the period of Republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive , war captives were a main source of slaves . The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war , and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves into Rome . Slaves were also traded in markets , and sometimes sold by pirates . Infant abandonment and self @-@ enslavement among the poor were other sources . <unk> , by contrast , were " homegrown " slaves born to female slaves within the urban household or on a country estate or farm . Although they had no special legal status , an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his <unk> faced social disapproval , as they were considered part of his familia , the family household , and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family . 
 Talented slaves with a knack for business might accumulate a large enough peculium to justify their freedom , or be manumitted for services rendered . Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law ( Lex <unk> <unk> ) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will . 
 = = = = Freedmen = = = = 
 Rome differed from Greek city @-@ states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens . After manumission , a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed not only passive freedom from ownership , but active political freedom ( libertas ) , including the right to vote . A slave who had acquired libertas was a <unk> ( " freed person , " feminine <unk> ) in relation to his former master , who then became his patron ( patronus ) : the two parties continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other . As a social class generally , freed slaves were <unk> , though later writers used the terms <unk> and <unk> interchangeably . 
 A <unk> was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods , but he could play a priestly role in the cult of the emperor . He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank , nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself , but during the early Empire , freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy , so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law . Any future children of a freedman would be born free , with full rights of citizenship . 
 The rise of successful freedmen — through either political influence in imperial service , or wealth — is a characteristic of early Imperial society . The prosperity of a high @-@ achieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire , and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at Pompeii , such as the House of the <unk> . The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius , who wrote in the time of Nero . Such individuals , while exceptional , are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire . 
 = = = Census rank = = = 
 The Latin word ordo ( plural ordines ) refers to a social distinction that is translated variously into English as " class , order , rank , " none of which is exact . One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the ordo to which an individual belonged . The two highest ordines in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian . Outside Rome , the decurions , also known as <unk> ( Greek <unk> ) , were the top governing ordo of an individual city . 
 " Senator " was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome ; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate . A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million sestertii , as determined by the census . Nero made large gifts of money to a number of senators from old families who had become too impoverished to qualify . Not all men who qualified for the ordo <unk> chose to take a Senate seat , which required legal domicile at Rome . Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600 @-@ member body by appointment . A senator 's son belonged to the ordo <unk> , but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate itself . A senator could be removed for violating moral standards : he was prohibited , for instance , from marrying a <unk> or fighting in the arena . 
 In the time of Nero , senators were still primarily from Rome and other parts of Italy , with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France ; men from the Greek @-@ speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian . The first senator from the most eastern province , Cappadocia , was admitted under Marcus Aurelius . By the time of the Severan dynasty ( 193 – 235 ) , Italians made up less than half the Senate . During the 3rd century , domicile at Rome became impractical , and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland ( patria ) . 
 Senators had an aura of prestige and were the traditional governing class who rose through the cursus <unk> , the political career track , but equestrians of the Empire often possessed greater wealth and political power . Membership in the equestrian order was based on property ; in Rome 's early days , equites or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors ( the " public horse " ) , but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire . A census valuation of 400 @,@ 000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian . The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified , and in 14 AD , a thousand equestrians were registered at Cadiz and Padua alone . <unk> rose through a military career track ( tres <unk> ) to become highly placed prefects and procurators within the Imperial administration . 
 The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the first three centuries of the Empire . Roman aristocracy was based on competition , and unlike later European nobility , a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands . Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges , but also a number of responsibilities . In antiquity , a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works , events , and services ( munera ) , rather than on tax revenues , which primarily supported the military . Maintaining one 's rank required massive personal expenditures . <unk> were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire , as the ranks of the town councils became depleted , those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns , in an effort to sustain civic life . 
 In the later Empire , the dignitas ( " worth , esteem " ) that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as vir illustris , " illustrious man " . The appellation <unk> ( Greek <unk> ) was used to designate the dignitas of certain senators and their immediate family , including women . " Grades " of equestrian status proliferated . Those in Imperial service were ranked by pay grade ( <unk> , 60 @,@ 000 sesterces per annum ; <unk> , 100 @,@ 000 ; <unk> , 200 @,@ 000 ) . The title <unk> , " most eminent " ( Greek <unk> ) was reserved for equestrians who had been Praetorian prefects . The higher equestrian officials in general were <unk> , " most distinguished " ( Greek <unk> ) , the lower merely <unk> , " outstanding " ( Greek <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Unequal justice = = = = 
 As the republican principle of citizens ' equality under the law faded , the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours ( honestiores ) and those who were humbler folk ( <unk> ) . In general , honestiores were the members of the three higher " orders , " along with certain military officers . The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority over other citizens affirmed , particularly within the justice system . Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative " worth " ( dignitas ) of the defendant : an <unk> could pay a fine when convicted of a crime for which an <unk> might receive a scourging . 
 Execution , which had been an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic even in a capital case , could be quick and relatively painless for the Imperial citizen considered " more honorable , " while those deemed inferior might suffer the kinds of torture and prolonged death previously reserved for slaves , such as crucifixion and condemnation to the beasts as a spectacle in the arena . In the early Empire , those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as honestiores , especially if they declined to fulfill the religious aspects of their civic responsibilities , and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of martyrdom . 
 = = Government and military = = 
 The three major elements of the Imperial Roman state were the central government , the military , and provincial government . The military established control of a territory through war , but after a city or people was brought under treaty , the military mission turned to policing : protecting Roman citizens ( after 212 AD , all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire ) , the agricultural fields that fed them , and religious sites . Without modern instruments of either mass communication or mass destruction , the Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to impose their rule through force alone . Cooperation with local power elites was necessary to maintain order , collect information , and extract revenue . The Romans often exploited internal political divisions by supporting one faction over another : in the view of Plutarch , " it was discord between factions within cities that led to the loss of self @-@ governance " . 
 Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws , could collect their own taxes locally , and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation . Legal privileges and relative independence were an incentive to remain in good standing with Rome . Roman government was thus limited , but efficient in its use of the resources available to it . 
 = = = Central government = = = 
 The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices , including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society . The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus , and centralized the right to declare war , ratify treaties , and negotiate with foreign leaders . While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate , the emperor 's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical , culminating in the Dominate . 
 The emperor was the ultimate authority in <unk> and decision @-@ making , but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life , and to deal personally with official business and petitions . A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually . The Julio @-@ Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians , but trusted slaves and freedmen . After Nero , the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion , and the emperor 's council ( consilium ) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency . Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty , equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium . The women of the emperor 's family often intervened directly in his decisions . <unk> exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian . Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published , as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people . 
 Access to the emperor by others might be gained at the daily reception ( <unk> ) , a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron ; public banquets hosted at the palace ; and religious ceremonies . The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues . By the 4th century , as urban centres decayed , the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings , no longer responding to individual petitions . 
 Although the senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor , it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate . The senate legitimated the emperor 's rule , and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates ( <unk> ) to serve as generals , diplomats , and administrators . A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor , or over time perhaps multiple emperors . 
 The practical source of an emperor 's power and authority was the military . The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury , and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor ( <unk> ) . The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis . Most emperors indicated their choice of successor , usually a close family member or adopted heir . The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape . No emperor could hope to survive , much less to reign , without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions . To secure their loyalty , several emperors paid the <unk> , a monetary reward . In theory , the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor , but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The soldiers of the Imperial Roman army were professionals who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves . The transition to a professional military had begun during the late Republic , and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism , under which an army of conscripts had exercised their responsibilities as citizens in defending the homeland in a campaign against a specific threat . For Imperial Rome , the military was a full @-@ time career in itself . 
 The primary mission of the Roman military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana . The three major divisions of the military were : 
 the garrison at Rome , which includes both the Praetorians and the vigiles who functioned as police and firefighters ; 
 the provincial army , comprising the Roman legions and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces ( auxilia ) ; 
 the navy . 
 The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of cultural exchange and assimilation known as " Romanization , " particularly in regard to politics , the economy , and religion . Knowledge of the Roman military comes from a wide range of sources : Greek and Roman literary texts ; coins with military themes ; papyri preserving military documents ; monuments such as Trajan 's Column and triumphal arches , which feature artistic depictions of both fighting men and military machines ; the archaeology of military burials , battle sites , and camps ; and inscriptions , including military diplomas , epitaphs , and dedications . 
 Through his military reforms , which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty , Augustus changed and regularized the legion , down to the <unk> pattern on the soles of army boots . A legion was organized into ten cohorts , each of which comprised six centuries , with a century further made up of ten squads ( <unk> ) ; the exact size of the Imperial legion , which is most likely to have been determined by logistics , has been estimated to range from 4 @,@ 800 to 5 @,@ 280 . 
 In AD 9 , Germanic tribes wiped out three full legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest . This disastrous event reduced the number of the legions to 25 . The total of the legions would later be increased again and for the next 300 years always be a little above or below 30 . The army had about 300 @,@ 000 soldiers in the 1st century , and under 400 @,@ 000 in the 2nd , " significantly smaller " than the collective armed forces of the territories it conquered . No more than 2 percent of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army . 
 Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard : nine cohorts , ostensibly to maintain the public peace , which were garrisoned in Italy . Better paid than the legionaries , the Praetorians served only sixteen years . 
 The auxilia were recruited from among the non @-@ citizens . Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength , they were paid less than the legionaries , and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship , also extended to their sons . According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries . The auxilia thus amounted to around 125 @,@ 000 men , implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments . The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic , Hispanic or Germanic areas . Several aspects of training and equipment , such as the four @-@ horned saddle , derived from the Celts , as noted by Arrian and indicated by archaeology . 
 The Roman navy ( Latin : <unk> , " fleet " ) not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions , but also helped in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube . Another of its duties was the protection of the crucial maritime trade routes against the threat of pirates . It patrolled the whole of the Mediterranean , parts of the North Atlantic coasts , and the Black Sea . Nevertheless , the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch . 
 = = = Provincial government = = = 
 An annexed territory became a province in a three @-@ step process : making a register of cities , taking a census of the population , and surveying the land . Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths , real estate transactions , taxes , and juridical proceedings . In the 1st and 2nd centuries , the central government sent out around 160 officials each year to govern outside Italy . Among these officials were the " Roman governors " , as they are called in English : either magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces ; or governors , usually of equestrian rank , who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in provinces excluded from senatorial control , most notably Roman Egypt . A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed , but he could delegate various duties . His staff , however , was minimal : his official attendants ( <unk> ) , including lictors , heralds , messengers , scribes , and bodyguards ; legates , both civil and military , usually of equestrian rank ; and friends , ranging in age and experience , who accompanied him unofficially . 
 Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances . Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era . Under the Republic , provincial governors and tax farmers could exploit local populations for personal gain more freely . Equestrian procurators , whose authority was originally " extra @-@ judicial and extra @-@ constitutional , " managed both state @-@ owned property and the vast personal property of the emperor ( res <unk> ) . Because Roman government officials were few in number , a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity , such as a procurator or a military officer , including centurions down to the lowly <unk> or military police . 
 = = = Roman law = = = 
 Roman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire , but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces . Most parts of the Eastern empire already had well @-@ established law codes and juridical procedures . In general , it was Roman policy to respect the mos <unk> ( " regional tradition " or " law of the land " ) and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability . The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying ius gentium , the " law of nations " or international law regarded as common and customary among all human communities . If the particulars of provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom , Roman courts heard appeals , and the emperor held final authority to render a decision . 
 In the West , law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis , and private property rights may have been a novelty of the Roman era , particularly among Celtic peoples . Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro @-@ Roman elite who found their new privileges as citizens to be advantageous . The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law , replacing the local law codes that had applied to non @-@ citizens . Diocletian 's efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years , the Codex <unk> and the Codex Hermogenianus , to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards . 
 The pervasive exercise of Roman law throughout Western Europe led to its enormous influence on the Western legal tradition , reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law . 
 = = = Taxation = = = 
 Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5 percent of the Empire 's gross product . The typical tax rate paid by individuals ranged from 2 to 5 percent . The tax code was " bewildering " in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes , some paid in cash and some in kind . Taxes might be specific to a province , or kinds of properties such as fisheries or salt evaporation ponds ; they might be in effect for a limited time . Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military , and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty . In @-@ kind taxes were accepted from less @-@ monetized areas , particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps . 
 The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals , who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land , construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity . Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions ; for example , Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax @-@ exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile . Tax obligations were determined by the census , which required each head of household to appear before the presiding official and provide a head count of his household , as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation . 
 A major source of indirect @-@ tax revenue was the <unk> , customs and tolls on imports and exports , including among provinces . Special taxes were levied on the slave trade . Toward the end of his reign , Augustus instituted a 4 percent tax on the sale of slaves , which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers , who responded by raising their prices . An owner who manumitted a slave paid a " freedom tax " , calculated at 5 percent of value . 
 An inheritance tax of 5 percent was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone but members of their immediate family . Revenues from the estate tax and from a 1 percent sales tax on auctions went toward the veterans ' pension fund ( aerarium militare ) . 
 Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth , which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government . An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the " super @-@ rich " , but in the later period , the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Moses Finley was the chief proponent of the primitivist view that the Roman economy was " underdeveloped and underachieving , " characterized by subsistence agriculture ; urban centres that consumed more than they produced in terms of trade and industry ; low @-@ status artisans ; slowly developing technology ; and a " lack of economic rationality . " Current views are more complex . Territorial conquests permitted a large @-@ scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization , particularly in north Africa . Some cities were known for particular industries or commercial activities , and the scale of building in urban areas indicates a significant construction industry . Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism , and the Empire was highly monetized . Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity , transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly , and trade routes connected regional economies . The supply contracts for the army , which pervaded every part of the Empire , drew on local suppliers near the base ( castrum ) , throughout the province , and across provincial borders . The Empire is perhaps best thought of as a network of regional economies , based on a form of " political capitalism " in which the state monitored and regulated commerce to assure its own revenues . Economic growth , though not comparable to modern economies , was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization . 
 Socially , economic dynamism opened up one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire . Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth , patronage , good luck , or even extraordinary ability . Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society , a strong tendency toward plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank . Prestige could be obtained through investing one 's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately : grand country estates or townhouses , durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware , public entertainments , funerary monuments for family members or coworkers , and religious dedications such as altars . Guilds ( collegia ) and corporations ( corpora ) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking , sharing sound business practices , and a willingness to work . 
 = = = Currency and banking = = = 
 The early Empire was monetized to a near @-@ universal extent , in the sense of using money as a way to express prices and debts . The <unk> ( plural sestertii , English " sesterces " , symbolized as HS ) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century , though the silver denarius , worth four sesterces , was used also for accounting beginning in the Severan dynasty . The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as ( plural asses ) , one @-@ fourth <unk> . Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as <unk> , " money , " and were used only on the frontiers for transacting business or buying property . Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries counted coins , rather than weighing them — an indication that the coin was valued on its face , not for its metal content . This tendency toward fiat money led eventually to the debasement of Roman coinage , with consequences in the later Empire . The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration . The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving . 
 Rome had no central bank , and regulation of the banking system was minimal . Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers ' deposits . A typical bank had fairly limited capital , and often only one principal , though a bank might have as many as six to fifteen principals . Seneca assumes that anyone involved in commerce needs access to credit . 
 A professional deposit banker ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or later <unk> ) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term , and lent money to third parties . The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending , both as creditors and borrowers , making loans from their personal fortunes on the basis of social connections . The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party , without cash changing hands . Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked " paper " or documentary transactions , the system of banks throughout the Empire also permitted the exchange of very large sums without the physical transfer of coins , in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash , particularly by sea . Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire , a credit crisis in 33 AD that put a number of senators at risk ; the central government rescued the market through a loan of 100 million HS made by the emperor Tiberius to the banks ( <unk> ) . Generally , available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers . The central government itself did not borrow money , and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves . 
 Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency , particularly the denarius , under the pressures of meeting military payrolls . Sudden inflation during the reign of Commodus damaged the credit market . In the mid @-@ 200s , the supply of specie contracted sharply . Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century — such as reductions in long @-@ distance trade , disruption of mining operations , and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies — greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300 . Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency , general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian , and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government . Despite Diocletian 's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms , the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness . 
 = = = Mining and metallurgy = = = 
 The main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula ( gold , silver , copper , tin , lead ) ; Gaul ( gold , silver , iron ) ; Britain ( mainly iron , lead , tin ) , the Danubian provinces ( gold , iron ) ; Macedonia and Thrace ( gold , silver ) ; and Asia Minor ( gold , silver , iron , tin ) . Intensive large @-@ scale mining — of alluvial deposits , and by means of open @-@ cast mining and underground mining — took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD , when the instability of the Empire disrupted production . The gold mines of Dacia , for instance , were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271 . Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century . 
 Hydraulic mining , which Pliny referred to as <unk> <unk> ( " ruin of the mountains " ) , allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto @-@ industrial scale . The total annual iron output is estimated at 82 @,@ 500 tonnes . Copper was produced at an annual rate of 15 @,@ 000 t , and lead at 80 @,@ 000 t , both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution ; Hispania alone had a 40 percent share in world lead production . The high lead output was a by @-@ product of extensive silver mining which reached 200 t per annum . At its peak around the mid @-@ 2nd century AD , the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10 @,@ 000 t , five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD . As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production , lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era , and dropped again thereafter . 
 = = = Transportation and communication = = = 
 The Roman Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean , which they called " our sea " ( mare nostrum ) . Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as the major rivers of the Empire , including the Guadalquivir , Ebro , Rhône , Rhine , Tiber and Nile . Transport by water was preferred where possible , and moving commodities by land was more difficult . Vehicles , wheels , and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled <unk> .
