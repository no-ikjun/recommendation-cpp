 In November 1941 , he was chosen by Göring to command Germany 's fighter force as General der Jagdflieger , succeeding Werner Mölders who had just been killed in an air crash en route to attend the funeral of Ernst Udet . Galland was not enthusiastic about his promotion , seeing himself as a combat leader and not wanting to be " tied to a desk job " . 
 Soon afterward , on 28 January 1942 , Galland was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ) for his service as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 26 . Although not keen on a staff position , soon after Galland 's appointment , he planned and executed the German air superiority plan ( Operation Donnerkeil ) for the Kriegsmarine 's ( German navy , or War Marine ) Operation Cerberus , from his headquarters at Jever . The German battleships Scharnhorst , Gneisenau and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sailed from Brest , France , up the English Channel to Kiel , Germany . The operation caught the British off guard . The RAF attempted to intercept with the forces available , but the German fighter defences were able to shoot down 43 RAF aircraft with 247 British casualties . The Luftwaffe had prevented any damage on the ships by air attack . 
 A strong proponent of the day fighter force and the defence of Germany , Galland used his position to improve the position of the Jagdwaffe . The need was now pressing , as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941 , and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign . Galland was outspoken , something that was not often tolerated by Göring . Yet , by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe , like Erhard Milch and Günther <unk> , and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler , Galland was able to survive in his position for three years .

 After his appointment , Galland was strictly confined to operational matters and not allowed to fly tactical or combat missions . As the war continued Galland flew missions in violation of these restrictions against the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) bombing raids during the Defence of the Reich . Galland was keen to familiarise himself with all types of German fighter aircraft and flew the Fw 190 on these interception missions . He would actively engage American bombers on some raids . On at least one mission , he shot down a USAAF heavy bomber .

 Galland 's position as General der Jagdflieger brought him into gradual conflict with Göring as the war continued . In 1942 – 44 , the German fighter forces on all fronts in the European Theatre of Operations ( ETO ) came under increasing pressure and Galland 's relationship with Göring began to turn sour . The first distinct cracks began to appear in the spring , 1943 . Galland suggested that the fighter forces defending Germany should limit the number interceptions flown to allow sufficient time for re @-@ grouping and to conserve air strength . Only by conserving its strength and its precious resources — the fighter pilots — could the Luftwaffe hope to inflict damage on the bombers . Göring refused . He demanded every raid be countered in maximum strength regardless of the size of the Allied fighter escort . According to head of production and procurement Erhard Milch , who was also present at the meeting , " Göring just could not grasp it . " 
 During the late summer , 1943 , the USAAF fighters operated over German air space for the first time . Several aircraft crashed near Aachen on the cusp of Germany 's west border . Galland presented these wrecks as proof that the Luftwaffe was facing an enemy that could soon escort its heavy bombers with fighter aircraft to industrial targets inside Germany . Galland submitted his findings to Göring . Göring was livid with Galland and the fighter force . The Reichsmarschall called the report the " rantings of a worn @-@ out defeatist " , and gave Galland an " order " , that no Allied fighters had crossed into Germany . Göring declared the only possible reason could have been that short range fighters ran out of fuel at high altitude and " they were shot down much further west ... and glided quite a distance before they crashed . Galland and Milch denied this . Galland questioned why an Allied pilot would choose to glide east instead of west . Both men and argued that they must increase fighter production to reach a three or fourfold advantage over the attackers immediately to prepare for this new threat . Galland 's efforts to produce a fighter force fit for a war of attrition conflicted with Göring 's bias in favour of bombers , to maintain the offensive on all fronts . It was a policy the Reichsmarschall persisted with until the autumn , 1943 . 
 By October 1943 , the fractious relationship came to the surface again . Galland met with Göring at Göring 's estate , Schloss Veldenstein . During the conversation the need for new and improved interceptor aircraft arose . The demands made by Göring , that heavily cannon @-@ armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations , were unreasonable to Galland . Göring , prompted by the desires of Hitler , wanted cannons of some 2 @,@ 000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second . Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft ; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre . Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410 , a favourite of Hitler 's , had caused heavy losses . Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible . Göring ignored Galland 's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force , accusing them of cowardice . Galland , as he always did , defended them , risking his career , and near the end of the war , his life in doing so . Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring 's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit . Göring accepted , but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress . Galland continued in his post . 
 The arguments , mainly over aircraft procurement and armament for the defence of Germany from Allied bombing began to give rise to a growing personal rift between Göring and Galland . 
 = = = Innovations = = = 
 To retrieve the situation for the fighter force , Galland looked to employ new technology in the air war . On 23 May 1943 , Galland flew an early prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . After the flight , he described his experience : 
 For the first time I was flying by Jet propulsion ! No engine vibrations . No torque and no lashing sound of the engine propeller . Accompanied by a whistling sound , my jet shot through the air . Later when asked what it felt like , I said , " It was as though angels were pushing . " 
 Galland became an enthusiastic supporter of the aircraft , realising its potential as a fighter rather than a bomber . Galland hoped that the Me 262 would compensate for the numerical superiority of the Allies : 
 In the last four months [ January – April 1944 ] our day fighters have lost 1 @,@ 000 pilots ... we are numerically inferior and will always remain so ... I believe that a great deal can be achieved with a small number of technically and far superior aircraft such as the [ Me ] 262 and [ Me ] 163 ... I would at this moment rather have one Me 262 in action rather than five Bf 109s . I used to say three 109s , but the situation develops and changes . 
 Galland succeeded in temporarily persuading Milch to support cancelling the Me 209 program in favour of producing 100 Me 262s by the end of 1943 . However , because of persistent problems with its turbojet engines and later , Hitler 's determination to use it as a bomber , the Me 262 was not developed as a fighter until late in the war . 
 By spring 1944 , the Me 262 was sufficiently ready for operational service . By this time , Galland faced rivalries amongst the Luftwaffe command over how best to employ the aircraft . Dietrich Peltz , commander of the IX . Fliegerkorps ( 9th Air Corps ) , wanted to use the aircraft as a weapon against a future Allied landing in France . Peltz saw the aircraft as an ideal fast bomber which could evade the overwhelming numbers of Allied piston @-@ engine fighters and attack the landing grounds . Peltz also wished to use highly trained bomber pilots who he felt could better serve as home defence fighter pilots in place of the overextended and overworked Jagdwaffe . Their blind @-@ weather experience and training , and background in multi @-@ engine aircraft made them ideal for these operations in his view . In the first five months of 1944 , Peltz ' conventional bomber force had suffered a significant defeat over England in Operation Steinbock but it did not dull his appetite for offensive action or dent his reputation with Göring . Galland argued against his suggestion . Instead , Galland thought the bomber corps should be disbanded and its pilots converted onto fighters . Göring adopted Peltz ' idea to impress Hitler and regain his waning influence . 
 Galland did not give up . He made repeated appeals for Me 262 fighter aircraft . Göring refused Galland 's requests to have equal numbers of Me 262 fighter and bomber variants built . However , Galland 's close relationship with Albert Speer , the German armaments minister , enabled him to retain a small operational number . Even this was difficult , as Hitler had taken personal control of turbo @-@ jet production and checked where each batch of the aircraft were being deployed . It was not until September 1944 that Hitler rescinded his directive that the Me 262 be used as a fighter @-@ bomber . Galland ignored the order and formed <unk> 262 to test the Me 262 against high @-@ flying Allied reconnaissance aircraft . He selected the highly decorated pilot Werner Thierfelder as its commander . Hitler heard of the experiment through Milch and ordered Göring to put a stop to it at a meeting on 29 May 1944 . Galland persisted with the experiments and ordered operations to be continued . They achieved isolated successes until Thierfelder was shot down and killed by P @-@ 51 Mustangs on 18 July 1944 . On 20 August , Hitler finally agreed to allow one in every 20 Me 262 to go into service with the Jagdwaffe which allowed Galland to build all – jet units . 
 Owing to his keen interest in the type he followed , with interest , the exploits of Kommando Nowotny , the all jet fighter unit . Although it had low serviceability rates , its aircraft achieved considerable success . To see how new aircraft performed in action , Galland often visited the front line airfields close to the scene of the fighting . On 8 November 1944 , he was present when ace Walter Nowotny took off with a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid . Galland listened to it over the radio waves . Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged . He was then jumped by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield . Galland heard the firing but did not see the event . It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter . 
 In the meantime , Galland pursued innovations with existing designs . The Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 aircraft was formed into several Geschwader with distinctly upgraded firepower . Called the Sturmbock ( Battering ram ) , these machines could inflict heavy damage on unescorted bomber formations . Galland supported the conversion of units such as Jagdgeschwader 300 to the Sturmbock role . The Sturmbock were heavily armed and armoured , which meant they were un @-@ manoeuvrable and vulnerable without protection from escorting Bf 109s . Still , the tactics quickly became widespread and were one of the few Luftwaffe success stories in 1944 . Galland said after the war , that had it not been for the Allied landing in Normandy which increased the need for lighter fighter variants , each Geschwader in the Luftwaffe would have contained a Gruppe of Sturmbock aircraft by September 1944 . 
 Galland himself flew on unauthorised interception flights to experience the combat pressures of the pilots , and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P @-@ 51 Mustangs . Nevertheless , on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked . For example , on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the <unk> Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted . The entire squadron of 12 B @-@ 24s were shot down . The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day , the majority to a Sturmbock attack .

 Despite Göring 's apology after their previous dispute , the relationship between the two men did not improve . Göring 's influence was in decline by late 1944 and he had fallen out of favour with Hitler . Göring became increasingly hostile to Galland , blaming him and the fighter pilots for the situation . In 1944 , the situation worsened . A series of USAAF raids termed Big Week won air superiority for the Allies in February . By the spring 1944 , the Luftwaffe could not effectively challenge the Allies over France or the Low Countries . Operation Overlord , the Allied invasion of German @-@ occupied Europe took place in June 1944 . According to a report made by Galland , in the previous four months 1 @,@ 000 pilots had been killed . Galland reported that the enemy outnumbered his fighters between 6 : 1 and 8 : 1 and the standard of Allied fighter pilot training was " astonishingly high " . 
 To win back some breathing space for his force and German industrial targets , Galland formulated a plan which he called the " Big Blow " ( German : Großer Schlag ) . It called for the mass interception of USAAF bomber formations by approximately 2 @,@ 000 German fighters . Galland hoped that the German fighters would shoot down some 400 – 500 bombers . Acceptable losses were to be around 400 fighters and 100 – 150 pilots . The night fighter force was to assist by employing 100 aircraft in southern and northern Germany , to prevent any crippled bombers making it to Switzerland and Sweden . Over the autumn 1944 Galland carefully <unk> is resources and waited for unusually bad weather to improve . 
 Hitler proved too impatient . He hoped to improve Germany 's position by winning a decisive victory on the Western Front . Hitler distrusted Galland 's theory and believed him to be afraid and stalling for time . The Führer was also sceptical that the Luftwaffe could stop the American air offensive and was not willing to have German resources sit idle on airfields to wait for an improvement in flying conditions . Admittedly Galland 's efforts had built up a useful reserve , but Hitler was now to use it in support of a land offensive . Göring and Hitler handed over the forces pooled by Galland to Peltz whom they had appointed commander of II . Jagdkorps — responsible for virtually all fighter forces in the west . Peltz appointed Gordon Gollob as Special Fighter Staff Officer for the offensive . Gollob ultimately was a vociferous opponent of Galland and eventually engineered his dismissal . Whether the " Big Blow " operation would have worked is a matter of academic debate . Historians remained divided , with some believing it was a lost opportunity while others think it would have had much less impact than Galland estimated . 
 The operation never took place . Instead , the fighter force was committed to the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte , designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge . Galland 's influence on matters was now virtually nil . Appalled by the Ardennes losses , he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely . Gollob contacted the Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler . Himmler 's reputation as the most powerful man after Hitler at that time may have been a prime motive . Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland 's leadership . The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V @-@ 2 operations . Himmler , whose relationship with Göring was poor , took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob . It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power . Göring , for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned . On 13 January 1945 , Galland was finally relieved of his command . 
 On 17 January , a group of senior pilots took part in a " Fighter Pilots Revolt " . Galland 's high standing with his fighter pilot peers led to a group of the most decorated Luftwaffe combat leaders loyal to Galland ( including Johannes Steinhoff and Günther Lützow ) confronting Göring with a list of demands for the survival of their service . Göring initially suspected Galland had instigated the unrest . Heinrich Himmler had wanted to put Galland on trial for treason himself ; the SS and Gestapo had already begun investigations into who he associated with . The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( OKL ) appointed the more politically acceptable Gollob , a National Socialist supporter , to succeed him as General der Jagdflieger on 23 January . Although professional contemporaries , Gollob and Galland had a mutual dislike , and after Galland had removed the Austrian from his personal staff in September 1944 , Gollob started to gather evidence to use against Galland , detailing false accusations of his gambling , womanising , and alleged private use of Luftwaffe transport aircraft . The official reason for his being relieved of command was his ill health . 
 For his own safety , Galland went to a retreat in the Harz Mountains . He was to keep the RLM informed of his whereabouts , but was effectively under house arrest . Hitler , who liked Galland , had not heard of the events . However , when he learned of them he ordered that " all this nonsense " [ the treatment of Galland ] , was to stop immediately . Hitler had been informed by Albert Speer , who in turn had been informed of events by one of Galland 's close friends . In the end , Göring contacted Galland and invited him to Karinhall . In light of his service to the fighter arm , he promised no further action would be taken against him and offered command of a unit of Me 262 jets . Galland accepted on the understanding that Gollob had no jurisdiction over him or his unit . 
 = = = Self appraisal = = = 
 Galland did not pretend to have been error free . After the war , he was candid about his own mistakes as General der Jagdflieger . Production and aircraft procurement were not his responsibility but Galland identified four major mistakes by the OKL during the war , and accepted partial responsibility for the first three : 
 Fighter pilots received no instrument training until very late in the war , after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages and the need to produce pilots more quickly to replace losses . Galland also did not make sure all @-@ weather flying was incorporated into pilot training , which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force . 
 Attrition by 1942 had created a shortage of experienced combat leaders . No special training was made available for this role . Galland set up a course in late 1943 , but it only lasted a few months . Galland was quoted as saying he thought they could learn the skills while on operations , as he had . This ignored his own talents , and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards . 
 The Me 262 , while not a war winner , might have extended the Defence of the Reich campaign . The problems with the engines , failures of production priorities and Hitler 's meddling are well known , but the long delay between operational testing , tactical and doctrinal development and training were largely Galland 's fault . 
 The German pilots were increasingly lacking in quantity and quality . Galland recognised this but could not correct it without stepping outside his own authority . Galland noticed that the highly educated engineers and trainees were selected for the bomber arm in the early war years . Most of the brightest youth were pulled by expert campaigners , toward the Waffen SS and Kriegsmarine . The Luftwaffe did not match this effort .

 Galland was initially assigned to command a Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 54 , at that time stranded behind Soviet lines in the Courland Pocket . Galland never took up this command but was given the task of forming Jagdverband 44 ( JV 44 ) . On 24 February 1945 the order for formation of Jagdverband 44 read : 
 JV 44 is established at Brandenburg @-@ Briest with immediate effect . Ground personnel are to be drawn from 16 . / JG 54 , Factory Protection Unit 1 and III . / Erg JG 2 . The commander of this unit receives the disciplinary powers of a Divisional Commander as laid down in Luftwaffe Order 3 / 9 @.@ 17 . It is subordinated to Luftflotte Reich and comes under Luftgaukommando III ( Berlin ) . Verband Galland is to have a provisional strength of sixteen operational Me 262s and fifteen pilots . [ Signed ] Generalleutnant Karl Koller , Chief of Staff of the Luftwaffe . 
 Galland was allowed to hand pick a number of experienced fighter pilots and aces for the unit , including Johannes Steinhoff , Erich <unk> , Heinrich Bär and Gerhard Barkhorn . Erich Hartmann was also asked but would not leave his unit . The unit was officially formed on 22 February 1945 . Galland did everything he could to introduce the Me 262s to the wing as quickly as possible . Göring showed sympathy for Galland 's efforts , which thus far had only 16 operational jets in February . General Josef Kammhuber was asked to assist Galland . Kampfgeschwader 51 ( KG 51 or Bomber Wing 51 ) , 6 and 27 were behind their training schedules on jets , and they were to hand over their pilots and Me 262s to Jagdgeschwader 7 and Kampfgeschwader 54 . Galland added a suggestion that all experienced fighter pilots flying with Bf 109 or Fw 190 units should be made to join the Me 262 unit . If this could be done Galland believed he could get 150 jets in action against the USAAF fleets . The general chaos and impending collapse prevented his plans from being realised . 
 On 31 March 1945 , Galland flew 12 operational jets to Munich to begin operations . On 5 April , he organised the interception of a USAAF raid . The Me 262s destroyed three B @-@ 17s . On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B @-@ 26 Marauder bombers shot down . On 21 April , to his surprise , he was visited by Göring for the final time . Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 and the use of bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct . He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility . As they parted , Göring said , " I envy you Galland , for going into action . I wish I were a few years younger and less bulky . If I were , I would gladly put myself under your command . It would be marvelous to have nothing to worry about but a good fight , like it was in the old days . " 
 In the space of six days , Galland 's friend , Steinhoff was badly burned in a crash on 18 April , and then , on 24 April , his friend Lützow was posted missing . On 21 April , Galland was credited with his 100th aerial victory . He was the 103rd and last Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . On 26 April , Galland claimed his 103rd and 104th aerial victories against B @-@ 26s , escorted by the 27th Fighter Group and 50th Fighter Group . Galland again made a mistake ; he stopped to make sure his second victory was going to crash and he was hit by a USAAF P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt piloted by James Finnegan . Galland nursed his crippled Me 262 to the airfield , only to find it was under attack by more P @-@ 47s . Galland landed under fire and abandoned his jet on the runway . The battle was his last operational mission . Soon afterward , he was sent to hospital for a knee wound sustained during his last mission . The Americans lost four B @-@ 26s and another six damaged . In return two Me 262s were shot down : the other pilot surviving . 
 In the 1970s , a San Jose State University graduate student came across Galland 's memoirs The First and the Last while researching records of United States Army Air Forces records and matching them to German victory claims . He found that James Finnegan , a P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt pilot of the 50th Fighter Group , Ninth Air Force , had made a " probable " claim on 26 April 1945 , the day of Galland 's last mission . The details of the engagement matched . Galland and Finnegan met for the first time at an Air Force Association meeting in San Francisco in 1979 . 
 = = = Surrender = = = 
 By late April , the war was effectively over . On 1 May 1945 , Galland attempted to make contact with United States Army forces to negotiate the surrender of his unit . The act itself was dangerous . SS forces roamed the countryside and towns executing anyone who was considering capitulation . The Americans requested that Galland fly his unit and Me 262s to a USAAF controlled airfield . Galland declined citing poor weather and technical problems . In reality , Galland was not going to hand over Me 262 jets to the Americans . Galland had harboured the belief that the Western Alliance would soon be at war with the Soviet Union , and he wanted to join American forces and to use his unit in the coming war to free Germany from Communist occupation . Galland replied , making his whereabouts known to the Americans , and offering his surrender once they arrived at the Tegernsee hospital where he was being treated . Galland then ordered his unit , which had then moved to Salzburg and Innsbruck , to destroy their Me 262s . At the time of his surrender , Galland had filed claims for 104 Allied aircraft shot down . His claims included seven with the Me 262 . 
 On 14 May 1945 , Galland was flown to England and interrogated by RAF personnel about the Luftwaffe , its organisation , his role in it and technical questions . Galland returned to Germany on 24 August and was imprisoned at <unk> . On 7 October , Galland was returned to England for further interrogation . Galland was eventually released on 28 April 1947 .

 After his release , he travelled to Schleswig @-@ Holstein to join Baroness Gisela von Donner , an earlier acquaintance , on her estate and lived with her three children . During this time , Galland found work as a forestry worker . There he convalesced and came to terms with his career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes . Galland began to hunt for the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations . Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying . Kurt Tank , the designer of the Fw 190 , requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal . Tank had been asked to work for the British and Soviets , and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter . Tank , through a contact in Denmark , informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank ’ s new generation of fighters . Galland accepted and flew to Argentina . He settled with Gisela in El Palomar , Buenos Aires . Galland enjoyed the slow life . His time there , aside from work commitments , were taken up with Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life . Galland found South America a world away from post @-@ war shortages of Germany . Soon , he took up gliding again . 
 In a professional capacity , Galland spoke fluent Spanish which eased his instruction on new pilots . During his time with the Argentine Air Force ( AAF ) he flew the British Gloster Meteor . Galland commented , mindful it was a contemporary to the Me 262 , that it was a fine aircraft . He claimed that if he could have fit the Meteor engines to the Me 262 airframe he would have had the best fighter in the world . Galland continued training , lecturing and consulting for the AAF until 1955 . During his later years in Argentina Galland returned to Europe to test fly new types . While there , he teamed up with Eduard Neumann , the former Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 27 and mentor of Hans @-@ Joachim Marseille " The Star of Africa " . Neumann had joined Galland 's staff in April 1943 . They flew a Piaggio <unk> in an international air rally across Italy . The weather was appalling and seven aircraft crashed taking two lives . Galland and Neumann came in second place . 
 = = = Return to Germany = = = 
 Galland 's time in Argentina was running out . For his services , he was awarded a pilot 's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot . Later that year Galland left South America . By that time , he had begun writing his autobiography , The First and the Last ( Die <unk> und die <unk> ) , and it was published in 1954 by Franz <unk> . It was a best @-@ seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies . It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement . Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power . Galland joined with Steinhoff , and went over the proposal . However , France objected to West Germany 's proposal for a pan @-@ European defence pact and chose to go its own way . That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces . Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by . In 1956 Josef Kammhuber , the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader ( Night Fighter Wings ) during the war , became the new commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the <unk> . Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of , or in , the new air force . Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina , a state which was on poor terms with the United States , the dominant partner of NATO . 
 In the summer of 1957 , Galland moved to Bonn and rented an office on <unk> , beginning his own aircraft consultancy there . Galland worked hard but continued flying , taking part in national air shows . In 1956 , he was appointed honorary chairman of the Gemeinschaft der Jagdflieger , the Association of Fighter Pilots . Through this , he came into contact with contemporaries in Britain and America . In 1961 , he joined the <unk> Group of Cologne who contracted Galland to help develop their aviation business . With business going well , Galland bought his own aircraft on 19 March 1962 , his 50th birthday . The aircraft was a Beechcraft Bonanza , registered D @-@ <unk> , which he named Die Dicke ( Fatty ) . 
 In 1969 , he served as technical adviser for the film Battle of Britain , in which the character Major Falke is based on Galland . Galland was upset about the director 's decision not to use the real names . While making the film , Galland was joined by his friend Robert Stanford Tuck . In 1973 , Galland appeared in the British television documentary series The World at War , in episodes four and twelve , " Alone ( May 1940 – May 1941 ) " and " Whirlwind : Bombing Germany ( September 1939 – April 1944 ) " . 
 Galland took part in many engagements throughout the 1960s and 1970s . In 1974 , he was part of the remaining German General Staff that took part in the Operation Sea Lion wargame at Sandhurst in the United Kingdom , replicating the planned German invasion of Britain in 1940 ( which the German side lost ) . In 1975 , he was a guest at the RAF Museum Hendon , during the unveiling of the Battle of Britain Hall , where he was entertained by Prince Charles . In 1980 , Galland 's eyesight became too poor for him to fly and he retired as a pilot . However , he continued to attend numerous aviation events , to include being a periodic guest of the U.S. Air Force for their annual " Gathering of Eagles " program at the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB , Alabama , USA . On 16 October , he was reunited with two Merkel shotguns stolen by American soldiers after his capture in 1945 . Galland had located them before and had tried to buy them back , only to be told no , as they would be worth more after his death . Towards the end of the 1980s , Galland 's health began to fail . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Baroness Gisela von Donner had refused to marry Galland as the restrictions imposed upon her former husband 's will would deny her the wealth and freedom she had enjoyed . She left for Germany in 1954 . Galland married <unk> von <unk> on 12 February 1954 . However , she was unable to have children and they divorced on 10 September 1963 . 
 On 10 September 1963 , Galland married his secretary , <unk> <unk> . They had two children : a son , Andreas Hubertus ( nicknamed " <unk> " ) born 7 November 1966 ; and a daughter , Alexandra @-@ Isabelle born 29 July 1969 . The RAF ace Robert Stanford Tuck was the godfather of his son Andreas . Galland remained friends with Tuck until the latter 's death on 5 May 1987 . Galland felt his loss greatly . Galland 's marriage to <unk> did not last and on 10 February 1984 , he married his third wife , Heidi Horn , who remained with him until his death . 
 By the 1980s , Galland was now regularly attending the funerals of friends like Tuck , and also Douglas Bader , who had died on 5 September 1982 after speaking at a dinner for Arthur Harris . In June 1983 he attended the funeral of Gerhard Barkhorn and his wife <unk> , who had died in a traffic accident . 
 Later that year , Galland tracked down his mechanic , Gerhard Meyer , who had installed the armour that saved his life in 1941 .

 = William Henry Leonard Poe = 
 William Henry Leonard Poe , often referred to as Henry Poe , ( January 30 , 1807 – August 1 , 1831 ) was a sailor , amateur poet and the older brother of Edgar Allan Poe and Rosalie Poe . 
 After the death of their parents , the three Poe children were split up : Henry lived with family in Baltimore , Maryland , while Edgar and Rosalie were cared for by two different families in Richmond , Virginia . Before the age of 20 , Henry traveled around the globe by sea before returning to Baltimore and becoming a published poet and author . One of his works , " The Pirate " , was a fictionalized account of his brother 's first relationship with Sarah Elmira Royster in Richmond . Henry died of tuberculosis in 1831 at the age of twenty @-@ four . 
 Henry Poe was an inspiration to his brother 's life and writings and the two had similar writing styles . Edgar Allan Poe for a time used the alias " Henri Le Rennet " , a name inspired by Henry . Henry 's influence on Edgar 's writing include a character in the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and possibly the name of the title character in the poem " Lenore " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 William Henry Leonard , who went by the name Henry , was born circa January 30 , 1807 , to traveling actors Eliza Poe and David Poe , Jr . , four months after their troupe began performing in Boston . Their second son , Edgar , was born on January 19 , 1809 , and a daughter , Rosalie , was born in December 1810 . Some time before July 1809 , however , David Poe had deserted his family , though little is known about his disappearance . He may have died in Norfolk , Virginia on December 11 , 1811 . Eliza Poe died of tuberculosis on December 8 , 1811 , leaving her three children as orphans . 
 During their mother 's illness , Henry had been left in the care of his paternal grandparents , while Edgar and Rosalie had been cared for by actor friends of their parents , namely Mr. and Mrs. Luke Usher . The children were likely at Eliza 's side as she died . In one of his poems , Henry described her " long ... last farewell " to them and was given a lock of her hair to remember her . After the death of Eliza , the three children were split up . Henry went back to his grandparents in Baltimore , Maryland while Edgar went to live with a foster family , the Allans of Richmond . Rosalie was adopted by the Mackenzies , also of Richmond . 
 Henry was raised by his grandparents , Elizabeth Cairnes Poe and David Poe , Sr. David Poe , Sr. had been a quartermaster in the American Revolutionary War and paid for supplies out of his own pocket , including $ 500 for clothing for the troops . His commitment had earned the respect and friendship of the Marquis de LaFayette and the honorary title of " General " . David Poe , Sr. died in 1816 , and his wife , Elizabeth Cairnes Poe , though sickly and bedridden , outlived her grandson and died on July 7 , 1835 . 
 Henry kept in touch with his younger brother Edgar sporadically as they grew up , often through letters but once he even visited Edgar in Richmond in the 1820s . There , Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart , Sarah Elmira Royster . Edgar 's foster @-@ father John Allan also corresponded with Henry . In one letter , dated November 1 , 1824 , Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry , complaining that his foster @-@ son " had little else to do , for he does nothing ... The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us , not a particle of gratitude for all my care and kindness towards him . " 
 Before the age of twenty , Henry served in South America and elsewhere on board the USS Macedonian . As a crewman aboard the Macedonian , a frigate , he also visited the West Indies , the Mediterranean , and Russia . In 1827 , he returned to Baltimore to live with his grandmother , his aunt Maria Clemm , and his two cousins Henry Clemm and Virginia Clemm . Around this time , Henry was described as a " slim , feeble , young man with dark inexpressive eyes " who possessed a " singular personal beauty " . 
 = = = Writings = = = 
 In Baltimore , while working at a law office , Henry developed his interest in writing . He wrote verse inspired by Lord Byron into the albums of local young women and gave recitations . The May 19 , 1827 , issue of Baltimore 's North American , or , Weekly Journal of Politics , Science , and Literature published Henry 's " Dreams " , a poem which laments the difference between the dream world and reality . The October 27 issue of the same periodical published Henry 's short story " The Pirate " , a fictionalization of his brother 's love affair with Royster . The main character was named Edgar Leonard , a combination of the names of the two brothers , who pursues a woman named Rosalie , a name borrowed from their sister . The Edgar Leonard character says : " I lost my parents at an early age ... and was left to the care of a relation . " 
 One of Henry 's poems , titled " Original " , was virtually identical to one of Edgar 's early poems published in Tamerlane and Other Poems , now known as " The Happiest Day , The Happiest Hour " . It is likely that this poem and another called " Dreams " were Edgar 's and incorrectly credited to Henry . Edgar wrote " The Happiest Day , The Happiest Hour " while he was serving in the Army . He sent the poem to Henry , who had it published in the September 15 , 1827 , issue of the North American , which included Henry 's name . 
 Another poem published by Henry was " Lines on a Pocket Book " , in which he considers John Allan 's accusations that younger sister Rosalie Poe was illegitimate . Henry 's poems generally have themes of melancholy , despair , and feature women who die and abandon their loved ones who dream of their reunion . Many are so similar to Poe 's early work that they may have been collaborative efforts . His writing career ended in 1827 when the North American Review ceased publication . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Henry , who was a heavy drinker and may have been an alcoholic , died of tuberculosis on August 1 , 1831 , in Baltimore , likely in the same room or even the same bed which he shared with his brother Edgar . He was twenty @-@ four . Henry was buried at what is now Westminster Hall and Burying Ground , where his brother would be buried several years later . Henry 's obituary misspelled his name as " W. H. Hope " . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Edgar Allan Poe was very close to his brother , as he wrote : " there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother — it is not so much that they love one another as that they both love the same parent . " Edgar occasionally used the alias " Henri Le Rennet " , a French version of his older brother 's name . He was also inspired by his brother Henry 's travels , often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story . The character of August Barnard in Edgar 's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket ( 1838 ) seems to be inspired by Henry , especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking . Poe may have also transformed his brother 's name into the title character in his poem " Lenore " . 
 = Cortina d 'Ampezzo = 
 Cortina d 'Ampezzo ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Ladin : <unk> , <unk> ) , commonly referred to as Cortina , is a town and comune in the heart of the southern ( Dolomitic ) Alps in the Veneto region of Northern Italy . Situated on the Boite river , in an alpine valley , it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails , scenery , accommodation , shops and <unk> @-@ ski scene , and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd . 
 In the Middle Ages , Ampezzo fell under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia , and of the Holy Roman Empire . In 1420 , it was conquered by the Republic of Venice . It then spent much of its history under Austrian rule , briefly undergoing some territorial changes under Napoleon , before being returned to Austria , who held it until 1918 . From the nineteenth century , Ampezzo became a notable regional centre for crafts . The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German holidaymakers as tourism emerged late nineteenth century . Among the specializations of the town were crafting wood for furniture , the production of tiled stoves and iron , copper and glass items . Today , the local economy thrives on tourism , particularly during the winter season , when the population of the town typically increases from about 7 @,@ 000 to 40 @,@ 000 . The Basilica Minore dei Santi Filippo e Giacomo was built between 1769 and 1775 on the site of two former thirteenth and sixteenth @-@ century churches ; it is home to the parish and the deanery of Cortina d 'Ampezzo . The town also contains the Rinaldo Zardini Palaeontology Museum , established in 1975 , the Mario Rimoldi Modern Art Museum , and the Regole of Ampezzo Ethnographic Museum . 
 Although Cortina was unable to go ahead with the scheduled 1944 Winter Olympics because of the Second World War , it hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956 and subsequently a number of world winter @-@ sports events . The town is home to SG Cortina , a top league professional ice hockey team , and Cortina is also the start and end point of the annual Dolomites Gold Cup Race . Several films have been shot in the town , mostly notably The Pink Panther ( 1963 ) , For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) and Cliffhanger ( 1993 ) . Every year , from the end of July to early August , Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy , which attracts pianists from around the world .

 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 The discovery in 1987 of a primitive tomb at <unk> de Sora high up in the mountains to the south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area as far back as the 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C. , Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore , in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century . From the 3rd century B.C. , the Romans assimilated the Veneti people , giving the area the name of <unk> ( from amplus meaning wide ) , today 's Ampezzo . 
 = = = Middle Ages to 19th century = = = 
 No historical information exists on the Cadore region from the fall of the Roman Empire until the Lombard period . It is assumed that during the Barbarian invasions , the inhabitants fled to the Fassa , Badia , <unk> and Ampezzo valleys . 
 In the Middle Ages , Ampezzo fell under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia , and of the Holy Roman Empire . In 1420 , the village was conquered by the Republic of Venice . In 1508 it was conquered by Austria , and by 1511 people of Ampezzo swore loyalty to the Emperor Maximilian , and is subsequently fell to the <unk> . In 1797 , when the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed , Napoleon initially permitted Austria to retain it , but in 1810 he added Ampezzo to the Department of Piave , following an attack on the town in which it was burned by the French . It was short @-@ lived ; Austria reclaimed it in 1813 , and it remained in Austrian possession even after the battles of <unk> and <unk> in 1866 when Venice was ceded to Italy . The town gained a reputation as a health resort ; it was reportedly free of diseases such as cholera . 
 In 1874 the Ampezzo forest became the property of the <unk> Woods Consortium . Although remaining a Habsburg possession until 1920 , aside from being home for an ethnic German @-@ speaking minority , Ampezzo never became a German @-@ speaking territory and conserved its original language , Ladin , a <unk> @-@ Romance language . 
 Until 1918 , the town came under the Austrian monarchy ( in Austrian region after the compromise of 1867 ) , head of the district of Ampezzo , one of the 21 <unk> in the Tyrol province . The coat of arms features a tower flanked by two trees , with a two @-@ headed eagle flying above .

 When Italy entered World War I in 1915 , most of the male inhabitants were fighting for Austria on the Russian front . 669 male inhabitants ( most of them under 16 or over 50 ) tried to fight the Italian troops . Outnumbered by the Italians , they had to retreat . After the Austrian recovery in 1917 , the town was occupied again by the Tyrolean <unk> . Following Italy 's victory in World War I , Ampezzo was finally given to Italy in 1923 . 
 After the war the city was renamed " Cortina d 'Ampezzo " ( Curtain of the Ampezzo Valley ) , adopting the name of one of the six villages that made up the territory of Ampezzo , located in the middle of the Ampezzo valley . 
 Already an elite destination for the first British tourists in the late 18th and early 20th century , after World War I Cortina d 'Ampezzo became a popular resort for upper @-@ class Italians too . Cortina d 'Ampezzo was chosen as the venue of the 1944 winter Olympics , which did not take place due to World War II . Thanks to finally hosting the winter Olympics in 1956 , Cortina grew into a world @-@ famous resort , with a substantial increase in tourists . With a resident population of 6 @,@ 150 people in 2008 , Cortina has a temporary population of around 50 @,@ 000 during peak periods such as the Christmas holidays and mid @-@ August .

 The town voted in October 2007 to secede from the region of Veneto and join the neighbouring region , Trentino @-@ Alto Adige / <unk> . This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin @-@ speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes . The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino @-@ Alto Adige . 
 In the European elections of 2014 , the leading party was the Democratic Party with 30 @.@ 4 % of the vote , followed by Forza Italia ( 19 @.@ 4 % ) and the autonomous <unk> <unk> with 14 @.@ 1 % . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Cortina is situated more or less in the centre of the Ampezzo valley , at the top of the Valle del Boite in the Dolomites , which encircle the town . The Boite river flows directly through the town of Cortina itself . The mountains in the area are described as " craggy " and " soaring " , " unmistakable ; like a massive coral reef ripped from the sea , strung with conifers and laced with snow " . The town is positioned between Cadore ( to the south ) and the <unk> Valley ( to the north ) , Val d <unk> ( to the east ) and <unk> ( to the west ) . Originally it consisted of numerous <unk> , isolated villages and hamlets , but from the 1950s it grew rapidly as a result of tourism . Only the most remote villages have remained isolated from the main town . San Vito di Cadore is 9 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) to the south of Cortina d 'Ampezzo . 
 Among the surrounding mountains are <unk> to the west , <unk> to the north , <unk> to the northeast , Faloria and <unk> to the east , and <unk> di <unk> , <unk> da Lago and Cinque Torri to the south . The town centre is located at an elevation of 1 @,@ 224 metres ( 4 @,@ 016 ft ) , although the highest summit is that of the Tofana di Mezzo , which towers at 3 @,@ 244 metres ( 10 @,@ 643 ft ) . There are numerous fast flowing rivers , streams and small lakes in the territory , such as the Ghedina , <unk> and d <unk> , which fill particularly during the summer snow @-@ melt season . Fauna include marmots , roe deer , chamois and hares and , on occasion , wolves , bears and lynx .

 The <unk> climate is typically alpine , with short summers and long winters that vacillate between frigid , snowy , unsettled , and temperate . In late December and early January , some of Italy 's lowest recorded temperatures are to be found in the region , especially at the top of the <unk> Pass on the border between the provinces of Belluno and Bolzano . The other seasons are generally rainy , cold , and very windy .

 In addition to Italian , the majority of the population speak fluent <unk> , a local variant of Ladin , now recognized as a language rather than a dialect . Ladin comes from Latin ( like Italian , French and Spanish ) and resembles Romansh which is spoken in Switzerland . Maintaining the local language , which is not only spoken by the older people but also by many of Cortina 's younger inhabitants , has become a symbol of their attachment to the local mountainous heritage . The community is also proud of its Ladin or Tyrolean culture , which continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years . Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages , in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999 .

 From the nineteenth century , Ampezzo became a notable regional centre for crafts . The growing importance of this sector led the Austrian Ministry of Commerce to authorize the opening of a State Industrial School in 1874 , which later became the Art Institute . It became a reputable institution in teaching wood and metal work , admitted boys from the age of 13 and up to four years of study . The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German holidaymakers as tourism emerged late nineteenth century . Some of the local items were said to have mythical qualities ; the Austrian journalist and anthropologist Karl Felix Wolff , for example , stated in 1935 that according to legend a local man " once made a sword that was so flexible that you could bend it over , tie it up , and then allow it to straighten out again " . Among the specializations of the town were crafting wood for furniture , the production of tiled stoves and iron , copper and glass items . 
 Today , the local economy thrives on tourism , particularly during the winter season , when the population of the town typically increases from about 7 @,@ 000 to 40 @,@ 000 . Lonely Planet refers to Cortina d 'Ampezzo as " one of Italy 's most famous , fashionable and expensive ski resorts " , which " boasts first @-@ class facilities ( skiing , skating , sledding , climbing ) and superb hiking " . 
 Cortina is home to some of the most prestigious names in fashion , including Bulgari , Benetton , Gucci and Geox , and various artisan shops , antiquarians , and craft stores . It is also home to many stores specializing in mountaineering equipment . The symbol of Cortina shopping remains La Cooperativa di Cortina , founded on June 28 , 1893 as <unk> Ampezzo . In this shopping centre many trades can be found , from confectioners to newspaper vendors , toys , gift shops , skiing stores and blacksmiths . The building is divided into three levels ( more a raised plan and a balcony ) . The cooperative in Cortina was one of the first cooperatives founded in the Italian Peninsula , and currently provides employment to approximately 200 people .

On the ceiling are three frescoes by Luigi Ghedina : " Christ Purifying the Temple " , " The Martyrdom of St. Philip and " The <unk> of St. James " . The Chiesa della Madonna della <unk> was built in 1750 on the site of a ruined fourteenth century building . Its façade features an intricate fresco depicting the Madonna della <unk> , and the interior is decorated with a wealth of statues , paintings , polychrome marble and gold leaf . 
 The Cappella della Beata <unk> di Lourdes ( Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes ) was completed in 1907 . Decorated by artist Corrado <unk> of the Val Gardena , it is a small church of particular interest given the reconstruction sculpture . The Cappella di Sant 'Antonio da Padova in the village of <unk> was completed in 1791 but the interior was renovated in 1809 after serious fire damage caused by the Napoleonic troops . The furnishings include two wooden busts ( Christ and St Catherine ) and a richly worked altar . 
 <unk> militare di Pocol ( also known as <unk> di Pocol ) is a cemetery and shrine located at an altitude of 1 @,@ 535 metres ( 5 @,@ 036 ft ) towards Passo <unk> , in the locality of Pocol . The small church and cemetery was built in 1916 as a military cemetery by the 5th Alpine group . A shrine was built in 1935 as memorial to the thousands who lost their lives during World War I on the Dolomite front . It is a massive square tower of stone , clearly visible from the entire Ampezzo valley below . In a crypt in the centre of the structure rests the body of general Antonio <unk> , who was awarded the gold medal for military valor .

 The Castello de Zanna is a small fortress , situated in the frazione of Majon . It consists of low white outer walls and two white corner towers , with a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity . The construction of the castle began in 1694 , but on August 19 , 1696 the works were interrupted ; the building remained unfinished in 1809 when it was burned by French revolutionary troops who had invaded Ampezzo . Since then the castle has undergone restoration . 
 Forte Tre Sassi ( or Forte Tra i Sassi ) is a fortress constructed in 1897 during the Austro @-@ Hungarian period on the Passo <unk> . It lies between Sass de <unk> and Piccolo Lagazuoi , dominating the passage between the Passo <unk> and Val Badia in South Tyrol ( Alto Adige ) . It was part of the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century . Rendered unusable due to a bombing by the Italians on 5 July 1915 , the ruins remained in a state of disrepair until the advent of the 21st century , when it was restored by the local administration of Ampezzo , with the assistance of the Lacedelli family . The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War . 
 Castello di <unk> ( also known as <unk> ) was a medieval fort perched on a rock in the valley of the river Boite , a little further north of Cortina , in the town of Prà del <unk> . It is believed that it was first erected as a stakeout during conflict with the Lombards between the seventh and eighth centuries , with the aim of dominating the three valleys that converge beneath it : the Boite , the Val di <unk> and the Val <unk> . The corner stone , however , probably dates to the 11th century . It was held by the Germans until 1077 , and then by the patriarchs of Aquileia ( 12th century ) and Camino ( 13th century ) , until <unk> became the seat of a captaincy . It then passed into Venetian hands and finally to the Habsburgs . During the eighteenth century the castle lost importance gradually , until it was auctioned in 1782 by order of Emperor Joseph II . Today the fort has now almost completely disappeared ; only the remnants of what must have been the wine cellars and the foundations remain , now weathered and largely covered up by vegetation .

 Cortina has a long tradition in hosting writers , intellectuals , poets and editors from all over the world . Ernest Hemingway , Saul Bellow , Dino <unk> , as well as Vittorio Gassman , Leonardo Sciascia , Leonardo Mondadori and many others , spent their vacations in the town and took part in the cultural life of the city . Through the years , this led to a continuous activity of literature festivals and book presentations , like Una Montagna di Libri ( " A Mountain of Books " ) , held twice a year since 2009 . The festival attracted to Cortina writers as Azar <unk> , Peter Cameron , Emmanuel Carrère . 
 Music is important to the locals of Cortina , with a guitar found in most houses , and young musicians are often found walking the streets . Every year , from the end of July to early August , Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy . It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani ( 1941 – 1974 ) who died when he was only 32 . The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world 's leading performers . The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August . Cortina 's own band , parading in traditional costumes , is a central attraction dating back to 1861 . Cortina d 'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest , won by Marcella Mariani . Traditionally , on the eves of the festivals of Ascension , Pentecost , Trinity and St Philip and St James , the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires . 
 After Ernest Hemingway 's wife Hadley lost a suitcase filled with Hemingway 's manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon in Paris , he took a time off . He began writing that same year in Cortina d 'Ampezzo , writing Out of Season . 
 The dominant religion in the comune of Cortina d 'Ampezzo is Roman Catholicism . Among the religious minorities , mainly a result of recent immigration , there is a small community of Orthodox Christians and Muslims . There is also a congregation of Jehovah 's Witnesses , which has its headquarters in Pian da Lago . 
 The surroundings of Cortina have been the location for a number of movies , including mountain climbing scenes for Cliffhanger , Krull and The Pink Panther . The resort was the primary area for location shooting in Sergio Corbucci 's Revisionist Spaghetti Western The Great Silence ; the resort was used to represent Utah in the winter of 1898 . It was also a major location for the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only . Aside from Roger Moore 's James Bond meeting the character Luigi Ferrara ( John Moreno ) at the peak of Tofana , and a stay at the Hotel <unk> , a number of action sequences were shot in the town involving Bond and Erich Kriegler ( John Wyman ) , as Kriegler competes in the biathlon . The battle culminates in one of the famous ski chase sequences in film , where Bond has to escape Kriegler and a crew of assassins on a spike @-@ wheeled motorcycles , his route taking them all onto the bobsleigh run . The actual town centre was also the scene of the first attack on Bond and his partner Melina Havelock ( Carole Bouquet ) by two motorcyclists who attempted to run them over , only for Bond to eliminate them both , putting one of them through the window of a local florist .

 Cortina d 'Ampezzo was the host town of the 1956 Winter Olympics . The 1944 Winter Olympics were also scheduled to be held in Cortina , but were cancelled because of World War II . The 1927 Nordic , 1941 Nordic and 1941 Alpine World Skiing Championships were held in Cortina as well , although the 1941 Nordic championships were withdrawn by the FIS in 1946 . The region lost the bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics to Calgary , Canada and the 1992 Winter Olympics to Albertville , France . 
 The town is home to SG Cortina , a professional ice hockey team currently playing in the country 's top division , Serie A1 . Cortina is also the start and end point of the annual Dolomites Gold Cup Race , a historic <unk> event for production cars on public roads . The town hosted the Red Bull Road Rage in 2009 . 
 Cortina also offers excellent skiing facilities for amateurs , thanks to its central position among the 12 resorts of the <unk> <unk> area . Cortina itself has 115 km ( 71 mi ) of ski pistes with 34 ski lifts and guaranteed snow coverage of over 95 % from December to April . There are six ski schools ( two for cross @-@ country ) and some 300 instructors . The Faloria @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ski @-@ area with spectacular views over the Ampezzo Valley is suitable for skiers of all levels including children . The <unk> area offers more challenging opportunities from an altitude of 2 @,@ 500 m ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) with the <unk> and Schuss ski runs . The longest and most spectacular ski run , the <unk> piste in the Lagazuoi @-@ 5 Torri area , starts next to the Lagazuoi refuge at a height of 2 @,@ 752 m ( 9 @,@ 029 ft ) and can be reached by cable car . 
 Facilities also exist for cross @-@ country skiing , including a long stretch of the old railway line . In and around Cortina , there are opportunities to participate in many other winter sports such as curling , ski mountaineering , snowboarding , sledding and extreme skiing . In the summer months , sports include trekking , biking , rock climbing , tennis , golf , swimming and ice skiing .

 Cortina Airport was built for the 1956 Winter Olympics , but is currently closed . The town has its own bus service , connecting the centre to surrounding villages and cable car lifts . The nearest airports are those serving Venice : the distance to Treviso is 138 km ( 86 mi ) while that to Venice Marco Polo Airport is 148 km ( 92 mi ) . Both can be reached in about two and a quarter hours by road . The railway station for Cortina is Calalzo di Cadore , 37 km ( 23 mi ) to the south east , with rail connections to Venice and a bus service to Cortina . The total journey time to Venice is about three and a half hours . There are also direct bus links from Venice Mestre and Padova railway stations , coordinated with the arrivals and departures of Eurostar trains . 
 Cortina was the principal intermediate station on the narrow @-@ gauge ( <unk> ) Dolomites Railway from Calalzo to Toblach . When the line was electrified in 1929 the only sub @-@ station was established at Cortina . The line closed in 1964 but in February 2016 the regional governments of Veneto and Trentino @-@ Alto Adige announced that they are to commission a feasibility study to build a new line between Calalzo , Cortina and Toblach .

 = Hurricane Ernesto ( 2006 ) = 
 Hurricane Ernesto was the costliest tropical cyclone of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season . The sixth tropical storm and first hurricane of the season , Ernesto developed from a tropical wave on August 24 in the eastern Caribbean Sea . Ernesto first affected the northern Caribbean , reaching minimal hurricane status near Haiti before weakening and moving across eastern Cuba as a tropical storm . Despite initial predictions for it to track through the eastern Gulf of Mexico as a major hurricane , Ernesto moved across eastern Florida as a weak tropical storm . After turning to the northeast , it re @-@ intensified and made landfall on August 31 on the North Carolina coast just below hurricane status . Late the next day , Ernesto became extratropical after entering southern Virginia . The remnants spread moisture across the northeastern United States before dissipating over eastern Canada on September 4 . 
 The deaths of at least eleven people were attributed to Ernesto , which dumped heavy rains throughout its path , especially in the Mid @-@ Atlantic region of the United States . While moving across the Caribbean , it affected several countries , and initially Ernesto posed a threat to the Gulf Coast of the United States around the one @-@ year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina . Damage in Virginia was estimated at over $ 118 million ( 2006 USD ) , prompting the declaration of a federal disaster area . Total damage in the United States was estimated at $ 500 million ( 2006 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 18 , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa . It tracked westward , and its convection began organizing and concentrating on August 22 . The next day , convection increased along the wave axis , and Dvorak classifications from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch of the National Hurricane Center began at 1200 UTC on August 23 . As it approached the Lesser Antilles , a surface low developed , and with the confirmation of a closed low @-@ level circulation from the Hurricane Hunters , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Five on August 24 about 50 mi ( 80 km ) north @-@ northwest of Grenada . 
 Located to the south of a ridge across the southwestern Atlantic Ocean , the depression tracked west @-@ northwestward through an area of dry air and westerly wind shear . Despite the shear , convection intensified near the center as banding features improved , and on August 24 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto . Convection deepened and expanded , though wind shear displaced the low @-@ level center to the west of the convection . By August 26 , the structure had become much better @-@ defined , and within five days Ernesto was forecast to be located about 275 mi ( 445 km ) south of the Gulf Coast of the United States as a powerful hurricane . The center reformed under the deepest convection after wind shear decreased , and at the same time outflow increased in all quadrants . Turning northwestward , a small eye formed , and early on August 27 Ernesto attained hurricane status about 95 mi ( 200 km ) south @-@ southwest of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic . 
 Upon becoming a hurricane , Ernesto was believed to be undergoing rapid intensification . However , the small inner core deteriorated as the circulation interacted with the mountainous terrain of southwest Haiti , and it quickly weakened back to tropical storm status . The center became broad and ill @-@ defined , though it was forecast to re @-@ intensify to hurricane status before striking Cuba . It continued to weaken due to land interaction , and early on August 28 Ernesto passed just offshore of the southwestern tip of Haiti with winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . Hindered by increased wind shear from an upper @-@ level low over the Bahamas , the storm weakened further before striking just west of Guantánamo Bay in Cuba as a minimal tropical storm . With very warm water temperatures and a favorable upper @-@ level environment , one forecast remarked the possibility of Ernesto strengthening greatly over the Straits of Florida and eastern Gulf of Mexico to hit western Florida as a major hurricane . Ernesto remained over land as a minimal tropical storm for about 18 hours before reaching the Straits of Florida . Convection gradually increased over the warm waters , though Ernesto failed to strengthen significantly due to its disrupted inner core . An eastward @-@ moving high pressure system over the southeastern United States allowed a continued northwest movement , and at 0300 UTC on August 30 the storm struck Plantation Key in the upper Florida Keys with winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . Two hours later , Ernesto made landfall on the Florida mainland in southwestern Miami @-@ Dade County . 
 Moving through a weakness in the subtropical ridge , the storm turned to the north through the state . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center downgraded Ernesto to tropical depression status while over the state , though post @-@ analysis indicated the system maintained tropical storm status . Ernesto retained a well @-@ organized cloud pattern over land , and after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral , convection again increased and began wrapping into the circulation . Upon reaching the Atlantic Ocean , Ernesto accelerated north @-@ northeastward ahead of an approaching deep layer trough . The convection increased as the storm strengthened over warm waters , and late on August 31 Ernesto attained an intensity of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) while located about 170 mi ( 270 km ) south @-@ southwest of Wilmington , North Carolina . Shortly prior to moving ashore , an eye began to develop , and early on September 1 the storm made landfall on Oak Island , North Carolina very near the threshold between tropical storm and hurricane status . The National Hurricane Center remarked the possibility that Ernesto could have been a hurricane at landfall , due to the possibility that the strongest maximum wind was not sampled . 
 After landfall the storm rapidly weakened , and about eight hours after moving ashore , Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status . Interacting with a pre @-@ existing frontal zone that extended eastward through Virginia , Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics , and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . It re @-@ intensified to a gale over the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania . With a large high pressure area to its east , the remnants turned to the north @-@ northwest , reaching southern Ontario on September 3 . After turning northeastward , the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4 .

 About nine hours after Ernesto became a tropical storm , the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country . As the storm strengthened , the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning , and about 15 hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning . Several low @-@ lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20 inches ( 500 mm ) of rain in some mountainous areas . Additionally , authorities advised residents in shantytowns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters . 
 Jamaican officials issued radio and television advisories for residents in low @-@ lying areas , urging them to be ready and evacuate if necessary . The Jamaican government opened all shelters on the island and placed its armed forces on standby . Long lines for storm supplies were reported at local businesses ahead of the storm as residents rushed to obtain supplies in preparation for Ernesto 's onslaught . When a tropical storm warning was put in effect for Jamaica and the central Bahamas , cruise ship companies indicated they were diverting several liners to avoid the storm . 
 Hurricane warnings were put in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba , where significant precipitation ranging up to 20 inches ( 500 mm ) across the mountainous south was expected as the center of Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba . Cuban officials evacuated 300 @,@ 000 people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors . The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm , urging precautions . Cattle were moved to higher ground , tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma , and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day . The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled .

 On August 26 , about four days prior to Ernesto striking the state , the government of Florida activated its Emergency Operations Center , while the National Guard was placed on standby , following a " warning order " to its commanders . On August 27 , the Governor of Florida , Jeb Bush , issued a state of emergency because of the high risk of impact from Ernesto on the state . Officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for all visitors and non @-@ residents in the Florida Keys about three days before the storm passed through the area . Mandatory evacuations were later issued for mobile homes and low @-@ lying areas of Monroe , Broward , St. Lucie , and Martin counties ; voluntary evacuations were also issued for barrier islands in Miami @-@ Dade and Palm Beach counties . On August 28 , forecasters issued a hurricane watch for southern Florida through the Florida Keys . When Ernesto was downgraded to tropical storm status , Governor Jeb Bush urged Florida residents to continue preparations and not wait until it regained hurricane status , as it was forecast to do by the National Hurricane Center . At least 30 shelters were opened , and tolls on four turnpike were lifted . Several schools were closed across southern Florida . The threat of the storm caused NASA to postpone the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center to avoid risking damage from the storm . 
 The storm was initially expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina , Rita , and Wilma in the previous year , which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed . There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina 's one @-@ year anniversary , and that the levees in New Orleans might not be able to withstand a strong storm surge . Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not . A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields , as well as tension with Iran , caused the price of oil to increase , although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded . 
 On August 29 , a hurricane watch was issued from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear , North Carolina . The next day , the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning , which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla , North Carolina before the storm moved ashore . In South Carolina , voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties . 
 On August 31 before the storm 's arrival , Virginia Governor Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency , putting the Virginia National Guard and state agencies on alert and opening the state 's new Emergency Operations Center in suburban Richmond . North Carolina Governor Mike Easley activated 200 National Guard troops and had other emergency teams on standby . Washington D.C. and parts of Maryland and Delaware were put on a Coastal Flood Watch and Flash Flood Watch by the National Weather Service in preparation for Ernesto .

 Shortly before Ernesto developed into a tropical cyclone , the precursor tropical wave produced sustained winds of 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) in Barbados in association with a convective downburst . On the island , the winds downed some trees , and some flooding was reported . Strong winds and rough seas damaged six fishing boats in the southern portion of the island . Squalls in Trinidad left about 12 people injured after winds destroyed several tents . Also on Trinidad , the system produced widespread flooding , which resulted in some crop damage . 
 Puerto Rico experienced peripheral rainfall from the cyclone as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea . A two @-@ day storm total of 4 @.@ 69 inches ( 119 mm ) occurred in Sabana Grande . 
 In the Dominican Republic , heavy rainfall caused river flooding and mudslides , resulting in damage to several houses . The highest rainfall report noted was 7 @.@ 01 inches ( 178 mm ) at Barahona . The rainfall also downed trees , and caused flooding to enter over 400 houses near Santo Domingo , which forced the evacuation of over 1 @,@ 600 people . In Haiti , the storm caused heavy rainfall of over 11 inches ( 300 mm ) and strong winds , causing flooding and destroying 13 homes on the island of La <unk> . In Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , rainfall severely damaged a bridge , isolating the southern portion of the region . Across the country , 59 homes were damaged , of which six destroyed , and a total of five deaths were reported . 
 Ernesto produced heavy rainfall in eastern Cuba , with Guantanamo reporting 3 inches ( 75 mm ) in four hours . Gusty winds left some towns in the Camagüey Province without power , though overall damage was minor . There were no reports from Cuba of deaths , injuries , or major damage attributed to the storm . 
 = = = Southeastern United States = = = 
 In the Florida Keys , Ernesto produced tropical storm force wind gusts and light rainfall , causing minor flooding . Upon making landfall in southern Florida , the storm produced a storm tide of about 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) above astronomical tide levels , though no beach erosion was reported . Winds were fairly minor across the state , reaching 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) at a station on Lake Okeechobee . Ernesto dropped heavy rainfall across southwest Florida , with a state maximum of 8 @.@ 72 inches ( 221 mm ) recorded at South Golden Gate . The rainfall caused the <unk> Creek to overflow , and some flooding also occurred in portions of Collier County . Floodwaters entered at least 13 homes in Palmdale . The storm resulted in more than 150 canceled flights at Orlando International Airport , stranding several travelers . While moving through the state , Ernesto spawned two F0 tornadoes in Osceola County . One person died in each in Broward and Miami @-@ Dade counties from traffic accidents ; the deaths are considered indirectly related to Ernesto . Overall damage in the state was minor . 
 Passing to the east of Georgia , the storm produced light winds and rainfall near the coast . In South Carolina , the storm brought over 7 inches ( 175 mm ) of precipitation to North Myrtle Beach , which caused ponding on roadways . Winds were generally light , peaking at around 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) , which caused isolated power outages ; about 2 @,@ 700 people across the state lost power . Near Charleston , the passage of the storm caused moderate flooding that left some roads closed . No significant damage was reported in the state . 
 Tropical Storm Ernesto made landfall in Brunswick County in the southern portion of North Carolina , producing a moderate storm surge along the Pamlico River which forced several evacuations . The storm surge reached 4 – 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 8 m ) in Beaufort County , flooding many homes and businesses . Just east of where it moved ashore , the storm dropped 14 @.@ 6 inches ( 371 mm ) of rainfall in Wrightsville Beach ; this was the highest rainfall total associated with Ernesto in the United States . Much of the eastern portion of the state received over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) of precipitation , and in the northeastern portion of the state , the precipitation caused flash flooding . The rainfall caused freshwater flooding in low @-@ lying areas , as well as along major and minor roadways ; the floodwaters left a 12 mi ( 19 km ) portion of Interstate 40 closed in <unk> County . Subsequent to the storm 's passage , the rainfall caused severe river flooding , with many streams and rivers overflowing their banks for several days . The Northeast Cape Fear River at Chinquapin remained in major flood stage for a week , flooding about 300 homes . 
 The storm moved ashore just below hurricane strength , though wind gusts near the coast were generally around 40 – 60 mph ( 65 – 95 km / h ) . Gusts peaked at 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) in Wilmington , and the strong winds downed trees and power lines across the coastal region ; about 69 @,@ 000 people were left without power . Minor property damage was caused by three tornadoes spawned by the storm in eastern North Carolina . The passage of the storm caused a traffic fatality in the state . Overall damage was estimated at $ 80 million ( 2006 USD ) , all but $ 4 million of which from crop damage .

 Ernesto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered southern Virginia , bringing heavy rainfall which peaked at 10 @.@ 6 inches ( 270 mm ) in Wakefield . The precipitation caused flash flooding , which closed several roads but did not cause serious damage . The interaction between Ernesto and a strong ridge over the western Atlantic produced a tight pressure gradient , resulting in strong winds across the state ; wind gusts peaked at 87 mph ( 141 km / h ) at a station near the mouth of the York River . Strong winds downed numerous trees , including in Gloucester where two people died after a tree hit their home . The winds caused widespread power outages ; Dominion Virginia Power reported about 600 @,@ 000 customers as losing power some time during the storm . The storm produced a storm tide of 6 @.@ 12 feet ( 1 @.@ 86 m ) near Virginia Beach ; along the Chesapeake Bay , tidal flooding in combination with strong waves damaged boats and piers , and left a few homes flooded . Storm surge flooding also occurred along the Potomac River , with heavy beach erosion , light property damage , and flooded roadways reported in Alexandria . Across the state , the storm damaged or destroyed 609 houses , with damage totaling at least $ 118 million ( 2006 USD ) . Seven people were killed in the state , of which two directly to the storm ; three of the deaths were from traffic accidents , and one person died from carbon monoxide poisoning , due to operating a power generator inside after a power outage . 
 In Washington , D.C. , the storm produced wind gusts of up to 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) which , in combination with heavy rainfall , resulted in a few downed tree branches and power lines . High tides left moderate damage in St. Mary 's County , Maryland of about $ 4 @.@ 4 million ( 2006 USD ) , with the damage to trees and power lines considered worse than the impact in Hurricane Isabel in 2003 . In neighboring Charles County , storm surge flooding forced the evacuations of houses along the waterfront . The interaction between Ernesto and a high pressure area over eastern Canada produced high winds , heavy rainfall , tidal flooding , and high waves across the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England . In Delaware , the winds left 151 @,@ 000 people without power , and the adverse conditions canceled several Labor Day Weekend events . A buoy in the Delaware Bay recorded a record @-@ high wave height of 22 @.@ 3 ft ( 6 @.@ 8 m ) . In southern New Jersey , 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) winds left over 200 @,@ 000 buildings without power , while high waves flooded or closed several roads and bridges . Further north , between 2 @-@ 4 inches ( 50 – 100 mm ) of rain fell across Pennsylvania and New York . In Pennsylvania , there were two deaths . A seven @-@ year @-@ old boy died at a hospital , after a tree limb fell on him . A man was trying to rescue his golden retriever from a drainage steam , while he was sucked into an outflow pipe , and was found dead after being pulled out of a manhole . The rain in New York caused delays in the play at the 2006 U.S. Open , and washed out a whole day 's play . 
 The extratropical remnants of Ernesto moved across southern Ontario , dropping moderate rainfall of up to 2 @.@ 1 inches ( 54 mm ) . Wind gusts reached 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) near Toronto , and the winds in combination with the rainfall caused power outages when lines snapped . Hundreds were left without power , though the outages were quickly restored .

 On September 22 , following a request from Virginia governor Tim Kaine , President George W. Bush declared 19 counties in Virginia as disaster areas , along with the cities of Richmond and Poquoson . The declaration allocated federal funding to assist in paying for debris removal and the rebuilding of public infrastructure damaged by Ernesto 's flooding , including roads , parks , and government buildings . The city of Newport News and four additional counties were added later in the areas eligible for federal funding . In all , FEMA provided about $ 7 @.@ 3 million ( 2006 USD ) in assistance . Although the state of Virginia applied for individual assistance , the federal government denied the request . 
 Due to debris and waste being carried into waterways by flooding from Ernesto , Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to <unk> for four days from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge @-@ Tunnel to the mouth of the Potomac River . In Richmond , officials condemned 70 homes , prompting city workers to establish temporary homes . By five days after the storm 's passage through the state , most of the 600 @,@ 000 people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored . Dominion Resources 's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected , requiring 2 – 3 days to restore all areas . By two days after the storm moved through the area , all major roadways were opened , though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris . 
 Outside of Virginia , the Emergency Operation Centers in Pennsylvania , Delaware , and the District of Columbia were closed . Power crews worked to restore electricity to the affected areas across the region . 
 = Texas State Highway 211 = 
 State Highway 211 or SH 211 ( Hill Country Parkway ) is a 11 @.@ 184 @-@ mile ( 17 @.@ 999 km ) state highway west of the city of San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas . This route was designated in 1986 as an access route to the Texas Research Park . Portions of the route were built , but significant landowner opposition kept the connecting section from being completed . The completed sections of the route consist of a southern section from U.S. Highway 90 ( US 90 ) north to Farm to Market Road 1957 ( FM 1957 ) and a northern section from FM 471 north to SH 16 . The Texas Transportation Commission has approved a pass @-@ through toll agreement that Bexar County submitted in October 2008 . This proposal will allow for development of a segment of SH 211 ( Hill Country Parkway ) from 1 @.@ 33 miles south of FM 1957 to FM 471 and improvements to FM 1957 ( Potranco Road ) from Loop 1604 to the Medina County line . The completion of the section between FM 1957 ( Potranco Road ) to FM 471 ( Culebra Road ) will finally allow for seamless travel from Hwy 90 at the south end , north to SH 16 ( Bandera Road ) . The improvements to FM 1957 ( Potranco Road ) will allow for the necessary widening of the two @-@ lane roadway which is dealing with new suburban growth and traffic for which it wasn 't built to handle . 
 = = History = = 
 The current alignment was designated in March 1986 from US 90 northward to SH 16 . In November 1988 , the designation was extended northeastward from SH 16 to FM <unk> . Construction of the current segments of the highway were completed in the early 1990s . The southern portion was the first to be completed with the interchange at US 90 and the bridge over Lucas Creek completed in 1990 . The northern portion was completed the following year in 1991 with the completion of the bridges over San Geronimo Creek . 
 SH 211 was previously designated between 1933 and 1935 on a route from Brenham northward to Independence . This route was transferred in 1942 to Farm to Market Road 50 and State Highway Spur 197 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SH 211 currently exists in two separate sections west of San Antonio . The southern section begins at a diamond interchange with US 90 in western Bexar County . The route travels to the north as a two @-@ lane highway with a northbound passing lane for the majority of the route and is known as either the Texas Research Parkway or the Hill Country Parkway ( once it 's finally completed ) , providing access to the Texas Research Park and a Citi service center . This 3 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) section of the highway ends at FM 1957 just east of the Bexar / Medina county line . 
 The northern section ( Hill Country Parkway ) begins at FM 471 in Medina County and heads north as a two @-@ lane highway , crossing back over into Bexar County and passes briefly through the San Antonio city limits before ending at SH 16 . The northern section of the highway features the occasional passing lane in both directions . This 7 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 11 @.@ 9 km ) section of the roadway includes a design to provide protection to the Edwards Aquifer , the drinking water supply of San Antonio . To prevent runoff from the highway entering the aquifer , a 555 @-@ foot ( 169 m ) long bridge was sealed to prevent it from leaking and an aqueduct was constructed nearby to carry the runoff . 
 There are plans to connect the two segments , but there are insufficient funds available to complete the nearly 8 @-@ mile ( 12 @.@ 9 km ) project and right @-@ of @-@ way needs to be acquired . TxDOT only has $ 7 @.@ 7 million of the $ 30 million required for construction costs . Bexar County will pay for the balance of the project costs with TxDOT reimbursing the County when funds become available . Relocation assistance is being provided to landowners to persuade them to sell their property for the highway . With a shortage of funds and the right @-@ of @-@ way not purchased , there is no time table for construction . Local opposition to the extension cite greater highway needs elsewhere , environmental concerns in the corridor , and a reluctance to sell land needed for the highway as chief concerns of the highway . Once completed , the highway is believed to provide relief to nearby Loop 1604 . 
 The traffic volume of the highway is dramatically different between the southern and northern sections . The southern section sees traffic volumes six times of that of the northern section . The traffic volume of the southern section saw a slight increase from 2005 to 2006 . In 2005 , it had a traffic volume of 6 @,@ 450 annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , which increased to 6 @,@ 700 AADT in 2006 . The traffic volume of the northern section saw a slight increase from 2005 to 2006 as well . In 2005 , it had a traffic volume of 1 @,@ 000 AADT near the southern end of the road and 1 @,@ 300 AADT near the northern end . In 2006 , these numbers had increased to 1 @,@ 050 and 1 @,@ 550 AADT respectively .

 = Nueces Bay = 
 Nueces Bay is a northwestern extension of Corpus Christi Bay in the San Patricio and Nueces counties of Texas . The bay is fed by the Nueces River , forming a natural estuary , which renders it ecologically and economically vital to the surrounding area . It serves as a habitat for the propagation of fish and shellfish , which sustain diverse species of birds and other wildlife . The bay is threatened by pollution from the heavy industry on its southern shore , which prevents oyster farming . Petrochemical production and oil are important to the surrounding economies of the major settlements of Corpus Christi and Portland , found on the eastern shore and connected by the Nueces Bay Causeway at the bay 's confluence with Corpus Christi Bay . 
 Agriculture dominates the northern shore , where many plots of land are still owned by the descendants of early settlers . The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area . To the west , the Odem Bay extension is formed , and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta . Just south of the mouth , are the remains of the abandoned Nuecestown settlement , which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits . 
 = = History = = 
 Nueces Bay formed approximately 9 @,@ 000 years ago , as the sea level rose at the conclusion of the last ice age . The sea level stabilized 6 @,@ 000 years later , shaping the present @-@ day Nueces Bay . The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians , who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8 @,@ 000 years ago , until 1300 CE . In the next century , the Karankawa Indians arrived , and were present when Europeans came ashore . 
 Nueces is Spanish for " nuts " , and refers to the pecan trees that grew along the banks of the Nueces River , noted by Spanish explorer Alonso De León in 1689 . It is unclear when the name was given to the bay ; it was called San Miguel Arcángel by Spanish captain Joaquín de <unk> y Basterra in 1747 , and an 1835 map of Texas identified it as <unk> or " <unk> " Bay . It appears to have been first noted on a Spanish map in 1527 as the mouth of the Río Escondido or hidden river , which is believed to be the Nueces . French explorer René Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle sailed into the bay in 1685 , mistakenly believing it was the Mississippi River . Spanish colonial governor José de <unk> planned a villa on the mouth of the Nueces River named Villa de <unk> . Fifty families were sent the site in 1749 , but failed to establish a settlement , due to a lack of sufficient supplies . Later that century , missionaries discussed the possibility of moving Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission to the site , but decided against the idea due to conflict with the Lipan Apaches . Germans attempted to settle the same area , but were turned away by the French during the Pastry War in the 1830s . The next decade , a colony for freed slaves was proposed by abolitionist Benjamin Lundy , who had to cancel after the outbreak of the Texas Revolution . 
 Corpus Christi , which was founded as a trading post on the southeastern shore in 1839 , is believed to be the first permanent settlement on the bay . It soon grew into a major Texas port with a population of 277 @,@ 454 at the time of the 2000 census . In 1852 , a settlement was finally established at the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay by Henry Kinney , who also founded Corpus Christi . The community was referred to as The Motts by German and English settlers for nearby tree clusters , but was officially known as Nuecestown . It was raided by Mexican bandits in 1875 , but recovered and grew to a population of 200 by 1896 . After the railroad passed on the town in 1905 , it declined , and is today included in the city limits of Corpus Christi . To the north of the bay , the Coleman @-@ Fulton Pasture Company controlled a large segment of San Patricio County for ranching during the aftermath of the Texas Revolution . David Sinton and later Charles Phelps Taft , whose names are immortalized by the nearby towns of Sinton and Taft , were involved with the company . They sold a plot of land on the northeast of Nueces Bay to George H. Paul , who hired Mexican immigrants to clear the land of mesquite trees and founded a ranching community later named West Portland . The plots of land in this community are still mostly held by the descendants of the original owners . The town of Portland — on the extreme northeast of the bay — was also established from land purchased from the Coleman @-@ Fulton Pasture Company by future State Senator John G. Willacy with help from a New England company . The town steadily grew and reached a population of 14 @,@ 827 by 2000 . To the northwest of the bay , on the Whites Point peninsula , a settlement was established around 1866 by <unk> Darius Rachal , who had purchased land on the point from the cattle @-@ driving White family . Soon after his purchase , many of the Whites died of yellow fever as an epidemic swept the area and killed 14 people . Rachal used his land to raise cattle , grow cotton and sell real estate to new settlers . A post office was established at the site in 1892 , and was given the name Rosita or " little flower " after the names " White Point " and " Rachal " were rejected by United States Postal Service . After a 1915 gas explosion and two massive hurricanes , including a 1919 storm that killed 26 residents ( approximately 50 were killed in Portland and 47 in Corpus Christi ) , the post office was abolished in 1919 and by the next year most residents had relocated to Odem .

 Nueces Bay covers an area of 28 @.@ 9 square miles ( 75 km2 ) and drains the 16 @,@ 950 square miles ( 43 @,@ 900 km2 ) of the Nueces River basin . It has an average depth of 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 ft 7 in ) , and a volume of 39 @,@ 700 acre feet ( 49 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) . The bay is considered the southern extreme of the Texas Coastal Plain , which stretches northeast to Galveston Bay , and is part of the geographic transition from the grasslands of the coastal plain to the dry brush region of South Texas . It forms at the base of the Nueces River , which enters at the southwesternmost point of the bay . North of the Nueces entrance is the extension of Odem Bay , named for the nearby settlement of Odem . This extension includes shallow marsh fed by an extensive system of tidal streams including Rincon Bayou , and is headed by Whites Point to the east . Due south of Whites Point at the mouth of Odem Bay , is an oil field , situated against the backdrop of heavy industry on the shore to the southwest . The southern shore , which continues toward Rincon Point , is slender due to the industrial canal dredged to the south to the Port of Corpus Christi . The mouth of Nueces Bay on Corpus Christi Bay from Rincon Point to Indian Point , is crossed by the mile @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) Nueces Bay Causeway , which leads to Portland . West Portland is found on the shoreline of the bay as it curves north and west , which is lined with piers and residences . The bay leads back west to Whites Point on the north shore , which is largely used for agriculture .

 The Nueces estuary provides an ecosystem for a wide variety of wildlife . However , since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985 , freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River , increasing the bay 's salinity , and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat . In response , the City of Corpus Christi , Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay . The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp , which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring . Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout , black drum , flounder and redfish . Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival . 
 A diverse collection of birds sustained by the water life , such as the black skimmer , brown pelican , great blue heron , egret , laughing gull , roseate spoonbill , tern , and the white ibis , can be found in the bay , especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou . Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay 's small islands for improved nesting conditions , and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds ' dietary requirements . At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve , countless birds have been observed , as well as bobcats , coyotes , feral hogs , mountain lions , rattlesnakes , Texas spiny lizards , western <unk> and white @-@ tailed deer .

 Oil has been pumped from the bay since 1912 , but fishing has been a mainstay since humans have inhabited the area . In the early 1970s , recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $ 17 million to the local economy , while commercial fishermen contributed $ 27 @.@ 3 million . Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995 , when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice , due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500 mg / kg in oysters , which as filter feeders , are affected by high levels of zinc in the water . The excessive zinc is believed to have been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company 's <unk> Texas Incorporated subsidiary , which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985 . The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002 . Since that time , zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000 mg / kg , which remains above the healthy levels of 700 mg / kg . The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group . The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed , in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants . Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects . 
 Several oil spills have occurred as a result of the heavy petroleum industry on the south shore of Nueces Bay . In 1984 , approximately 20 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 76 @,@ 000 L ) of oil leaked from a busted pipeline , which blackened 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the shore . Ten years later , Koch Industries , which owns a refinery on the bay , was responsible for a major spill that resulted in the release of 100 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 380 @,@ 000 L ) of oil , leaving a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) slick that seeped into Corpus Christi Bay . The Environmental Protection Agency fined the company $ 30 million for the spill in 2000 , and $ 2 @.@ 5 million was later given by the company to the state of Texas to improve the bay 's water quality .

 " The Grinning Man " is a feature @-@ length episode of the BBC crime drama series Jonathan Creek , first broadcast on 1 January 2009 . The episode marked the series ' return to television following a five @-@ year hiatus , and saw the return of Alan Davies as the show 's titular sleuth . Stuart Milligan returned to the series as Jonathan 's boss , magician Adam Klaus , while the episode also introduced Sheridan Smith as Joey Ross , Jonathan 's crime @-@ solving assistant . The episode was written and directed by series creator David Renwick , who chose to revive the show as a means of delaying his retirement . 
 The central mysteries of the episode focused on an attic room whose occupants disappeared without trace overnight , and the kidnapped partner of a stage magician . 
 The episode was watched by 9 @.@ 91 million viewers and attained a 36 % audience share . Critical reaction to the episode from The Scotsman 's Paul Whitelaw and The Northern Echo 's Steve Pratt suggested that , at 120 minutes , the plot was overstretched . The Stage 's Mark Wright compared Smith favourably to her predecessor in the assistant role , Julia Sawalha as Carla Borrego , while both Scotland on Sunday 's Chitra Ramaswamy and Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury discussed the nostalgia invoked by the episode , as a result of the series having been off @-@ air since 2004 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Set five years after the previous episode , " Gorgons Wood " , " The Grinning Man " begins by introducing the Gothic mansion Metropolis . Since 1938 , a number of visitors staying overnight in the mansion 's attic " Nightmare Room " have disappeared without a trace . Originally owned by a spiritualist , the mansion is now the property of his grandson , stage magician Lance Gessler ( Nicholas Boulton ) . Gessler lives with his mother , Constance ( Judy Parfitt ) , his partner Elodie ( Jenna Harrison ) , and their groundskeeper , Glenn ( Ciaran McMenamin ) . They offer shelter to paranormal investigator Joey Ross and her friend Mina ( Naomi Bentley ) when the two are caught in a storm . Mina elects to sleep in the Nightmare Room , and has vanished by morning . Constance calls in sleuth Jonathan Creek to investigate Mina 's disappearance . 
 Jonathan has recently begun a relationship with an old acquaintance , Nicola ( Katherine Parkinson ) , who is opposed to his investigative career , believing it to be too dangerous an occupation . Jonathan is still in the employment of the magician Adam Klaus , whose television series is receiving heavy criticism from viewers . To Jonathan 's bemusement , Klaus invests in the 3D pornography industry and begins dating the porn actress Candy Mountains ( Jemma Walker ) . 
 Investigating events at Metropolis , Jonathan deduces that Gessler 's grandfather was a Nazi sympathizer , who laid a trap in the attic room to kill one of his enemies without arousing suspicion . Jonathan and Joey spend the night in the room , but uncover nothing , save for a small vent in the canopy of the room 's four @-@ poster bed , which is opened when pressure is put on the mattress , releasing dead flies . The next morning , Jonathan comes to the realization that the vent above the bed was designed to leak a ectoplasmic fluid onto the room 's occupants as they slept , meaning they would need to bathe in the adjoining bathroom . Upon realizing the secret behind the disappearances , Jonathan races back up to the attic with Glenn . Unfortunately , Joey had already climbed into the bath , which has descended and released her into a water tank below the room , where the corpses of previous victims ( including her friend Mina ) remain , drowned and decomposing . The bath has not yet returned to its position so Jonathan and Glenn are able to rescue her . The mystery resembles the real @-@ life case of the <unk> , the sixteenth @-@ century owners of the Ostrich Inn in Slough ( Berkshire ) , who killed wealthy travelers by tipping them into a barrel of boiling water via a hinged bed in one of the bedrooms . 
 During the investigation , Gessler 's partner , Elodie , is kidnapped . Joey follows Gessler from his stage show one night , and observes him slashing Elodie 's throat . She , Jonathan , and Nicola later discover Elodie 's dead body , but when they return with policemen , the corpse has been switched for a prop dummy . Glenn reveals that he and Elodie were in love , and had recently married in secret . He suspects that Gessler may have murdered Elodie out of jealousy after she confessed their marriage to him . The police , however , receive a video of Elodie walking through a park the morning after she was supposedly murdered , with the day 's newspaper in plain view for validation . Jonathan realizes that Gessler had manipulated Delia Gunning ( Ellen Ashley ) , the editor of the local newspaper , into printing a fake copy a week in advance . By making the video before killing Elodie , he could deflect suspicion from himself , leading the police to believe that she had faked her own death and run away . Gessler ensured the front page 's authenticity by having Delia create the day 's headline herself , releasing a briefcase full of bees in the middle of a local council meeting . Jonathan 's suspicions became aroused as the following story about the construction of a motorway through six villages would have been far more engaging as a front @-@ pager . Jonathan and Joey arrive at Delia 's home just in time to save her from being murdered by Gessler , who later commits suicide by gassing himself in his car . 
 The " Grinning Man " the title refers to is the subject of a Hieronymous Bosch painting , which hangs in the attic Nightmare Room . Once the episode 's mysteries are resolved , Constance confesses that she rescued the painting from a burning room decades previously , leaving an elderly uncle to die as she did so . She has Glenn assist her in burning the painting in Metropolis ' grounds . The episode ends with Jonathan , Joey , and Adam arriving at a restaurant to celebrate with their significant others . Adam discovers that he has been conned by Candy , and will not be receiving any return on his pornography investment . Joey receives a call from her partner , Alec ( Adam James ) , who reveals that he is in Miami with Nicola and the two are now seeing one another . As the maître d ' ( Graham <unk> ) arrives to lead them to their private booth , Jonathan jests ; " Three for the Nightmare Room " .

 David Renwick made the decision to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of " deferring retirement " . He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process , and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the " safe decision " . He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an " agony " and a " torment " , revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly due to a lack of ideas . Renwick explained : " Inevitably , you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation , by definition it ’ s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer . So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place . " As well as writing , Renwick also directed the episode , which was produced by Nerys Evans ; Jonathan Creek 's former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007 . Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert 's death , and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek , the broadcaster " bit his hand off for it " . " The Grinning Man " was commissioned by Jane Tranter , Controller of BBC Fiction , with Lucy Lumsden , Controller of Comedy Commissioning , stating that the station was " delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One " . Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show 's revival , describing how : " People say , Oh Jonathan Creek 's coming back . Fantastic . ' And then they watch it and go : ' God , what a mistake . ' Which is what happened with One Foot in the Grave . So I tend to expect the worst . " 
 Davies had suspected that Renwick would one day revive Jonathan Creek , explaining that Jonathan 's fate had been left open , unlike Renwick 's other famous character - One Foot In The Grave 's Victor Meldrew , who was killed in a hit and run in the show 's last episode . When the production of " The Grinning Man " was announced in June 2008 , Davies commented : " For the last five years whenever I 've passed a locked room I 've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it , so I 'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve . " He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange , and that : " I couldn 't remember my lines on the first day . I 'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode . " He praised co @-@ star Sheridan Smith in comparison , describing how : " Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff , which works in a similar way to the script , in that she 's a very bright , sharp character and Creek 's a bit rusty and hasn 't really been doing it for a while . So sure enough , on the first day , she knows all her lines and makes her mark . And I 'm going , ' Hang on a minute , stop showing off ' " . Upon receiving the episode 's script , Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek , almost five years previously . Renwick suggested that they include Davies ' weight gain in the plot , presenting the character as having " gone to seed " . Davies , however , did not want to play a " fat Creek " , and lost weight before filming began , stating : " it was my choice not to let him go too much " . The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years : " We talked about whether he ’ d have changed , whether he ’ d have done any investigating in the meantime . He probably didn ’ t . He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn ’ t changed at all ... and he still lives in a windmill " . In a change from the original , <unk> Windmill was used for the exterior shots , replacing Shipley Windmill , which had been used for all other episodes . Davies grew his hair out again for the role , and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode . The coat had become the character 's trademark in the show 's first series , with Davies explaining that : " After we did the first series , I could never wear it off screen again , because people started doing the Danse Macabre [ theme ] music everywhere I went . So it 's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years . " 
 Previous series of Jonathan Creek had featured first Caroline Quentin , and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan 's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego , respectively . Quentin departed from the show at the end of its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child , while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004 , having become so disillusioned that she was " dragging [ her ] self out of bed " by the end of the show 's fourth series in order to film episodes . Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character , and that : " You can 't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind . In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what 's going on , but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes , it 's somebody for Holmes to explain it to . " For " The Grinning Man " , a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross , played by actress Sheridan Smith . Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show . The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup , and Renwick 's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode . Smith was approached about the role before the episode 's script was written , and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross , Renwick wrote the character 's dialogue with Smith 's northern accent in mind . The actress found <unk> herself to " detective talk " the hardest part of the role , explaining : " You slow down , and then speed up at the end . I kept watching Alan and going , ' I can ’ t do this figuring out talk . ' But I learned from the master . " Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented , stating : " He 's [ Renwick ] written this feisty little northern character , and I am really honoured because he 's such a great writer . I have always played <unk> and <unk> so I wasn 't used to being an intelligent young girl . " 
 Renwick has stated that the production of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to " The Grinning Man " , as well as his own schedule . Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future , stating : " If David writes more , I 'm happy to do them . Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn 't happened so far . And he wouldn 't send me an awful one anyway . But I don 't know if he will come up with another one . He always says that the writing is so difficult , I 'm not sure it gives him any pleasure . But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time . He was directing for the first time and I think he really enjoyed it . So , we 'll see . "

 " The Grinning Man " received a mixed response from critics , and was watched by 9 @.@ 91 million viewers , with a 36 % share of the total television audience . The episode beat ITV 's Marple in the same time @-@ slot , with Geraldine McEwan 's last episode as Agatha Christie 's famous sleuth receiving just 4 @.@ 48 million viewers and a 15 % audience share . The Sunday Times ' AA Gill was critical of the episode , suggesting that the series had been revived : " because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single , lonely , overweight , over @-@ 40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television , and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head . " Of the episode itself , he wrote : " It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy in a way that defies belief and interest . It is a dull confusion of <unk> loose ends that breaks its own rules , suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story . " The Herald 's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies ' acting in the episode , writing that : " it really is difficult to tell the difference between the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick 's comedy drama . Davies doesn 't act , he tries to stay awake , occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight . " While The Scotsman 's Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing " a slightly grumpier version " of himself , he was " quite impressed " by Davies performance , having never seen him act before . Whitelaw found that " the episode itself left a lot to be desired " , writing that its central mystery was " solid " and its solution was " satisfyingly creepy " , but that " At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [ ... ] It was as though Renwick , who also directed , had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs . " Steve Pratt , writing for The Northern Echo , was similarly critical of the episode 's length , deeming the Adam Klaus subplot " nonsense " which " could easily be removed without loss " . Pratt suggested that " This would also help reduce the overlong two @-@ hour running time , during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done . " The Observer 's Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment , writing that the episode : 
 ... was long , at two hours , but writer / director David Renwick had helped us here in our tea @-@ making and loo @-@ going by including an almost entirely unwatchable sub @-@ plot involving a sleazy magician and a porn star ; as soon as it segued back to this , it was time for the viewer to leap to race for the kettle . What was going on with this bit ? Had Renwick written it with his feet , in the bath or something ? Then gone through it removing all traces of point or humour , then dropped it actually into the bath , then torn it up , then asked for it to be quickly rewritten by , say , an ant ? 
 Unlike McKay and Gill , however , Ferguson praised both Davies ' acting and the episode as a whole , deeming it " the best thing on television all week " . He opined that Davies : " plays Creek to easy perfection : mumbling , lugubrious , quietly brilliant " , and called the plot " involving , intriguing , [ and ] original " , stating that it " did the thing all good thrillers , books or films , do of getting you actively , cleverly involved in thinking you can see the answer before anyone else . You couldn 't . " The List 's Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode , calling it " surprisingly splendid festive fare " , in which " The twists and resolutions were , to this watcher at least , as well hidden as Davies ’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce . " The Times ' Tim Teeman deemed the episode " comfort television " , commenting on its " rambling pace " and writing that : " Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward , funny and idiosyncratic ( as you 'd expect from the creator , writer and director David Renwick ) . " The Daily Telegraph ' Gerard O 'Donovan agreed that the episode felt " comfy and familiar " , but also found its run @-@ time overstretched , writing that it : 
 ... might have made for terrifically good , refreshingly unsentimental fun had it not been for the fact that the episode was commissioned to run for two hours . That 's a good 30 minutes longer than the show 's ever been stretched before , and an hour beyond its natural span . Expanding to fit necessitated getting Creek and Joey to stall , stumble and scratch their <unk> ineffectually at each other all the time while writer David Renwick desperately padded out the story with ever more unlikely twists and turns , zig @-@ zagging down incredible subplots involving the magician 's scheme to kidnap and murder his assistant , and the terrible betrayal that lay behind his mother 's acquisition of an oil painting by Hieronymus Bosch . In the end , by the time the secret of the original mystery was unlocked , the only room one really feared never being able to escape from was the one with the telly in it . 
 Of Smith 's performance as Joey , O 'Donovan opined that : " For most drama series the presence of a key new character would have a tangible impact . But not Jonathan Creek , where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes . Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek 's pushy , inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably . Smith was no different . Ten minutes in and we 'd forgotten she was anyone new . " In contrast , Mark Wright , reviewing the episode for The Stage , praised Smith 's performance as Joey , deeming her to be " a much more satisfying sidekick " than Julia Sawalha 's Carla Borrego . He enjoyed the on @-@ screen relationship between the two lead actors , writing that : " it ’ s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special . " Scotland on Sunday 's Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series ' return , alongside The Royle Family , Blackadder and Shooting Stars — other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials . Ramaswamy wrote : " all the comforting , well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times . In a culture that is becoming more and more risk @-@ averse , it 's the oldies but goodies that we trust . " Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle , but concluded that : " Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you ’ re happy to see once a year – any more than that , you feel , and his mannerisms would start to grate . " She deemed the episode : " Less a blast from the past as a shuffling " excuse me " . Conversely , Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one @-@ off special was not enough , and " what we really wanted was a brand new series " . Pickles said of the episode : " It ’ s the gentle , facially expressive , deeply sceptical , somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory . But a one @-@ off ? Oh come on ... you can do better than that . " 
 = Greek ironclad Spetsai = 
 Spetsai ( Greek : Θ / Κ <unk> ) was a Greek ironclad battleship of the Hydra class that served in the Royal Hellenic Navy from 1890 until 1920 . She was named after the Saronic Gulf island of Spetses , which played a key role in the war at sea during the Greek War of Independence . Spetsai she was ordered in 1885 in response to a crisis in the Balkans and Ottoman naval expansion . The ship was launched in 1889 and delivered to Greece by 1902 . She was armed with a main battery of three 10 @.@ 8 inches ( 270 millimetres ) guns and five 5 @.@ 9 inches ( 150 millimetres ) guns , and had a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 kilometres per hour ; 20 miles per hour ) . 
 Spetsai and her sisters saw extensive service with the Greek Navy . They participated in the Greco – Turkish War in 1897 until the Great Powers intervened and prevented the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the Ottoman Navy . Psara saw action in the First Balkan War at the Naval Battle of Elli and was present at the Naval Battle of Lemnos , but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces . She did not see action during World War I , and was used as a naval communications school until 1929 , when she was sold for scrapping .

 In 1885 , Greece ordered three new ironclads of the Hydra class . Spetsai was ordered from the Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipyard in Le Havre , France during the premiership of Charilaos Trikoupis . The ship , named for the island of Spetsai , was launched on 26 October 1889 , and by 1892 , she and her sister @-@ ships Hydra and Psara were delivered to the Greek fleet . The ship was 334 feet 8 inches ( 102 @.@ 01 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 51 ft 10 in ( 15 @.@ 80 m ) and a mean draft of 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) . She displaced 4 @,@ 808 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 732 long tons ; 5 @,@ 300 short tons ) as built . She was powered by a pair of steam engines of unknown type ; they were rated at 6 @,@ 700 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 000 kW ) and provided a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . Coal storage amounted to 500 t ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) . 
 Spetsai 's main battery consisted of three 10 @.@ 8 @-@ inch ( 274 mm ) guns . Two guns were mounted forward in barbettes on either side of the forward superstructure ; these were L / 34 guns . The third gun , a L / 28 gun , was placed in a turret aft . The secondary battery consisted of four 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) L / 36 guns in casemates were mounted below the forward main battery , and a fifth 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch gun was placed on the centerline on the same deck as the main battery . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included four 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) L / 22 guns , four 3 @-@ pounder guns , four 1 @-@ pounder guns , and six 1 @-@ pounder revolver cannons . The ship was also armed with three 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes . The ship was armored with a mix of Creusot and compound steel . The main belt was 12 in ( 300 mm ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armor . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Spetsai saw limited action in the Greco – Turkish War in 1897 , as the Royal Hellenic Navy was unable to make use of its superiority over the Ottoman Navy . The Ottoman Navy had remained in port during the conflict , but a major naval intervention of the Great Powers prevented the Greeks from capitalizing on their superiority . The conflict was centered on the island of Crete , which was the object of an international naval demonstration in 1897 – 1898 ; the Great Powers mediated a solution to the conflict that saw Crete returned to Ottoman control , but with a Greek prince . In 1897 – 1900 , Spetsai and her sister @-@ ships were partially rearmed ; Spetsai was modified at the La Seyne shipyard . Their small @-@ caliber guns were replaced with one 3 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 99 mm ) gun forward , eight 9 @-@ pounder guns , four 3 @-@ pounders , and ten 1 @-@ pounder revolver cannons . One of the 14 @-@ inch torpedo tubes was replaced with a 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) weapon . In 1908 – 1910 , the old 5 @.@ 9 in guns were replaced with new , longer L / 45 models . 
 The Balkan League , of which Greece was a member , declared war on the Ottoman Empire in October 1912 . Two months later , the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy , in an attempt to disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the Dardanelles . The Ottoman fleet , which included the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships Turgut Reis , Barbaros Hayreddin , the outdated ironclad battleships Mesudiye and Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik , nine destroyers , and six torpedo boats , sortied from the Dardanelles in the morning , at 09 : 30 . The smaller ships remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north , remaining near to the coast . The Greek flotilla , which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and Spetsai and her sisters , had been sailing from the island of Imbros to the patrol line outside the straits . When the Ottomans were sighted , the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents . In the ensuing Naval Battle of Elli , the Ottoman ships opened fire first , at 09 : 50 , from a range of about 15 @,@ 000 yards ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) ; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later , by which time the range had decreased significantly to 8 @,@ 500 yards ( 7 @,@ 800 m ) . At 10 : 04 , the Ottoman ships completed a 16 @-@ point turn , which reversed their course , and steamed for the safety of the straits in a disorganized withdrawal . Within an hour , the routed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles . 
 The Naval Battle of Lemnos resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles . The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea ; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to hunt down Hamidiye . Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser , the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from her position . Georgios Averof , Spetsai , and her two sisters appeared approximately 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Lemnos ; when the powerful Greek cruiser was spotted , the Ottomans turned to retreat with Georgios Averof in pursuit . She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase . Spetsai and her sisters were too slow to keep up with Georgios Averof , and played no active part in the engagement . 
 At the outbreak of World War I at the end of July 1914 , Greece 's pro @-@ German monarch , Constantine I , decided to remain neutral . The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915 , which was a source of tension between France and Greece . Ultimately , the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916 ; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve for the remainder of the war . Spetsai was decommissioned in 1920 and used as a naval communications school until 1929 , when she was broken up for scrap . 
 = Hurricane Joyce ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Joyce caused minor impact in the ABC and Windward islands during late September and early October 2000 . The fourteenth tropical cyclone , tenth named storm , and sixth hurricane of the season , Joyce developed from a tropical wave located southwest of Cape Verde on September 25 . Only twelve hours after becoming a cyclone , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joyce early on September 26 . Joyce continued to strengthen and became a hurricane by September 27 . On the following day , Joyce peaked with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) on September 28 . After peak intensity on September 28 , unfavorable conditions caused Joyce to become disorganized and weaken . 
 Late on September 29 , Joyce was downgraded to a tropical storm while centered well east of the Lesser Antilles . In contrast with predictions , Joyce continued to weaken and became a tropical depression on October 1 while crossing through the southern Windward Islands . Early on the following day , Joyce degenerated into a tropical wave over the southeast Caribbean Sea . The remnants were monitored for regeneration , but never developed back into a tropical cyclone . Overall , impact from Joyce was minimal , limited to mainly rainfall and near @-@ tropical storm force winds in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados . The remnants of Joyce also caused similar effects on the ABC islands and Dominican Republic , which resulted in minor damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Joyce originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on September 22 . Influenced by a powerful ridge that had developed in the wake of Hurricane Isaac , the wave traveled a brisk and slightly undulating westward path at 14 to 18 mph ( 23 to 29 km / h ) . It would never change from that general path . While in the deep tropics of the open Atlantic , the wave began to show indications of a closed circulation . Satellite data was ambiguous , but the evidence favored the existence of a tropical cyclone , and the system was designated Tropical Depression Fourteen . At the next advisory , the cyclone was upgraded and named " Joyce " , although satellite data was still ambiguous about whether Joyce even had a circulation . 
 Joyce headed westward and steadily intensified . Deep convection and outflow improved , and Joyce gradually developed an eye . On September 27 , it was upgraded to a hurricane with cold cloud tops . Early on September 28 , Joyce peaked in intensity with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) , a central pressure of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) , and a fleeting " pinhole " eye . At the time , it was located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles . 
 Wind shear then increased , partially exposing Joyce 's center of circulation , although bursts of convection remained . Convection and organization slowly deteriorated , and became , early on September 29 , " pretty crummy " and without a well @-@ defined center of circulation . Joyce did manage to remain at hurricane intensity through this time . Due to the disorganization , it was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day . Despite occasional bursts of convection , Joyce weakened into a tropical depression as it crossed the Windward Islands on October 1 . The weakening was confirmed by Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flights . After crossing the Windward Islands , and entering the southeastern Caribbean Sea , Joyce unexpectedly degenerated into an open wave . Although Joyce 's remnants were monitored for regeneration , any possible redevelopment never materialized . 
 Joyce dissipated in an area of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures . The National Hurricane Center attributed the weakening to dry air from the Sahara . The dry air may have been caused by a lack of southwesterlies bring moisture from equatorial areas , and continental influence from South America . 
 = = Forecasting , impact , and naming = = 
 Joyce 's track was well forecast , with errors ten to twenty percent smaller than the ten @-@ year average . In general , Joyce persistently stayed south of where it was forecast to be . By contrast , intensity forecasts had large errors . Indeed , at 0900 UTC on October 2 Joyce was forecast to be a 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) tropical storm three days out , when in reality the storm dissipated six hours later . These forecast errors were blamed on Joyce 's surprise dissipation . Regarding potential impacts , Joyce 's storm surge of 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) on Trinidad was accurately forecast . 
 On September 30 , a tropical storm watch was issued for the Windward Islands from St. Vincent and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and Tobago . One hour later , the watch was extended to Saint Lucia . Later that day , the watches were upgraded to warnings in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada . On October 1 , Trinidad 's warning was downgraded to a watch . After that , the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued , first in Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines , then Trinidad and Saint Lucia , then Tobago , and finally Grenada . In response to the approaching hurricane , emergency operations centers in Grenada and both main islands of Trinidad and Tobago were placed on alert . 
 While weakening , Tropical Depression Joyce passed close to Tobago , causing sustained winds of 30 mph ( 50 km / h ) . Barbados experienced the highest sustained winds Joyce brought to any land area . There , the winds were 35 mph ( 60 km / h ) , gusting to 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . Neither Barbados , Trinidad and Tobago , nor Grenada reported serious effects from Joyce . Joyce caused storm surge of 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) on southeast Trinidadian shores . After degenerating into an open wave , Joyce 's remnants passed over the ABC Islands , where locally heavy thunderstorms and light winds were reported on October 2 . A tropical wave related to Joyce 's decay was blamed for flooding in the Dominican Republic , where rain caused the Mao , Amina , and <unk> del Norte Rivers to burst their banks , flooding thousands of hectares of banana and rice crops . Damage was reported in communities in the northeastern part of the country . No other impact was reported , and no deaths were blamed on Joyce . 
 Officials from Trinidad and Tobago reported that Joyce made landfall in that country . The National Hurricane Center differs , not attributing any landfall to Joyce . If Joyce really made landfall on Tobago , it would have been the first tropical storm to do so since 1990 's Arthur . In addition , Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so . 
 = Historic districts in the United States = 
 In the United States , a historic district is a group of buildings , properties , or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant . Buildings , structures , objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories , contributing and non @-@ contributing . Districts greatly vary in size : some have hundreds of structures , while others have just a few . 
 The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the United States Department of Interior under the auspices of the National Park Service . Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places , but listing usually imposes no restrictions on what property owners may do with a designated property . State @-@ level historic districts may follow similar criteria ( no restrictions ) or may require adherence to certain historic rehabilitation standards . Local historic district designation offers , by far , the most legal protection for historic properties because most land use decisions are made at the local level . Local districts are generally administered by the county or municipal government . 
 = = History = = 
 The first U.S. historic district was established in Charleston , South Carolina in 1931 , predating the U.S. federal government designation by more than three decades . Charleston city government designated an “ Old and Historic District ” by local ordinance and created a board of architectural review to oversee it . New Orleans followed in 1937 , establishing the Vieux Carré Commission and authorizing it to act to maintain the historic character of the city 's French Quarter . Other localities picked up on the concept , with the city of Philadelphia enacting its historic preservation ordinance in 1955 . 
 The regulatory authority of local commissions and historic districts has been consistently upheld as a legitimate use of government police power , most notably in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York ( 1978 ) . The Supreme Court case validated the protection of historic resources as “ an entirely permissible governmental goal . ” In 1966 the federal government created the National Register of Historic Places , soon after a report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors had stated Americans suffered from " rootlessness . " By the 1980s there were thousands of federally designated historic districts . Some states , such as Arizona , have passed referendums defending property rights that have stopped private property being designated historic without the property owner 's consent or compensation for the historic overlay . 
 = = Property types = = 
 Historic districts are generally two types of properties , contributing and non @-@ contributing . Broadly defined , a contributing property is any property , structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district , listed locally or federally , significant . Different entities , usually governmental , at both the state and national level in the United States , have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics . In general , contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district . 
 In addition to the two types of classification within historic districts , properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are classified into five broad categories . They are , building , structure , site , district and object ; each one has a specific definition in relation to the National Register . All but the eponymous district category are also applied to historic districts listed on the National Register . 
 = = Federal @-@ level = = 
 A listing on the National Register of Historic Places is governmental acknowledgment of a historic district . However , the Register is " an honorary status with some federal financial incentives . " The National Register of Historic Places defines a historic district per U.S. federal law , last revised in 2004 . According to the Register definition a historic district is : 
 a geographically definable area , urban or rural , possessing a significant concentration , linkage , or continuity of sites , buildings , structures , or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development . A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history . 
 Districts established under U.S. federal guidelines generally begin the process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places . The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation . While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections , it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government . If the federal government is not involved , then the listing on the National Register provides the site , property or district no protections . For example , if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois , then the federal designation would offer no protections . If , however , company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected . A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation . 
 In general , the criteria for acceptance to the National Register are applied consistently , but there are considerations for exceptions to the criteria and historic districts have influence on some of those exceptions . Usually , the National Register does not list religious structures , moved structures , reconstructed structures , or properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years . However , if a property falls into one of those categories and are " integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria " then an exception allowing their listing will be made . Historic district listings , like all National Register nominations , can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval . In the case of historic districts , a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places . If such an objection occurred , then the nomination would become a determination of National Register eligibility only . 
 = = State @-@ level = = 
 Most U.S. state governments have a listing similar to the National Register of Historic Places . State listings can have similar benefits to federal designation , such as granting qualification and tax incentives . In addition , the property can become protected under specific state laws . The laws can be similar or different from the federal guidelines that govern the National Register . A state listing of a historic district on a " State Register of Historic Places , " usually by the State Historic Preservation Office , can be an " honorary status , " much like the National Register . For example , in Nevada , listing in the State Register places no limits on property owners . In contrast , state law in Tennessee requires that property owners within historic districts follow a strict set of guidelines , from the U.S. Department of Interior , when altering their properties . Though , according to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 , all states must have a State Historic Preservation Office , not all states must have a " state historic district " designation . As of 2004 , for example , the state of North Carolina had no such designation . 
 = = Local @-@ level = = 
 Local historic districts usually enjoy the greatest level of protection legally from any threats that may compromise their historic integrity because many land @-@ use decisions are made at the local level . There are more than 2 @,@ 300 local historic districts in the United States . Local historic districts can be administered at the county or the municipal level ; both entities are involved in land use decisions . 
 Local historic districts are identified by surveying historic resources and delineating appropriate boundaries that comply with all aspects of due process . Depending on local ordinance or State law , property owners permission may be required ; however all owners are to be notified and given a chance to share their opinion . Most local historic districts are constricted by design guidelines that control changes to the properties included in the district . Many local commissions adopt specific guidelines for the " tout ensemble " of each neighborhood , although some smaller commissions rely on the Secretary of Interior Standards . For most minor changes , homeowners can consult with local preservation staff at the municipal office and receive guidance on and permission for the changes . Major changes however , require homeowners to apply for a Certificate of <unk> ( COA ) , and the changes may be decided upon by the historic commission or architectural review board . The COA process is carried out with all aspects of due process , with formal notification , hearings , and fair and informed decision making . 
 According to the National Park Service , historic districts are one of the oldest forms of protection for historic properties . The city of Charleston , South Carolina is credited with beginning the modern day historic districts movement . In 1931 Charleston enacted an ordinance which designated an " Old and Historic District " administered by a Board of Architectural Review . Charleston 's early ordinance reflected the strong protection that local historic districts often enjoy under local law . It asserted that no alteration could be made to any architectural features which could be viewed by the public from the street . Local historic districts , as in New Orleans and Savannah , Georgia , predate the Register by 10 years or more as well . 
 Local historic districts are most likely to generate resistance because of the restrictions they tend to place on property owners . Local laws can cause residents " to comply with ( local historic district ) ordinances . " 
 The issue of local historic districts and the impact on property values is a concern to many homeowners . The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before @-@ and @-@ after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status . Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers in a number of states , including New Jersey , Texas , Indiana , Georgia , Colorado , Maryland , North and South Carolina , Kentucky , Virginia , and elsewhere . As stated by economist Donovan <unk> , " the results of these studies are remarkably consistent : property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole in the vast majority of cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case . Simply put – historic districts enhance property values . " In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values , it was found that “ property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4 % to over 19 % per year . ” Similarly , in New York City between 1980 @-@ 2000 , local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non @-@ designated properties . Equally important , local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non @-@ designated properties . A recent study investigating the data on single @-@ family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non @-@ designated neighborhoods found that designated properties were significantly less likely to experience foreclosure . Local historic district designation has proven to protect property values from wild fluctuations and provides stability in the housing market . 
 = = Significance = = 
 The original concept of an American historic district was as a protective area surrounding more important , individual historic sites . As the field of historic preservation progressed , those involved came to realize that the structures acting as " buffer zones " were actually key elements of the historic integrity of larger , landmark sites . Preservationists came to the view that districts should be more encompassing , blending together a mesh of structures , streets , open space and landscaping to define the historical character of a historic district . 
 As early as 1981 the National Trust for Historic Preservation identified 882 American cities and towns that had some form of " historic district zoning " in place ; local laws meant specifically to protect historic districts . Before 1966 , historic preservation in the United States was in its infancy . That year the U.S. Conference of Mayors penned an influential report which concluded , in part , that Americans suffered from a sense of " rootlessness . " They recommended historic preservation to help provide Americans with a sense of orientation . The creation of the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 , on the heels of the report , helped to instill that sense of orientation the mayors were looking for . The mayors also recommended that any historic preservation program not focus solely on individual properties but also on " areas and districts which contain special meaning for the community . " Local , state and federal historic districts now account for thousands of historic property listings at all levels of government . 
 = Keith Elliott = 
 Keith Elliott VC ( 25 April 1916 – 7 October 1989 ) was a New Zealand soldier who served with the New Zealand Military Forces during the Second World War . He was awarded the Victoria Cross , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces , for his actions in the First Battle of El Alamein . 
 Born in <unk> , Elliott was a farm manager when the Second World War began . He volunteered for service abroad with the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) and was posted to the 22nd Battalion . He saw action during the Battles of Greece and Crete and then in North Africa . By now a sergeant , during Operation Crusader in November 1941 , he was one of 700 New Zealanders made prisoners of war when their position was overrun by the Germans . Freed two months later , he was serving as a platoon commander during the First Battle of El Alamein . After he was awarded his VC , he was promoted to second lieutenant , sent home to New Zealand and discharged from the 2NZEF . 
 Returning to civilian life , he resumed his farming career , but in 1948 became a priest . He shifted around the lower half of the North Island for the next several years , serving in a number of churches . He was also a chaplain in the Territorial Force . He retired from the priesthood in 1981 and died eight years later at the age of 73 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Keith Elliott was born on 25 April 1916 in <unk> , New Zealand , one of nine children of a farmer and his wife . He was educated in nearby Feilding , firstly at Lytton Street School and then at Feilding Agricultural High School . He was unable to complete his formal schooling because in 1933 , he had to drop out to work on the family farm . Two years later , he began managing a large farm at <unk> . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 Elliott tried to enlist in the New Zealand Military Forces on hearing of the outbreak of the Second World War but was initially declined due to the poor state of his teeth . He was successful on a later attempt and in January 1940 he joined the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( 2NZEF ) that was raised for service overseas . He was posted to 22nd Battalion , commanded by a Victoria Cross winner of the First World War , Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew . The battalion embarked for the Middle East as part of the Second Echelon of the 2NZEF but was diverted to England during transit . It arrived in England in June 1940 , where it remained for the rest of the year on garrison duty . While in England , Elliott was promoted to lance corporal . 
 In early 1941 , the Second Echelon was redesignated the 5th Infantry Brigade , 2nd New Zealand Division , and was sent to Greece as part of an Allied contingent set to counter a likely invasion by the Germans . His battalion was positioned at the Olympus Pass , and shortly after the invasion commenced , engaged advancing German tanks . The New Zealanders withdrew after a day , beginning a gradual retreat from the country . Evacuated to Crete on 25 April , 22nd Battalion was defending Maleme airfield when German paratroopers attacked on 20 May . The airfield was abandoned that evening much to Elliott 's displeasure as his platoon was holding their positions . The Allies were eventually evacuated to Egypt a week later , but not before Elliott was wounded in the arm in a skirmish with enemy paratroopers . 
 = = = North Africa = = = 
 While the division was refitting and rearming following the fighting in Greece and Crete , Elliott was promoted to lance sergeant , then platoon sergeant . In November 1941 , during Operation Crusader , his platoon was attached to the headquarters of the 5th Infantry Brigade for security . On 27 November , he , along with 700 other men , were captured when the headquarters was overrun by elements of Generalleutnant ( Lieutenant General ) Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Corps , which had outflanked the Allies . He spent two months under harsh conditions in captivity before being liberated by South African troops . He lost a considerable amount of weight during his time as a prisoner of war . He rejoined the 2nd New Zealand Division which was refitting in Syria , but then contracted malaria and missed out on its hasty recall to Egypt and the subsequent fighting at Minqar Qaim . 
 On his recovery , Elliott rejoined the 22nd Battalion on 13 July 1942 , in time for the First Battle of Alamein . The battalion was short of commissioned officers , and he found himself acting platoon commander for the forthcoming operation to capture Ruweisat Ridge . After commencing the attack early in the morning of 15 July , the battalion reached the ridge and began digging in . At daybreak , it was discovered that the New Zealanders had passed several German tanks during their advance the previous evening . Elliott spotted the tanks when they began advancing towards the 22nd Battalion 's position at dawn and notified the commanders of nearby platoons . However , they believed the tanks to be British and disregarded Elliott 's warning until the German tanks began attacking the battalion 's positions . It was then that Elliott performed the actions that led to the award of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) . The citation for his VC read : 
 At dawn on 15 July 1942 the battalion to which Sergeant Elliot belonged was attacked on three flanks by tanks . Under heavy tank , machine @-@ gun and shell fire , Sergeant Elliott led the platoon he was commanding to the cover of a ridge three hundred yards away , during which he sustained a chest wound . Here he re @-@ formed his men and led them to a dominating ridge a further five hundred yards away , where they came under heavy enemy machine @-@ gun and mortar fire . He located enemy machine @-@ gun posts to his front and right flank , and while one section attacked on the right flank , Sergeant Elliott led seven men in a bayonet charge across five hundred yards of open ground in the face of heavy fire and captured four enemy machine @-@ gun posts and an anti @-@ tank gun , killing a number of the enemy and taking fifty prisoners . His section then came under fire from a machine @-@ gun post on the left flank . He immediately charged this post single @-@ handed and succeeded in capturing it , killing several of the enemy and taking fifteen prisoners . During these two assaults he sustained three more wounds in the back and legs . Although badly wounded in four places , Sergeant Elliott refused to leave his men until he had reformed them , handed over his prisoners , which were now increased to one hundred and thirty , and arranged for his men to rejoin the battalion . Owing to Sergeant Elliott 's quick grasp of the situation , great personal courage and leadership , nineteen men , who were the only survivors of B Company of his battalion , captured and destroyed five machine @-@ guns , one anti @-@ tank gun , killed a great number of the enemy and captured one hundred and thirty prisoners . Sergeant Elliott sustained only one casualty amongst his men , and brought him back to the nearest advanced dressing station . 
 All of the 22nd Battalion , bar Elliott 's platoon , were killed or captured during the fighting at Ruweisat Ridge . Some of the other battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses . Elliott managed to link up with elements of the 21st Battalion , the commander of which recommended him for the VC . Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before he returned to his battalion in September . 
 His VC was gazetted on 24 September 1942 , but Elliott had learnt of his award the previous day . His divisional commander , Major General Bernard Freyberg , commissioned Elliott in the field as a second lieutenant shortly afterwards . He was presented with his VC ribbon by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery and was ordered to return to New Zealand . It is likely that this was due the desire of military authorities to keep him out of harm 's way following the recent capture of the division 's other VC winner , Charles Upham , at Ruweisat . Elliott was unhappy at being sent home while his friends remained in the field . He was also uncomfortable with the attention he received from the public when he arrived back in New Zealand and remained modest about his achievements . He was discharged from the 2NZEF in December 1943 and resumed farming . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In February 1944 , Elliott married Margaret Rachel Markham . The couple had first met before the war and would go on to have five children . Although he continued farming , he became interested in a career in the Anglican Church . Encouraged by a friend who had been a chaplain in the military , he began training for the priesthood in February 1946 . He became a priest in 1948 and took up a curate in Palmerston North , before becoming chaplain at the nearby Linton Military Camp . This entailed him joining the New Zealand Territorial Force with the rank of chaplain , 4th class . 
 For the next several years , Elliott moved around a number of parishes in the lower North Island . He also spent periods of time at the City Mission in Wellington . He was present at the unveiling of the Alamein Memorial in Egypt in 1954 , and two years later attended VC centenary celebrations in London . In 1967 , he co @-@ authored a book of his life , From Cowshed to Dog Collar . He retired from the priesthood in April 1981 and moved to <unk> . 
 He died of cancer on 7 October 1989 , survived by his wife and five children . He was buried with full military honours at <unk> Cemetery .

 Elliott donated his Victoria Cross to his former school , Fielding Agricultural High School , in 1972 . It was later loaned to the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru for display . It was one of nine Victoria Crosses that were among a hundred medals stolen from the museum on 2 December 2007 . On 16 February 2008 , the New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ $ 300 @,@ 000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess . 
 = Blackrock ( film ) = 
 Blackrock is a 1997 Australian drama thriller film directed by Steven Vidler and written by Nick Enright . Marking Vidler 's directorial debut , the film was adapted from the play of the same name , also written by Enright , which was inspired by the murder of Leigh Leigh . The film stars Laurence Breuls , Simon Lyndon and Linda Cropper , and also features the first credited film performance of Heath Ledger . The film follows Jared ( Breuls ) , a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl . When she is found murdered the next day , Jared is torn between revealing what he saw and protecting his friends . 
 Leigh 's family opposed the fictionalisation of her murder , though protests against the film were abandoned after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office . Blackrock was filmed over a period of two weeks at locations including Stockton , where Leigh was murdered , a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh . While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story , numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made , and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder . 
 The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival , and was also shown at the Boston Film Festival , though it never found an American distributor . It was nominated for five AACTA Awards , including Best Film , and won the Feature Film – Adaptation award as well as the Major Award at the 1997 AWGIE Awards . It received generally positive reviews in Australia , where it grossed $ 1 @.@ 1 million at the box office . Outside Australia , where audiences were less familiar with Leigh 's murder , it received mixed reviews .

Jared 's mother Diane ( Linda Cropper ) attempts to tell Jared that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer , though Jared insists on talking to her later as he is busy arranging a " welcome home " party for Ricko at the local surf club . Rachel 's father , a photographer who takes provocative images of women , forbids her from attending the party , though he allows her older brother Toby ( Heath Ledger ) to attend . 
 While driving to the party , Toby sees Tracy ( Bojana Novakovic ) , Cherie ( Rebecca Smart ) and two other girls , and gives them a ride . Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and subsequently gets into a fight with Toby . Ricko comes to Jared 's defence , though Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko has hit Toby several times . Tracy comes to comfort Toby and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone . Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach . He then witnesses three of his male friends interrupting the couple and raping Tracy . Tracy calls out for help , though Jared , who is visibly disturbed by what he is witnessing , does not intervene . Toby and the other three boys , who never noticed Jared was watching , flee the area . Jared also runs away , leaving Tracy alone and distressed . Later that night Rachel , who has snuck out of home to attend the party , finds Tracy 's beaten corpse on the beach . 
 Jared initially tells the police nothing of what he saw . He is torn between the need to tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends ; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane . Despite Jared 's silence , police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days . Jared decides to tell the police what he saw , as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy 's murder ; however , on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko . Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy , but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her . He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship . Diane , who still has not been able to tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour , goes in to have surgery . 
 Jared tells the police that he was with Ricko ; when he tries to suggest Tracy 's death may have been an accident , the police show him the photos of Tracy 's battered body . Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy 's death was not an accident . He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home . He agreed , but wanted to have sex with her first . She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process , which enraged him enough to beat her to death . 
 As Ricko finishes his confession , the police arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in . He attempts to escape but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff . Rather than go to jail , and ignoring Jared 's screams of protest , he jumps to his death . In the weeks that follow , Jared 's life collapses . Despite learning of Diane 's illness , he moves out of her house , choosing instead to be homeless . Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings ; after arguing with Diane , he confesses that he witnessed Tracy 's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards . Later that day , Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy 's grave .

 Writing in the journal Antipodes , academics Felicity Holland and Jane O 'Sullivan credit the film with exploring the themes of Australian masculinity , mateship , violence and sexuality . The film 's portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply getting out of hand . The violence , they say , erupts from extreme <unk> rather than the archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women . The film 's critique of criminal masculinity undermines the status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in Australian history and cinema , such as Ned Kelly and Mick Dundee . The authors believe that the focus on masculinity leaves the female victim largely out of the film ; they consider the " near erasure " of Tracy to be a troubling aspect ; the film instead focuses on portraying the males as victims of their class , masculinity and mateship . 
 Director Steven Vidler said the film was not about a rape , rather it was " about the culture that allowed it to happen . " Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role , stating , " It was important to show that this could have happened to anyone . We didn 't want to give away too much about the victim so we could maintain that suspense . " Producer David Elfick said that the film was about contemporary Australia ; about " kids who have all their life to enjoy , then a deadly mixture of drugs , alcohol , sexual tension , and desire add up to a tragedy . "

 Brian Joyce , the director of Newcastle 's Freewheels Theatre in Education , approached playwright Nick Enright , encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around the 1989 rape and murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton , a beach area of Newcastle . Leigh 's family objected to the fictionalisation of her murder . Titled A Property of the Clan , the 45 @-@ minute play premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in 1992 and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993 . The play was shown at various high @-@ schools in the Newcastle area and , following its positive reception , was shown nationally at high schools across the country over a period of eighteen months . 
 In 1994 , the Sydney Theatre Company commissioned Enright to develop the play into a feature @-@ length production . The resulting play was titled Blackrock . Blackrock retained the original four characters from A Property of the Clan , and added nine others ; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh 's murder . The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment . 
 = = = Film adaptation = = = 
 While the revisions to the play Blackrock were still being finalised , Enright started working with first @-@ time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version , which would also be titled Blackrock . By December 1995 , Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor , although they were having trouble finding financing for the film . Vidler said he considered directing the film Blackrock after having watched and been moved by the theatrical version , saying the play was " absolutely what it was like [ for him ] growing up in the Western Suburbs ... It 's about keeping bonded with your mates . Nothing else matters ... It 's about the unbelievable lengths boys will go to keep those bonds solid . " Leigh 's mother Robyn campaigned to have production of the film halted , but her attempts failed after the film received government financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office . 
 Blackrock was filmed over a period of two weeks with a cast and crew of about 70 . A call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in the Newcastle area . Filming locations included Stockton , Maroubra Beach , Caves Beach , and <unk> House . Notable Stockton landmarks seen in the film include the Stockton Ferry and Stockton Bridge . 
 The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area , as memories of Leigh 's murder were still fresh and the details of the script were " too close for comfort " . When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996 , locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available . The local media treated them with hostility . Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production , saying " I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else . " Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area , saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so . The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers ' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh , despite their choice of Stockton for filming . During production in September 1996 , Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was " getting a bit bored " of people mentioning Leigh 's murder . While acknowledging that the comments were understandable , Elfick concluded , " Unfortunately , that event happens all over Australia . We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders " . He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying , " The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing " . Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh 's death , and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future . Leigh 's family were vehemently opposed to the film , saying that the filmmakers were " feasting on an unfortunate situation " , insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death , and portraying her negatively while doing so . One of Leigh 's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month , saying " David Elfick doesn 't seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault , rape , and murder of a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old virgin , not as he called it : ' the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia . ' " Enright said that while Leigh 's murder served as the inspiration , the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Sandy George from Australian Screen Online said that Vidler 's long career as an actor helped him " draw the terrific performances " from the film 's young actors . 17 @-@ year @-@ old Laurence Breuls was literally the first person to audition for the role of Jared . Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice . Vidler chose Simon Lyndon , who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock , for the role of Ricko , stating that Lyndon had the looks , charisma , and complexity to play the role . Rebecca Smart , who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production , was the only person to reprise their role from the play . Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger 's debut film , but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film <unk> Around . While Ledger 's role in Blackrock is small , it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia , leading to more prominent acting roles . 15 @-@ year @-@ old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene . Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced , who despite initial reservations , eventually gave permission for her to film the scene . Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended , though recovered shortly afterwards , concluding , " In a way , I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career . I don 't think I 'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again . " The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T @-@ shirt that said " shit happens " . Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone , he burst into tears . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The soundtrack to the film was released on 28 April 1997 on Mercury Records Australia . Vidler said a lot of time was spend sifting through hundred of CDs " trying to find stuff that was not only appropriate for the film but would also be appealing to the audiences and hopefully , you know , would be released around the same time as the film , which isn 't as easy as it sounds ! " Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic gave the album four and a half out of five stars , concluding that it was " A fine collection of songs that , given the diversity of artists featured , is surprisingly cohesive as an album .

 The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 1997 . It was also shown at the Boston Film Festival in September 1997 . The version of the film shown outside Australia was around 100 minutes long ; upon reviewing this version the Australian Classification Board gave it an ' R ' rating , stating the rape scene was " too harrowing and confronting " for an MA15 + rating . Vidler subsequently cut about 10 minutes of footage out of the film so it could receive an MA15 + rating and reach its target audience of 15- to 18 @-@ year @-@ olds . Blackrock opened in cinemas in Australia on 1 May 1997 . It grossed $ 1 @,@ 136 @,@ 983 at the Australian box office .

 In anticipation of the film 's debut at Sundance , John Brodie from Variety said the film could be the " thunder from Down Under the way Shine was last year . " Having watched the film at Sundance , David Rooney from Variety praised several of the actors ' performances and said the film " should score with kids the protagonists ' age , but its soap @-@ opera @-@ style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance " . Premiere also gave a negative review of the film 's debut , commenting that audiences had been expecting to see another Shine , though left the screening disappointed . Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of Blackrock at Sundance was less well received , which he blamed on sound problems . He stated that the issue was rectified for the second and third screenings , which were much more successful . Diane Carmen of The Denver Post gave the film a positive review of the film , which she said left audiences at Sundance " reeling with its intensity " , concluding it was " almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S " , though in the event the film never received American distribution . Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival , Chris Wright from The Phoenix concluded , " Even with its slightly over @-@ the @-@ top dénouement , Blackrock is a believable , touching teen drama . It 's also a gripping thriller " . 
 R.S. Murthi from the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times gave the film two out of five stars , concluding it is " an unflattering but somewhat forced look at the wild side of teen life that at times seems dangerously tolerant of unrestrained teen behaviour . " Associate professor Donna Lee Brien of Central Queensland University said that when shown outside Australia , the film lacks the " poignant and powerful narrative support of Leigh 's tragedy " and was deemed by critics to be " shallow and clichéd " . 
 Australian novelist and critic Robert Drewe gave a positive review , praising the performance of Breuls , the cinematography by Martin McGrath , and director Steven Vidler 's choice of such a controversial subject for a first film . Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual people involved in the Leigh Leigh murder as possible , Drewe said the film is " asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories " , though he concluded that the film should be " compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers . " Rob Lowing from The Sun @-@ Herald noted that the film belonged to a slew of Australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave the film 3 ½ stars out of 4 , stating , " if you went to see Romper Stomper , Metal Skin , Idiot Box or Once Were Warriors , this gritty , punchy social drama ably fits into that class . " 
 In her book Who Killed Leigh Leigh ? , Kerry Carrington , a criminologist and prominent researcher of Leigh 's murder , had both criticism and praise for the film . She praised it for dispelling " the myth " that sexual violence is confined to one social class , for illustrating how boys model their sexual conduct on their fathers ' treatment of women , and how the culture of sex segregation in workplaces can carry over into the public life of a town , exacerbating sexist beliefs and behaviours . She criticised the film , however , for the " strong impression " it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of the underlying problem and for several differences between Leigh 's murder and the film that she considered to be disrespectful to Leigh 's memory , in particular the film 's " Hollywood ending " . 
 Donna Lee Brien stated that just as the filmmakers attempted to distance themselves from Leigh 's murder , the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock . A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson 's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year , but made no mention of Blackrock . Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system , as the film achieves justice for the victim , whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh . Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime .

According to Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile the featurette was " overburdened " with clips from the film , but was otherwise of interest . Urban also praised the seven @-@ minute interview with Nick Enright . 
 = = Historical accuracy = = 
 None of the promotional material for the film mentioned Leigh and the film was not marketed as being " based on a true story " . The film 's credits state that it is a work of fiction and that resemblance to " actual events or persons living or dead is entirely coincidental " . Nevertheless , numerous comparisons between the film and Leigh 's murder were made . Just like the play it was based on , Blackrock was often incorrectly considered by viewers to be a factual account of Leigh 's murder . <unk> between the two subjects was high ; the film was described by Miriam Davis on radio station FM 91 @.@ 5 as being the true story of " the murder of Leigh Warner at Blackrock Beach near Newcastle . " Donna Lee Brien stated that every review of both the film and the play it was based on at least mentioned Leigh , with some going into great detail on the subject . Kerry Carrington stated that the film was very accurate in some aspects of the murder , yet very distant in others , as if the film was " having a bet each way " . 
 Jared is an entirely fictional character , though he has been interpreted as a metaphor for everyone who witnessed Leigh being publicly assaulted yet did nothing . In the film , Tracy does not ask her parents for permission to attend the party as she knows this would be denied , whereas Leigh obtained permission from her parents , who were told the party would be supervised . Tracy wears a short skirt , tight @-@ fitting top , and high @-@ heels to the party , while Leigh wore ordinary shorts , a jumper , and sand @-@ shoes . Tracy 's body is found that night by a girl ; Leigh 's body was found the next day by a boy . Tracy 's mother packs up her daughter 's bedroom the following day , whereas Leigh 's mother left her room untouched for months . In the film , police labour until every boy involved in the rape and murder is punished , whereas no one was convicted for raping Leigh and police received criticism for alleged incompetence . Tracy 's murderer was 22 years old , well @-@ toned , and committed suicide , while Leigh 's was 18 years old , 120 kg ( 265 lb ) , and was jailed . 
 Both murderers , however , were high @-@ school dropouts who were interested in mechanics , were considered to have no emotional depth , and were prone to violence . The party in the film was considered to be " an almost perfect re @-@ creation " of the party in Stockton ; a surf club is hired for the night with teenage attendees being entertained by a high @-@ school band . The party spills out into the surrounding area where there are fights , and teenagers are seen stumbling , vomiting and unconscious . Tracy 's funeral was also considered to be " a direct re @-@ staging " of Leigh 's service ; both Leigh and Tracy 's friends placed red roses on her coffin and then plant a tree in her memory . Both Leigh and Tracy 's mothers worked at a nursing home and both their fathers called for the death penalty for her murderer . Parents are blamed for neglecting their children in both cases . 
 Details that were considered to be undoubtedly taken from Leigh 's murder included the filming location of Stockton , the presence of the song " If I Could Turn Back Time " featured at Leigh 's funeral appearing in the original script ( though it did not appear in the finished film ) , and posters reading " Shame Blackrock Shame " seen on telegraph poles following Tracy 's murder ; posters appeared around Stockton following Leigh 's murder stating " Shame Stockton Shame : Dob the gutless bastards in " .

 The Headphone Masterpiece is the debut album by American recording artist Cody Chesnutt . He recorded the album in his home bedroom with a 4 @-@ track recorder and played guitar , bass , keyboard , and an organ . A 36 @-@ song double album , The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo @-@ fi music , and distorted , overdubbed production . It was written and arranged by Chesnutt , whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as falling in love with his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle . 
 After unsuccessfully shopping the album to record companies , Chesnutt released it himself on his website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 through his own label Ready , Set , Go ! . The album charted for one week on the Billboard 200 and had sold 25 @,@ 000 copies by March 30 , 2003 , according to Nielsen SoundScan . The Headphone Masterpiece was well received by music critics , who found it musically adventurous , albeit indulgent .

 After his band The <unk> was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997 , Cody Chesnutt spent several months recording The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom , which he used as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland , in Valley Village , California . He used a 4 @-@ track recorder , and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $ 10 @,@ 000 , including one microphone , an organ , a guitar , bass , and keyboard . He used a pair of Sony MDR @-@ 7506 headphones as a studio monitor in order not to wake up his roommate . It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner . 
 A 36 @-@ song double album , The Headphone Masterpiece has overdubbed , distorted production , and incorporates pop rock , soul , R & B , and hip hop styles . Music journalist Philip Sherburne said that it explores British Invasion music on songs such as " Upstarts in a <unk> " , synthpop on " The World Is Coming to My Party " , and " cheerfully misogynist " hip hop on " Bitch , I 'm Broke " , but the album 's " core is classic soul " . Jared Levy of Tiny Mix Tapes called it a neo soul album , while The Fader magazine 's Knox Robinson categorized it as lo @-@ fi music . 
 Chesnutt 's lyrics mix irony and sincerity . He wrote the album to express the complexity of his personal experiences , such as falling in love with his wife , rock and roll , and reconciling his love for the music with the trappings of the rock lifestyle . Pitchfork Media 's Rob Mitchum wrote that " Serve This Royalty " celebrates Chesnutt 's " cultural sect " , and " The Seed " mixes his " hypersexual egotism " with " a tone of evolutionary bravado . " On the former song , Chesnutt sings " Thank you Jesus / For my mama / Thank you bitches / For my money " . He said of recording the song , " I woke up , went to the organ , and played these chords " . Following " Bitch , I 'm Broke " , the album features a suite of songs written about Chesnutt 's wife and the pleasures of monogamy .

 Chesnutt shopped the album around to record companies , but they mistook it for a demo and rejected it . They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly , rearrange the drums , and rerecord his vocals . He said in an interview for Vibe at the time , " I refuse to re @-@ record it @-@ that defeats the purpose . What about the experience I had in my bedroom ? To go back to the studio , I 'd be chasing something . If you 're listening to it and you love it , then it 's already done what it 's supposed to do . " In September 2002 , Chesnutt made the album available through his website , and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready , Set , Go ! . 
 Chesnutt performed at clubs in Los Angeles in the album 's promotion . He subsequently toured with Macy Gray , Erykah Badu , and The Roots , who covered his song " The Seed " on their 2002 album Phrenology . The band released a music video for the song featuring Chesnutt , which received airplay on MTV .

 In a positive review , AllMusic editor Mike Gowan called The Headphone Masterpiece a " lo @-@ fi gem " and " an eclectic celebration of sound " , while Rolling Stone magazine 's Tom Moon hailed it as " one of the most emotionally raw albums of the year " ; Moon wrote that the record " gathered musical strands from all over the pop universe into unadorned , remarkably intimate stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness musings on love , money and responsibility " . Uncut called the album " an awesome declaration of intent " and stated , " Although decidedly lo @-@ fi , this epic , adventurous and mischievous album bears comparison with Prince and Todd Rundgren ( at their respective peaks ) . " Matt Diehl from Spin called it " indie soul that traverses the chasm between Shuggie Otis and Guided by Voices " . Dream Hampton , writing in Vibe , said that the album is " everything that many roots and retro artists have reached for , pure and straightforward ; yet it is thoroughly modern in its outlook , inventive and unsentimental , with both feet in the future . " 
 Mojo was somewhat less enthusiastic , finding the record " at once engaging and aloof " , with " its often hamfisted production and errant vocals adding to its ramshackle , rusticated charms " . In The A.V. Club , Nathan Rabin said the album was " musically uneven in the best way " , calling it " a brilliant , self @-@ indulgent , kaleidoscopic , contradictory mess " . Pitchfork Media 's Rob Mitchum observed " a surplus of uniqueness overshadows a respectable aptitude " and remarked that its " self @-@ indulgence , lack of focus , and unbridled sonic and lyrical crudity " made the album " so frustrating , yet compelling .

 = Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge = 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge ( local / <unk> / ) , formerly known as South Branch Bridge or Romney Bridge , is a historic Whipple truss bridge in Capon Lake , West Virginia . It is located off Carpers Pike ( West Virginia Route 259 ) and crosses the Cacapon River . The bridge formerly carried Capon Springs Road ( West Virginia Secondary Route 16 ) over the river , connecting Capon Springs and Capon Lake . 
 The bridge 's Whipple truss technology was developed by civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847 . J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple 's truss design in 1859 by designing the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections . The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy 's later modifications with double @-@ intersections and horizontal chords , and is therefore considered a Whipple – Murphy truss bridge . The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is West Virginia 's oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge and its oldest extant metal truss bridge . 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge ( or alternatively , the Romney Bridge ) , a larger two @-@ span Whipple truss bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike ( U.S. Route 50 ) across the South Branch Potomac River near Romney . The larger Whipple truss bridge replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the American Civil War . In 1874 , T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple truss bridge over the South Branch ; that bridge served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937 . 
 Dismantled in 1937 , the bridge was relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road ( West Virginia Secondary Route 16 ) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs . The bridge was dedicated on August 20 , 1938 . In 1991 , a new bridge was completed to the south , and the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was preserved in place by the West Virginia Division of Highways , due to its rarity , age , and engineering significance . The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15 , 2011 . 
 = = Geography and setting = = 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is located in a predominantly rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County within the Cacapon River valley . Baker Mountain , a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises to the immediate west , and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise to the bridge 's east . The confluence of Capon Springs Run with the Cacapon River lies just north ( downstream ) of the bridge . George Washington National Forest is located to the bridge 's southeast , covering the forested area south of Capon Springs Road . 
 The bridge is located along Carpers Pike ( West Virginia Route 259 ) in the unincorporated community of Capon Lake , 2 @.@ 05 miles ( 3 @.@ 30 km ) southwest of Yellow Spring and 6 @.@ 77 miles ( 10 @.@ 90 km ) northeast of the town of Wardensville . The historic Capon Springs Resort and the unincorporated community of Capon Springs are located 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) east of Capon Lake on Capon Springs Road ( West Virginia Secondary Route 16 ) . The bridge is located immediately north ( downstream ) of the intersection of Carpers Pike with Capon Springs Road , which is carried across the Cacapon River via the current Capon Lake Bridge , a steel stringer bridge built in 1991 to replace the Whipple truss bridge for conveying vehicle traffic . The property containing the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is less than 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) in size . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is an early example of the use of metal truss bridge load @-@ bearing superstructure technology , which defined highway bridge design well into the 20th century . Because of " its uncommon innovative design and age " , the bridge is one of West Virginia 's most historically significant bridges . It is the oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge in West Virginia , and the oldest extant metal truss bridge in the state . The metal truss technology of the bridge displays distinctive innovations developed by the prominent civil engineers and bridge designers Squire Whipple and J. W. Murphy ; the innovations are evident in the bridge 's double @-@ intersection diagonals and counter @-@ diagonals with pin connections . 
 Approximately 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in width and 176 feet ( 54 m ) in length , the bridge is built atop a reinforced concrete abutment and pier . Its truss structure exhibits a double @-@ intersection configuration , constructed of 14 bays , each measuring approximately 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) wide and 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) in height , with the diagonals extending across two bays each . The bridge is fabricated of wrought iron bracketed with pins . Spanning the full length of the bridge is a wooden pedestrian walkway that consists of an observation deck and wooden seating near the bridge 's midspan . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Whipple truss development = = = 
 The bridge 's Whipple truss technology was developed in 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple , who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year . Whipple was one of the first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge , and his groundbreaking 1847 book , A Work on Bridge Building , had a significant influence on bridge engineering . Whipple 's truss bridge design incorporated double @-@ intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss , thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays . Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple 's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections , which utilized pins instead of trunnions . Murphy 's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges . In 1863 , Murphy designed the first pin @-@ connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals . Murphy 's truss design consisted of double @-@ intersection counter @-@ diagonals , and along with the eyebar and pin connections , permitted longer iron bridge spans . 
 The technological design advances made by Whipple and Murphy , in addition to further advances in steel and iron fabrication , made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States . The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple – Murphy truss bridge , since it incorporated Murphy 's later modifications with double @-@ intersections and horizontal chords . At the time of the bridge 's original fabrication in 1874 , metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance . These entities provided the desired width , length , and other specifications , and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams . Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible , could span longer distances , and were simpler to construct than stone bridges , and they were more durable than wooden bridges . They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled . The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia . While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s , the bridges were commonly disassembled and re @-@ erected for use on secondary roads , as was the case with the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938 . 
 = = = T. B. White and Sons = = = 
 The construction company that built the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge , T. B. White and Sons , was established in 1868 . Its founder Timothy B. White had been a carpenter and contractor in New Brighton , Pennsylvania since the 1840s . White also operated factories for iron cars and woolen mill machinery until 1859 , when he began to concentrate solely on bridge construction . White 's bridge company operated from a factory on the Beaver River in New Brighton until the factory was destroyed by fire in 1878 . After the fire , the company relocated across the river to Beaver Falls and restructured as the Penn Bridge and Machine Works . In addition to iron truss bridges , the company produced a range of structural and architectural components and continued to expand ; it employed over 500 workers by 1908 . Penn Bridge and Machine Works fended off purchase by the American Bridge Company and continued to operate independently , unlike similar small bridge companies founded in the 19th century . The most prolific of its kind in the Pittsburgh region , the company was responsible for the construction of bridges throughout the United States . 
 = = = South Branch Bridge = = = 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge ( or the Romney Bridge ) , a larger two @-@ span Whipple truss bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike ( U.S. Route 50 ) across the South Branch Potomac River 0 @.@ 57 miles ( 0 @.@ 92 km ) west of Romney . The 1874 Whipple truss bridge across the South Branch replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that had been chartered by the Virginia General Assembly during the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike . Before the construction of the covered bridge in 1838 , a public ferry conveyed traffic across the river . Isaac Parsons ( 1752 – 1796 ) operated a ferry there following its establishment by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in October 1786 . The 1838 covered bridge remained in use until it was destroyed by retreating Confederate forces during the American Civil War . Throughout the course of the war , Romney reportedly changed hands 56 times between Confederate and Union forces , and the crossing of the South Branch Potomac River served as a strategic point due to its position along the Northwestern Turnpike , an important east – west route . 
 Following the conclusion of the war , nearly all bridges along the Northwestern Turnpike had been destroyed , including the South Branch Bridge . In order to restore local businesses and industry , Hampshire County citizens called a meeting and steps were taken at the local level to proceed with the construction of new bridges . Local citizens and the South Branch Intelligencer newspaper of Romney campaigned for the immediate replacement of the bridge because of " continual risk , danger and inconveniences arising from want of the South Branch Bridge at Col. Gibson 's ( destroyed during the war ) ... " . Hampshire County began issuing bonds for the construction of a new bridge over the South Branch in 1868 , and by 1874 , construction of the Whipple truss bridge had commenced . T. B. White and Sons were charged with the bridge 's construction . 
 The South Branch Intelligencer published periodic updates on the progress of the South Branch Bridge 's construction . According to the newspaper , the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875 . During the course of construction , John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge . The new South Branch Bridge was completed well ahead of schedule in October 1874 . The October 12 , 1874 , edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a " complete , handsome and durable structure " , and further recounted that " the contractors , Messrs. White & Sons , New Brighton , Pennsylvania ' Penn Bridge & Machine Works , ' have given us , in general opinion , a first rate , durable work , and deserve our best commendations .... We are confident that ours will realize a very handsome income and fully vindicate the wisdom of the County Court in voting its construction . " 
 Following its construction in 1874 , the Whipple truss bridge over the South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years . In 1935 , the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge , and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936 . In November of that year , a car collided with the south side of the eastern Whipple truss span , which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment . The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River , followed by the compromised truss span , which collapsed on top of the car . Unaware of the span 's collapse , a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge 's center pier , and fell onto the collapsed span . According to the Hampshire Review , the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg . Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span , a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment , so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21 , 1937 . The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge . 
 = = = Capon Lake Bridge = = = 
 Because Whipple truss bridges were easily disassembled and re @-@ erected , the remaining western span of the Whipple truss over the South Branch was dismantled in 1937 and relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to convey Capon Springs Road ( West Virginia Secondary Route 16 ) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs . According to Branson Himelwright , a Capon Springs resident who had been a construction worker involved in the re @-@ erection of the Whipple truss span at Capon Lake , the only two ways to cross the Cacapon River to reach Capon Springs were to cross a swinging footbridge or ford the river . During the bridge 's construction , a new pier and abutments were constructed to carry the Whipple truss span and a connected Pratt truss that had been salvaged from an unknown bridge . Himelwright and Jacob " Moss " Rudolph , who had also participated in the bridge 's construction , stated in interviews that both the site excavation and concrete work for the pier and abutments were completed by hand . 
 The newly erected Capon Lake Bridge was dedicated on August 20 , 1938 , with a ceremony including musical performances by the Romney High School and Capon Springs Resort bands . Former West Virginia Governor and Capon Springs native Herman G. Kump , West Virginia State Road Commission Secretary Cy Hammill , and numerous other state officials were in attendance at the dedication . 
 In 1991 , the new steel stringer Capon Lake Bridge was constructed 187 feet ( 57 m ) to the southwest of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge , after which the Whipple truss bridge was closed to vehicle traffic . Due to its rarity , age , and engineering significance , West Virginia Division of Highways District 5 decided to preserve the Whipple truss bridge . During the bridge 's restoration , the Pratt truss span was removed due to significant deterioration , and the roadway deck was also removed . A wooden pedestrian walkway and observation deck were constructed across the full span of the remaining truss bridge . 
 The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15 , 2011 , for its " engineering significance as an excellent example of a Whipple / Murphy Truss bridge . " Since its listing , the bridge has been maintained as a historic site for pedestrians by the West Virginia Division of Highways District 5 . In 2012 , the West Virginia Division of Highways , in association with the West Virginia Archives and the history department of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History , installed a historical marker at the northwestern entry to the bridge as part of the West Virginia Highway Historical Marker Program . The marker reads : 
 First erected in 1874 as a two span bridge on US 50 near Romney , one span was moved here in 1938 and re @-@ erected on a new foundation . The 17 ' wide by 176 ' long bridge is a Whipple – Murphy Truss . The state 's oldest extant metal truss , the bridge is one of a few of its type in WV . Listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 .

 Delorentos are a critically acclaimed Dublin @-@ based Irish alternative rock band , formed in 2005 . The band consist of four members : <unk> ( vocals , guitar , piano ) , Kier ( vocals , guitar ) , <unk> ( Bass , Keys , backing vocals ) and Ross ( drums , backing vocals ) . 
 The band 's sound is based around having four singer @-@ songwriters , with each member taking lead vocals on various albums ' tracks and singles . In 2013 they won the Choice Music Prize Irish Album of the Year for " Little Sparks " . 
 The band 's early sound was rooted in post @-@ punk and pop but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music . In 2010 , they began experimenting with acoustic music , ( obvious in 2014 release " Unbroken , Untied " ) a theme that would expand and develop their sound and audience . 
 The band have released five critically acclaimed albums ; 2007 's In Love with Detail , 2009 's You Can Make Sound , 2012 's Little Sparks , 2014 's Acoustic album , Unbroken , Untied , and 2014 's Night Becomes Light . 
 The band 's debut album In Love with Detail was critically acclaimed in Ireland , being nominated for the Choice Music Prize and in the Best Irish Album category at the 2007 Meteor Awards , at which Delorentos were also nominated for Best New Irish Band . Delorentos spent much of 2008 working on their second album , playing few live shows . By early 2009 , they were reported to be performing with Director as both bands showcased material from their second albums . However , on 17 February 2009 , Delorentos announced on their MySpace and official website that <unk> Yourell had decided to leave the band . The entire band subsequently announced a split but rescinded this decision two months later . Their second album You Can Make Sound was released on 9 October 2009 and led to two more Meteor nominations for Delorentos in 2010 . Since then , their third album Little Sparks was released with much fanfare and an innovative release and went on to win <unk> ' Choice Music Prize . 
 Aside from headline shows , Delorentos have opened a number of high @-@ profile shows throughout their career , including 2013 support slots for Bruce Springsteen in Kilkenny , in 2007 with Sinéad O 'Connor at Heineken Green Energy , the Dave Matthews Band at the Point Theatre and Arctic Monkeys , Supergrass and The Coral at Malahide Castle . The band have also played with the likes of Idlewild , Gang of Four , Bell X1 and The Futureheads in locations such as London , New York City , Chicago , Madrid and Toronto .

They have also had several songs feature on the PlayStation 3 karaoke video game , SingStar . 
 The band announced on 31 July 2014 that they had signed a deal with Universal Music to release their new album Night Becomes Light .

 Each of the band members were in other bands prior to Delorentos , sometimes playing together , in what Conlan once described as " a weird web of bands through schools and colleges , until the four of us came together " . McGuinness started playing with McCormick 's school band around 1999 , with Conlan joining the band soon after that . After this band failed , McCormick played with Yourell for a while , with McCormick and Conlan having played in a band together as well . Yourell then worked in France for a time but later returned to Ireland . Eventually the four grouped together to form Delorentos , whose name was taken from an older band in which a number of them featured . They were , by their own admission , " shite " until they went to Chicago to play " a rake of gigs " . McCormick and Conlan were in college in the earlier days of the band 's career . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Their first release , the EP , Leave It On , was an entirely independent one and was launched in Whelan 's in Dublin . The band collectively provided an amount of cash to record it at the start of 2005 . McGuinness had a job so provided the money , with the rest of the band paying him back . Leave It On was released on the band 's Delo Records label , with Cottage Records distributing it . Produced by Marc Carolan the four @-@ track EP was released in Ireland in November 2005 , entering the Top 30 of the Irish Singles Chart . The single , " Leave it On " , went straight to number one in the Irish Singles Chart . Delorentos followed this with a tour which included an appearance at the UK industry show In The City ( festival ) and they were invited to participate in the 2006 series of RTÉ 's annual Other Voices music show . This was followed in May 2006 by another single , " The Rules " , which debuted in the Irish Singles Chart at number fourteen and spent a total of three weeks in this chart . 
 Just prior to this , Delorentos had come to wider attention when they represented Ireland at the National Student Music Awards ( <unk> ) in Dublin on 31 March 2005 , where they were chosen as the Best Student Artist in the UK and Ireland . As part of their prize , they received free recording time at the BBC 's Maida Vale recording studios and were invited onto the UK television show CD : UK , on which they confirmed the UK release date of their debut EP Leave It On . The band followed this with another Irish tour and appeared on The Cafe in 2006 and 2007 . They toured with other more established bands such as Idlewild , Bell X1 , Whitey , The Futureheads , Gang of Four and Tapes ' n Tapes in locations such as London , New York City , Chicago and Toronto . Delorentos featured at both Oxegen and Electric Picnic in 2006 , becoming the first unsigned act to perform at both festivals . In February 2007 , they released the single , " Basis of Everything " , to coincide with US dates in New York City and a series of performances at South by South West . 
 = = = In Love with Detail = = = 
 Delorentos recorded their debut album in Dublin 's Sun and Apollo Studios with Gareth Mannix . In Love with Detail was released on their own Cottage Records label on 20 April 2007 . The album entered the Irish Albums Chart at number seven , spending five weeks in that chart , and later received a nomination for the Choice Music Prize . The majority of the album was written over the previous year . Later that year , Delorentos had festival slots at Oxegen , Electric Picnic and Cois <unk> . At that year 's Heineken Green Energy , the band supported Sinéad O 'Connor and <unk> , they supported the Dave Matthews Band at the Point Theatre on 23 May 2007 , and went on to open for Arctic Monkeys at Malahide Castle on two separate dates in June 2007 . The single " Stop " was released in July . A second EP , Do You Realise , was released in November , spending two weeks in the Irish Singles Chart and peaking at number thirty @-@ four . 
 Delorentos twice toured the United States during this time , including several dates in March 2008 . The Irish Times selected their South by Southwest performance in Austin , Texas in March 2008 as the best by any Irish act at the event . The band also performed at the <unk> Club in Barcelona , Spain . However , they kept a low enough profile on the Irish live circuit for much of the year , only performing at a small number of festivals , including Oxegen , the Bandon Music Festival and the Drogheda Arts Festival . The Irish Times noted their performance in Pet Sounds on the Sunday of Oxegen 2008 by reminiscing upon their performance from two years previously in front of a smaller crowd early on a Sunday morning . Performances of the singles " Basis of Everything " and " The Rules " at Oxegen 2008 were described as having " the kind of hummable sheen that sounds as perfect at a festival as on the radio " . Two extended plays were also been released to accompany their debut ; their debut release , titled Leave It On , in October 2005 , and the follow @-@ up EP , titled Do You Realise , came out in November 2007 . 
 = = = Brief split = = = 
 The band 's overall low profile in 2008 was initially thought to be due to them spending time working on their second album . However , in December 2008 , Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems . Added to this , the collapse of Pinnacle , their distribution company , denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom . Their blog entry stated that " these are strange times for everyone , and for us in the music industry there has been a lot of uncertainty . It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time . " After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director , Delorentos announced their break @-@ up on 17 February 2009 . The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to " do other things " . A MySpace entry stated : " It 's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band . He feels its best for him to move on and do other things . The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next " . However , they still planned to record their second album , believed to be titled You Can Make Sound , in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play " a gig or two " as part of a farewell tour . The band 's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan 's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork . Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The <unk> were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced , Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show , whilst blogger <unk> , John Walshe of State , Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band 's sound . On 22 April 2009 , the band announced they would not split after all , citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason . Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had " knocked us out of our stride " and had led to him considering his future .

The record was recorded over three months with engineer Colin Murphy , and Cenzo Townsend additionally mixing a number of tracks . The First single from the record , " Did we ever really Try " was released in October 2011 with an accompanying EP Magazine - written by the band with contributions from other artists and musicians . It reached number 10 on the charts , despite not being available in record stores , only the band 's own " pop @-@ up stores " . 
 The release was notable for its inventive release campaign : they toured acoustically to release the preceding EP , " Little Sparks EP " ( which was released as part of a full @-@ colour 40 @-@ page creative magazine ) , they slowly released their songs on YouTube as part of an Acoustic project , and they opened up their own pop @-@ up record shops to perform in on the week of release .

The band discussed this radical new idea on RTÉ 's " the Business with George Lee " and Today FM 's " The Last Word with Matt cooper " , and the shops were also written about in the Irish Times .

 = Disappearance of Madeleine McCann = 
 Madeleine Beth McCann ( b . 12 May 2003 ) disappeared on the evening of 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz , a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal , sparking what one newspaper called " the most heavily reported missing @-@ person case in modern history . " Her whereabouts remain unknown . 
 Madeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents , Kate and Gerry McCann , her younger twin siblings , and a group of family friends and their children . She and the twins had been left asleep at 20 : 30 in the ground @-@ floor apartment , while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 50 metres ( 160 ft ) away . The parents checked on the children throughout the evening , until Madeleine 's mother discovered she was missing at 22 : 00 . At first the Portuguese police seemed to accept that it was an abduction , but after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis they came to believe that Madeleine had died in the apartment . The McCanns were declared arguidos ( suspects ) in September 2007 but were cleared when Portugal 's attorney @-@ general archived the case in July 2008 . 
 The parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry , Operation Grange , in 2011 . In 2013 Scotland Yard released e @-@ fit images of men they wanted to trace , including one of a man seen carrying a child toward the beach that night . Shortly after this the Portuguese police reopened their inquiry . Operation Grange was scaled back in 2015 . 
 The disappearance attracted sustained international interest and saturation coverage in the UK reminiscent of the death of Diana in 1997 . The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and false allegations of involvement in their daughter 's death , particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter . They received damages and front @-@ page apologies in 2008 from Express Newspapers , In 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct , lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation .

 Madeleine was born in Leicester and lived with her family in <unk> , also in Leicestershire . At the request of her parents , she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance , which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf . Interpol described Madeleine as having blonde hair , blue and green eyes , a small brown spot on her left calf , and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye . In 2009 the McCanns released age @-@ progressed images of how she may have looked at age six , and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine . 
 = = = Kate and Gerry McCann = = = 
 Madeleine 's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics . Kate Marie McCann , née Healy ( born 1968 , Huyton , near Liverpool ) attended All Saints School in Anfield , then Notre Dame High School , Everton Valley , graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee . She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology , then <unk> , and finally general practice . 
 Gerald Patrick McCann ( born 1968 in Glasgow ) attended Holyrood Secondary School . He obtained a BSc in physiology / sports science from the University of Glasgow in 1989 , qualifying in medicine in 1992 . In 2002 he obtained his MD , a research degree , also from Glasgow . Since 2005 he has been a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital , Leicester . The McCanns met in 1993 in Glasgow and were married in 1998 . Madeleine was born in 2003 and the twins , a boy and girl , two years later . 
 = = = Tapas Seven = = = 
 The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all , including the McCanns ' three . The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20 : 30 in the resort 's tapas restaurant , as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven . The group consisted of marketing manager Jane Tanner and her partner , physician Russell O 'Brien , who were there with their two children ; physician Matthew Oldfield and his wife , recruitment consultant Rachael Oldfield , along with their daughter ; and physicians Fiona and David Payne , their two children , and Fiona Payne 's mother , Dianne Webster . Jane Tanner became an important witness , when she reported seeing a man carry a young girl away from the resort 50 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing . 
 = = 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva , Praia da Luz = = 
 The McCanns arrived on Saturday , 28 April 2007 , for their seven @-@ night spring break in Praia da Luz , a village with a population of 1 @,@ 000 , known as a " little Britain " because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers . They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd , and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva , an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool , one of several privately owned properties rented by the company . 
 5A was a two @-@ bedroom , ground @-@ floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village , which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner 's Ocean Club resort . ( The resort 's facilities were scattered throughout the town . ) Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B , Jane Tanner and Russell O 'Brien in 5D , and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor . 
 Located on the corner of Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins , 5A was accessible to the public from at least two sides . Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club 's ostensibly private pool , tennis courts , tapas restaurant and bar . The patio doors could be accessed via the ( public ) Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins , where a small gate and set of steps led up to 5A 's balcony and living room . 5A 's front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club , on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva . 
 The McCanns ' three children slept in a bedroom next to the front door , which the McCanns kept locked . The bedroom had one waist @-@ high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter , the latter controlled by a cord inside the window ; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday . The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents ' car park , which was separated by a low wall from the street . Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door , on the opposite side of the room from the window , while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room . There was another , empty , single bed underneath the window .

 = = = Tapas restaurant = = = 
 Thursday , 3 May , was the penultimate day of the family 's holiday . Over breakfast Madeleine asked : " Why didn 't you come when [ her brother ] and I cried last night ? " After the disappearance , her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children 's bedroom . Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine 's Eeyore pyjama top . 
 The children spent the morning in the resort 's Kids ' Club , then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool . Madeleine 's mother took the last known photograph of Madeleine that afternoon , sitting by the pool next to her father and two @-@ year @-@ old sister . The children returned to Kids ' Club , and at 18 : 00 their mother took them back to 5A , while their father went for a tennis lesson . 
 The McCanns put the children to bed around 19 : 00 . Madeleine was left asleep in short @-@ sleeved , pink @-@ and @-@ white Marks and Spencer 's Eeyore pyjamas , next to her comfort blanket and soft toy Cuddle Cat . At 20 : 30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club 's open @-@ air tapas restaurant , 50 metres ( 160 ft ) as the crow flies on the other side of the pool , a walk of 30 – 45 seconds , according to Madeleine 's mother . The staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming @-@ pool reception area , asking that the same table , which overlooked the apartments , be block @-@ booked for 20 : 30 for the McCanns and friends . The message said the group 's children were asleep in the apartments . Madeleine 's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note . 
 The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half @-@ hour to check on their children . 5A 's patio doors could only be locked from the inside , so to allow them to enter that way , the McCanns had left the patio curtains drawn and the doors closed but unlocked . They had also closed the child @-@ safety gate at the top of the patio stairs and the gate at the bottom leading to the street . Madeleine 's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21 : 05 . The children were asleep and all was well , except that he recalled having left the children 's bedroom door slightly ajar , and now it stood almost wide open ; he pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant . This was the last time either of the McCanns saw Madeleine . 
 = = = Tanner sighting = = = 
 The sighting by Jane Tanner , one of the Tapas Seven , of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation . She had left the restaurant just after 21 : 00 to check on her own daughter , passing Madeleine 's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21 : 05 check . He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker , but neither man recalled having seen Tanner . This became an issue that puzzled the Portuguese police , given how narrow the street was , and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting . 
 At c . 21 : 10 Tanner noticed a man with a child cross the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her , heading east , away from the Ocean Club . He was carrying a barefoot child wearing light @-@ coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs . She described the man as white , dark @-@ haired , 5 ft 7 in ( 1 @.@ 70 m ) tall , of southern European or Mediterranean appearance , 35 – 40 years old , wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket , and said he did not look like a tourist . Tanner told the Portuguese police , but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May . Madeleine 's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man ( right ) , which was released in October 2007 . 
 Although Tanner had not seen the man 's face , the sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction , but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring . In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen , and that he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche . Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night , and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported . The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner 's report . Scotland Yard said they were " almost certain " the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction . 
 = = = Smith sighting = = = 
 Another sighting of a man carrying a child that night was reported by Martin and Mary Smith , on holiday from Ireland . Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine 's kidnap . 
 The Smiths saw the man at around 22 : 00 on Rua da Escola <unk> , 500 yards ( 457 m ) from the McCanns ' apartment , walking toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach . He was carrying a girl aged 3 – 4 years . She had blonde hair and pale skin , was wearing light @-@ coloured pyjamas and had bare feet . The man was mid @-@ 30s , 5 ft 7 in – 5 ft 9 in ( 1 @.@ 75 – 1 @.@ 80 m ) , slim @-@ to @-@ normal build , with short brown hair , wearing cream or beige trousers . He did not look like a tourist , according to the Smiths , and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child . 
 = = = Reported missing = = = 
 Madeleine 's mother had intended to check on the children at 21 : 30 , but Matthew Oldfield , one of the Tapas Seven , offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door . He noticed that the McCanns ' children 's bedroom door was wide open , but after hearing no noise he left their apartment without looking far enough into the room to see whether Madeleine was in bed . He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at that point . Early on in the investigation the Portuguese police accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check , suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window . 
 Kate made her own check at around 22 : 00 . Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this . Kate recalled entering the apartment through the patio doors at the back , and noticed that the children 's bedroom door was wide open . When she tried to close the door it slammed shut as though there was a draught , which is when she found that the bedroom window and its shutter were open . Madeleine 's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed , but Madeleine was gone . After briefly searching the apartment Kate ran back towards the restaurant , screaming that someone had taken Madeleine . 
 At around 22 : 10 Madeleine 's father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort 's reception desk to call the police , and at 22 : 30 the resort activated its missing @-@ child search protocol . Sixty staff and guests searched until 04 : 30 , at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off . One of them told Channel 4 's Dispatches that , from one end of Luz to the other , you could hear people shouting her name . 
 = = Early response = = 
 = = = Police = = = 
 Two officers from the gendarmerie , the Guarda Nacional Republicana ( GNR ) , arrived at the resort at 23 : 10 from Lagos , five miles ( 8 km ) away . At midnight , after briefly searching , they alerted the criminal police , the Polícia Judiciária ; the latter said their officers arrived within 10 minutes of that alert . Two patrol dogs were brought to the resort at 2 am and four search @-@ and @-@ rescue dogs at 8 am . Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways , wells , caves , sewers and ruins . 
 It was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made , perhaps the most serious of which was that the crime scene was not secured . Around 20 people entered apartment 5A before it was closed off , according to Chief Inspector <unk> de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária . According to Madeleine 's mother , an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children 's bedroom , but left at 3 am without securing the apartment . The Polícia Judiciária case file , released in 2008 , showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance , then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests . 
 A similar situation arose outside the apartment . A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A , including next to the children 's bedroom window through which an abductor may have entered or left , trampling on potentially important evidence . An officer dusted the bedroom window 's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing . 
 Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours , and officers did not appear to make extensive door @-@ to @-@ door inquiries . According to Madeleine 's mother , roadblocks were first put in place at 10 am the next morning . Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night , or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border ; the company that monitors the road , <unk> , said they were not approached for information . It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing @-@ person alert . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 Criminal investigations in Portugal are governed by a secrecy clause in its penal code , which means there are no official press briefings . One journalist wrote that this leads to a culture of " leak , not speak " and a proliferation of gossip that is hard for others to counter without breaking the law . A Polícia Judiciária officer acknowledged in 2010 that they had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start , because the couple turned the inquiry into what the officer called a " media circus . " Owen Jones described it as " something approaching mass hysteria . " 
 Bell Pottinger , representing Mark Warner Ltd , dealt with the media for the first ten days , then the British government sent in press officers . The first was Sheree Dodd , a former Daily Mirror journalist , then Clarence Mitchell , director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information . When the government withdrew Mitchell , Justine McGuinness , a non @-@ government PR representative , took over until September 2007 , then another PR company , Hanover , was briefly involved . In September Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor , and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell 's salary ( later paid by Madeleine 's Fund ) ; Mitchell resigned from his position and started working for the McCanns . 
 Madeleine appeared on the cover of People magazine on 28 May 2007 , and on 30 May the McCanns and a group of journalists flew to Rome , in a Learjet belonging to British businessman Sir Philip Green , to meet Pope Benedict XVI . Placing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30 @,@ 000 extra copies . She was on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months and became one of Sky News 's menu options . The Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã published 384 articles about her between May 2007 and July 2008 . By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3 @,@ 700 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube .

 = = = Witness statements = = = 
 Witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A on the day of the disappearance , Thursday , 3 May 2007 , and in the days leading up to it . Scotland Yard believe the men may have been engaged in reconnaissance for an abduction or burglary . 
 Between 15 : 30 and 17 : 30 on 3 May , two black @-@ haired men visited apartments close to 5A , ostensibly collecting for orphanages . One was seen in the McCanns ' block at 16 : 00 . On 20 April a bedraggled @-@ looking man rang on a tourist 's doorbell to say in broken English that he was collecting money for an orphanage . She described him as 38 – 45 years old , with a sallow complexion , lank dark hair , moustache and large teeth . 
 On 3 May a man was seen walking through a gate leading away from the apartments ; he tried to close the gate quietly , with both hands , and looked around as he left . At 14 : 30 two blonde @-@ haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C , an empty apartment two doors from 5A . At 16 : 00 – 17 : 00 a blonde @-@ haired man was seen near 5A . At 18 : 00 the same or another blonde @-@ haired man was seen standing in the stairwell of the McCanns ' block . At 23 : 00 , an hour after the disappearance was reported , two blonde @-@ haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices . When they realized they had been noticed , they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away . 
 A witness reported seeing a blonde @-@ haired man on 29 April on Rua do <unk> , and again on 2 May across the road from 5A . She remembered him because he made her uneasy : she described him as " ugly , " with pitted skin and a large nose . That day or the next a different witness saw a man standing by a wall near the car park next to the pool . He was staring at the McCanns ' apartment block , where a white van was parked . 
 At 8 am on Monday , 30 April , a girl whose grandparents used to own 5A saw a blonde @-@ haired man leaning against a wall on a path behind the apartments , and saw him again on 2 May near the car park by the pool and Tapas restaurant , looking at 5A . She described him as Caucasian , mid @-@ 30s , short cropped hair , " ugly " with spots . He was wearing a black leather jacket , a light @-@ coloured T @-@ shirt , jeans with a belt , trainers , and thick @-@ framed sunglasses . 
 = = = First arguido = = = 
 The first person given arguido ( suspect ) status , 12 days after the disappearance , was a local British @-@ Portuguese property consultant , Robert Murat . As with the McCanns , Murat found himself at the centre of media allegations that continued for months . Murat lived in his mother 's home , 150 yards ( 137 m ) from apartment 5A in the direction the man in the Tanner sighting had walked . He was made an arguido after a British tabloid journalist told police he had been asking questions about the case . The police had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter . 
 Three members of the Tapas Seven said they had seen Murat near the resort on the evening Madeleine disappeared , although he and his mother said he had been at home all evening . The house was searched , the pool drained , his cars , computers , phones and video tapes examined , his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs , and two of his associates were questioned . There was nothing to link him to the disappearance , and he was cleared on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived . The Portuguese case was re @-@ opened in 2013 , and in 2014 Murat was questioned as a witness by the Polícia Judiciária , this time on behalf of Scotland Yard . 
 = = = McCanns as arguidos = = = 
 = = = = Early suspicion = = = = 
 An early indication for the McCanns that the tide was turning against them publicly came on 6 June 2007 , when a German journalist asked them during a press conference in Berlin whether they were involved in Madeleine 's disappearance . On 30 June the first of a series of articles critical of the couple appeared in Sol , a Portuguese weekly . The reporters had the names and mobile numbers of the Tapas Seven and at least one other witness , so there appeared to have been a leak from within the inquiry . 
 This and later articles in the Portuguese press , almost invariably followed up in the UK , made several allegations , based on no evidence , that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media . They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were " swingers , " that there was a " pact of silence " between them regarding what happened the night of the disappearance , and that the McCanns had been sedating their children . 
 Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns ' and Tapas Seven 's statements , perhaps the result of translation problems . The police had asked questions in Portuguese , the interviewees had replied in English , and an interpreter had translated . The officer had then typed up a statement in Portuguese , which was verbally translated into English for the interviewee to sign . The likelihood that misunderstandings would emerge was high . 
 Among the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children . According to the Polícia Judiciária case file , Gerry McCann told them during his first interview on 4 May 2007 that they had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21 : 05 and her 22 : 00 checks , and in a second interview on 10 May that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back . There was also an inconsistency regarding whether the front door had been locked that night . He told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that the couple had used the front door during their checks earlier in the week , but it was next to the children 's bedroom so they had started using the patio doors instead . 
 Another issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine 's bedroom window could be opened from outside . Kate McCann said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed , and both were open when she discovered Madeleine was missing . Her husband told the Polícia Judiciária that , when he was first alerted to the disappearance , he had lowered the shutter , then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised from the outside . 
 Against this , the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced , but there was no sign of forced entry . According to journalist Danny Collins , the shutter was made of non @-@ ferrous metal slats linked together on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window , controlled by pulling on a strap . He writes that the shutter was gravity @-@ fed ; once rolled down , the slats locked in place outside the window and could only be raised using the strap on the inside . 
 The discrepancy contributed to the view of the Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction . Even Kate 's shout of " they 've taken her " was viewed with suspicion , as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story . The suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in the apartment as a result of an accident — perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep — and that her parents had hidden her body for a month , before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance . 
 = = = = British sniffer dogs = = = = 
 In July 2007 Mark Harrison , the national search adviser to the British National Policing Improvement Agency arrived in Praia da Luz to help with the ground search , and recommended bringing in Keela and Eddie , two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire . Keela was a crime @-@ scene @-@ investigation ( CSI ) dog trained to alert her handler , Martin Grime , to traces of human blood . Eddie was an enhanced @-@ victim @-@ recovery dog ( <unk> ) , who alerted to the scent of human cadavers . 
 The dogs were taken to two beaches , Robert Murat 's house and several Ocean Club apartments . Both dogs gave alerts only in apartment 5A , including behind the sofa in the living room , and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine 's parents had used . On 2 August the Polícia Judiciária told the McCanns that an anomaly had arisen , and removed boxes and suitcases of clothes from the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores , as well as Madeleine 's Cuddle Cat . They also took a diary that Kate McCann had started after the disappearance and a friend 's Bible she had borrowed . A passage the Bible 's owner had marked from 2 Samuel , about the death of a child , became another item of interest ; it was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation . On 6 August they took the Renault Scenic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing . 
 Keela and Eddie were placed in a room with the clothes and other items , and taken to an underground public car park where the McCanns ' car was parked alongside others , including Robert Murat 's . Eddie , the cadaver dog , gave an alert outside the McCanns ' car and inside the boot ( trunk ) . One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat , Kate McCann 's clothes and the Bible . According to the Sunday Times , it seemed apparent from a video released by the Ministério Público that the handler was directing the dogs to particular spots inside the apartment and to the McCanns ' car . The McCanns ' lawyer said that , if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate 's clothes , it might have been caused by her contact with the deceased as a family doctor . 
 = = = = British DNA analysis = = = = 
 Hair and other fibres were collected from areas in the apartment and car that Keela and Eddie had reacted to , and sent to the Forensic Science Service ( FSS ) in Birmingham for DNA profiling , arriving around 8 August 2007 . The FSS used a technique known as low copy number ( <unk> ) DNA analysis . This is used when only a few cells are available ; the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation . 
 On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police , the liaison between the British and Portuguese police . Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine 's DNA components , and that the result was " too complex for meaningful interpretation " : 
 A complex <unk> [ low copy number ] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section ... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart . ... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item ; there are 37 components in total . There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors ; but there could be up to five contributors . In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation / inclusion . 
 At this point , according to the Sunday Times , the Polícia Judiciária " abandoned the abduction theory . " The FSS email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September . The next day , according to Madeleine 's mother , the Polícia Judiciária proposed that , if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that she had hidden the body , she might only serve a two @-@ year sentence ; her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave . Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September . They were interviewed that day and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions ; Gerry did answer them , but Kate declined . The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine 's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in the apartment . 
 Journalists in Portugal were told that the DNA evidence was a " 100 percent match . " British tabloid headlines included " Corpse in McCann Car " ( London Evening Standard ) and " Brit Lab Bombshell : Car DNA is 100 % Maddie 's " ( Sun ) , while another reported that " a clump of Maddie 's hair " had been found in the car . Jerry Lawton , a reporter with the Daily Star , a British tabloid , told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police . Matt Baggott , who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire police , the force that coordinated the British input , told the inquiry that he knew the DNA evidence was being wrongly interpreted , but because the Portuguese were in charge of the inquiry , he made a decision not to correct reporters who had been told the McCanns were involved . His force 's priority , he said , was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine . 
 = = = = McCanns return to the UK = = = = 
 Despite their arguido status , the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal and arrived back in England on 9 September 2007 . The following day Tavares de Almeida , head of the Polícia Judiciária in <unk> , signed a police report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident , and that the McCanns had concealed the body and faked an abduction . On 11 September the 10 @-@ volume case file was passed to a judge , Pedro Miguel dos <unk> Frias , who authorized the seizure of Madeleine 's mother 's diary and her father 's laptop . The McCanns had taken both items back to England , although the police had retained a copy of the diary . 
 On 24 September Control Risks , a British security company , took hair samples from the McCann twins at their parents ' request . An anonymous donor paid for Control Risks ' services . The McCanns were concerned that the abductor might have given the children sedatives ; the twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing , but despite requests the Portuguese police had not taken samples . Control Risks took a sample from Kate McCann too , to rebut allegations that she was on medication . No trace of drugs was found . 
 In October 2007 Gonçalo Amaral , the inquiry 's coordinator in Portugal , was removed from his post after telling a newspaper that the British police only pursued leads that were helpful to the McCanns . He was replaced by Paulo Rebelo , deputy national director of the Polícia Judiciária . The team of detectives was expanded and a case review began . On 29 November four members of the Portuguese investigation , including Francisco Corte @-@ Real , vice @-@ president of Portugal 's forensic crime service , were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the Forensic Science Service . 
 = = = Investigation closed ( July 2008 ) = = = 
 The Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008 , with the Polícia Judiciária , including Paulo Rebelo , in attendance . The Polícia Judiciária planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz , using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors , but it was cancelled when the Tapas Seven declined to participate . The poor relationship between the McCanns and the Portuguese police was evident again that month when , on the day the couple were at the European Parliament in Brussels to promote a monitoring system for missing children , transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television . The national director of the Polícia Judiciária , <unk> Ribeiro , resigned not long after this , citing media pressure from the investigation ; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects . 
 As of May 2008 Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns , including abandonment of a child , abduction , homicide and concealment of a corpse . Two months later , on 21 July , the Portuguese Attorney General announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance , that their arguido status had been lifted and the case closed . On 4 August Ministério Público released 11 @,@ 233 pages of the case file to the media on CD @-@ ROM . 
 Days after the case closed , excerpts from Kate McCann 's diary , which had been taken by the Polícia Judiciária in August 2007 for the sniffer dogs , were published without her permission by a Portuguese tabloid , Correio da Manhã , translated from English to Portuguese , despite a Portuguese judge 's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed . On 14 September 2008 one of the News International tabloids , the News of the World , also published the extracts , again without permission and now translated poorly back into English .

 The bad feeling between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that the officer who had coordinated the investigation from May to October 2007 , Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral , resigned in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that the McCanns had faked an abduction . The McCanns had had little or no contact with Amaral , then @-@ head of the Polícia Judiciária in <unk> , during the Madeleine inquiry . After telling a Portuguese newspaper in October 2007 that the British police only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns , he had been transferred to Faro . Three days after the case closed in July 2008 , his book , Maddie : A <unk> da <unk> ( " Maddie : The Truth of the Lie " ) , was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz . By November 2008 it had sold 180 @,@ 000 copies . 
 The McCanns began a libel action in 2009 and in 2015 were awarded over € 600 @,@ 000 in damages and interest by a court in Lisbon . The decision was overturned in 2016 . A judge issued an injunction against further publication or sales of the book in 2009 , but the Court of Appeal in Lisbon overturned the ban in 2010 , stating that it violated Amaral 's freedom of expression . The ban was reinstated as part of the libel ruling , and was lifted when Amaral 's appeal succeeded in 2016 . 
 Amaral was himself an arguido in another case during the McCann inquiry . A month after she went missing , he and four other officers were charged with offences related to their investigation into the disappearance of Joana Cipriano , an eight @-@ year @-@ old Portuguese girl who vanished in 2004 from Figueira , seven miles ( 11 km ) from Praia da Luz . Her body was never found , and no murder weapon was identified . Her mother , Leonor Cipriano , launched a campaign to find her daughter , but she and her brother were convicted of murder after confessing to the killing . The mother retracted her confession , saying she had been beaten by police ; the police accounted for bruising on her face and body by saying she had thrown herself down stairs in the police station . Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place , but was accused of having covered up for others . He was convicted in 2009 of perjury related to that investigation and received an 18 @-@ month suspended sentence .

 = = = Madeleine 's Fund , private detectives = = = 
 The family set up a limited company in May 2007 to finance the search , Madeleine 's Fund : Leaving No Stone Unturned . Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward in September that year to help the McCanns financially . Appeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain . Over £ 2 @.@ 6 million was raised , and the News of the World offered a reward of £ 1 @.@ 5 million . The Fund was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns ' mortgage payments when they were unable to work , before they were made arguidos . 
 Madeleine 's Fund hired several firms of private investigators , which caused friction with the Portuguese police . Shortly after the disappearance , an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company , Control Risks . Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency , <unk> 3 , for six months for £ 50 @,@ 000 a month . The company had 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco , and Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 to look into one sighting . 
 Investigators working for the McCanns attempted to question a British paedophile , Raymond Hewlett , in May 2009 ; he denied involvement , declined to speak to them , and died of cancer in Germany in December that year . Dave Edgar , a retired detective working for the McCanns , released an e @-@ fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona , Spain , shortly after the disappearance , whether they were there to deliver her new daughter . Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008 , and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer , Stephen Birch , who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz . 
 = = = Oakley International = = = 
 In 2008 Madeleine 's Fund hired Oakley International , a Washington , <unk> detective agency , for over £ 500 @,@ 000 for six months . The company owner , Kevin <unk> , was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation . Oakley sent a five @-@ man team to Portugal . Led by Henri Exton , a former British police officer who had worked for MI5 , the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community . 
 Exton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21 : 15 near apartment 5A , and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22 : 00 . The Oakley team produced e @-@ fits based on the Smiths ' description . This was a sensitive issue , because in September 2007 Martin Smith had watched footage of the McCanns arriving in the UK from Portugal , and believed he recognized Gerry McCann as the man he had seen with the child at 22 : 00 in Praia da Luz . Smith came to accept that he was mistaken : at 22 : 00 witnesses placed Gerry McCann in the tapas restaurant . Nevertheless , the publication of the Smith e @-@ fits , which bore some resemblance to Gerry , would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns . 
 Exton submitted his report to Madeleine 's Fund in November 2008 , but the Fund told Exton that the report and its <unk> had to remain confidential . The relationship between the company and the Fund soured , in part because of a dispute over fees , and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends ; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors . The Fund passed the e @-@ fits to the police – the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009 , and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011 – but did not otherwise release them . Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book , Madeleine ( 2011 ) , although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial . Scotland Yard released the e @-@ fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction .

 = = = Operation Grange = = = 
 At the request of the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson , the Home Office began discussions in 2010 with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a new investigation . In May 2011 , under Home Secretary Theresa May , Scotland Yard launched an investigative review , Operation Grange , with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians . The inquiry , which by June 2015 had cost £ <unk> , was financed by a government contingency fund at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron , reportedly after News International persuaded the government to involve the British police . 
 The team was led by Commander Simon Foy . Detective Chief Inspector ( DCI ) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard 's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer , reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell . Redwood retired in December 2014 and was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall . The investigation was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four . The Home Office funded the final months of the investigation in 2016 to the tune of £ 95 @,@ 000 . 
 The Operation Grange team had tens of thousands of documents translated , released an updated age @-@ progressed image of Madeleine , and investigated 560 lines in inquiry and 8 @,@ 685 potential sightings of Madeleine . By 2015 they had taken 1 @,@ 338 statements , collected 1 @,@ 027 exhibits , and investigated 60 persons of interest , as well as 650 sex offenders . 
 = = = Burglary theory = = = 
 By 2013 Scotland Yard were focusing on the theory that Madeleine was taken during a burglary gone wrong . There had been a fourfold increase in burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 . They included two in the McCanns ' block , during which intruders entered through apartment windows , in the three weeks before the disappearance . In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC 's Crimewatch staged a reconstruction — broadcast in the UK , Netherlands and Germany — during which they released several e @-@ fits , including Oakley International 's e @-@ fit of the Smith sighting and of men seen near the McCanns ' apartment on and around the day of the disappearance . 
 Days after Crimewatch aired , Portugal 's attorney general reopened the Portuguese investigation , citing new evidence . Mobile @-@ phone tracking techniques showed that the phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort on the evening of the disappearance . He was identified in the media as originally from Cape Verde , West Africa , who had died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft ; the suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit . 
 In June 2014 Scotland Yard and the Polícia Judiciária , accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs , searched drains and dug in 60 @,@ 000 sq metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz . Several interviews took place in Praia da Luz in July and December 2014 , conducted by the Polícia Judiciária at the request of Scotland Yard , with the latter in attendance . In July four Portuguese citizens were interviewed ; one , an associate of Robert Murat ( an arguido in 2007 ) , was first questioned shortly after the disappearance . Eleven people were interviewed in December . They included Robert Murat , his wife and her ex @-@ husband ; a 30 @-@ year @-@ old former tourist @-@ bus driver for the Ocean Club ; and the former driver 's 24 @-@ year @-@ old and 53 @-@ year @-@ old associates . The latter three men had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance . They admitted having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine . 
 = = = Other inquiries = = = 
 Other Scotland Yard inquiries included an effort to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared , including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British <unk> . They made inquiries about two convicted paedophiles in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder ; the men were running a window @-@ cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing , and one was said to resemble the Smith sighting . Another focus of the inquiry was Urs Hans von <unk> , a deceased Swiss man implicated in the July 2007 murder of five @-@ year @-@ old <unk> <unk> . Von <unk> was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared . 
 Scotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in 12 incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2010 , two of them in Praia da Luz . On four occasions he had sexually assaulted five white girls , aged 7 – 10 , in their beds . The man spoke English with a foreign accent , his speech was slow and perhaps slurred , and he had short , dark unkempt hair , tanned skin , and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell . He may have worn a long @-@ sleeved burgundy top , perhaps with a white circle on the back . The Polícia Judiciária said they believed the intruder was the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in the 2009 tractor accident .

 The disappearance turned a harsh spotlight on the McCanns , one that became increasingly intrusive as familiarity bred contempt . The case had everything the media could latch onto , according to feminist scholar Nicola Rehling : a whodunnit involving a white , middle @-@ class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad . While the News of the World offered a £ 1 @.@ 5 million reward for Madeleine , another News International tabloid , The Sun , offered £ 20 @,@ 000 for information about Shannon Matthews , who disappeared from a council estate and whose mother had seven children by five men . 
 The McCanns ' middle @-@ class status , at first protective , turned into a weapon against them . They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone , despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters . Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate . The argument ran that a working @-@ class couple would have faced child @-@ abandonment charges , but doctors on a posh holiday had been let off the hook . 
 Kate McCann — or " Hot Lips Healy , " as one tabloid called her after digging up a university nickname — was deemed too attractive , thin , well @-@ dressed , intense , controlled and not <unk> enough , according to media analyst Caroline Bainbridge . Much of the commentary came from female journalists . Journalism professor Nicola Goc wrote that Kate joined a long list of women the media sought to transform into Medea figures , including Lindy Chamberlain , Sally Clark , <unk> Patel , Angela Cannings and Donna Anthony . There was even a similar ( false ) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages Lindy Chamberlin and Kate McCann were said to have highlighted . Several tabloids criticized Kate for not crying in public , despite her obvious distress ; Correio da Manhã in Portugal complained that she had not " shed a single tear , " and called her " cynical and strange " while relying on Portuguese police sources to portray her as hysterical . 
 = = = Leveson Inquiry = = = 
 In November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards . The inquiry heard that the editor of the Daily Express , in particular , had become " obsessed " with the McCanns . Lord Justice Leveson called the Express articles " complete piffle " ; Roy Greenslade described them as " a sustained campaign of vitriol . " Kate told the inquiry that photographers would bang on her car as she left home with the twins to obtain a startled expression for a photograph . British tabloids simply repeated Portuguese tabloid stories , which in turn made no mention of sources . " Maddie ' Sold ' By Hard @-@ Up McCanns " ran a headline in the Daily Star .

 The McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers .

The Tapas Seven were awarded £ 375 @,@ 000 against the Express Group , also donated to Madeleine 's Fund , along with an apology in the Daily Express . 
 Robert Murat and his two associates sued 11 newspapers for libel in relation to 100 articles published by Associated Newspapers , Northern & Shell ( Express group ) , Mirror Group Newspapers and News Group Newspapers ( News International ) . According to The Observer , it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue . Murat was awarded £ 600 @,@ 000 in 2008 and the others $ 100 @,@ 000 ; all three received public apologies . The British Sky Broadcasting Group , which owns Sky News , also paid Murat undisclosed damages in 2008 and agreed that Sky News would host an apology on its website for 12 months . 
 = = = Social media = = = 
 Nicola Rehling writes that the narrative around the disappearance was shaped by social media . Twitter , one year old when Madeleine went missing , was the source of much of the vitriol . Social media 's attacks on the McCanns reportedly included threats to kidnap one of their twins , and when Scotland Yard and Crimewatch staged their reconstruction in 2013 , there was talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal . 
 One man who ran a website devoted to criticizing the couple received a three @-@ month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations , and the following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her McCann tweets . Eilis O 'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance " could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse . " 
 = Hurricane Henriette ( 1995 ) = 
 Hurricane Henriette was the ninth tropical cyclone , eight named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1995 Pacific hurricane season . Henriette developed from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 15 . After crossing the Atlantic and moving into the eastern Pacific on August 29 , it developed a low @-@ level circulation that was designated a tropical depression on September 1 . The next day , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henriette , and it was further upgraded to a hurricane on September 3 . The storm peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula . On land , wind gusts of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) were reported , knocking out power and water supplies . Heavy rainfall and strong storm surge contributed to flooding that damaged many roads ; throughout the region , 800 people were forced from their homes . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 15 . It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29 . The system quickly developed deep convection and a low @-@ level circulation , and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E while located about 170 miles ( 270 km ) off the southwest coast of Mexico . The depression initially moved west @-@ northwestward , and shortly after forming it turned to the north @-@ northwest . Under favorable conditions , the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220 miles ( 350 km ) west of Manzanillo . By later that day , the convection wrapped around the center of circulation . Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135 miles ( 235 km ) west @-@ southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco . Upon reaching hurricane status , one computer model predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California , though most forecast a turn to the northwest . 
 Late on September 3 , an eye began to form in the center of the deep convection as Henriette turned to the northwest . The eye became better defined the next day , and Henriette attained a peak intensity of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) as the northern portion of the eyewall moved over southern Baja California Peninsula . The hurricane quickly crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula and emerged into the Pacific Ocean again as a weakened 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) cyclone with disrupted convection near the center . Convection gradually waned as the hurricane moved over progressively colder waters , and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression . The storm turned to the west , and gradually weakened until dissipating on September 8 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On September 2 , a few hours after Henriette became a tropical storm , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Peninsula from La Paz southward . Early the next day it was changed to a hurricane watch , and 18 hours before Henriette made landfall the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning . Early on September 4 , the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25 ° N. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route . Originally planned to tour Mexican ports , the captain turned the ship to tour the southern California coastline . Many upset passengers demanded refunds , to which the cruise line offered discounts for future cruises and a $ 40 credit card during their cruise . 
 Winds of up to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) in southern Baja California Sur left much of Cabo San Lucas without water or power . Overall , 2 @,@ 000 people were directly affected by the hurricane . A strong storm surge produced flooding and heavy road damage in the state . Approximately 800 people were forced from their homes , and crop damage was reported . Generally up to 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of rain fell on land , though peak precipitation exceeded 13 inches ( 330 mm ) . No damage estimates are available , and no deaths were reported .
