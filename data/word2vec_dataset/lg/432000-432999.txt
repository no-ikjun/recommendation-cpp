 = African Americans in Omaha , Nebraska = 
 African Americans in Omaha , Nebraska are central to the development and growth of the 43rd largest city in the United States . The first free black settler in the city arrived in 1854 , the year the city was incorporated . In 1894 black residents of Omaha organized the first fair in the United States for African @-@ American exhibitors and attendees . The 2000 US Census recorded 51 @,@ 910 African Americans as living in Omaha ( over 13 % of the city 's population ) . In the 19th century , the growing city of Omaha attracted ambitious people making new lives , such as Dr. Matthew Ricketts was the first African American to graduate from a Nebraska college or university , and Silas Robbins was the first African American to be admitted to the bar in Nebraska . In 1892 Dr. Ricketts was also the first African American to be elected to the Nebraska State Legislature . Ernie Chambers , an African @-@ American barber from North Omaha 's 11th District , became the longest serving state senator in Nebraska history in 2005 after serving in the unicameral for more than 35 years . 
 Because of its industrial jobs with the railroads and meatpacking industries , Omaha was the city on the Plains that attracted the most African @-@ American migrants from the South in the Great Migration of the early 20th century . By 1910 it had the third largest black population among western cities after Los Angeles and Denver . From 1910 to 1920 , the African @-@ American population in Omaha doubled to more than 10 @,@ 000 , as new migrants were attracted by jobs in the expanding meatpacking industry . More than 70 percent were from the South . Of western cities , in 1920 only Los Angeles had a greater population of blacks than Omaha , with nearly 16 @,@ 000 . Reflecting the concentration of people and vital community , in 1915 the Lincoln Motion Picture Company was founded in Omaha . It was the first film company owned by African Americans . Like several other major industrial cities during the " Red Summer of 1919 " , Omaha suffered a race riot . It was marked by the lynching of Will Brown , a black worker , and deaths of two white men . The violence erupted out of job competition and postwar social tensions among working class groups , aggravated by sensational journalism in the city . In the aftermath of the riot , the city 's residential patterns became more segregated . By the 1920s , a vibrant African @-@ American musical and entertainment culture had developed in the city . 
 While African Americans were already concentrated in North Omaha , in the 1930s redlining and race restrictive covenants reinforced their staying there without options for years to move to newer housing . In the 1930s and 1940s African Americans were part of successful interracial organizing teams in the meatpacking industry . They succeeded in creating the integrated United Meatpacking Workers of America union and gained an end to segregated jobs in the industry . The union helped support integration of public facilities in the 1950s and the civil rights movement in the 1960s . During this period , activists worked both for local and national changes ; they contributed to improving conditions for African Americans in Omaha . Mid @-@ century massive restructuring in railroads and the meatpacking industry cost the city more than 10 @,@ 000 jobs . African Americans were particularly affected by the loss of industrial jobs . Those who could migrated for work in other areas and problems increased among the remaining population in North Omaha . 
 Omaha has the fifth @-@ highest African @-@ American poverty rate among the nation 's 100 largest cities , with more than one in three black residents in Omaha living below the poverty line . The percentage of black children in Omaha who live in poverty rank ranks number one in the United States , with nearly six of 10 black kids living below the poverty line . Only one other metropolitan area in the U.S. , Minneapolis , has a wider economic disparity between blacks and whites .

 The first recorded instance of a black person in the Omaha area occurred in 1804 . " York " was a slave belonging to William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition . The presence of several black people , probably slaves , was recorded in the area comprising North Omaha today when Major Stephen H. Long 's expedition arrived at Fort Lisa in September 1819 . They reportedly lived at the post and in neighboring farmsteads .

 After a short history of slavery in Nebraska , the first free black person to live in Omaha was Sally Bayne , who moved to Omaha in 1854 . A clause in the original proposed Nebraska State Constitution from 1854 limited voting rights in the state to " free white males " , which kept Nebraska from entering the Union for almost a year . In the 1860s , the U.S. Census showed 81 " Negroes " in Nebraska , ten of whom were accounted for as slaves . At that time , the majority of the population lived in Omaha and Nebraska City . 
 Some of the earliest African @-@ American residents of the city may have arrived by the Underground Railroad via a small log cabin outside of Nebraska City built by Allen Mayhew in 1855 . It is honored today as the Mayhew Cabin Museum . One report says , " Henry Daniel Smith , born in Maryland in 1835 , still living in Omaha in 1913 and working at his trade of broom @-@ maker , was one escaped slave who entered Nebraska via the Underground Railroad . " 
 By 1867 enough blacks gathered in community to found St. John 's African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Near North Side neighborhood . It was the first church for African Americans in Nebraska . The first recorded birth of an African American in Omaha occurred in 1872 , when William Leper was born . 
 Before Omaha 's African @-@ American residents gathered in North Omaha , they lived dispersed throughout the city . By 1880 there were nearly 800 black residents , many recruited by Union Pacific Railroad as strikebreakers . By 1884 there three black churches had been founded . By 1900 there were 3 @,@ 443 black residents , in a total city population of 102 @,@ 555 . 
 Black men and women quickly formed social and community organizations , such as the Women 's Club in 1895 , devoted to education , respectability and reform . In addition , the community began to create its own newspapers , such as the Progress , the Afro @-@ American Sentinel and The Enterprise in the 1880s and 1890s . 
 Blacks also quickly distinguished themselves in public life : in 1892 Dr. Matthew Ricketts was the first black person elected to serve in the Nebraska Legislature and in 1895 Silas Robbins was the first black lawyer admitted to the Nebraska State Bar Association .

 At the turn of the 20th century , two African @-@ American physicians , doctors Riddle and Madison , opened a hospital for African Americans . Citizens could not afford the facility and it failed financially . Reared in Omaha , Clarence W. Wigington was the first black architect to design a home in Nebraska as a student of the noted Thomas Rogers Kimball . He also designed churches in Omaha . Wigington gained a national reputation after moving to St. Paul , Minnesota , in 1914 , where he soon became the senior architectural designer for the city . His legacy includes 60 surviving buildings , among which four are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 John Grant Pegg was the Leading Colored Republican of the Western States Meet in Conference . In 1906 , he was appointment as the City Weights and Measures Inspector by J.C. <unk> , Mayor of Omaha 1910 . Pegg held the post for 10 years until his death in 1916 . Encouraged and Sponsored many of the black settlers who went by wagon out to Cherry County , Nebraska to homestead benefiting from The Kincaid Homestead Act of 1904 
 In 1912 the Omaha chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded , the first NAACP chapter west of the Mississippi . George Wells Parker , a founder of the Afrocentric <unk> League of the World , was instrumental in recruiting African Americans from the Deep South to Omaha during the 1910s . 
 Railroads and the meatpacking industry recruited African American workers from the South . From 1910 to 1920 , the African @-@ American population of Omaha doubled from 4 @,@ 426 to 10 @,@ 315 , making up five percent of Omaha 's population . Of the western cities which were new destinations for blacks of the Great Migration , in 1920 Omaha had the second largest black population , after Los Angeles . The rapid pace of growth alarmed some people in the city , which was also absorbing thousands of new eastern and southern European immigrants . People were concerned about social problems : labor unrest following strikes in 1917 , and the return of veterans looking for work after World War I. 
 During the first week of August 1919 , the Omaha Bee newspaper reported that as many as 500 " Negro " workers , mostly from Chicago and East St. Louis , arrived in Omaha to seek employment in the <unk> . The Bee tended to sensational journalism , adding to tensions in the city as it highlighted alleged crimes committed by blacks . The migration of African Americans to Omaha and the hiring of black workers created a source of friction in the local labor market . Blacks had been hired as strikebreakers in 1917 , and there was a major strike among white workers in 1919 . The immigrant workers in the meatpacking industry resented the strikebreakers . Economic pressure exacerbated hostilities . 
 From 1910 to the 1950s , Omaha was a destination for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South . An African @-@ American cultural expansion flourished beginning in the 1920s , part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era . A late 20th @-@ century documentary reported about the 1940s , " On the surface the black community appeared quite stable . Its center was a several @-@ block district north of the downtown . There were over a hundred black @-@ owned businesses , and there were a number of black physicians , dentists , and attorneys . Over twenty fraternal organizations and clubs flourished . Church life was diverse . Of more than forty denominations , Methodists and Baptists predominated . " 
 = = Neighborhoods = = 
 Early African American neighborhoods in Omaha included Casey 's Row , a community of housing for African @-@ American families , most of whose men worked as railroad porters at the nearby Union Pacific Railroad . The steady jobs on the railroads were considered good work , even if some men had greater ambitions . In the 1880s , Omaha 's original " Negro district " was located at Twentieth and Harney Streets . The Near North Side , located immediately north of Downtown Omaha , is where the majority of African Americans have lived in Omaha for almost 100 years . Originally the community had mostly European immigrants : Germans , Italians and Jews and gradually drew more African Americans . In pre @-@ 1900 Omaha , the city 's cemetery was always integrated . 
 The community became more racially segregated soon after the Omaha Race Riot of 1919 . During that event an African @-@ American worker named Will Brown was lynched by a white mob outside the Douglas County Courthouse . After the mob finished with Brown , they turned against the entire population of African Americans in the Near North Side ; however , their efforts were thwarted by soldiers from Fort Omaha . In the following years the city began enforcing race @-@ restrictive covenants . Properties for rent and sale were restricted on the basis of race , with the primary intent of keeping the Near North Side " black " and the rest of the city " white " . These agreements were held in place with redlining , a system of segregated insuring and lending reinforced by the federal government . These restrictions were ruled illegal in 1940 . 
 During the 1930s , the Federal government built housing projects for working families : the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects in North Omaha and a similar project in South Omaha . Both were intended to improve housing for the large working @-@ class community , whose majority then were immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe and their descendants . With job losses and demographic changes accelerating in the late 1950s and 1960s , the project residents in North Omaha became nearly all poor and low @-@ income African Americans . By the early first decade of the 21st century , each of these facilities was torn down and replaced with public housing schemes featuring mixed @-@ income and supporting uses . 
 African @-@ American neighborhoods in Omaha have been studied extensively ; the most notable reports include Lois Mark <unk> 's Three to Get Ready : The Education of a White Family in Inner City Schools , and the 1966 documentary film A Time for Burning . This movie featured the opinions of the young Ernie Chambers . A barber , Chambers went on to law school and has been repeatedly elected to represent North Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature for more than 35 years .

 The Union Pacific Railroad first introduced large numbers of African American strikebreakers to Omaha during a strike in 1877 . Black barbers organized the first labor union in Omaha , and went on strike in Omaha in 1887 after they deemed it " unprofessional to work beside white competitors . " Arriving in 1890 , Dr. Stephenson was the first African @-@ American physician in Omaha and the start of a substantial professional class . Matthew Ricketts was the first African @-@ American medical student to graduate from the University of Nebraska Medical College and settled in North Omaha to set up his practice . In 1892 , Dr. Ricketts was the first African American elected to a seat in the Nebraska State Legislature . According to the Works Progress Administration , the first African @-@ American fair held in the United States took place in Omaha , July 3 – 4 , 1894 . Their study reports : " Only Negro @-@ owned horses were entered in the races , and all exhibits were restricted to articles made or owned by Negroes . " 
 African Americans also built a " Colored Old Folks Home " in North Omaha in the 1910s and sustained it for a long period of time . Clarence W. Wigington was a renowned African @-@ American architect from Omaha . He designed St. John 's <unk> and the Broomfield <unk> , among many others in the city , but built most of his career after 1914 in St. Paul , Minnesota . 
 Miss Lucy Gamble , later known as Mrs. John Albert Williams , was the first African @-@ American teacher in the Omaha Public Schools , teaching there for six years from 1899 through 1905 . The first film company controlled by Black filmmakers was founded in Omaha in the summer of 1915 . George and Noble Johnson founded the Lincoln Motion Picture Company to produce films for African @-@ American audiences . Noble was a small @-@ time actor ; George worked for the post office . Noble Johnson was president of the company ; Clarence A. Brooks , secretary ; Dr. James T. Smith , treasurer ; and Dudley A. Brooks was assistant secretary . Lincoln Films quickly built a reputation for making films that showcased African @-@ American talent in the full sphere of cinema . In less than a year the company relocated to Los Angeles , where the major film industry was located . 
 Today African Americans own fifty percent of all minority @-@ owned businesses in Omaha . 
 = = Politics = = 
 From a slow start in the late 19th century , in the mid @-@ 20th century on , African Americans began to win more seats and appointments in politics , with their participation steadily growing . More people obtained higher education and entered professional middle classes . 
 In 1892 , Dr. Matthew Ricketts became the first African American elected to the Nebraska State Legislature , and was the acknowledged leader of the African @-@ American community in Omaha . After he left Omaha in 1903 , Jack Broomfield , proprietor of a notorious bar in downtown Omaha , became the leader of the community . He is criticized for having allowed the community to fall apart under the influence of Tom Dennison . 
 No African Americans served on the Omaha City Council or Douglas County Board of Commissioners until district elections became law . In 1893 Edwin R. Overall , a mail carrier , ran as a Populist for the City Council . He finished 18th in a field of 23 candidates running at @-@ large for nine of 18 council seats . In 1973 and 1977 , Fred Conley ran for the Omaha City Council in the at @-@ large format and each time finished 18th – just as Overall did some 70 years earlier . At @-@ large elections were won by candidates who represented the majority population of the city , which was white . 
 In 1981 , after City Council elections were changed to be based on district representation , Conley became the first African American elected . He served until 1989 . In 1992 , Carol Woods Harris became the first African American elected to the Douglas County Board and served until 2004 . 
 African Americans have been represented on the Omaha School Board since 1950 when attorney Elizabeth Davis Pittman was elected . De facto school segregation , however , persisted in Omaha long after that date with school boundaries tailored to match residential areas , which had de facto segregation . 
 Brenda Warren Council , a former member of the Omaha School Board and the City Council , narrowly lost the 1997 mayoral election , losing by 700 votes to Mayor Hal <unk> . In 2003 Thomas Warren , Brenda Council 's brother , was appointed by Mayor Mike Fahey as the city ’ s first African @-@ American Chief of Police for the Omaha Police Department . 
 In 2005 , Marlon Polk was appointed by Governor Dave Heineman to serve as a District Court Judge , the first African American to do so in Nebraska . He was assigned to serve in Douglas County . In 1970 Ernie Chambers became the city 's second African American elected to the state legislature . Chambers has won every election since then , and in 2007 became the longest @-@ serving Nebraska Senator in history . In 2005 the Nebraska State Legislature approved a term limit law limiting legislators to two terms , forcing Chambers from office in 2008 .

 Hose Company # 12 , and later Hose Company # 11 , hired the first African @-@ American firefighters in the city . One of these two stations was located at 20th and Lake Streets . One of the first African @-@ American <unk> in Omaha , was James C. Greer , Sr. who was a member of the Omaha Fire Department from 5 / 5 / 1906 to 8 / 1 / 1933 and was a captain in the department for many years . Horse @-@ drawn wagons were in use when he was assigned to the old No. 11 Station at Thirtieth and Spaulding Streets . He later served at the No. 4 Station at Sixteenth and Izard Streets . He retired as senior captain from the Omaha , NE . Fire Department in 1933 . His son Richard N. Greer ( known as Dick ) served as a volunteer for Fire Department in the 1950s . The first step towards integration in Omaha 's Fire Department came in 1940 , when an African @-@ American firefighter was assigned to the city 's Bureau of Fire Prevention and Inspection . By the 1950s , the city had two companies of African @-@ American firefighters . Omaha 's Fire Department was integrated in 1957 .

 The earliest African @-@ American churches in Omaha were St. John 's African Methodist Episcopal Church , organized in 1867 ; St. Phillip the Deacon Episcopal Church , organized in 1878 , and ; Zion Baptist Church , organized in 1884 . The second St. John 's building and Zion 's current building were notable for being designed by future master architect Clarence Wigington . St. John 's current building is lauded for being a notable example of the Prairie School architectural style . 
 In 1921 , the Omaha and Council Bluffs Colored Ministerial Alliance demanded that Tom Dennison 's cabarets in the Sporting District " wherein there is unwarranted mingling of the races " be closed indefinitely . It is unknown what their objectives were . 
 Other influential churches included Calvin Memorial Presbyterian Church , which opened in 1954 as an integrated congregation . Omaha had several interesting examples of integration in its churches , including those featured the documentary film A Time for Burning and Pearl Memorial United Methodist Church , which began integration efforts in the 1970s . Sacred Heart Catholic Church has operated since the late 19th century and has evolved numerous times as different ethnic groups succeeded each other in the neighborhood . North Omaha 's Lizzie Robinson founded the first Church of God in Christ congregation in Nebraska in the 1920s . Salem Baptist Church has been particularly important in the city 's African @-@ American community , hosting Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. in a major speaking event in Omaha in 1957 . 
 = = = Historical social clubs = = = 
 The African @-@ American community in North Omaha was anchored with numerous important social clubs . According to one report from the 1930s , " There are today in Omaha alone some twenty @-@ five clubs and societies with a total membership of over two thousand . " These groups included the Pleasant Hour Club ( which was estimated to be 50 years old in the late 1930s ) , Aloha Club , Entre Nous Club , the Beau Brummels Club , the Dames Club , the Jolly Twenty Club , the Trojan Club , and the Quack Club . Important locations included the North Side YWCA . This influential organization , starting in 1920 , was located in a house at <unk> N. 22nd Street The African @-@ American community in Omaha also supported the Old Colored Folks ' Home , which was organized in 1913 . In 1923 they received funds from the city 's " Community Chest " fund , with which they purchased a building . 
 The Royal Circle was a premier African @-@ American social organization . The Royal Circle held annual <unk> for young African @-@ American women through the early 1960s , at which they were " introduced " to adult society . Formed in 1918 , the War Camp Community Service became the local American Legion the following year . The Centralized Commonwealth Civic Club , formed in 1937 , promoted community business . Two local Boy Scout troops ( Troop 23 , Troop 79 ) were founded for African @-@ American youth . 
 The community also boasted halls for the Odd Fellows , the Masons , ( which had about 550 members in North Omaha in 1936 ) , and the Elks , ( with about 250 members in the community in 1936 ) . Perhaps the most elusive organization in North Omaha was the Knights and Daughters of Tabor , also known as the " Knights of Liberty " . This was a secret African @-@ American organization whose goal was " nothing less than the destruction of slavery . " 
 = = = Historic entertainment venues = = = 
 From the 1920s through to the early 1960s , North Omaha boasted a vibrant African @-@ American entertainment district , featuring both local and nationally known musicians . The most important venue in the area was the Dreamland Ballroom , opened in 1923 in the Jewell Building at 24th and Grant Streets . Dreamland hosted some of the greatest jazz , blues , and swing performers , including Duke Ellington , Count Basie , Louis Armstrong , Lionel Hampton , and the original Nat King Cole Trio . Whitney Young spoke there as well . Other venues included Jim Bell 's Harlem , opened in 1935 on Lake Street , west of 24th ; McGill 's Blue Room , located at 24th and Lake , and ; Allen 's Showcase Lounge , which was located at 24th and Lake . 
 The Ritz Theater was opened in the mid @-@ 1930s at 2041 North 24th Street , near Patrick Avenue . It was specifically designated an " African @-@ American theater " with seating for 548 people . It was closed in the 1950s and has since been demolished . 
 During this period , North Omaha and its main artery of North 24th Street were the heart of the city 's African @-@ American cultural and business community , with a thriving jazz and rhythm & blues scene that attracted top @-@ flight swing , blues and jazz bands from across the country . Due to racial segregation , musicians such as Cab Calloway stayed at Myrtle Washington 's at 22nd and Willis , while others stayed at Charlie Trimble 's at 22nd and Seward . Early North Omaha bands included Lewis ' Excelsior Brass Band , Dan <unk> Band , Simon Harrold 's Melody Boys , the Sam Turner Orchestra , the Ted Adams Orchestra , the Omaha Night Owls , Red Perkins and his Original Dixie Ramblers , and the Lloyd Hunter Band who , in 1931 , became the first Omaha band to record . A Lloyd Hunter concert poster can be seen on display at the Community Center in nearby Mineola , Iowa . 
 The intersection of 24th and Lake was the setting of the Big Joe Williams song " Omaha Blues " . Omaha @-@ born Wynonie Harris , one of the founders of rock and roll , got his start at the North Omaha clubs , and for a time lived in the now @-@ demolished Logan Fontenelle Housing Project . There were innumerable African @-@ American churches , social and civic clubs , formal dances for young people , and many other cultural activities . 
 Several accounts attribute the decline of the African @-@ American cultural scene in North Omaha to the riots of the 1960s and ' 70s . Television also took away from local entertainment . Since the turn of the 21st century , there has been a resurgence in interest in this vibrant period , with cultural and historical institutions created to honor it , such as Love 's Jazz & Art Center , the Dreamland Project , and the Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame .

 Preston Love , who left Omaha to tour nationally , said , 
 The history of African Americans and music in Omaha is long and varied . The black music community was first organized in the early 20th century by Josiah Waddle , one of Omaha 's first barbers . After teaching himself to play a number of brass instruments , Waddle pulled together Omaha 's first African American band in 1902 . In 1917 he brought together the first women 's band in Omaha . One of his most famous students was Lloyd Hunter , who ran one of the most popular orchestras ' in the United States Midwest . Anna Mae Winburn was a student of Waddle 's as well . 
 After leading the Cotton Club Boys and several smaller outfits , Winburn led the International Sweethearts of Rhythm to fame during World War II . The Sweethearts were the first integrated all women 's band in the United States . Nat Towles also led an important territory band out of Omaha during the swing era , and most of these bands were represented by the National Orchestra Service , which was also based out of Omaha . It was a nationally regarded company which acted as agent for dozens of bands . 
 International Jazz legend Preston Love was an important figure in Omaha 's African @-@ American community . After playing in Towles ' and Hunter 's bands , Love joined Count Basie as a saxophonist . After traveling the world , Love came back to North Omaha and founded his own band . He also joined the staff of the Omaha Star newspaper . Love toured the U.S. and Europe into the late 1990s and died in 2004 . 
 North Omaha 's musical culture gave rise to several influential African @-@ American musicians . Rhythm & Blues singer Wynonie Harris and influential drummer Buddy Miles , who played with guitarist Jimi Hendrix , were friends while they grew up and played together . They collaborated throughout their lives , and while they were playing with the greatest names in Rock and Roll , Jazz , R & B and Funk . Big Joe Williams and funk band leader Lester Abrams are also from North Omaha .

Franklin started publishing the Enterprise , later published by Thomas P. <unk> and edited by his wife , Ella <unk> . It was the longest lived of any of the early African @-@ American newspapers published in Omaha . The best known and most widely read of all African @-@ American newspapers in the city was the Omaha Monitor , established in 1915 , edited and published by Reverend John Albert Williams .

 Today , African @-@ American culture in Omaha is regarded as being anchored , in large part , by The Omaha Star , founded by the late Mildred D. Brown and her husband S. E. Gilbert in 1938 . Brown is believed to be the first female , certainly the first African @-@ American woman , to have founded a newspaper in the nation 's history . She managed the paper for the rest of her life .

 = = Race relations = = 
 North Omaha has a contentious history between whites and African Americans that is predicated on racism . In 1891 an African American George Smith was lynched at the Douglas County Courthouse , accused as a suspect for allegedly attacking a young girl . While little is known about Smith , reports of the incident described a mob dragging Smith from his cell , before any court trial , and hanging him from a nearby street post . 
 In July 1910 racial tension flared towards the African @-@ American community after a tremendous upset victory by African @-@ American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno , Nevada . Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting , as they did in cities across the U.S .. The mobs wounded several black men in the city , killing one . 
 The Red Summer of 1919 caused one Omaha newspaper to run a front page declaration that 21 Omaha women reported that they were assaulted from early June to late September 1919 . In an example of yellow journalism , 20 of the victims were white and 16 of the assailants were identified as black , while only one of the victims was black . A separate newspaper warned that vigilante committees would be formed if the " respectable colored population could not purge those from the Negro community who were assaulting white girls . " During the ensuing Omaha Race Riot of 1919 in September , a white ethnic mob from South Omaha took over the Douglas County Courthouse . The white rioters lynched Willy Brown , an accused packinghouse worker . They then tried to attack blacks on the street and move against the community in North Omaha . Soldiers from Fort Omaha put down the riot . They reestablished control and were stationed in South Omaha , to prevent any more mobs from forming , and in North Omaha at 24th and Lake streets " to prevent any further murders of black citizens . Orders were issued that any citizen with a gun faced immediate arrest . All blacks were ordered to remain indoors . "

 A legacy of this terrible summer was the de facto racial segregation of many of Omaha 's neighborhoods . Introduced in the 1930s , the practices of redlining by banks and racially restrictive housing covenants effectively ended for decades the ability of African Americans to buy or rent outside North Omaha . Originally built in the 1930s , Omaha housing projects were intended for occupancy without reference to race . A 1937 report from the Omaha Housing Authority reported that residents included " both black and white occupants and there are 284 units . There is no distinct segregation of the whites from the blacks but individual buildings will be confined to either Negro or white . " The Logan Fontenelle Housing Project , built during the Depression , with an addition completed in 1941 , to improve working class housing in North Omaha , was closed to African Americans through the 1950s . Even in the 1940s , housing was so overcrowded in the area that some families stayed at the projects although their income exceeded the limits , because they couldn 't find housing elsewhere . With civil rights challenges , the segregation policy that kept African Americans out of public housing changed in the 1960s . 
 The massive loss of industrial jobs changed the nature of families and the issues in public housing . Although the Logan Fontenelle projects were first built for working families , they came to be dominated by the unemployed . Other public housing projects also reflected later de facto segregation . A concentration of problems here and in other cities led the City of Omaha , along with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , to radically rethink public housing in the 1990s . The Logan Fontenelle Housing Project was torn down in 1996 . Today public housing is scattered throughout Omaha and often combined with market rate housing and community amenities .

 The lynching of Willy Brown has been credited for radicalizing Omaha 's African @-@ American community . In the 1920s the Omaha chapter of Marcus Garvey 's Universal Negro Improvement Association was founded by Earl Little , a Baptist minister and the father of Malcolm X. Malcolm X was born in Omaha in 1925 . Malcolm X 's mother reported a 1924 incident where her family was warned to leave Omaha by Ku Klux Klansmen . She was told that her husband , Earl Little , was " stirring up trouble " through his involvement with Universal Negro Improvement Association . The family moved shortly thereafter . 
 Another radical leader , Communist spokesman and one @-@ time leader of American forces in the Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood , was born in 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were former slaves . In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked , forcing the family to move from the city . The African Blood Brotherhood , started in Omaha , contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it the group in Chicago , where his family had moved in 1915 . 
 Starting in 1920 , the Colored Commercial Club organized to help blacks in Omaha secure employment and to encourage business enterprises among African Americans . The National Federation of Colored Women had five chapters in Omaha . In 1928 the first Urban League chapter in the American West was founded in city . Whitney Young led the chapter in 1950 and tripled its membership . After a few years he left Omaha , taking over the national leadership of the Urban League by 1961 . 
 The Industrial Workers of the World organized African @-@ American workers in the South Omaha Stockyards in the 1920s . Along with the rest of the working class , they suffered setbacks during layoffs in the Great Depression . 
 In the 1930s , however , an interracial committee succeeded in organizing the United Meatpacking Workers of America , one of the Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) unions . They worked to end segregation of job positions in meatpacking in the 1940s . Community leader Rowena Moore attacked gender restrictions and organized to expand opportunities in industry for black women . <unk> helped African Americans extended their political power and gain an end to segregation in retail places in the 1950s . After all this progress , however , the loss of more than 10 @,@ 000 jobs due to structural changes in the railroad and meatpacking industries in the 1960s sharply reduced opportunities for the working class communities . 
 As a major western city , Omaha was visited by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. in 1958 and Robert Kennedy in 1968 , who helped galvanize the civil rights movement in North Omaha . Local leaders continued to struggle against racism . North Omaha was marred by race @-@ related violence and de facto segregation throughout the 20th century . When the Black Panthers were implicated in a police killing in North Omaha in 1970 , the trial highlighted political tensions . The Rice / Poindexter Case continues to highlight Omaha 's contentious legacy of racism . A majority of Omaha 's African @-@ American population still lives in North Omaha . 
 = = = Integration = = = 
 Studies have shown starting in the 1950s Omaha 's white middle class moved from North Omaha to the suburbs of West Omaha in the phenomenon called " white flight . " The inability of government money to solve the problems of Omaha 's African American community was accented by white flight . The city 's schools were greatly affected by racial unrest . Consequential to the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte @-@ Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling enforcing desegregation busing in the United States , Omaha was reputed to have adapted well to integrated busing . However , an analysis of white flight found that public schools in Omaha had enhanced racial discrimination despite their integration attempts . Optional attendance zones , the location of new schools , and feeder patterns were found to enhance segregation . This study found that mandatory busing was required to attain racial balance in every school . Enrollment of white students in the Omaha Public Schools plummeted in the 1970s , while the enrollment of black students during the same period rose from 21 % to 30 % , primarily due to the loss of white students . In the 1990s the Omaha Housing Authority adopted a scattered site housing plan , eventually destroying several of the housing projects in the city , including the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project . 
 = = = Race riots = = = 
 The civil rights movement brought calls for black power and against racism to Omaha . While youth throughout the city were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War , funding for education and youth programs were being cut , and policing tactics were targeting African @-@ American youth . This led to a series of protests and riots , the repercussions of which are still felt today in some communities . 
 On July 4 , 1966 , the temperature soared to 103 degrees . A crowd of African Americans gathered at the intersection of North 24th and Lake Streets in the evening . When police requested their dispersal they responded violently . After demolishing police cars , the mob roamed the North 24th Street business corridor for hours , throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts . After three days of rioting millions of dollars of damage was reported by affected businesses . 
 Riots erupted again on August 1 , 1966 after a 19 @-@ year @-@ old was shot by a white , off @-@ duty policeman during a burglary . The Omaha World @-@ Herald and local television stations blamed African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods during this period . Three buildings were firebombed , and 180 riot police were required to quell the crowds . 
 On March 4 , 1968 a crowd of high school and university students were gathered at the Omaha Civic Auditorium to protest the presidential campaign of George Wallace , the segregationist governor of Alabama . After counter @-@ protesters began acting violently toward the youth activists , police brutality led to the injury of dozens of protesters . An African @-@ American youth was shot and killed by a police officer during the melee , and fleeing students caused thousands of dollars of damage to businesses and cars . The following day a local barber named Ernie Chambers helped calm a disturbance and prevent a riot by students at Horace Mann Junior High School . Chambers was already recognized as a community leader . After finishing his law degree , Chambers was elected to the Nebraska State Legislature , and served a total of 38 years , longer than any of his predecessors . 
 African @-@ American teenager Vivian Strong was shot and killed by police officers in an incident at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects on June 24 , 1969 . Young African Americans in the area rioted in response to the teenager 's death , with looting along the North 24th Street business corridor . During this initial surge , eight businesses were destroyed by firebombing or looting . Rioting went on for several more days . This is the last noted riot in Omaha . 
 The effects of these riots is still evident in the North 24th Street district , with high numbers of vacant lots and general economic depression still prevalent . 
 = = = Commemorations and recognitions = = = 
 There have been several different organizations formed to commemorate the history of Omaha 's African Americans . In the 1960s Bertha Calloway founded the Nebraska Negro Historical Society , and in 1974 the Society opened the Great Plains Black History Museum . It includes material related to the history of black homesteaders on the plains , as well as the more numerous urbanites based chiefly in Omaha , the major city of the state . 
 In 1976 the community began Native Omaha Days , devised as a series of activities to celebrate black history in the city . In addition to being a labor organizer in meatpacking in the 1940s , Rowena Moore led an effort to recognize the Malcolm X House Site in the 1970s . A monument to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was placed along North 24th Street in the late 1990s . The Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame was founded in 2005 to celebrate the city 's musical history .

 The director of a statewide poverty advocacy group was quoted as saying in 2007 : " In Omaha , you start talking about low @-@ income issues , people assume you ’ re talking about minority issues ... " As of October 2007 , the city of Omaha , the 42nd largest in the country , has the fifth highest percentage of low @-@ income African Americans in the country . Census data from 2000 in Douglas County show more than 7 @,@ 800 families live below the poverty line , about 6 @.@ 7 percent of families . The percentage of black children in Omaha who live in poverty rank ranks number one in the United States , with nearly six of 10 black kids living below the poverty line . Only one other metropolitan area in the U.S. , Minneapolis , has a wider economic disparity between blacks and whites .

 = 1959 Escuminac disaster = 
 The 1959 Escuminac disaster ( also to referred to as the Escuminac hurricane ) was considered the worst fishing @-@ related disaster in New Brunswick in 100 years . It occurred due to the extratropical remnants of an Atlantic hurricane . The storm was the third tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season , and developed from a tropical wave in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 18 . It headed rapidly northeastward and struck Florida later that day . Shortly after entering the Atlantic Ocean , it strengthened into a tropical storm later on June 18 . By the following day , it had strengthened into a hurricane . However , it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later . The remnants struck Atlantic Canada , once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before dissipating on June 21 . 
 In its early stages , the storm dropped moderately heavy rainfall in Florida , which caused damage to crops . A tornado near Miami and high tides on the west coast of the state also resulted in damage . Overall , losses in Florida were around $ 1 @.@ 7 million ( 1959 USD ) . After becoming extratropical , the storm caused significant effects in Atlantic Canada . About 45 boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island , and they did not have radio to receive warning of the approaching storm . Rough seas of up to 49 ft ( 15 m ) in height damaged or destroyed many boats . At least 22 fishing boats capsized over water with their crew , causing 35 fatalities . High winds also disrupted communications in some areas , and several houses were damaged , causing $ 750 @,@ 000 ( 1959 CAD , $ 781 @,@ 000 1959 USD ) . The event became the deadliest work @-@ related disaster in New Brunswick . 
 = = Early history = = 
 On June 15 , a tropical wave with associated instability was observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June 16 , and the next day developed a weak circulation at the same time that Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf . The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast , becoming a tropical depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC . Moving quickly to the northeast , the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours , making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral . 
 As the depression struck western Florida , it produced 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal tides , which damaged docks and caused beach erosion . Wind gusts near Sarasota reached about 49 mph ( 80 km / h ) . After previously wet conditions , the system dropped heavy rainfall across the state , unofficially reaching 15 in ( 380 mm ) in some areas and causing flooding . Along the Indian River , flooding damaged citrus crops , and statewide some roads were damaged due to flooding . When the storm was first forming in the Gulf of Mexico , it spawned a tornado in Miami that lasted for over 20 minutes . The National Climatic Data Center considered it the worst tornado in the city since one in 1925 , and the overall path was about 12 mi ( 19 km ) . A total of 77 people were injured due to the tornado , mostly due to cuts from broken glass , and damage from it was estimated at $ 1 @.@ 5 million . Another tornado was reported north of West Palm Beach , although it affected a sparsely populated area ; total damage statewide totaled $ 1 @,@ 656 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Storm approach to Canada = = 
 Late on June 18 , it is estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm , and that day the Miami Hurricane Center issued its last advisory , warning ships of the potential for future strengthening . The storm moved rapidly to the northeast , passing halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina early on June 19 . At 0250 UTC that day , a ship reported a falling barometric pressure of 993 mbar ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) with west @-@ southwesterly winds of 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) . Although it was associated with a diffused frontal zone , the storm maintained a warm core and initially remained largely tropical . At 1200 UTC on June 19 , it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane about halfway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia , with a pressure of 974 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . By six hours later , it became extratropical , although the former hurricane intensified further to peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . On June 20 , the storm slowed and turned sharply to the northwest . It weakened slightly before moving ashore near Canso , Nova Scotia . Crossing the island , it struck Prince Edward Island before turning sharply to the east and crossing Nova Scotia again . By late on June 20 , it re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to the east @-@ northeast . The extratropical storm moved over southeastern Newfoundland and dissipated on June 21 . 
 Before the storm reached Atlantic Canada , the National Search and Rescue Secretariat ( NSS ) provided notices for the advancing storm . On the day of the storm , the forecast from Halifax was for light winds , and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions , boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat . There were many salmon in the region , which prompted fishermen to set sail . As the storm approached , there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Along the coast of New Brunswick , the storm produced 49 ft ( 15 m ) waves that destroyed several boats , including 22 over open waters between Point Escuminac and <unk> . Two bodies washed ashore in the latter city , and eleven bodies were eventually discovered . About one @-@ third of the salmon boats in Miramichi were destroyed . Across New Brunswick , the storm disrupted communications near the coast . Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island , high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate . The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region , peaking at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall , peaking at 4 @.@ 29 in ( 109 mm ) in Nova Scotia . There , many lobster cages were destroyed , and boats were removed from their moorings . In Prince Edward Island , up to 50 % of lobster traps were destroyed or missing , including 5 @,@ 000 destroyed traps near Souris . As with New Brunswick , several boats were destroyed or washed ashore , and damage in the province was estimated at $ 750 @,@ 000 ( 1959 CAD , $ 781 @,@ 000 1959 USD ) . A total of 35 people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island , mostly fishermen . As a result , the Escuminac Disaster , as it came to be known , became the deadliest work @-@ related disaster in New Brunswick . The Minister of Fisheries considered the event as " the worst disaster to hit a Canadian fishing fleet in about 100 years . " 
 In the days after the storm , the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police operated search and rescue missions , while families waited on the beach . The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims . Due to storm fatalities , 24 adults became widows , and 83 children lost a father . As a result , the New Brunswick Fishermen 's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families . The fund raised $ 400 @,@ 000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada , as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II , the latter who was on a tour of the country at the time . 
 In memory of the storm victims , artist Claude Roussel created a wood sculpture entitled " Les <unk> – The Fishermen " , which won first prize at New Brunswick Museum in 1962 . Later , residents near Escuminac raised money to turn the work into a stone monument , which was dedicated on June 19 , 1969 . It was nearly 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) in height , weighed about 10 @,@ 000 lbs ( 5 tonnes ) , and depicted a group of fishermen working together , with the names of the deceased on a bronze plaque . In 2001 , the government of New Brunswick declared the Escuminac Disaster Monument as a provincial historical site . 
 = Permanent Record : Al in the Box = 
 Permanent Record : Al in the Box is a four disc compilation box set of songs by " Weird Al " Yankovic . The album , released by Scotti Brothers Records so that the label could make monetary projections for the fiscal year , collects Yankovic 's favorite songs from his first eight studio albums . The collection also includes alternate versions of " My Bologna " , " Happy Birthday " , " UHF " and the new single , " Headline News " , a parody of " Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm " by Crash Test Dummies . It peaked at number 104 on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 The collection was met with mostly positive critical reviews , with many appreciating the gathering of some of Yankovic 's best works . However , the box set was not a high seller , and near the end of the 1990s , it ranked as Yankovic 's least @-@ purchased album . In 2006 , due to a mishap by Volcano Records , the artwork for the set was lost , and the collection went out of print . Yankovic refused to scan existing copies of the album to make new ones , fearing that it would lead to an inferior product .

 While Yankovic was writing the original songs for a new album — which would later be released in 1996 as Bad Hair Day — his label , Scotti Brothers Records , insisted that he release a new record in order to meet monetary projections for the fourth fiscal quarter of the year . Yankovic , however , explained that he would be unable to finish a new record in time , so his label decided to release a box set that eventually was named Permanent Record : Al in the Box . The label then stipulated that Yankovic would need to at least record a new single to promote the box set . Yankovic complied , producing the parody " Headline News " , a spoof of " Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm " by Crash Test Dummies , which would also appear on his second greatest hits album . 
 While most of the songs that appear on this record can be found on Yankovic 's first eight studio albums , there are several unique inclusions . The version of " My Bologna " is the Capitol Records single version , which only featured the accordion and Yankovic 's voice . Early pressings of the album included the incorrect version of " My Bologna " , but this was later rectified in subsequent pressings . The version of " Happy Birthday " included was previously released on the 1981 independent Another One Rides the Bus EP . Finally , the third disc contains the single edit of " UHF " as opposed to the lengthier version available on UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff ; this was done because Yankovic figured that " fans would appreciate having both versions available . " 
 = = = Tile and artwork = = = 
 Both " Permanent Record " and " Al in the Box " were titles proposed by Yankovic ; however , he favored the former , whereas his label preferred the latter . Both parties , being unwilling to yield , eventually decided to compromise and name the release Permanent Record : Al in the Box . The album also included a detailed booklet , written by Yankovic 's long @-@ time associate , Dr. Demento . When Yankovic 's recording contract was transferred from Scotti Brothers to Volcano in the late 1990s , the artwork for the set was lost , forcing the set to go out of print ; although Yankovic noted that the label " could just scan existing booklets and CD art and crank out boxed sets with slightly inferior graphics , " he did not want to put out a product that was not up to his usual standards .

 Barry Weber of AllMusic awarded the album four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , and argued that " no [ other greatest hits album of Yankovic 's ] matches Permanent Record , a four @-@ CD set of Yankovic 's best songs " . He applauded many of the parodies , and called several of them — namely " My Bologna " , " Eat It " , " Like a Surgeon " , " Yoda " , " Fat " , and " Smells Like Nirvana " — " defining satires " . He also wrote that the originals contained on the record were " overlooked but equally entertaining " . Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard , in The Rolling Stone Album Guide , awarded the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent . Craig Rosen of Billboard magazine opined that the album " will remind consumers that Yankovic has outlasted " many of his past parody targets . Chuck Eddy of Spin magazine named the album the fourth most " essential " comedy record , writing that album is proof " for fifth @-@ grade smart <unk> , no rock star is greater " than Yankovic .

 The box set was released on September 27 , 1994 .

On March 1 , 2006 , the record went out of print , due to the aforementioned loss of the artwork . The collection 's only single , " Headline News " , charted and peaked at number four on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart , which corresponds to a position of 104 on the Billboard Hot 100 .

 Richard Smith ( September 17 , 1886 – 1937 ) , also known as Dick Smith , was a screenwriter , actor , and film director . Smith was born in Cleveland , Ohio , and became a comedian active in the vaudeville era . He met his wife Alice Howell in 1910 and the two performed together as Howell and Howell . After working under direction of Mack Sennett at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in New York , Smith moved to Los Angeles , California . Smith and his wife starred in reels together produced by L @-@ KO Kompany . 
 While Howell was contracted at Universal Studios , Smith directed her in films described in the book Clown Princes and Court Jesters as , " some of Universal 's most memorable comedies of the twenties " . With colleague Vin Moore , Smith directed actor Oliver Hardy in the 1920 film Distilled Love . Smith directed the Marx Brothers in 1921 in their first film , titled Humor Risk , which has since been lost . In 1925 , Smith 's directing work included films starring Bert Roach , Neely Edwards , and Charles Puffy .

 Due to a medical condition , Smith decided to switch his residence from New York to Los Angeles , California , where his wife began to gain roles in the film industry under Sennett in 1914 . The two starred together in reels including Dad 's Dollars and Dirty Doings , a comedy by L @-@ KO Kompany . Under the production company <unk> Pictures , Smith wrote and directed several films which his wife starred in . In the book Clown Princes and Court Jesters , authors <unk> C. Lahue and Samuel Gill describe these films directed by Smith and starring Howell as " low @-@ burlesque charades and as such were slanted toward the neighborhood and second @-@ run houses , where they found receptive audiences . " 
 After his wife became an actress in features at Universal Studios in 1921 , Smith directed her in multiple comedies . Lahue and Gill characterize these films as , " some of Universal 's most memorable comedies of the twenties " , and note , " Starting with the usual framework provided by the situation comedy format , directors William Watson and Richard Smith inserted a sufficient amount of subdued slapstick to flavor these single reels with laugh after laugh . " Comedian Oliver Hardy acted under the direction of Smith and associate Vin Moore , in the 1920 film Distilled Love ; Smith also had an acting role in the film as an artist . He served as director in 1921 of Humor Risk , the first film starring the Marx Brothers . Smith directed actors including Bert Roach and Neely Edwards in the 1925 film A Nice Pickle , and Charles Puffy the same year in Muddled Up . After Howell retired from film in the 1926 , Smith kept up with his contracted work at Universal and wrote a set of comedy films called " The Collegians " .

 = Matrix ( mathematics ) = 
 In mathematics , a matrix ( plural matrices ) is a rectangular array of numbers , symbols , or expressions , arranged in rows and columns . The dimensions of matrix ( 1 ) are 2 × 3 ( read " two by three " ) , because there are two rows and three columns . 
 The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries . Provided that they are the same size ( have the same number of rows and the same number of columns ) , two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element . The rule for matrix multiplication , however , is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second . Any matrix can be multiplied element @-@ wise by a scalar from its associated field . A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations , that is , generalizations of linear functions such as f ( x ) = 4x . For example , the rotation of vectors in three dimensional space is a linear transformation which can be represented by a rotation matrix R : if v is a column vector ( a matrix with only one column ) describing the position of a point in space , the product Rv is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation . The product of two transformation matrices is a matrix that represents the composition of two linear transformations . Another application of matrices is in the solution of systems of linear equations . If the matrix is square , it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its determinant . For example , a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero . Insight into the geometry of a linear transformation is obtainable ( along with other information ) from the matrix 's eigenvalues and eigenvectors . 
 Applications of matrices are found in most scientific fields . In every branch of physics , including classical mechanics , optics , electromagnetism , quantum mechanics , and quantum electrodynamics , they are used to study physical phenomena , such as the motion of rigid bodies . In computer graphics , they are used to project a 3D model onto a 2 dimensional screen . In probability theory and statistics , stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities ; for instance , they are used within the <unk> algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search . Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions . 
 A major branch of numerical analysis is devoted to the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations , a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research . Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations , both theoretically and practically . Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures , such as sparse matrices and near @-@ diagonal matrices , expedite computations in finite element method and other computations . Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory . A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator , which acts on the Taylor series of a function . 
 = = Definition = = 
 A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or other mathematical objects for which operations such as addition and multiplication are defined . Most commonly , a matrix over a field F is a rectangular array of scalars each of which is a member of F. Most of this article focuses on real and complex matrices , that is , matrices whose elements are real numbers or complex numbers , respectively . More general types of entries are discussed below . For instance , this is a real matrix : 
 <formula> 
 The numbers , symbols or expressions in the matrix are called its entries or its elements . The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called rows and columns , respectively . 
 = = = Size = = = 
 The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns that it contains . A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m × n matrix or m @-@ by @-@ n matrix , while m and n are called its dimensions . For example , the matrix A above is a 3 × 2 matrix . 
 Matrices which have a single row are called row vectors , and those which have a single column are called column vectors . A matrix which has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix . A matrix with an infinite number of rows or columns ( or both ) is called an infinite matrix . In some contexts , such as computer algebra programs , it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns , called an empty matrix . 
 = = Notation = = 
 Matrices are commonly written in box brackets or parentheses : 
 <formula> 
 The specifics of symbolic matrix notation vary widely , with some prevailing trends . Matrices are usually symbolized using upper @-@ case letters ( such as A in the examples above ) , while the corresponding lower @-@ case letters , with two subscript indices ( e.g. , <unk> , or <unk> ) , represent the entries . In addition to using upper @-@ case letters to symbolize matrices , many authors use a special typographical style , commonly boldface upright ( non @-@ italic ) , to further distinguish matrices from other mathematical objects . An alternative notation involves the use of a double @-@ underline with the variable name , with or without boldface style , ( e.g. , <formula> ) . 
 The entry in the i @-@ th row and j @-@ th column of a matrix A is sometimes referred to as the i , j , ( i , j ) , or ( i , j ) th entry of the matrix , and most commonly denoted as ai , j , or aij . Alternative notations for that entry are A [ i , j ] or Ai , j . For example , the ( 1 @,@ 3 ) entry of the following matrix A is 5 ( also denoted <unk> , <unk> , A [ 1 @,@ 3 ] or <unk> ) : 
 <formula> 
 Sometimes , the entries of a matrix can be defined by a formula such as ai , j 
 = f ( i , j ) . For example , each of the entries of the following matrix A is determined by aij = 
 i − j . 
 <formula> 
 In this case , the matrix itself is sometimes defined by that formula , within square brackets or double parenthesis . For example , the matrix above is defined as A 
 = [ i @-@ j ] , or A = 
 ( ( i @-@ j ) ) . If matrix size is m × n , the above @-@ mentioned formula f ( i , j ) is valid for any i 
 = 1 , ... , m and any j = 
 1 , ... , n . This can be either specified separately , or using m × n as a subscript . For instance , the matrix A above is 3 × 4 and can be defined as A 
 = [ i − j ] ( i = 
 1 , 2 , 3 ; j 
 = 1 , ... , 4 ) , or A = 
 [ i − j ] 3 × 4 . 
 Some programming languages utilize doubly subscripted arrays ( or arrays of arrays ) to represent an <unk> × -n matrix . Some programming languages start the numbering of array indexes at zero , in which case the entries of an m @-@ by @-@ n matrix are indexed by 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 . This article follows the more common convention in mathematical writing where enumeration starts from 1 . 
 The set of all m @-@ by @-@ n matrices is denoted <unk> ( m , n ) . 
 = = Basic operations = = 
 There are a number of basic operations that can be applied to modify matrices , called matrix addition , scalar multiplication , transposition , matrix multiplication , row operations , and submatrix . 
 = = = Addition , scalar multiplication and transposition = = = 
 Familiar properties of numbers extend to these operations of matrices : for example , addition is commutative , that is , the matrix sum does not depend on the order of the summands : A + B 
 = B + A. The transpose is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication , as expressed by ( cA ) T = 
 c ( AT ) and ( A + B ) T 
 = AT + BT . Finally , ( AT ) T = 
 A. 
 = = = Matrix multiplication = = = 
 Multiplication of two matrices is defined if and only if the number of columns of the left matrix is the same as the number of rows of the right matrix . If A is an m @-@ by @-@ n matrix and B is an n @-@ by @-@ p matrix , then their matrix product AB is the m @-@ by @-@ p matrix whose entries are given by dot product of the corresponding row of A and the corresponding column of B : 
 <formula> , 
 where 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ p . For example , the underlined entry 2340 in the product is calculated as ( 2 × 1000 ) + ( 3 × 100 ) + ( 4 × 10 ) 
 = 2340 : 
 <formula> 
 Matrix multiplication satisfies the rules ( AB ) C = 
 A ( BC ) ( associativity ) , and ( A + B ) C 
 = AC + BC as well as C ( A + B ) = 
 CA + CB ( left and right distributivity ) , whenever the size of the matrices is such that the various products are defined . The product AB may be defined without BA being defined , namely if A and B are m @-@ by @-@ n and n @-@ by @-@ k matrices , respectively , and m ≠ k . Even if both products are defined , they need not be equal , that is , generally 
 AB ≠ BA , 
 that is , matrix multiplication is not commutative , in marked contrast to ( rational , real , or complex ) numbers whose product is independent of the order of the factors . An example of two matrices not commuting with each other is : 
 <formula> 
 whereas 
 <formula> 
 Besides the ordinary matrix multiplication just described , there exist other less frequently used operations on matrices that can be considered forms of multiplication , such as the <unk> product and the Kronecker product . They arise in solving matrix equations such as the Sylvester equation . 
 = = = Row operations = = = 
 There are three types of row operations : 
 row addition , that is adding a row to another . 
 row multiplication , that is multiplying all entries of a row by a non @-@ zero constant ; 
 row switching , that is interchanging two rows of a matrix ; 
 These operations are used in a number of ways , including solving linear equations and finding matrix inverses . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by deleting any collection of rows and / or columns . For example , from the following 3 @-@ by @-@ 4 matrix , we can construct a 2 @-@ by @-@ 3 submatrix by removing row 3 and column 2 : 
 <formula> 
 The minors and cofactors of a matrix are found by computing the determinant of certain <unk> . 
 A principal submatrix is a square submatrix obtained by removing certain rows and columns . The definition varies from author to author . According to some authors , a principal submatrix is a submatrix in which the set of row indices that remain is the same as the set of column indices that remain . Other authors define a principal submatrix to be one in which the first k rows and columns , for some number k , are the ones that remain ; this type of submatrix has also been called a leading principal submatrix . 
 = = Linear equations = = 
 Matrices can be used to compactly write and work with multiple linear equations , that is , systems of linear equations . For example , if A is an m @-@ by @-@ n matrix , x designates a column vector ( that is , n × 1 @-@ matrix ) of n variables x1 , x2 , ... , xn , and b is an m × 1 @-@ column vector , then the matrix equation 
 Ax 
 = b 
 is equivalent to the system of linear equations 
 <unk> + <unk> + ... + A1 , <unk> = 
 b1 
 ... 
 Am , <unk> + Am , 2x2 + ... + Am , <unk> = bm . 
 = = Linear transformations = = 
 Matrices and matrix multiplication reveal their essential features when related to linear transformations , also known as linear maps . A real m @-@ by @-@ n matrix A gives rise to a linear transformation Rn → Rm mapping each vector x in Rn to the ( matrix ) product Ax , which is a vector in Rm . Conversely , each linear transformation f : Rn → Rm arises from a unique m @-@ by @-@ n matrix A : explicitly , the ( i , j ) <unk> of A is the ith coordinate of f ( ej ) , where ej 
 = ( 0 , ... , 0 @,@ 1 @,@ 0 , ... , 0 ) is the unit vector with 1 in the <unk> position and 0 elsewhere . The matrix A is said to represent the linear map f , and A is called the transformation matrix of f . 
 For example , the 2 × 2 matrix 
 <formula> 
 can be viewed as the transform of the unit square into a parallelogram with vertices at ( 0 , 0 ) , ( a , b ) , ( a + c , b + d ) , and ( c , d ) . The parallelogram pictured at the right is obtained by multiplying A with each of the column vectors <formula> and <formula> in turn . These vectors define the vertices of the unit square . 
 The following table shows a number of 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 matrices with the associated linear maps of R2 . The blue original is mapped to the green grid and shapes . The origin ( 0 @,@ 0 ) is marked with a black point . 
 Under the 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence between matrices and linear maps , matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of maps : if a k @-@ by @-@ m matrix B represents another linear map g : Rm → <unk> , then the composition g ∘ f is represented by BA since 
 ( g ∘ f ) ( x ) = 
 g ( f ( x ) ) 
 = g ( Ax ) = 
 B ( Ax ) = ( BA ) x . 
 The last equality follows from the above @-@ mentioned associativity of matrix multiplication . 
 The rank of a matrix A is the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors of the matrix , which is the same as the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors . Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank @-@ nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix . 
 = = Square matrix = = 
 A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns . An n @-@ by @-@ n matrix is known as a square matrix of order n . Any two square matrices of the same order can be added and multiplied . The entries <unk> form the main diagonal of a square matrix . They lie on the imaginary line which runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the matrix . 
 = = = Main types = = = 
 = = = = Diagonal and triangular matrix = = = = 
 If all entries of A below the main diagonal are zero , A is called an upper triangular matrix . Similarly if all entries of A above the main diagonal are zero , A is called a lower triangular matrix . If all off @-@ diagonal elements are zero , A is called a diagonal matrix . 
 = = = = Identity matrix = = = = 
 The identity matrix In of size n is the n @-@ by @-@ n matrix in which all the elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0 , e.g. 
 <formula> 
 It is a square matrix of order n , and also a special kind of diagonal matrix . It is called an identity matrix because multiplication with it leaves a matrix unchanged : 
 <unk> 
 = <unk> = 
 A for any m @-@ by @-@ n matrix A. 
 = = = = Symmetric or skew @-@ symmetric matrix = = = = 
 A square matrix A that is equal to its transpose , that is , A 
 = AT , is a symmetric matrix . If instead , A is equal to the negative of its transpose , that is , A = 
 − AT , then A is a skew @-@ symmetric matrix . In complex matrices , symmetry is often replaced by the concept of Hermitian matrices , which satisfy A ∗ = A , where the star or asterisk denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix , that is , the transpose of the complex conjugate of A. 
 By the spectral theorem , real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an <unk> ; that is , every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors . In both cases , all eigenvalues are real . This theorem can be generalized to infinite @-@ dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns , see below . 
 = = = = <unk> matrix and its inverse = = = = 
 A square matrix A is called invertible or non @-@ singular if there exists a matrix B such that 
 AB 
 = BA = 
 In . 
 If B exists , it is unique and is called the inverse matrix of A , denoted A − 1 . 
 = = = = Definite matrix = = = = 
 A symmetric n × n @-@ matrix is called positive @-@ definite ( respectively negative @-@ definite ; indefinite ) , if for all nonzero vectors x ∈ Rn the associated quadratic form given by 
 Q ( x ) 
 = <unk> 
 takes only positive values ( respectively only negative values ; both some negative and some positive values ) . If the quadratic form takes only non @-@ negative ( respectively only non @-@ positive ) values , the symmetric matrix is called positive @-@ semidefinite ( respectively negative @-@ semidefinite ) ; hence the matrix is indefinite precisely when it is neither positive @-@ semidefinite nor negative @-@ semidefinite . 
 A symmetric matrix is positive @-@ definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive , that is , the matrix is positive @-@ semidefinite and it is invertible . The table at the right shows two possibilities for 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 matrices . 
 Allowing as input two different vectors instead yields the bilinear form associated to A : 
 BA ( x , y ) = 
 <unk> . 
 = = = = Orthogonal matrix = = = = 
 An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix with real entries whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors ( that is , orthonormal vectors ) . Equivalently , a matrix A is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse : 
 <formula> 
 which entails 
 <formula> 
 where I is the identity matrix of size n . 
 An orthogonal matrix A is necessarily invertible ( with inverse A − 1 
 = AT ) , unitary ( A − 1 = 
 A * ) , and normal ( A * A = AA * ) . The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either + 1 or − 1 . A special orthogonal matrix is an orthogonal matrix with determinant + 1 . As a linear transformation , every orthogonal matrix with determinant + 1 is a pure rotation , while every orthogonal matrix with determinant -1 is either a pure reflection , or a composition of reflection and rotation . 
 The complex analogue of an orthogonal matrix is a unitary matrix . 
 = = = Main operations = = = 
 = = = = Trace = = = = 
 The trace , tr ( A ) of a square matrix A is the sum of its diagonal entries . While matrix multiplication is not commutative as mentioned above , the trace of the product of two matrices is independent of the order of the factors : 
 tr ( AB ) 
 = tr ( BA ) . 
 This is immediate from the definition of matrix multiplication : 
 <formula> 
 Also , the trace of a matrix is equal to that of its transpose , that is , 
 tr ( A ) = 
 tr ( AT ) . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The determinant det ( A ) or | A | of a square matrix A is a number encoding certain properties of the matrix . A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero . Its absolute value equals the area ( in R2 ) or volume ( in R3 ) of the image of the unit square ( or cube ) , while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map : the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved . 
 The determinant of 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 matrices is given by 
 <formula> 
 The determinant of 3 @-@ by @-@ 3 matrices involves 6 terms ( rule of <unk> ) . The more lengthy Leibniz formula <unk> these two formulae to all dimensions . 
 The determinant of a product of square matrices equals the product of their determinants : 
 det ( AB ) = det ( A ) · det ( B ) . 
 Adding a multiple of any row to another row , or a multiple of any column to another column , does not change the determinant . <unk> two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by − 1 . Using these operations , any matrix can be transformed to a lower ( or upper ) triangular matrix , and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal ; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix . Finally , the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors , that is , determinants of smaller matrices . This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants ( taking as starting case the determinant of a 1 @-@ by @-@ 1 matrix , which is its unique entry , or even the determinant of a 0 @-@ by @-@ 0 matrix , which is 1 ) , that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula . Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer 's rule , where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system 's variables . 
 = = = = Eigenvalues and eigenvectors = = = = 
 A number λ and a non @-@ zero vector v satisfying 
 Av 
 = λv 
 are called an eigenvalue and an eigenvector of A , respectively . The number λ is an eigenvalue of an n × n @-@ matrix A if and only if A − <unk> is not invertible , which is equivalent to 
 <formula> 
 The polynomial pA in an indeterminate X given by evaluation the determinant det ( <unk> − A ) is called the characteristic polynomial of A. It is a <unk> polynomial of degree n . Therefore the polynomial equation pA ( λ ) = 
 0 has at most n different solutions , that is , eigenvalues of the matrix . They may be complex even if the entries of A are real . According to the Cayley – Hamilton theorem , pA ( A ) = 0 , that is , the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the zero matrix . 
 = = Computational aspects = = 
 Matrix calculations can be often performed with different techniques . Many problems can be solved by both direct algorithms or iterative approaches . For example , the eigenvectors of a square matrix can be obtained by finding a sequence of vectors xn converging to an eigenvector when n tends to infinity . 
 To be able to choose the more appropriate algorithm for each specific problem , it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms . The domain studying these matters is called numerical linear algebra . As with other numerical situations , two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability . 
 Determining the complexity of an algorithm means finding upper bounds or estimates of how many elementary operations such as additions and multiplications of scalars are necessary to perform some algorithm , e.g. , multiplication of matrices . For example , calculating the matrix product of two n @-@ by @-@ n matrix using the definition given above needs <unk> multiplications , since for any of the n2 entries of the product , n multiplications are necessary . The Strassen algorithm outperforms this " naive " algorithm ; it needs only <unk> multiplications . A refined approach also incorporates specific features of the computing devices . 
 In many practical situations additional information about the matrices involved is known . An important case are sparse matrices , that is , matrices most of whose entries are zero . There are specifically adapted algorithms for , say , solving linear systems Ax 
 = b for sparse matrices A , such as the conjugate gradient method . 
 An algorithm is , roughly speaking , numerically stable , if little deviations in the input values do not lead to big deviations in the result . For example , calculating the inverse of a matrix via Laplace 's formula ( Adj ( A ) denotes the <unk> matrix of A ) 
 A − 1 = 
 Adj ( A ) / det ( A ) 
 may lead to significant rounding errors if the determinant of the matrix is very small . The norm of a matrix can be used to capture the conditioning of linear algebraic problems , such as computing a matrix 's inverse . 
 Although most computer languages are not designed with commands or libraries for matrices , as early as the 1970s , some engineering desktop computers such as the HP <unk> had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices . Some computer languages such as APL were designed to manipulate matrices , and various mathematical programs can be used to aid computing with matrices . 
 = = Decomposition = = 
 There are several methods to render matrices into a more easily accessible form . They are generally referred to as matrix decomposition or matrix factorization techniques . The interest of all these techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question , such as determinant , rank or inverse , so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation , or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry out for some types of matrices . 
 The LU decomposition factors matrices as a product of lower ( L ) and an upper triangular matrices ( U ) . Once this decomposition is calculated , linear systems can be solved more efficiently , by a simple technique called forward and back substitution . Likewise , inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate . The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm ; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form . Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices , which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row . Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A as a product <unk> ∗ , where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix . 
 The <unk> or <unk> expresses A as a product VDV − 1 , where D is a diagonal matrix and V is a suitable invertible matrix . If A can be written in this form , it is called <unk> . More generally , and applicable to all matrices , the Jordan decomposition transforms a matrix into Jordan normal form , that is to say matrices whose only nonzero entries are the eigenvalues λ1 to <unk> of A , placed on the main diagonal and possibly entries equal to one directly above the main diagonal , as shown at the right . Given the <unk> , the nth power of A ( that is , n @-@ fold iterated matrix multiplication ) can be calculated via 
 An 
 = ( VDV − 1 ) n = 
 VDV − <unk> − 1 ... VDV − 1 = <unk> − 1 
 and the power of a diagonal matrix can be calculated by taking the corresponding powers of the diagonal entries , which is much easier than doing the exponentiation for A instead . This can be used to compute the matrix exponential <unk> , a need frequently arising in solving linear differential equations , matrix logarithms and square roots of matrices . To avoid numerically ill @-@ conditioned situations , further algorithms such as the Schur decomposition can be employed . 
 = = Abstract algebraic aspects and generalizations = = 
 Matrices can be generalized in different ways . Abstract algebra uses matrices with entries in more general fields or even rings , while linear algebra codifies properties of matrices in the notion of linear maps . It is possible to consider matrices with infinitely many columns and rows . Another extension are tensors , which can be seen as higher @-@ dimensional arrays of numbers , as opposed to vectors , which can often be realised as sequences of numbers , while matrices are rectangular or two @-@ dimensional arrays of numbers . Matrices , subject to certain requirements tend to form groups known as matrix groups . Similarly under certain conditions matrices form rings known as matrix rings . Though the product of matrices is not in general commutative yet certain matrices form fields known as matrix fields . 
 = = = Matrices with more general entries = = = 
 This article focuses on matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers . However , matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers . As a first step of generalization , any field , that is , a set where addition , subtraction , multiplication and division operations are defined and well @-@ behaved , may be used instead of R or C , for example rational numbers or finite fields . For example , coding theory makes use of matrices over finite fields . Wherever eigenvalues are considered , as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field than that of the entries of the matrix ; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries . The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field ( e.g. , to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real ) then allows considering each square matrix to possess a full set of eigenvalues . Alternatively one can consider only matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field , such as C , from the outset . 
 More generally , abstract algebra makes great use of matrices with entries in a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist . The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting , too . The set M ( n , R ) of all square n @-@ by @-@ n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring , isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R @-@ module Rn . If the ring R is commutative , that is , its multiplication is commutative , then M ( n , R ) is a unitary noncommutative ( unless n = 1 ) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula ; such a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible in R , <unk> the situation over a field F , where every nonzero element is invertible . Matrices over <unk> are called <unk> . 
 Matrices do not always have all their entries in the same ring – or even in any ring at all . One special but common case is block matrices , which may be considered as matrices whose entries themselves are matrices . The entries need not be quadratic matrices , and thus need not be members of any ordinary ring ; but their sizes must fulfil certain compatibility conditions . 
 = = = Relationship to linear maps = = = 
 Linear maps Rn → Rm are equivalent to m @-@ by @-@ n matrices , as described above . More generally , any linear map f : V → W between finite @-@ dimensional vector spaces can be described by a matrix A 
 = ( aij ) , after choosing bases v1 , ... , vn of V , and w1 , ... , <unk> of W ( so n is the dimension of V and m is the dimension of W ) , which is such that 
 <formula> 
 In other words , column j of A expresses the image of <unk> in terms of the basis vectors wi of W ; thus this relation uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. Note that the matrix depends on the choice of the bases : different choices of bases give rise to different , but equivalent matrices . Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light , for example , the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A , with respect to the dual bases . 
 These properties can be restated in a more natural way : the category of all matrices with entries in a field <formula> with multiplication as composition is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps over this field . 
 More generally , the set of m × n matrices can be used to represent the R @-@ linear maps between the free modules Rm and Rn for an arbitrary ring R with unity . When n = 
 m composition of these maps is possible , and this gives rise to the matrix ring of n × n matrices representing the endomorphism ring of Rn . 
 = = = Matrix groups = = = 
 A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of objects together with a binary operation , that is , an operation combining any two objects to a third , subject to certain requirements . A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group . Since in a group every element has to be invertible , the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size , called the general linear groups . 
 Any property of matrices that is preserved under matrix products and inverses can be used to define further matrix groups . For example , matrices with a given size and with a determinant of 1 form a subgroup of ( that is , a smaller group contained in ) their general linear group , called a special linear group . Orthogonal matrices , determined by the condition 
 MTM = I , 
 form the orthogonal group . Every orthogonal matrix has determinant 1 or − 1 . Orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 form a subgroup called special orthogonal group . 
 Every finite group is isomorphic to a matrix group , as one can see by considering the regular representation of the symmetric group . General groups can be studied using matrix groups , which are comparatively well @-@ understood , by means of representation theory . 
 = = = Infinite matrices = = = 
 It is also possible to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and / or columns even if , being infinite objects , one cannot write down such matrices explicitly . All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows , and every element in the set indexing columns , there is a well @-@ defined entry ( these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers ) . The basic operations of addition , subtraction , scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem ; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries , and these are not defined in general . 
 If R is any ring with unity , then the ring of <unk> of <formula> as a right R module is isomorphic to the ring of column finite matrices <formula> whose entries are indexed by <formula> , and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries . The <unk> of M considered as a left R module result in an analogous object , the row finite matrices <formula> whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries . 
 If infinite matrices are used to describe linear maps , then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but a finite number of nonzero entries , for the following reason . For a matrix A to describe a linear map f : V → W , bases for both spaces must have been chosen ; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a ( finite ) linear combination of basis vectors , so that written as a ( column ) vector v of coefficients , only finitely many entries vi are nonzero . Now the columns of A describe the images by f of individual basis vectors of V in the basis of W , which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries . There is no restriction on the rows of A however : in the product A · v there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved , so every one of its entries , even if it is given as an infinite sum of products , involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined . Moreover , this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them , whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries , because each of those columns do . One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined ( provided as usual that the column @-@ index and row @-@ index sets match ) , is again of the same type , and corresponds to the composition of linear maps . 
 If R is a normed ring , then the condition of row or column finiteness can be relaxed . With the norm in place , absolutely convergent series can be used instead of finite sums . For example , the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring . Analogously of course , the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring . 
 In that vein , infinite matrices can also be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces , where convergence and continuity questions arise , which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed . However , the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter , and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead . 
 = = = Empty matrices = = = 
 An empty matrix is a matrix in which the number of rows or columns ( or both ) is zero . Empty matrices help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space . For example , if A is a 3 @-@ by @-@ 0 matrix and B is a 0 @-@ by @-@ 3 matrix , then AB is the 3 @-@ by @-@ 3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3 @-@ dimensional space V to itself , while BA is a 0 @-@ by @-@ 0 matrix . There is no common notation for empty matrices , but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them . The determinant of the 0 @-@ by @-@ 0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1 . This value is also consistent with the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant 1 , a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants . 
 = = Applications = = 
 There are numerous applications of matrices , both in mathematics and other sciences . Some of them merely take advantage of the compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix . For example , in game theory and economics , the payoff matrix encodes the payoff for two players , depending on which out of a given ( finite ) set of alternatives the players choose . Text mining and automated thesaurus compilation makes use of document @-@ term matrices such as tf @-@ <unk> to track frequencies of certain words in several documents . 
 Complex numbers can be represented by particular real 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 matrices via 
 <formula> 
 under which addition and multiplication of complex numbers and matrices correspond to each other . For example , 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 rotation matrices represent the multiplication with some complex number of absolute value 1 , as above . A similar interpretation is possible for quaternions and Clifford algebras in general . 
 Early encryption techniques such as the Hill cipher also used matrices . However , due to the linear nature of matrices , these codes are comparatively easy to break . Computer graphics uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish tasks such as projecting a three @-@ dimensional object onto a two @-@ dimensional screen , corresponding to a theoretical camera observation . Matrices over a polynomial ring are important in the study of control theory . 
 Chemistry makes use of matrices in various ways , particularly since the use of quantum theory to discuss molecular bonding and spectroscopy . Examples are the overlap matrix and the Fock matrix used in solving the <unk> equations to obtain the molecular orbitals of the Hartree – Fock method . 
 = = = Graph theory = = = 
 The adjacency matrix of a finite graph is a basic notion of graph theory . It records which vertices of the graph are connected by an edge . Matrices containing just two different values ( 1 and 0 meaning for example " yes " and " no " , respectively ) are called logical matrices . The distance ( or cost ) matrix contains information about distances of the edges . These concepts can be applied to websites connected by hyperlinks or cities connected by roads etc . , in which case ( unless the connection network is extremely dense ) the matrices tend to be sparse , that is , contain few nonzero entries . Therefore , specifically tailored matrix algorithms can be used in network theory . 
 = = = Analysis and geometry = = = 
 The Hessian matrix of a differentiable function ƒ : Rn → R consists of the second derivatives of ƒ with respect to the several coordinate directions , that is , 
 <formula> 
 It encodes information about the local growth behaviour of the function : given a critical point x = ( x1 , ... , xn ) , that is , a point where the first partial derivatives <formula> of ƒ vanish , the function has a local minimum if the Hessian matrix is positive definite . Quadratic programming can be used to find global minima or maxima of quadratic functions closely related to the ones attached to matrices ( see above ) . 
 Another matrix frequently used in geometrical situations is the Jacobi matrix of a differentiable map f : Rn → Rm . If f1 , ... , fm denote the components of f , then the Jacobi matrix is defined as 
 <formula> 
 If n > m , and if the rank of the Jacobi matrix attains its maximal value m , f is locally invertible at that point , by the implicit function theorem . 
 Partial differential equations can be classified by considering the matrix of coefficients of the highest @-@ order differential operators of the equation . For elliptic partial differential equations this matrix is positive definite , which has decisive influence on the set of possible solutions of the equation in question . 
 The finite element method is an important numerical method to solve partial differential equations , widely applied in simulating complex physical systems . It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions , where the pieces are chosen with respect to a sufficiently fine grid , which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation . 
 = = = Probability theory and statistics = = = 
 Stochastic matrices are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors , that is , whose entries are non @-@ negative and sum up to one . Stochastic matrices are used to define Markov chains with finitely many states . A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row . Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states , that is , states that any particle attains eventually , can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices . 
 Statistics also makes use of matrices in many different forms . Descriptive statistics is concerned with describing data sets , which can often be represented as data matrices , which may then be subjected to dimensionality reduction techniques . The covariance matrix encodes the mutual variance of several random variables . Another technique using matrices are linear least squares , a method that approximates a finite set of pairs ( x1 , y1 ) , ( x2 , y2 ) , ... , ( xN , <unk> ) , by a linear function 
 yi ≈ <unk> + b , i = 1 , ... , N 
 which can be formulated in terms of matrices , related to the singular value decomposition of matrices . 
 Random matrices are matrices whose entries are random numbers , subject to suitable probability distributions , such as matrix normal distribution . Beyond probability theory , they are applied in domains ranging from number theory to physics . 
 = = = Symmetries and transformations in physics = = = 
 Linear transformations and the associated symmetries play a key role in modern physics . For example , elementary particles in quantum field theory are classified as representations of the Lorentz group of special relativity and , more specifically , by their behavior under the spin group . Concrete representations involving the Pauli matrices and more general gamma matrices are an integral part of the physical description of fermions , which behave as <unk> . For the three lightest quarks , there is a group @-@ theoretical representation involving the special unitary group SU ( 3 ) ; for their calculations , physicists use a convenient matrix representation known as the Gell @-@ Mann matrices , which are also used for the SU ( 3 ) gauge group that forms the basis of the modern description of strong nuclear interactions , quantum chromodynamics . The Cabibbo – Kobayashi – Maskawa matrix , in turn , expresses the fact that the basic quark states that are important for weak interactions are not the same as , but linearly related to the basic quark states that define particles with specific and distinct masses . 
 = = = Linear combinations of quantum states = = = 
 The first model of quantum mechanics ( Heisenberg , 1925 ) represented the theory 's operators by infinite @-@ dimensional matrices acting on quantum states . This is also referred to as matrix mechanics . One particular example is the density matrix that characterizes the " mixed " state of a quantum system as a linear combination of elementary , " pure " eigenstates . 
 Another matrix serves as a key tool for describing the scattering experiments that form the cornerstone of experimental particle physics : Collision reactions such as occur in particle accelerators , where non @-@ interacting particles head towards each other and collide in a small interaction zone , with a new set of non @-@ interacting particles as the result , can be described as the scalar product of outgoing particle states and a linear combination of <unk> particle states . The linear combination is given by a matrix known as the S @-@ matrix , which encodes all information about the possible interactions between particles . 
 = = = Normal modes = = = 
 A general application of matrices in physics is to the description of linearly coupled harmonic systems . The equations of motion of such systems can be described in matrix form , with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term , and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions . The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system 's eigenvectors , its normal modes , by <unk> the matrix equation . Techniques like this are crucial when it comes to the internal dynamics of molecules : the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms . They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations , and oscillations in electrical circuits . 
 = = = Geometrical optics = = = 
 Geometrical optics provides further matrix applications . In this <unk> theory , the wave nature of light is neglected . The result is a model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays . If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small , the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two @-@ component vector with a two @-@ by @-@ two matrix called ray transfer matrix : the vector 's components are the light ray 's slope and its distance from the optical axis , while the matrix encodes the properties of the optical element . Actually , there are two kinds of matrices , viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface , and a translation matrix , describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface , where another refraction matrix applies . The optical system , consisting of a combination of lenses and / or reflective elements , is simply described by the matrix resulting from the product of the components ' matrices . 
 = = = Electronics = = = 
 Traditional mesh analysis and nodal analysis in electronics lead to a system of linear equations that can be described with a matrix . 
 The behaviour of many electronic components can be described using matrices . Let A be a 2 @-@ dimensional vector with the component 's input voltage v1 and input current i1 as its elements , and let B be a 2 @-@ dimensional vector with the component 's output voltage v2 and output current i2 as its elements . Then the behaviour of the electronic component can be described by B = H · A , where H is a 2 x 2 matrix containing one impedance element ( <unk> ) , one admittance element ( <unk> ) and two dimensionless elements ( <unk> and <unk> ) . Calculating a circuit now reduces to multiplying matrices . 
 = = History = = 
 Matrices have a long history of application in solving linear equations but they were known as arrays until the 1800s . The Chinese text The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art written in 10th – 2nd century BCE is the first example of the use of array methods to solve simultaneous equations , including the concept of determinants . In 1545 Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano brought the method to Europe when he published Ars Magna . The Japanese mathematician Seki used the same array methods to solve simultaneous equations in 1683 . The Dutch Mathematician Jan de Witt represented transformations using arrays in his 1659 book Elements of Curves ( 1659 ) . Between 1700 and 1710 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz publicized the use of arrays for recording information or solutions and experimented with over 50 different systems of arrays . Cramer presented his rule in 1750 . 
 The term " matrix " ( Latin for " womb " , derived from mater — mother ) was coined by James Joseph Sylvester in 1850 , who understood a matrix as an object giving rise to a number of determinants today called minors , that is to say , determinants of smaller matrices that derive from the original one by removing columns and rows . In an 1851 paper , Sylvester explains : 
 I have in previous papers defined a " Matrix " as a rectangular array of terms , out of which different systems of determinants may be engendered as from the womb of a common parent . 
 Arthur Cayley published a treatise on geometric transformations using matrices that were not rotated versions of the coefficients being investigated as had previously been done . Instead he defined operations such as addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division as transformations of those matrices and showed the associative and distributive properties held true . Cayley investigated and demonstrated the non @-@ commutative property of matrix multiplication as well as the commutative property of matrix addition . Early matrix theory had limited the use of arrays almost exclusively to determinants and Arthur Cayley 's abstract matrix operations were revolutionary . He was instrumental in proposing a matrix concept independent of equation systems . In 1858 Cayley published his A memoir on the theory of matrices in which he proposed and demonstrated the Cayley @-@ Hamilton theorem . 
 An English mathematician named Cullis was the first to use modern bracket notation for matrices in 1913 and he simultaneously demonstrated the first significant use of the notation A 
 = [ ai , j ] to represent a matrix where ai , j refers to the ith row and the <unk> column . 
 The study of determinants sprang from several sources . Number @-@ theoretical problems led Gauss to relate coefficients of quadratic forms , that is , expressions such as x2 + xy − <unk> , and linear maps in three dimensions to matrices . Eisenstein further developed these notions , including the remark that , in modern parlance , matrix products are non @-@ commutative . Cauchy was the first to prove general statements about determinants , using as definition of the determinant of a matrix A = 
 [ ai , j ] the following : replace the powers <unk> by <unk> in the polynomial 
 <formula> , 
 where Π denotes the product of the indicated terms . He also showed , in 1829 , that the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices are real . Jacobi studied " functional determinants " — later called Jacobi determinants by Sylvester — which can be used to describe geometric transformations at a local ( or infinitesimal ) level , see above ; Kronecker 's <unk> über die Theorie der <unk> and Weierstrass ' Zur <unk> , both published in 1903 , first treated determinants axiomatically , as opposed to previous more concrete approaches such as the mentioned formula of Cauchy . At that point , determinants were firmly established . 
 Many theorems were first established for small matrices only , for example the Cayley – Hamilton theorem was proved for 2 × 2 matrices by Cayley in the aforementioned memoir , and by Hamilton for 4 × 4 matrices . Frobenius , working on bilinear forms , generalized the theorem to all dimensions ( 1898 ) . Also at the end of the 19th century the Gauss – Jordan elimination ( generalizing a special case now known as Gauss elimination ) was established by Jordan . In the early 20th century , matrices attained a central role in linear <unk> partially due to their use in classification of the hypercomplex number systems of the previous century . 
 The inception of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg , Born and Jordan led to studying matrices with infinitely many rows and columns . Later , von Neumann carried out the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , by further developing functional analytic notions such as linear operators on Hilbert spaces , which , very roughly speaking , correspond to Euclidean space , but with an infinity of independent directions . 
 = = = Other historical usages of the word “ matrix ” in mathematics = = = 
 The word has been used in unusual ways by at least two authors of historical importance . 
 Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica ( 1910 – 1913 ) use the word “ matrix ” in the context of their Axiom of reducibility . They proposed this axiom as a means to reduce any function to one of lower type , successively , so that at the “ bottom ” ( 0 order ) the function is identical to its extension : 
 “ Let us give the name of matrix to any function , of however many variables , which does not involve any apparent variables . Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalization , that is , by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some value of one of the arguments , the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined ” . 
 For example , a function Φ ( x , y ) of two variables x and y can be reduced to a collection of functions of a single variable , e.g. , y , by “ considering ” the function for all possible values of “ individuals ” ai substituted in place of variable x . And then the resulting collection of functions of the single variable y , that is , ∀ ai : Φ ( ai , y ) , can be reduced to a “ matrix ” of values by “ considering ” the function for all possible values of “ individuals ” bi substituted in place of variable y : 
 ∀ bj ∀ ai : Φ ( ai , bj ) . 
 Alfred Tarski in his 1946 Introduction to Logic used the word “ matrix ” synonymously with the notion of truth table as used in mathematical logic .

 = Albin of Brechin = 
 Albin ( or Albinus ) ( died 1269 ) was a 13th @-@ century prelate of the Kingdom of Scotland . A university graduate , Albin is known for his ecclesiastical career in the diocese of Brechin , centred on Angus in east @-@ central Scotland . 
 Almost certainly a native of Angus , he appears to be a descendant of David of Scotland , Earl of Huntingdon , brother of King William I of Scotland , through an illegitimate son whom Earl David settled in the area around Brechin . 
 Albin , himself an illegitimate child , made his career as a churchman in the local diocese , and served for some time as precentor of Brechin Cathedral before , in 1246 , being elected Bishop of Brechin . He remained Bishop of Brechin until his death in 1269 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Background and early career = = = 
 Albin 's family and origin are unclear . It has been suggested that he may have been a son of Henry de Brechin ( died 1244 or 1245 ) , the bastard son of David of Huntingdon ( " Earl David " ) and the younger brother of King William the Lion ; Henry bore the title Lord of Brechin , and was given lands there by his father . The strongest evidence of Albin 's relationship with Henry is that his episcopal seal bore the arms of Earl David . 
 Albin 's family certainly had strong connections in the church of Brechin . A known kinsman ( nepos ) of Albin 's , Adam , held the position of Archdeacon of Brechin , probably by 1242 , but certainly by 1264 . It has been suggested that this Adam was Adam de Brechin , probable son of Henry de Brechin 's successor William de Brechin ( died between 1286 and 1294 ) , who held benefices in the see of Brechin in 1274 . 
 Albin became precentor of Brechin Cathedral , the first known person to hold that office ; he was not , however , recorded in that position until the summer of 1246 , when he was confirmed as Bishop of Brechin . Because Albin was born illegitimately , he needed papal dispensation to hold that office , which he obtained from the papal legate Otto of <unk> , Bishop of Porto , in the autumn or early winter of 1239 , when that legate visited Scotland . 
 By 1246 , Albin was styled " Master " , indicating that he had completed many years of university study ; what he studied , and at which university , is unknown .

 Albin became Bishop of Brechin following an election and then a successful appeal for confirmation to the papacy . Pope Innocent IV 's mandate for confirmation gave the details of the election . Following the death of Gregory , Bishop of Brechin , the cathedral chapter selected three of their members to elect the next bishop , and they unanimously forwarded their precentor , Albin . Because of Albin 's " defect of birth " ( i.e. his illegitimacy ) , they <unk> the papacy to repeat the earlier dispensation . 
 The Pope followed legate Otto 's earlier dispensation , and on 19 July 1246 issued the mandate for confirmation and consecration to the Kingdom of Scotland 's three senior bishops : David de Bernham , Bishop of St Andrews ; William de Bondington , Bishop of Glasgow ; and Geoffrey de <unk> , Bishop of Dunkeld . The consecration took place some time before 13 May 1247 , the date Albin was given his first recorded task as a consecrated bishop , when he , Clement , Bishop of Dunblane , and David de Bernham , Bishop of St Andrews , were authorised to perform the episcopal consecration of Peter de Ramsay as Bishop of Aberdeen . 
 = = = Early episcopate , 1240s = = = 
 Albin witnessed a royal charter at Forfar on 4 July 1246 . In the following year , on 11 July and 8 August 1248 , the Pope wrote to Albin commanding him to ensure that a settlement between Inchaffray Abbey in Strathearn , diocese of Dunblane , and Bishop Clement of Dunblane be peacefully kept , with Inchaffray being portrayed as the side in more need of protection . 
 In the same period , he ordained vicarages for Arbroath Abbey in Angus , and on 22 September 1248 settled a long @-@ standing property dispute between the church of Brechin and Arbroath Abbey . However , he had left Scotland by the following month , and was in England , at <unk> Priory near Durham , where he granted many indulgences . 
 Following the death of Alexander II of Scotland on 6 July 1249 , the accession of the boy king , Alexander III of Scotland , meant minority administration , and as a result , factional politics . The government during this minority was divided between a faction centred on Walter Comyn , husband of the countess of Menteith , and Alan Durward ; the Comyn faction held the ascendancy between 1249 and 1252 , and again between 1255 and 1257 ; the Durward faction held the ascendancy between 1252 and 1255 , and again between 1257 and 1258 . 
 The available sources give no clue as to Albin 's pattern of allegiance in these factional politics , and neither do his recorded activities . Professor Donald Watt has suggested that Albin was probably aligned with the Durward faction , in contrast , for instance , to the allegedly Comyn aligned Clement of Dunblane . Watt even argued that Albin 's postulation was probably due to the influence of Alan Durward , who at the time was a close advisor of King Alexander II . 
 = = = Middle episcopate , 1250s = = = 
 Despite Albin 's suggested <unk> allegiance , Bishop Albin , Bishop David de Bernham of St Andrews and Abel de Gullane , Archdeacon of St Andrews , issued a letter of protest against the behaviour of the Durward dominated government ; they criticised Durward 's onslaught on the " liberties of the church " , probably in the aftermath of the translation of the relics of St Margaret to Dunfermline Abbey on 19 June 1250 . 
 In either 1253 or 1254 , Albin was an assessor at a court held by the Justiciar of Scotia , Alexander Comyn , Earl of Buchan . In April 1253 , he summoned Bishop David de Bernham to appear before the papal curia , in order to resolve a dispute he and the culdees of St Mary 's were having with St Andrews Cathedral Priory . 
 Albin performed various tasks in this period on behalf of the papacy . On 15 May 1253 , Bishop Albin and Richard de Inverkeithing , Bishop of Dunkeld , were appointed to be papal <unk> , and instructed by the papacy to protect Bishop William de Bondington from being summoned to lay courts on account of matters concerning his bishopric . 
 Bishop Albin , with the Archdeacon of Brechin , was named as a papal mandatory again on 4 January 1254 and authorised to put Nicholas de Hedon in possession of the deanery of Elgin Cathedral . Along with Clement of Dunblane , Albin was named by the pope as a conservator of the privileges given to Abel de Gullane , newly provided Bishop of St Andrews , on 23 March . 
 On 22 June , Bishop Albin assisted the justiciar Alexander Comyn in conducting a <unk> in eastern Angus . Albin appears to have left Scotland again some time after this , as he appears active around Durham again in either 1254 or 1255 . Back in Scotland , at Arbroath on 21 September 1256 , he and Bishop Clement of Dunblane passed judgment on William de <unk> , vicar of the parish church of Dundee , after <unk> had been withholding the revenues due to the church 's rector , Lindores Abbey . 
 During this period , Albin was involved in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom . An alleged papal bull , dated 13 December 1255 , had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory , along with Robert de <unk> , with instructions to investigate Alan Durward 's claim to the earldom of Mar ; however , the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257 , after Durward 's rivals had seized power . During the months preceding this denunciation , Albin was once again out of Scotland ; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham . 
 = = = Later episcopate , 1260s = = = 
 For three years , Albin 's activities are unreported until , on 30 April 1260 , he was recorded as being at Montrose , again as a papal mandatory . He gave judgment on a dispute between Archibald , Bishop of Moray , and the latter 's cathedral chapter , concerning the bishop 's rights of visitation . On 13 June 1263 , Albin , Roger , Bishop of Ross , and Richard de Inverkeithing , Bishop of Dunkeld , were selected by the papacy to judge the fitness and , if appropriate , consecrate Walter de <unk> as Bishop of Caithness . 
 In the following year , Albin was involved in a controversy regarding the archdeaconry of Brechin . On 23 January 1364 , papal judge @-@ delegates were appointed to investigate allegations of nepotism which had been made against him . The allegations centred on Bishop Albin 's handling of a vacancy to the Brechin archdeaconry ; Albin had given collation of the archdeaconry to the Abbot of Arbroath , who then appointed Adam , one of Albin 's relatives . The outcome of the case is not known , and it is therefore unclear whether or not Adam was deposed as archdeacon . All that can be confirmed is that no other archdeacon is attested by name until 1284 . 
 The stay of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi ( later Pope Adrian V ) in England from 29 October 1265 , until July 1268 , led to a great deal of diplomatic activity in the Scottish church , in which Albin was perhaps involved . Cardinal Ottobono imposed a general tax on the English church , which he extended to Scotland . King Alexander III forbade the payment of this money , and appealed to the papacy ; but in 1267 the Scottish clergy persuaded Alexander to abandon his appeal , while they made their own reduced payments . Meanwhile , Cardinal Ottobono 's legatine council , to which the Scottish church had sent four delegates , promulgated canons for the English church which he expected the Scottish church to incorporate ; the Scottish church does not appear to have done so , however . 
 Bishop Albin witnessed William de Brechin 's foundation charter of Maison Dieu chapel , Brechin , sometime between March and July 1267 , the last known recorded reference to him until 1269 . His death in that year was reported in the Chronicle of Melrose , but without any details of the cause , or location , or Albin 's age . 
 = = = General notes about Albin 's episcopate = = = 
 During Albin 's episcopate , the incorporation of the Céli Dé ( " vassal of God " ) into the cathedral chapter was probably brought near to completion . The Céli Dé were the Scottish monks who formed the base of the pre @-@ Reform , pre @-@ 13th century monastery of Brechin before it was organised into a bishopric in the 12th century . A bull of Pope Innocent IV of 18 February 1250 stated that : 
 The brethren who have been wont to be in the church of Brechin were called <unk> and now by change of name are styled canons 
 These Céli Dé had been proclaimed as part of the secular cathedral by an act of Bishop Gregory , Albin 's predecessor . 
 During his episcopate , Albin is said to have attracted Egbert , an English Arabic scholar and Carmelite friar , to teach in Brechin . A later tradition held that a now obscure local martyr named <unk> , " martyr of Brechin " , had been translated to Brechin Cathedral during Albin 's episcopate ; the date given is 2 January but the year is not recorded . 
 = National Popular Vote Interstate Compact = 
 The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact ( NPVIC ) is an agreement among several U.S. states and the District of Columbia to award all their respective electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia . The compact is designed to ensure that the candidate who wins the most popular votes is elected president , and it will come into effect only when it will guarantee that outcome . As of 2016 , it has been joined by ten states and the District of Columbia ; their 165 combined electoral votes amount to 30 @.@ 7 % of the total Electoral College vote , and 61 @.@ 1 % of the 270 votes needed for it to have legal force . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 Proposed in the form of an interstate compact , the agreement would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes ( currently at least 270 ) in the Electoral College . In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states , the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia . As a result , the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College . Until the compact 's conditions are met , all states award electoral votes in their current manner . 
 The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II , Section 1 , Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution , which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College . The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors , and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate its own electors . States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years , with regular changes in the nation 's early decades . Today , all but two states ( Maine and Nebraska ) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide . 
 = = Motivation behind the compact = = 
 Under current state laws , a presidential candidate could lose the popular vote nationally but still win the presidency Public opinion surveys suggest that a majority of Americans support the idea of a popular vote for President . A 2007 poll found that 72 % favored replacing the Electoral College with a direct election , including 78 % of Democrats , 60 % of Republicans , and 73 % of independent voters . Polls dating back to 1944 have shown a consistent majority of the public supporting a direct vote . Reasons behind the compact include : 
 The Electoral College allows a candidate to win the Presidency while losing the popular vote , as happened in the elections of 1824 , 1876 , 1888 and 2000 . In the 2000 election , the outcome was decided by 528 votes in Florida . 
 The Electoral College system effectively forces candidates to focus disproportionately on a small percentage of pivotal swing states , while sidelining the rest . A study by <unk> reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states , while the other 45 states received very little attention . The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising . This means that swing state issues receive more attention , while issues important to other states are largely ignored . 
 The Electoral College system tends to decrease voter turnout in states without close races . Voters living outside the swing states have a greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state . This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote . A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6 @.@ 3 % from the previous presidential election , compared to an increase of only 3 @.@ 8 % in noncompetitive states . A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement ( <unk> ) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64 @.@ 4 % in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47 @.@ 6 % in the rest of the country — a 17 % gap . 
 = = Debate = = 
 The project has been supported by editorials in many newspapers , including the New York Times , the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , the Los Angeles Times , the Boston Globe , and the Minneapolis Star Tribune , arguing that the existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues , while a popular election would equalize voting power . Others have argued against it , including the Honolulu Star @-@ Bulletin . An article by Pierre S. du Pont , IV , a former governor of Delaware , in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal has called the project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run . A collection of readings pro and con has been assembled by the League of Women Voters . 
 Some of the major points of debate are detailed below : 
 = = = Campaign focus = = = 
 Under the current system , campaign focus – in terms of spending , visits , and attention paid to regional or state issues – is largely limited to the few swing states whose electoral outcomes are competitive , with politically " solid " states mostly ignored by the campaigns . The maps to the right illustrate the amount spent on advertising and the number of visits to each state , relative to population , by the two major @-@ party candidates in the last stretch of the 2004 presidential campaign . Supporters of the compact contend that a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign with equal effort for votes in competitive and non @-@ competitive states alike . Critics of the compact argue that candidates would have less incentive to focus on states with smaller populations or fewer urban areas , and would thus be unmotivated to address rural issues . 
 = = = Close elections and election fraud = = = 
 Opponents of the compact have raised concerns about election fraud . In his article , Pete du Pont argues that in 2000 , " Mr. Gore 's 540 @,@ 000 @-@ vote margin amounted to 3 @.@ 1 votes in each of the country 's 175 @,@ 000 precincts . ' Finding ' three votes per precinct in urban areas is not a difficult thing ... " . However , National Popular Vote has argued that a direct election would in fact reduce the likelihood of a close election and decrease the feasibility of fraud . They contend that the large pool of 122 million votes spread across the country would make a close or fraudulent outcome much less likely than under the current system , in which the national winner may be determined by an extremely small vote margin in any one of the fifty @-@ one statewide tallies . 
 The NPVIC does not include any provision for a nationwide recount in the event that the vote tally is in dispute . While each state has established rules governing recounts in the event of a close or disputed statewide tally , it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state . Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system . 
 = = = Populous states versus low @-@ population states = = = 
 There is some debate over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large @-@ population states . Those who argue that the College favors low @-@ population states point out that such states have proportionally more electoral votes relative to their populations , because each state 's number of electors is greater by two than its ( proportionally allocated ) number of Congressional representatives . In the most populous state , California , this results in an electoral clout 16 % smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce , whereas the least @-@ populous states , with three electors , hold a voting power 143 % greater than they would under purely proportional allocation . The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter 's ballot , regardless of what state they live in . Others , however , believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner @-@ takes @-@ all system , the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout . 
 = = = Possible partisan advantage = = = 
 Some supporters and opponents of the NPVIC have based their position at least in part on a perceived partisan advantage of the compact . Governor Du Pont , a Republican , has argued that the compact would be an " urban power grab " and benefit Democrats . However , Saul <unk> of the Republican National Committee wrote that Republicans " need " the compact , citing what he believes to be the center @-@ right nature of the American electorate . New Yorker essayist Hendrik Hertzberg maintains that the compact would benefit neither party , noting that historically both Republicans and Democrats have been successful in winning the popular vote in presidential elections . In the last four elections , Democrats enjoyed an advantage from the electoral vote system in three elections ( 2012 , 2008 , and 2004 ) , whereas in 2000 the electoral system provided the Republicans with an advantage . 
 = = = Relevance of state @-@ level majorities = = = 
 Two governors who have vetoed NPVIC legislation , Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Linda Lingle of Hawaii , both in 2007 , objected to the compact on the grounds that it could require their states ' electoral votes to be awarded to a candidate who did not win a majority in their state . ( Both states have since enacted laws joining the compact . ) Supporters of the compact counter that under a national popular vote system , state @-@ level majorities are irrelevant ; in any state , votes cast contribute to the nationwide tally , which determines the winner . The preferences of individual voters are thus paramount , while state @-@ level majorities are an obsolete intermediary measure . 
 = = = Legality = = = 
 Supporters believe the compact is legal under Article II of the U.S. Constitution , which establishes the plenary power of the states to appoint their electors in any manner they see fit : " Each State shall appoint , in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct , a Number of Electors , equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress … " Proponents of this position include law professors Jamie Raskin , who co @-@ sponsored the first NPVIC bill to be signed into law , and Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar , who were the compact 's original proponents . 
 A 2008 assessment by law school student David <unk> suggested that the NPVIC could potentially violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , but the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012 precleared California 's entry into the compact under Section 5 of the Act , concluding that the compact had no adverse impact on California 's racial minority voters . The DOJ 's decision is consistent with the argument of <unk> 's Rob Richie that the NPVIC " treats all voters equally . " 
 <unk> also assailed the NPVIC as " an end @-@ run around the constitutional amendment process . " Raskin has responded : " the term ' end run ' has no known constitutional or legal meaning . More to the point , to the extent that we follow its meaning in real usage , the ' end run ' is a perfectly lawful play . " Raskin argues that the adoption of the term " end run " by the compact 's opponents is a tacit acknowledgment of the plan 's legality . 
 Ian Drake , an assistant professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact , has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact . In Drake 's view , only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid . Authors Michael Brody , Jennifer Hendricks , and Bradley <unk> have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC , if successfully enacted , would pass constitutional muster . 
 It is possible that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before it could go into effect . Article I , Section 10 of the US Constitution states that : " No State shall , without the Consent of Congress . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State , or with a foreign Power . " However , the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee , 148 U.S. 503 ( 1893 ) , and in several more recent cases , that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy . Every Vote Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states , not the federal government . Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system in such a way that it would require Congressional approval , while Ian Drake argues that Congress is actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC . NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states .

 Several proposals to abolish the Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in Congress over the decades . These efforts have , however , been hampered by the fact that a two @-@ thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states , where ratification by three @-@ fourths of the State legislatures is required for it to become operative . 
 = = = = Bayh – Celler Amendment = = = = 
 The amendment which came closest to success was the Bayh – Celler proposal during the 91st Congress . Introduced by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York as House Joint Resolution 681 , it would have replaced the Electoral College with a simpler plurality system based on the national popular vote . Under this system , the pair of candidates who had received the highest number of votes would win the presidency and vice presidency respectively , providing they won at least 40 % of the national popular vote . If no pair received 40 % of the popular vote , a runoff election would be held , in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest numbers of votes in the first election . The word " pair " was defined as " two persons who shall have consented to the joining of their names as candidates for the offices of President and Vice President . " Celler 's proposed constitutional amendment passed in the House of Representatives by a 338 – 70 vote in 1969 , but was filibustered in the Senate , where it died . 
 = = = = Every Vote Counts Amendment = = = = 
 A joint resolution to amend the Constitution , providing for the popular election of the president and vice president under a new electoral system was introduced in 2005 by Representative Gene Green of Texas . In 2009 , at the start of the 111th Congress , Green introduced <unk> 9 , commonly known as the Every Vote Counts Amendment . Two other joint resolutions were proposed in the 111th Congress to amend the Constitution to establish a national popular vote for the president and vice @-@ president . Sponsored by Congressman Jesse Jackson , Jr. of Illinois , <unk> 36 would require a majority vote for president . Sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida , S.J.Res. 4 would leave the method of election to an Act of Congress . Each of these measures died in committee . 
 = = = Academic plan = = = 
 In 2001 , Northwestern University law professor Robert Bennett suggested a plan in an academic publication to implement a National Popular Vote through a mechanism that would embrace state legislatures ' power to appoint electors , rather than resist that power . By coordinating , states constituting a majority of the Electoral College could effectively implement a popular vote . 
 Law professors ( and brothers ) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar defended the constitutionality of such a plan . They proposed that a group of states , through legislation , form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner , regardless of the balance of votes in their own state . These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college ( 270 votes ) , thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college . 
 The academic plan uses two constitutional features : 
 Presidential Electors Clause in Article 2 , section 1 , clause 2 which gives each state the power to determine the manner in which its electors are selected . 
 Compact Clause , Article I , section 10 , clause 3 under which it creates an enforceable compact . 
 The Amar brothers noted that such a plan could be enacted by the passage of laws in as few as eleven states and would probably not require Congressional approval , though this is not certain ( see Debate above ) . 
 = = = Organization and advocacy = = = 
 In 2006 , John Koza , a computer science professor at Stanford , was the lead author of Every Vote Equal , a book that makes a detailed case for his plan for an interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote . ( Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch @-@ off lottery ticket . ) That year , Koza , Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote , a non @-@ profit group to promote the legislation . The group has a <unk> advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn , Birch Bayh , and David <unk> , and former Representatives John Anderson , John Buchanan , and Tom Campbell . 
 By the time of the group 's opening news conference in February 2006 , the proposed interstate compact had been introduced in the Illinois legislature . With backing from National Popular Vote , the NPVIC legislation was introduced in five additional state legislatures in the 2006 session . It passed in the Colorado Senate and in both houses of the California legislature before being vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .

 In 2007 , NPVIC legislation was introduced in 42 states . It was passed by legislative chambers in Arkansas , California , Colorado , Illinois , New Jersey North Carolina , Maryland , and Hawaii .

 New Jersey became the second state to enter the compact when Governor Jon S. Corzine signed the bill on January 13 , 2008 . Illinois became the third state to join when Governor Rod Blagojevich signed it into law on April 7 , 2008 and Hawaii became the fourth on May 1 , 2008 , after the legislature overrode a second veto from the governor . 
 Washington became the fifth state to join when Governor Christine Gregoire signed it into law on April 28 , 2009 . Massachusetts became the sixth state to join when Governor Deval Patrick signed it into law on August 4 , 2010 . The District of Columbia entered into the compact when the bill was signed by Mayor Adrian Fenty on October 12 , 2010 . ( Neither chamber of Congress objected to the passage of the bill during the mandatory review period of 30 legislative days following that date , thus allowing the District 's action to proceed . ) 
 Vermont joined the compact when Governor Peter Shumlin signed it into law on April 22 , 2011 . California entered the compact on August 8 , 2011 , with Governor Jerry Brown 's signature . Rhode Island entered the compact on July 12 , 2013 , with Governor Lincoln Chafee 's signature . On April 15 , 2014 , New York entered the compact with a bipartisan vote in the NY assembly and Governor Andrew Cuomo 's signature . 
 NPVIC legislation has been introduced in all 50 states . States where only one chamber has adopted the legislation are Arkansas , Connecticut , Delaware , Maine , Michigan , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , Oklahoma and Oregon .

 Drama Queen is the seventh studio album by Puerto Rican reggaeton recording artist Ivy Queen . It was released on July 13 , 2010 by Machete Music . The album was written by Queen with help from Rafael Castillo , Marcos Masis and others , while production was handled by Luny Tunes , Tainy and Noriega . The album features collaborations with De La Ghetto , Frank Reyes , Wisin & Yandel and Franco " El Gorila " . It features a wide variety of musical styles in common with her previous album , Sentimiento , released three years earlier on a different label . 
 Selling 3 @,@ 000 units in its first week , Drama Queen debuted and peaked at number 163 on the US Billboard 200 chart , number three on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart , number one on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Albums chart and number 18 on the Billboard Rap Albums chart . The recording received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Urban Music Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2011 and two nominations at the Billboard Latin Music Awards of 2011 . The album garnered mainly positive reviews from critics , who praised the mixture of R & B and reggaeton . 
 Two singles were released from the album : " La Vida Es Así " and " Amor Puro " . The former became a commercial success ; it was supplied to Latin radio in urban and bachata versions , reaching the Top 10 in several Spanish @-@ language markets in the United States . The latter , however , failed to gain chart success .

 After the success of her 2007 effort Sentimiento , which spawned the Top 10 hit " Que <unk> " and was later certified platinum by the United States Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , a live album ( Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE ! ) was distributed by Machete in 2008 . The album included a studio track , " Dime " , which became Queen 's first single to top the Billboard Latin Rhythm Songs chart . 
 Queen signed a new record deal with the label in April 2010 , as it celebrated its fifth anniversary . The signing , described as a " 360 deal " , includes profit @-@ sharing in tours , sponsorships and merchandising . Ivy Queen was previously signed to a distribution deal with Univision Records , which was acquired by Machete parent company Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2008 . The president of Universal Music Latino and Machete , Walter Kolm , commented in a press release : " It 's a privilege to have Ivy Queen apart of our artistic roster . Ivy is an extraordinary woman with incomparable talent , and she 's number one in her genre . We 're happy to be able to work with her on her new album as well as future projects " . " I 'm very proud to be a part of Machete Music . They are a young , vibrant company that has created a name for itself in Latin music in the United States and the world . They are a strong and important company that has been recognized for nurturing their artists ’ creative talents " , said Queen about the partnership . The album was originally to be released after her third compilation album , Cosa Nostra : Hip @-@ Hop ( 2006 ) , as an concept album which would have Ivy Queen performing duets with female singers from different genres on new label Filtro Musik . However , this was changed and Sentimiento was released instead . Ivy Queen told Efe that the composition process started while she was heartbroken at home , and her emotions then burst out in the recording studio . She added the album brings together 16 of 26 songs she wrote during this period . When asked by Latina Magazine about the drama between the release of Sentimiento and Drama Queen , Queen said : 
 I ’ m single . For the first time in my life , I ’ m really experiencing what that ’ s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship ; I didn ’ t like being alone . But this time I ’ m realizing that people come into your life for a season , and my last relationship served its purpose . I can ’ t sit here and cry about it , because it ended right where it should have . A lot of that stuff is on the album .

 Collaborations on the album include Wisin & Yandel on " Acércate " ; former Aventura band member Lenny Santos , who plays guitar on " Cosas De La Vida " with Frank <unk> on vocals ; Franco " El Gorila " on " Jungle " ; De La Ghetto on " De La Calle " and Jadiel on " Amor A Primera Vista " . Queen said the collaboration with Wisin & Yandel came about from her work on their album , La Revolución ( 2009 ) . When speaking about the collaboration with Jadiel she said it was a decision she made with her heart : " When I collaborate with colleagues , I don 't care who is a hit on the radio and who isn 't " . The track " I Do " was to originally feature American R & B singer Beyoncé Knowles after Queen signed a contract with International Creative Management ( <unk> ) .

 Drama Queen has been described as " R & B meets reggaeton " ; it was the first time Ivy Queen experimented with R & B. Queen explained that the album was half hip hop and half reggaeton but that she had to include extra styles such as R & B and bachata . Musical textures on the album vary from R & B to tropical bachata , pop , rap and reggaeton , a more diverse set of musical styles than on Sentimiento . Themes include " cool & cocky , pool party , <unk> , partying and driving . " According to Frances Tirado of Primera Hora , the album demonstrates Queen 's vocal maturity and rhythmic evolution . The album 's lyrics explore heartbreak , love and the value of women in relationships . It contains original songs with sentimental lyrics , demonstrating Queen 's incorporation of musical fusion and sonic evolution ( in contrast to her previous studio albums ) .

 " Intro ( Listen To My Drama ) " is in a minor key and features a string ensemble and synthesizers . In the rap , Ivy Queen sings : " 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 9 @-@ 3 was the year that I started , Many have seen my rise and fall I 've seen many . Vigilant , I have an angel on my back , I have a throne flanked by holy souls . " Lyrically , Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton . " Te Voy A <unk> " ( I 'm Going To Make You Remember ) , also in a minor key , also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers . Lyrically , the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost . " Me Quiere " ( They Like Me ) is an R & B power ballad built on a snapping rhythm . Also in a minor key , it features synthesizers and percussion . In the song , Queen says that people listen to her because they like her . The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly , and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige ( both of whom Queen has said she would like to work with in the future ) . The song highlights her hip @-@ hop status . " De La Calle " ( From the Street ) is an R & B power ballad exploring the love between two people ( " love from the street " ) , with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes ' " Noche de <unk> ( Nuestro Amor ) " . 
 " Amor Puro " ( Pure Love ) is in a minor key with romantic lyrics , a string ensemble and techno synthesizers . Its lyrics focus on the meaning of true love . Queen sings : " Pure love does not fight , it does not hurt you , love that is pure does not cause you to fall " , and described the song as " an honest statement of what love is " . " I Do " is a minor @-@ key , mid @-@ tempo pop and R & B power ballad built on a <unk> rhythm and piano . Lyrically , the song is a message to men and women ; Queen sings : " My ladies , if you know better , if he loves you , let him come back . My fellas , if you love her , don 't let nothing hold you back , run out and look for her " . Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat . According to an editor for iTunes , the song " puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad , complete with English lyrics and Auto @-@ Tuned vocal . " The minor @-@ key " Acércate " ( Get Closer ) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers ; it has been described as " pure reggaeton " .

 The minor @-@ key " La Vida es Así " ( Life Is Like That ) features vocal effects and synthesizers . The urban version " attacks " with a modern and aggressive beat ; the bachata version is slower , with Luny Tunes ' tropical rhythms . In the lyrics , Ivy Queen declares to a rival : " The guy you 're dating is mine , and you know it , but here 's the detail : He 's worthless in bed . That 's why I 'm here to congratulate you for setting me free , I have to confess " . The reggaeton rhymes tell a story of revenge and lovesickness . Angie Romero of Latina Magazine describes the song as a " powerful and pulsating break @-@ up anthem . " 
 " Cuando " ( When ) , also in a minor key , is a pop R & B ballad featuring synthesizers and percussion with Caribbean roots and Afro @-@ Latin influences . It uses electric @-@ guitar riffs , an acoustic guitar , a string orchestra and a piano .

 Ivy Queen headlined the Machete Music Tour 2010 , which performed in cities such as New York and Los Angeles and featured " the hottest stars in reggaeton and Latin urban music " , including Chino & Nacho , Flex , Jowell & Randy , Tego Calderon , Don Omar , <unk> , Angel & Khriz , J @-@ King & <unk> and R.K.M & Ken @-@ Y. Ivy Queen would usually be the last to perform closing each show . Dressed in a pink miniskirt sporting blonde hair with white boots which reached past her knees , Queen 's setlist included . Songs she performed included " Que <unk> " , " Dime " , " La Vida Es Así " and " Cosa De La Vida " . Drama Queen was first promoted in the liner notes of Queen 's seventh studio album , Sentimiento ( 2007 ) , with a picture of Queen with hands bent upward and the words " Drama " and " Queen " on the right and left sides of her body ; underneath are the words " Coming Soon " in bold letters . In an effort by Universal Music Latin Entertainment to expand their promotional efforts on the social network MySpace , the album was offered exclusively in full , before its official release , garnering over 100 @,@ 000 streams . It was released on July 13 , 2010 ; on August 10 a deluxe edition was released , with three new tracks ( " Aya Aya " ; " Amor A Primera Vista " , featuring Jadiel and the hit " Dime " ) and a DVD with three music videos . " Dime " was originally included on her first live album , Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE ! ( 2008 ) , with a bachata version of the song . On the album 's cover Queen appears on a gargoyle dressed in black , representing a villain . On the inside of the album jacket she is seen with superpowers , dressed in bold colors ( such as yellow and pink ) and representing a superhero . The singer was inspired by action figures she use to collect and Wonder Woman , of whom she is a fan . Following the album 's release , she created the " Drama Line " , in which fans could call and leave messages and " publicly humiliate their former partner or anyone who has betrayed them in the past " .

 The lead single , " La Vida es Así " , was released on May 11 ; the music video ( directed by Marlon Pena ) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28 . Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful , since it reveals more feelings . The a cappella version of " La Vida es Así " was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production , allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred . The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre @-@ order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes . The second single , " Amor Puro " was released for Puerto Rican radio on September 24 . The music video ( also directed by Marlon Pena ) was shot on September 28 , and premiered on VEVO November 30 . The video was also filmed in Miami , at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux ( a historic building dating to 1133 in <unk> , Segovia , Spain , later reconstructed in Miami ) . " Acércate " was leaked online before the album was released , the first time Queen experienced copyright infringement in her 15 @-@ year career . Originally titled " No Te Equivoques " , it was re @-@ recorded in response to the copyright violation and retitled " Acércate " . She said , " Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well . I 'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song . We have good chemistry and friendship . We tried to change the song and lyrics , but with their agenda , which is tight , and mine too , we could not do it again . We have no idea who hacked , all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did " . The singer appeared on the television program “ Don Francisco Presenta ” , where she performed " La Vida es Así " . 
 " La Vida Es Así " has two versions : reggaeton and bachata . The reggaeton version became a hit on Latin radio , but the bachata alternative did not chart .

The album sold 6 @,@ 000 less copies than Sentimiento , and 2 @,@ 000 less than 2005 's Flashback , in its first week . It debuted ( and peaked ) at number 163 on the US Billboard 200 chart , number three on Top Latin Albums and number 18 on Rap Albums . 
 Drama Queen received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Urban Music Album at the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards ( which was won by Calle 13 for Entren Los Que Quieran ) . It earned Queen two nominations at the 2011 Latin Billboard Music Awards for Hot Latin Songs Artist of the Year , Female and Top Latin Albums Artist of the Year , Female ( both won by Shakira ) . 
 The album received generally positive reviews . David Jefferies of Allmusic gave the album a score of 3 @.@ 5 of 5 stars , commenting that the album keeps its sci @-@ fi elements on its cover artwork as Queen keeps her reggaeton strong by sticking with her original formula ; he later claimed it was a standard @-@ issue effort . Ayala Ben @-@ Yehuda of Billboard noted that the album features a set filled with a more @-@ honest longing than most of what is heard on commercial Latin radio . Frances Tirado of Primera Hora gave the album a positive review , stating that " Ivy Queen shows vocal maturity and evolution of rhythms " . Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody felt " each track could have been a single . " 
 Jefferies commented on the musical style as well : " The beats are familiar as reggaeton drum machines meet R & B keyboards and the Queen , commanding attention on every track with a stern yet sexy delivery . Bardeen said , " Her authoritative flow is matched only by the evolving landscape of beats that back her -- and Ivy , unlike some of her peers , has not been seduced by the European club scene " . Ben @-@ Yehuda also noted , " The set presents a more diverse range of musical styles , from bachata to R & B to even a poppy ballad ( " Cuando " ) " . The iTunes Notes for the album say , " True to its title , her seventh album is rich in melodrama , boasting grand synthesizer runs and heart @-@ wrenching themes of love and betrayal . That 's her strength . She 's her own yin and yang @-@ strong yet soft , swaggering yet tender . " The Editor Notes for the album claimed Drama Queen to be an " adventurous set " and " full of sonic surprises " .

 The evolutionary history of life on Earth traces the processes by which living and fossil organisms have evolved since life appeared on the planet , until the present day . Earth formed about 4 @.@ 5 Ga ( billion years ) ago and there is evidence that life appeared within 0 @.@ 5 billion years . The similarities between all present @-@ day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution . More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1 @.@ 2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . 
 = = Outline = = 
 The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be a biogenic substance in 3 @.@ 7 billion @-@ year @-@ old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3 @.@ 48 billion @-@ year @-@ old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . More recently , in 2015 , " remains of biotic life " were found in 4 @.@ 1 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , " If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . " 
 Microbial mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life in the early Archean and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place within them . The evolution of photosynthesis , around 3 @.@ 5 Ga , eventually led to a buildup of its waste product , oxygen , in the atmosphere , leading to the great oxygenation event , beginning around 2 @.@ 4 Ga . The earliest evidence of eukaryotes ( complex cells with organelles ) dates from 1 @.@ 85 Ga , and while they may have been present earlier , their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism . Later , around 1 @.@ 7 Ga , multicellular organisms began to appear , with differentiated cells performing specialised functions . Sexual reproduction , which involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells ( gametes ) to create a zygote in a process called fertilization is , in contrast to asexual reproduction , the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of macroscopic organisms , including almost all eukaryotes ( which includes animals and plants ) . However the origin and evolution of sexual reproduction remain a puzzle for biologists though it did evolve from a common ancestor that was a single celled eukaryotic species . Bilateria , animals with a front and a back , appeared by 555 Ma ( million years ago ) . 
 The earliest land plants date back to around 450 Ma , although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems , at least 2 @.@ 9 Ga . Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Phanerozoic . Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event . Ediacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period , while vertebrates , along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 Ma during the Cambrian explosion . During the Permian period , synapsids , including the ancestors of mammals , dominated the land , but most of this group became extinct in the Permian – Triassic extinction event 252 @.@ 17 Ma . During the recovery from this catastrophe , archosaurs became the most abundant land vertebrates ; one archosaur group , the dinosaurs , dominated the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . After the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event 66 Ma killed off the non @-@ avian dinosaurs , mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity . Such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify . 
 = = Earliest history of Earth = = 
 The oldest meteorite fragments found on Earth are about 4 @.@ 54 billion years old ; this , coupled primarily with the dating of ancient lead deposits , has put the estimated age of Earth at around that time . The Moon has the same composition as Earth 's crust but does not contain an iron @-@ rich core like the Earth 's . Many scientists think that about 40 million years later a body the size of Mars struck the Earth , throwing into orbit crust material that formed the Moon . Another hypothesis is that the Earth and Moon started to coalesce at the same time but the Earth , having much stronger gravity than the early Moon , attracted almost all the iron particles in the area . 
 Until 2001 , the oldest rocks found on Earth were about 3 @.@ 8 billion years old , leading scientists to estimate that the Earth 's surface had been molten until then . Accordingly , they named this part of Earth 's history the Hadean , whose name means " hellish . " However , analysis of zircons formed 4 @.@ 4 Ga indicates that Earth 's crust solidified about 100 million years after the planet 's formation and that the planet quickly acquired oceans and an atmosphere , which may have been capable of supporting life . 
 Evidence from the Moon indicates that from 4 to 3 @.@ 8 Ga it suffered a Late Heavy Bombardment by debris that was left over from the formation of the Solar System , and the Earth should have experienced an even heavier bombardment due to its stronger gravity . While there is no direct evidence of conditions on Earth 4 to 3 @.@ 8 Ga , there is no reason to think that the Earth was not also affected by this late heavy bombardment . This event may well have stripped away any previous atmosphere and oceans ; in this case gases and water from comet impacts may have contributed to their replacement , although volcanic outgassing on Earth would have supplied at least half . However , if subsurface microbial life had evolved by this point , it would have survived the bombardment . 
 = = Earliest evidence for life on Earth = = 
 The earliest identified organisms were minute and relatively featureless , and their fossils look like small rods , which are very difficult to tell apart from structures that arise through abiotic physical processes . The oldest undisputed evidence of life on Earth , interpreted as fossilized bacteria , dates to 3 Ga . Other finds in rocks dated to about 3 @.@ 5 Ga have been interpreted as bacteria , with geochemical evidence also seeming to show the presence of life 3 @.@ 8 Ga . However , these analyses were closely scrutinized , and non @-@ biological processes were found which could produce all of the " signatures of life " that had been reported . While this does not prove that the structures found had a non @-@ biological origin , they cannot be taken as clear evidence for the presence of life . Geochemical signatures from rocks deposited 3 @.@ 4 Ga have been interpreted as evidence for life , although these statements have not been thoroughly examined by critics . 
 = = Origins of life on Earth = = 
 Biologists reason that all living organisms on Earth must share a single last universal ancestor , because it would be virtually impossible that two or more separate lineages could have independently developed the many complex biochemical mechanisms common to all living organisms . As previously mentioned the earliest organisms for which fossil evidence is available are bacteria . The lack of fossil or geochemical evidence for earlier organisms has left plenty of scope for hypotheses , which fall into two main groups : 1 ) that life arose spontaneously on Earth or 2 ) that it was " seeded " from elsewhere in the Universe . 
 = = = Life " seeded " from elsewhere = = = 
 Panspermia does not explain how life arose in the first place , but simply examines the possibility of it coming from somewhere other than the Earth . The idea that life on Earth was " seeded " from elsewhere in the Universe dates back at least to the Greek philosopher Anaximander in the sixth century BCE . In the twentieth century it was proposed by the physical chemist Svante Arrhenius , by the astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe , and by molecular biologist Francis Crick and chemist Leslie Orgel . 
 There are three main versions of the " seeded from elsewhere " hypothesis : from elsewhere in our Solar System via fragments knocked into space by a large meteor impact , in which case the most credible sources are Mars and Venus ; by alien visitors , possibly as a result of accidental contamination by microorganisms that they brought with them ; and from outside the Solar System but by natural means . 
 Experiments in low Earth orbit , such as <unk> , demonstrated that some microorganism spores can survive the shock of being catapulted into space and some can survive exposure to outer space radiation for at least 5 @.@ 7 years . Scientists are divided over the likelihood of life arising independently on Mars , or on other planets in our galaxy .
