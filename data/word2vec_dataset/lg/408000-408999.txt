 The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway ( <unk> ) , given the epithet , the " Toy Train " , is a 610 mm ( 2 ft ) narrow – gauge railway that runs for 88 kilometers ( 55 mi ) from Siliguri to Darjeeling in the Indian state of West Bengal , operated by the Indian Railways . Highly regarded in India to this day , the railway line was built by the British Government . Darjeeling was a major summer hill station and the centre of a flourishing tea @-@ growing district . The elevation level along this line starting with about 100 meters ( 330 ft ) at Siliguri rose to about 2 @,@ 200 meters ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) at Darjeeling but attained highest elevation at <unk> station of 2 @,@ 300 meters ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . 
 The Siliguri town was connected with Calcutta ( now called Kolkata ) in 1878 while an alternative journey to Darjeeling used to be performed by <unk> ( horse @-@ driven carts ) along a dust track . On the recommendations of a Committee appointed by Sir Ashley Eden , the then Lt. Governor of the Government of West Bengal , and the request of Franklyn <unk> , the Agent of the Eastern Bengal Railway Company , work on the railway commenced in 1879 and was completed by July 1881 . The railway line underwent several improvements over the years to ease the gradient of the line for convenience of manoeuvrability . By 1909 – 1910 , Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying 174 @,@ 000 passengers and 47 @,@ 000 <unk> of goods annually . 
 Important features incorporated in the line consisted of four loops ( spirals ) and four ‘ Z ’ reverses ( zigzags ) . The introduction of the first bogie carriages service replaced the very basic four wheel carriages and extensive improvements were made to the track and stations after the earthquake of 1897 and underwent further modernization under the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone of Indian Railway . It is still powered by a steam engine , although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train . 
 In 1999 , this mountain line in India was the first to be recognized by the UNESCO and inscribed on the World Heritage List . An assurance recorded was that apart that from creating a buffer zone under the declared heritage site , the steam trains would be retained within the site . 
 Another feature along this line is the pithy <unk> located at key vantage points along the route which proclaim to the passengers travelling by the train , and creates excitement to explore the locations , such as the ‘ Agony Point ’ , the ' Sensation Corner ' and so forth . The loop points or spirals constructed on precipitous hills are also view points , which provide spectacular views of the valley down below . 
 = = Nilgiri Mountain Railway = = 
 The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a single track , 46 kilometers ( 29 mi ) long metre gauge single line . <unk> was initially the final hill station on the line in June 1899 but this was extended up to Fernhill in September 1908 and up to <unk> by October 15 , 1908 . It now connects the town of Mettupalayam with the hill station of <unk> ( Ootacamund ) , in the Nilgiri hills , popularly known as the ' Blue Mountains ' of Southern India . Both towns are in the state of Tamil Nadu . The only rack railway in India , it uses the alternate biting system ( Abt ) commonly termed as ' rack and pinion ' rail system and is operated with special steam locomotives . This system is described in Sir <unk> L. Molesworth ’ s report of 1886 , which says : 
 Two distinct functions – 1st that of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco ; 2nd that of traction by pinions acting on the track bars . The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes , acting by friction ; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding the progress of the engine . The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients . One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle , but can be used in those places where the rack is laid . 
 The trains that run on this line cover a distance of 46 kilometers ( 29 mi ) , travel through 208 curves , 16 tunnels , and 250 bridges . The uphill journey takes around 290 minutes ( 4 @.@ 8 hours ) , and the downhill journey takes 215 minutes ( 3 @.@ 6 hours ) . 
 The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was inscribed as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2005 . The unique feature of this line , which is still fully operational , is its oldest and the steepest ‘ rack and pinion technology ’ . As it now operates , the line has a metre gauge section for 7 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 5 mi ) up to the foothill station of <unk> from where the rack rail system begins and runs hugging the hills , passing through tunnels , 12 in number with the longest tunnel measuring 97 meters ( 318 ft ) , for 7 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 5 mi ) up the hills at a gradient of 1 : 12 @.@ 5 up to <unk> locomotives are used in this section . Beyond <unk> , up to the last station at Ooty or <unk> , the track has a ruling gradient of 1 : 23 . 
 = = Kalka – Shimla Railway = = 
 Shimla , the modern capital city of Himachal Pradesh , is located at 7 @,@ 234 feet ( 2 @,@ 205 m ) , in the foothills of the Himalayas . It was the summer capital of British India in 1864 and it was also the headquarters of the British Army in India . Kalka is a town in the Panchkula district of Haryana . 
 Prior to construction of the railway communication , connection with the outside world was via a village <unk> . The railway line was constructed by the Delhi – Ambala – Kalka Railway Company commencing in 1898 in the Siwalik Hills ranges . However , several plans with alternative routes were surveyed between 1884 and 1898 , and the contract to build this line was finally awarded to Delhi – Ambala – Kalka Railway Company . The 95 @.@ 66 kilometers ( 59 @.@ 44 mi ) long , 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) narrow gauge line was opened for traffic on November 9 , 1903 . 
 The line has 103 tunnels and 864 bridges ( multi @-@ arched gallery type , like the Roman aqueducts ) , except for one bridge of 18 @.@ 29 meters ( 60 @.@ 0 ft ) length with plate girder span and steel truss . The ruling gradient is 1 : 33 or 3 % , with 919 curves , the sharpest being 48 degrees ( a radius of 37 @.@ 47 meters ( 122 @.@ 9 ft ) and climbs from 656 meters ( 2 @,@ 152 ft ) and terminates at an elevation of 2 @,@ 076 meters ( 6 @,@ 811 ft ) at Shimla . The <unk> Tunnel ( No. 33 ) is the longest tunnel on the line at 1 @,@ 144 meters ( 3 @,@ 753 ft ) in length between <unk> and <unk> ( 270 meters ( 890 ft ) below the road ) and is named after the engineer who had commenced digging the tunnel from both sides of the mountain but could not complete it and hence committed suicide ( he was buried near the site of the tunnel ) . His Indian counterpart , known by the name <unk> , who helped H. S. Harrington to build another tunnel about 1 kilometer ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) away from the abandoned tunnel , was honoured with a medal and turban as an appreciation for his contribution to building tunnels , by the then Viceroy of India . 
 The route from Kalka to Shimla involves journey through the Koti tunnel 3 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) long , the <unk> main station , 32 kilometers ( 20 mi ) from Kalka , three loops at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to attain flatter gradients , <unk> , Prospect Hill to <unk> , <unk> to the terminus at old <unk> chambers at Shimla . Other important stations on this route , distance wise from Kalka include <unk> – 38 @.@ 4 kilometers ( 23 @.@ 9 mi ) , at an elevation of 1 @,@ 600 meters ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) – and <unk> . Special luxury trains called the Shivalik Express and Shivalik Palace Saloon operate during the summer months to cater for heavy traffic from tourism , apart from several passenger and cargo ( potato , in particular ) trains , in addition to catering to the requirements of the armed services . 
 This line was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 2008 , joining the Nilgiri and Darjeeling lines . 
 = = Matheran Hill Railway = = 
 Matheran Hill Railway , a heritage railway in Maharashtra , was built between 1901 and 1907 by Abdul Hussein Adamjee <unk> and was financed by his father , Sir Adamjee <unk> of the Adamjee Group . The railway line , a <unk> ( 2 ft ) gauge line , covers a distance of 20 kilometers ( 12 mi ) , over large swathes of forest territory connecting Neral to Matheran in the Western Ghats hills near <unk> and Mumbai . The plan , formulated in 1900 , began construction in 1904 and the line was opened to traffic by 1907 . Originally , the tracks were laid with 30 lb / yard rails but now use heavier 42 lb / yard rails . Ruling gradient is 1 : 20 ( 5 % ) with tight curves and speeds are limited to 20 kilometres per hour ( 12 mph ) . The line , which generally used to be closed during the monsoons because of the danger of landslides , has , since the 1980s , been kept operational throughout the year . This railway line is administered by the Central Railways . 
 The unique feature of this line is the horseshoe embankment , which was built to avoid a reversion station , seen when the train curves markedly . Important stations and special features include this , the initial Neral Station , the <unk> Hill section , the <unk> <unk> steep gradient , the only tunnel on the route , popularly known as the " One Kiss Tunnel " ( time to pass through this is just sufficient to exchange a kiss with one 's partner ) , a " Water Pipe " station ( no longer in use due to change over to diesel locos ) , Mountain Berry with two sharp ' Zig <unk> ' , Panorama Point and finally terminating at Matheran Bazaar . The Broad gauge line between Mumbai and Pune runs close to this line and the road also crosses the railway line at two locations . 
 = = Kangra Valley Railway = = 
 The Kangra Valley Railway lies in the sub @-@ Himalayan region and covers a distance of 163 kilometers ( 101 mi ) between Pathankot and Joginder Nagar , a valley known for its natural beauty and ancient Hindu shrines . The line , which is part of the Northern Railway and is made with a 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) gauge , was planned in May 1926 and commissioned in 1929 and is popularly known as the “ Kangra Toy Train ” . The highest point on this line is at <unk> station at an elevation of 1 @,@ 291 meters ( 4 @,@ 236 ft ) and the terminus at Joginder Nagar is at 1 @,@ 189 meters ( 3 @,@ 901 ft ) . The line has 971 uniquely designed bridges and two tunnels . Two particularly important bridge structures are the steel arch bridge over the <unk> <unk> and the girder bridge over the Banganga River . Though the gradient of the line is generally gentle , the critical reach with steep slopes is at the 142 kilometers ( 88 mi ) stretch , which is of 210 meters ( 690 ft ) width with 1 : 19 slope with approach slopes of 1 : 31 and 1 : 25 . The terminus stretch between Baijnath and <unk> is 1 : 25 . The train journey on this line provides beautiful views of peaks of the <unk> mountain range , particularly in the stretch between Kangra and <unk> , and also the ruins of the Kangra Fort .

 The Northeast Frontier Railway plans to preserve the 120 km @-@ long <unk> – <unk> hill section while the metre @-@ gauge track on the Lumding – Silchar line gets converted into broad gauge . It has 37 tunnels , 586 bridges and 24 stations on the way with the steepest gradient of 1 in 37 on the <unk> – <unk> section . 
 = = Kashmir Railway = = 
 The Kashmir Railway is a railway line being built in India to connect the state of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country . Officially termed the ' Jammu <unk> Srinagar Baramulla Railway Link ' ( <unk> ) , the railway starts from Jammu and , when completed , will travel for 345 kilometres ( 214 mi ) to the city of Baramulla on the northwestern edge of the Kashmir Valley . The route crosses major earthquake zones , and is subjected to extreme temperatures of cold and heat , as well as inhospitable terrain , making it an extremely challenging engineering project . The project has had a long and chequered history but serious progress was made only after it was declared a National Project in 2002 . The scheduled date of completion was August 15 , 2007 . However , several unforeseen complications have pushed back the final completion deadline to 2017 at the earliest so a through service from central India to Kashmir will not be possible till then .

 = School Reunion ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " School Reunion " is the third episode in the second series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who . It first aired on 29 April 2006 . The episode 's narrative takes place some time after the events of " The Christmas Invasion " . In the episode 's <unk> , Mickey Smith alerts the Doctor and Rose Tyler to a comprehensive school where strange things are happening , such as UFO sightings . At the school , the Doctor encounters his former companion Sarah Jane Smith and the robotic dog , K9 Mark III , he sent her , who likewise were interested by the current events . Together , they discover the force behind the events , a race known as the Krillitanes , and work to prevent them gaining control of the universe . 
 The use of the Doctor 's previous companions , in particular Sarah Jane and K9 , was first proposed in 2003 to the BBC . After the episode was produced , Elisabeth Sladen was approached by the BBC to star in a spin @-@ off , The Sarah Jane Adventures , which also included K9 in several stories . The episode was positively reviewed , with an Appreciation Index of 85 % ( " Excellent " ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mr. Finch , the headmaster of <unk> Vale School , has been changing the school to improve the students ' performance ; his changes include free lunches with special chips . The Doctor , under the alias " John Smith " , is undercover as a science teacher in the school , and his companion , Rose Tyler , is working undercover in the school 's cafeteria . The Doctor is surprised by the good behavior of the students and intrigued by the uncommon intelligence of one of his physics students . Both the Doctor and Rose relate the mysterious events around the school to the chips : Rose observes that the chip oil has an adverse effect on the other kitchen staff , who must use hazmat suits to handle the oil , while the Doctor notes that the chips themselves are making children more intelligent . 
 Mr. Finch 's successes have aroused media attention — in particular , the attention of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith . While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance ( but is barely able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again ) , when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night , he reveals his identity to her . Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey , with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women . As the group searches the school , they find thirteen bat @-@ like creatures asleep in Finch 's office . Returning to Sarah Jane 's car , the journalist reveals a battered , inactive K9 Mark III , who — once repaired — identifies the chip oil as <unk> oil . Rose , unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions , confronts him ; he replies sadly that , while she can spend the rest of her life with him , he cannot spend the rest of his life with her , so he must remain aloof . 
 The following day , the group returns to the school to investigate further . The Doctor confronts Mr. Finch , who confirms that he and the others are Krillitanes — a composite species that takes desirable attributes of the species they conquer . He attempts to subvert the Doctor , without success . Meanwhile , Sarah Jane and Rose , now getting on better than at their first meeting , try to unlock the programming on the school 's computers ; Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane 's car for surveillance . With the Doctor 's help , they discover that the computers — bolstered by the students ' enhanced intelligence — are part of a <unk> effort to solve the " <unk> Paradigm " , a theory of everything . As the paradigm is nearly solved , which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space , they seal the school . Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time , tempting him with the ability to save the Time Lords and override human mortality . With Sarah Jane 's counseling , the Doctor refuses , and they run from Mr. Finch . After Kenny ( a student who had not eaten the chips ) alerts Mickey to the students ' plight , Mickey crashes Sarah Jane 's car through the school 's doors and unplugs the computers , allowing the children to flee . The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen . Upon their arrival , K9 detonates the chip oil container , saturating the Krillitanes . The Krillitanes suddenly explode , destroying the school and K9 . 
 At episode 's end , Rose , Sarah Jane , Mickey , and the Doctor are standing in the TARDIS . Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS , having finally decided to move on with her life and stop waiting for the Doctor . Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew , a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves . She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor , and to find her one @-@ day if she needs to . Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor , who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 " School Reunion " is the first appearance of Sarah Jane Smith and K9 since The Five Doctors . It answers the question of where Sarah was left at the end of The Hand of Fear : Aberdeen . Rose mentions visiting " the year 5 billion " , a reference to her first trip with the Ninth Doctor in The End of the World . The bragging match between Sarah and Rose also references other stories : Sarah has met the Daleks , " lots of robots " , anti @-@ matter monsters , mummies , dinosaurs , and the Loch Ness Monster , whereas Rose has met ghosts , " Slitheen in Downing Street " , the Dalek Emperor , gas @-@ masked zombies , and a werewolf . 
 = = Production = = 
 The concept of Sarah @-@ Jane and K9 returning to Doctor Who was an idea of Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003 . Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor , without dwelling too much on the classic series . It was Davies ' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this , and while Sladen originally declined a request , thinking her role would not be important , she changed her mind when she realised she would be the focal point of the adventure . After production of the episode was finished , Sladen was approached about a full spin @-@ off series , The Sarah Jane Adventures , which was formally announced on 14 September 2006 . 
 The episode went through several changes in production : working titles included " Old Friends " and " Black Ops " , the latter being set in an army base . Davies requested that Whithouse set it in a school instead , mainly for simplicity , but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher . Additionally , the Krillitanes were to be named " <unk> " until the BBC found the name was trademarked , and Finch 's forename was originally Hector , until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name , and renamed him Lucas . K9 's eye grill was initially filmed flashing in sync with his lines , not unlike the Daleks , until Phil Collinson saw the footage and nixed the practice ( which was inconsistent with the robot dog 's past appearances ) . A scene that was cut was of Milo 's brain being " shorted out " by the Doctor 's rapid @-@ fire questions at the beginning of the episode , which was later alluded to in the episode . 
 The episode , originally in the second production block , was produced in the first block along with " The Christmas Invasion " and " New Earth " . Two high schools in Wales were used for filming : Fitzalan High School in Leckwith was used on 23 August and 24 August 2005 , for filming the first conversation between the Doctor and Finch , and for the playground , kitchen , and cafeteria scenes , and Duffryn High School in Newport , which was used between 25 August and 6 September for the remainder of the episode , with filming delayed due to asbestos being discovered in Duffryn High School 's structure . The scenes in the schools utilised dozens of children as extras . Pick @-@ up shots were later completed on 7 September and 8 September , with filming of the cafe scene delayed due to drunk and disorderly conduct from members of the public .

 The episode was watched by 8 @.@ 3 million viewers , the twelfth most @-@ watched programme of the week , with an Appreciation Index score of 85 % . Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A + rating , and jokingly stated that he " didn 't know why the Doctor was fucking around [ during the Physics lesson ] : he taught Physics at Coal Hill School way back in ' 63 " . Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8 @.@ 7 out of 10 ( " Great " ) and commented that the episode had " fantastic character moments " and " brilliant CGI effects " , and that " if you 're willing to accept the Scooby @-@ Doo storyline , then the strong nostalgic vibes present in this episode should be enough to carry this episode into a must @-@ see category .

 Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track ( Norwegian : Lillehammer Olympiske <unk> og <unk> ) is a bobsleigh , luge and skeleton track located at Hunderfossen in Lillehammer , Norway , 15 kilometers ( 9 mi ) north of the town center of Lillehammer . It was completed in 1992 for the 1994 Winter Olympics , where it hosted the bobsleigh events and luge events . It has since also hosted the FIBT World Championships 1995 in skeleton and the FIL World Luge Championships 1995 , and is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics . 
 Original plans called for the track to be located at Fåberg . Later it was proposed moved to Kanthaugen in the town center and then Holmenkollen in Oslo , before Hunderfossen was decided upon . The track is 1 @,@ 710 meters ( 5 @,@ 610 ft ) , giving a competition length of 1 @,@ 365 meters ( 4 @,@ 478 ft ) for bobsleigh and men 's singles luge , and 1 @,@ 185 meters ( 3 @,@ 888 ft ) for other luge competitions . The bobsleigh course has a vertical drop of 114 meters ( 374 ft ) , giving an 8 @.@ 5 percent average grade . The track has been part of the proposed Oslo 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics bids . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the Lillehammer Olympics , there was no bobsleigh and luge track in Norway . During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo , Korketrekkeren had been built as a temporary venue , but it was made of snow and was not reused after the Olympics . In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics , Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg . By May 1989 , plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta . The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK 231 million . 
 Lillehammer Municipal Council , Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage rejected the location because of the environmental impact . These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at <unk> at Hunderfossen . The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking at the possibility of constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo . Two routes were considered , one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from <unk> at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen . Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway 's track in the capital . Concerns about the environmental impact of a Hunderfossen location were raised , particularly regarding visual pollution . However , Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990 . 
 The designers of the tracks at Altenberg and Oberhof , East Germany , the Olympic tracks in La Plagne , France , and Calgary , Canada , were consulted during planning . Five companies bid for the concrete construction work , which was awarded to a joint venture between Aker Entreprenør and Veidekke for NOK 45 million . Also the construction of the buildings was awarded to the same group . The track was the first of the Olympic venues for the 1994 games for which construction started . After construction started , Minister of Culture Åse Kleveland ( Labour Party ) suggested in March 1991 , in an attempt to reduce costs , that the 1994 Olympic bobsleigh and luge events be held at La Plagne , the site of the events for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville . The French authorities were positive , given that Norway pay for part of the construction costs , but the idea was rejected by LOOC @-@ president Gerhard Heiberg .

 Construction was undertaken by spraying 1 @,@ 300 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 300 long tons ; 1 @,@ 400 short tons ) of <unk> intertwined with 180 tonnes ( 180 long tons ; 200 short tons ) of reinforcement bars . It is the first track in the world to build the cooling pipes into an underground culvert . It consists of 31 reinforced concrete sections . The concrete work was completed on 31 October 1991 . Representatives for the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature stated that they were satisfied with the end result . It is the only artificially frozen bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic Countries . The venue was completed on 1 October 1992 and cost NOK 201 million . After the Olympics , the ownership of the venue was transferred to Lillehammer Olympiapark , owned by Lillehammer Municipality .

 = The Empathic Civilization = 
 The Empathic Civilization : The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non @-@ fiction book written by Jeremy Rifkin . It connects the evolution of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans . Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes — that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction — as bringing people together on the nation @-@ state level based on democratic capitalism , but at the same time creating global problems , like climate change , pandemics , and nuclear proliferation . Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future , predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small @-@ scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems . 
 The book was published by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. as a hardcover in January 2010 . It was noted as being well @-@ researched and covering a significant breadth of academic fields . However , reviews were mixed ; several reviewers found that while Rifkin provided a convincing overview of the development of empathy , he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co @-@ operatively solve global problems . 
 = = Background = = 
 Author Jeremy Rifkin had previously written several books that , like The Empathic Civilization , have attempted to extrapolate trends in the economy , technology , and society . For example , his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele @-@ commuting would have on the workplace , his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering , and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium . His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream , published in 2004 , comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post @-@ industrial economy . At the time of publication , the 64 @-@ year @-@ old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy , climate change , and energy security , as well as president of the American non @-@ profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends . Rifkin argues that the global crisis of 2008 and 2011 marks the end of a particular energy regime – fossil fuels . The new global economy will be based upon renewable energy , like wind power , solar energy , natural gas , etc . He calls this distributed capitalism because these energy sources are dispersed rather than centralized . They are best controlled by individuals or small communities . This will entail a very different power structure from fossil fuel , financial capitalism . This new structure is networked and decentralized , and an inherently much more democratic form of globalization . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The Empathic Civilization is divided into three parts with an introductory chapter that summarizes the contents and arguments of the book . The first part consists of four chapters and analyses empathy from the perspective of psychology , biology , and philosophy . Rifkin provides a history of empathy in psychology , including how it relates to the works of Freudian psychology , Melanie Klein , Ronald Fairbairn , Heinz Kohut , and Donald <unk> , leading to John Bowlby and Attachment Theory . As psychological theory has evolved , empathy has played a larger and larger role , especially in the emotional and intellectual development of children . In terms of biology , Rifkin connects the biological function of mirror neurons with the capacity for empathy . Philosophically , Rifkin explores empathy @-@ altruism , the faith versus reason debate , and truth versus reality debate . Rifkin argues in favour of <unk> , that the meaning of existence is to enter into relationships . From the lens of empathy , he deconstructs the concepts of truth , freedom , democracy , equality , mortality . 
 The second part consists of five chapters and focuses on the rise , development , and fall of civilizations . Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality . Hunter @-@ gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically @-@ limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically in terms of that group . <unk> , these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales . The development of writing , as well as hydraulics and irrigation , allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled . Hydraulic power was labour @-@ intensive , requiring large populations of subservient people . With scripts , there was a shift from a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness ; individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small , local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god . 
 Decentralization followed the collapse of the Roman Empire , as each town operated a water or wind mill and the printing press distributed literature , empowering more people . Autobiographies started to be written , more people married for love rather than other arrangements , and the concept of privacy , democracy , and market capitalism was more prevalent . People began to organize themselves more into nation @-@ states . Steam and fossil fuels became the dominant energy regime and electronic communications , like telegraphs , radios , telephones , and television , became the dominant means of communication . With vastly more interaction with other people and cultures , there was more emphasis on studying people and psychology . Personal investments , social exploration , and creativity became highly valued . 
 The third part consists of the remaining five chapters . Rifkin extrapolates the changes in energy regimes to predict a shift in production towards renewable sources like wind and solar power under distributed ( i.e. personal ) management . Rifkin also extrapolates the changes in communication to predict a proliferation of wireless , mobile personal communication that allows people to be constantly connected to others regardless of distance , language , or other barriers . This will evolve people 's sense of empathy to create a biosphere @-@ wide consciousness and a mode of production he calls distributed capitalism . Rifkin believes this new system will allow people to solve more complex issues , such as climate change and pathogenic pandemics , focus more on quality of life ( rather than materialistic ) issues , and value collaboration over competition . 
 = = Style and genre = = 
 The book was noted for its heft , in terms of its actual page numbers , exhaustive research , and dense academic language . The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language . Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts , theology , philosophy , anthropology , sociology , political science , psychology , and communication theory . The book was described as sociobiology . The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen <unk> , as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress . 
 John N. Gray 's review in The Guardian described the theme of Rifkin 's argument as " a struggle between the polar forces of empathy and entropy " and that " as civilisation has extended the reach of empathy beyond the family and the tribe ... the expanding infrastructure of industry and transport has needed ever larger inputs of energy , increasing entropy and wrecking the planet " .

 The Empathic Civilization was published in January 2010 by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc . , an imprint of Penguin Group ( USA ) , in North America and by Cambridge Polity Press in the United Kingdom . Cambridge Polity Press also published the book in Australia and New Zealand beginning in March 2010 . A German translation was published by Campus Verlag and Spanish language version was released by Mexican publisher <unk> <unk> . Excerpts were published in the Huffington Post and Arianna Huffington named it one of the best books of the year . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The book received mixed reviews by critics . Philosopher John N. Gray 's review in The Guardian found that Rifkin spent most of the book defending his " view that humans are essentially empathic animals " and ultimately " fails to substantiate its central thesis " that empathy in humans will make them able to deal with a world @-@ wide crisis , like global warming . In The Globe and Mail , the reviewer expressed a similar view that Rifkin " doesn 't explain how ... empathy can vanquish a physical principle , entropy " . 
 The reviewer in the Edmonton Journal admitted the book is well @-@ researched and presents " an immense amount of engaging evidence " on empathy , but ultimately dismisses it as " a shallow intellectual hit " due to its " simple thesis , souped up unnecessarily " and " impression of having been written in a hurry , with a marketing rep scribbling catchphrases over Rifkin 's shoulder " . Along with the Edmonton Journal review , numerous others noted either the book 's <unk> interpretation of history or selective historiography . 
 Michael <unk> , reviewing for the Winnipeg Free Press , labelled the book " ambitious " , " deserving of a wide audience " and " at times fascinating but ultimately underwhelming " . Dudley found the book " covers so many topics that few of them are given the depth they deserve " and that " despite the book 's considerable length , it is also surprisingly limited in scope " . For example , Dudley was disappointed with the few references made to Marshall McLuhan and the lack of reference to the works of Julian Jaynes . Likewise , the reviewer in Journal of <unk> was disappointed with the one reference to Lloyd <unk> who the reviewer believed would have helped Rifkin 's case . The book was reviewed in the journal Integral Leadership Review from a spiral dynamics point @-@ of @-@ view , noting that it speaks more towards people at green and turquoise . 
 = Washington State Route 31 = 
 State Route 31 ( SR 31 ) is a Washington state highway located entirely in Pend Oreille County . The highway , which is 26 @.@ 79 miles ( 43 @.@ 11 km ) long , starts at an intersection with SR 20 in Tiger and travels north to the Canada – US border north of Metaline Falls . At the border , SR 31 becomes British Columbia Highway 6 ( BC 6 ) . The route parallels the Pend Oreille River for most of its route and the primary functions of the highway is to serve and connect Tiger , Ione , Metaline and Metaline Falls with British Columbia . 
 Before 1964 , the route from Newport to BC 6 was the northernmost section of Primary State Highway 6 , which ran from Spokane to BC 6 . Originally created in 1964 , SR 31 extended southeast to an intersection with U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 , formerly US 195 ) in Newport . The North Cascades Highway ( SR 20 ) was extended to Newport in 1973 and SR 31 from Newport to Tiger became SR 20 . SR 31 had one auxiliary route , SR 311 , which became SR 211 after SR 20 was extended .

 State Route 31 ( SR 31 ) is 26 @.@ 79 miles ( 43 @.@ 114 km ) long within Pend Oreille County , Washington from SR 20 in Tiger north to British Columbia Highway 6 ( BC 6 ) at the Canadian border , located north of Metaline Falls . The highway parallels the Pend Oreille River for most of its route and connects Tiger , Ione , Metaline and Metaline Falls with British Columbia . The route also parallels the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad from Tiger to Metaline Falls ; the railroad extends south to Newport along SR 20 and east to Dover , Idaho . 
 SR 31 starts at an intersection with SR 20 and Tiger East Road in the small community of Tiger . The road turns northwest after the intersection and then curves north after intersecting Vogel Road . After crossing the railroad , the highway forms the eastern boundary of Ione Municipal Airport and later passes Sullivan Lake Road . At the Sullivan Lake Road junction , SR 31 is named McKay Road and crosses the Ione <unk> to enter the city of Ione . There , the route is renamed Second Street and leaves the city to parallel the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad and the shoreline of the Pend Oreille River . The name of the road changes to Lehigh Avenue , a name that stays with SR 31 until the Canadian border . The railroad crosses the road and later bridges the Pend Oreille River , as the highway turns northwest and reverts northeast . The route reaches Metaline and curves southeast to cross the Pend Oreille River on the Pend Oreille Bridge into Metaline Falls . After turning south and back north , the highway starts to curve multiple times until intersecting Sullivan Lake Road and being directed northeast . The road turns north and crosses two streams before curving northwest and then northeast to Lake <unk> . After passing Lake <unk> , SR 31 passes Crescent Lake and Boundary Lake before ending at the Canadian border . SR 31 's northern end at the Canadian border is the easternmost crossing in Washington and is located east of Crawford State Park .

 In 1923 , a system of roads to connect cities throughout Washington was established . One of the roads , State Road 6 , followed a route from Spokane to the Canadian border . The road was named the Pend O <unk> Highway , a name that would identify the route until 1964 . The state road system was later expanded into a new system in 1937 . 
 During the creation of the Primary and Secondary Highways in 1937 , the road that was State Road 6 became Primary State Highway 6 ( PSH 6 ) . PSH 6 ran from U.S. Route 10 ( US 10 ) and US 195 ( future US 2 ) , north to the Canadian border ; the route was co @-@ signed as US 195 from Spokane to Newport . US 2 was signed over PSH 6 from Spokane to Newport in 1948 and the route became SR 31 from Newport to the Canadian border during the 1964 highway renumbering . During the renumbering , WSDOT replaced the previous system of Primary and Secondary Highways with a new system called State Routes , which is still in use today .

 SR 31 's previous route ran a total of 73 @.@ 31 miles ( 117 @.@ 98 km ) from Newport northwest to Tiger and north to the Canadian border at BC 6 . The route started in Newport at the intersection of W. Walnut Street ( SR 31 northbound and US 2 eastbound ) and N. Union Avenue ( US 2 westbound ) . Next , the highway went northwest and left Newport to parallel the Pend Oreille River for the rest of its route . The road would also join the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad north to the current southern terminus . SR 31 turned west and passed Lake Newport State Park , located on the shores of the river , before curving northwest and entering the community of <unk> . From <unk> , the road goes north to pass SR 311 's northern terminus in Usk and pass the towns of Cusick , Locke and Jared . The highway turned east at Jared and back northwest at Ruby . After Blue Slide and Lost Creek , SR 31 would continue north out of Tiger , which was the eastern terminus of SR 294 . SR 31 from Newport to Tiger later became SR 20 after it was extended on SR 294 and SR 31 in 1973 . 
 = = = = SR 311 ( 1964 – 1973 ) = = = = 
 From 1964 until 1973 , SR 31 had an auxiliary route called State Route 311 . The highway ran from US 2 west of Newport , north 15 @.@ 24 miles ( 24 @.@ 53 km ) to SR 31 in Usk . The road was entirely located within Pend Oreille County ; the southern terminus was located east of Pend Oreille State Park on US 2 and west of Diamond Lake and the community of the same name . SR 311 advanced north past <unk> Lake and Davis Lake to the northern terminus , which was 2 @.@ 39 miles ( 3 @.@ 85 km ) south of Cusick . SR 311 was established as SSH 6B in 1937 during the creation of the primary and secondary highway system . In the 1964 renumbering , SR 311 was created over SSH 6B . When SR 20 was extended over SR 294 and SR 31 , SR 311 became SR 211 , which it is still currently designated as .

 = Puerto Rico at the 2008 Summer Olympics = 
 Puerto Rico competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics which was held in Beijing , People 's Republic of China from August 8 to August 24 , 2008 . The American territory with a population of four million people qualified 22 athletes in eight different sports . The appearance of the Puerto Rican delegation at the Beijing Olympics marked the commonwealth 's sixteenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics , and its twenty @-@ second appearance at any Olympic games , since its debut at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London , England . Of its competitors participating in events that involve progression by heats , six athletes advanced at least one round in their events , and two advanced at least two rounds , with Asunción Ocasio almost medaling bronze in taekwondo . However , there were no Puerto Rican medalists at the Beijing Olympics . McWilliams Arroyo , a boxer , bore Puerto Rico 's flag at the ceremonies . 
 = = Background = = 
 Puerto Rico is a large island on the northern rim of the Caribbean Sea that is home to approximately 4 million people . It lies due east of the Dominican Republic and to the west of the United States Virgin Islands . Puerto Rico was first colonized by the Spanish , but was ceded to the United States in the wake of the Spanish – American War in 1898 . Puerto Ricans were granted American citizenship in 1917 , although it remained apart from the United States and has a constitution that provides for self @-@ government . 41 years after Puerto Ricans became American citizens , Puerto Rico sent its first delegation to the Olympics at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London , England . The American commonwealth has sent a delegation to all sixteen Summer Olympics between then and the 2008 Beijing Olympics in addition to six Winter Olympic games . 
 Between its 1948 debut and its arrival at the Beijing Olympics , Puerto Rican athletes had won six medals ( one silver and five bronze ) . The last medal earned by a Puerto Rican was a bronze medal by Daniel Santos at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . No medals were won by Puerto Ricans at Beijing . During the course of the 2008 Olympics , 22 athletes represented Puerto Rico — 17 men and five women — in eight sports ( track and field , boxing , artistic gymnastics , judo , shooting , swimming , taekwondo , and weightlifting ) . The size of the delegation was 21 athletes smaller than the Puerto Rican delegation that arrived at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , and 58 athletes smaller than Puerto Rico 's largest Olympic team , which included 80 athletes participating in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal , Canada . The oldest member of the Beijing delegation was Lucas Bennazar , a sharpshooter , who was 39 years old at the time ; boxer Jonathan González , in contrast , was the youngest at 19 years old . Boxer McWilliams Arroyo was the nation 's flag bearer at the ceremonies .

 = Hurricane Dora ( 2011 ) = 
 Hurricane Dora was the strongest tropical cyclone in the northeastern Pacific in 2011 . Dora developed from a tropical wave south of Honduras on July 18 . Moving northwestward in favorable conditions , the system quickly intensified to tropical storm status and attained hurricane intensity the next day . Rapid intensification ensued shortly thereafter , bringing the storm to its peak intensity on July 21 as a Category 4 hurricane , with a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 43 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) . However , the storm 's path into an area with cool sea surface temperatures and wind shear caused Dora to quickly deteriorate and weaken . By July 24 , Dora had degenerated into a remnant low @-@ pressure area west of the Baja California Peninsula . Dora brought stormy conditions to the southwestern Mexico coast and the Baja California Peninsula throughout its existence . Remaining off the coast from its formation to dissipation , Dora 's effects on land were slight . However , the outer rainbands of the hurricane caused flooding and mudslides in southern Mexico and Guatemala , while rough surf toppled a lighthouse and damaged 60 restaurants along the coast . The hurricane 's remnants contributed to heightened shower and thunderstorm activity across New Mexico and Arizona in late July . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Dora can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western African coast on July 7 . The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without any signs of development . However , the system encountered an enhanced flow of moisture in the southwestern Caribbean , allowing for organization and the formation of a broad low @-@ pressure area on July 15 . Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone . The next day , thunderstorm activity erupted around the system , and at 1500 UTC on July 18 , the NHC declared the vigorous disturbance to have reached tropical depression status ; in post @-@ season analysis , the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier . 
 After development , Dora was steered towards the northwest by a ridge over the Southwestern United States . Situated in an area of favorable atmospheric conditions and warm sea surface temperatures , the tropical cyclone quickly strengthened , developing an intermittent eye before being classified as a hurricane at 1800 UTC on July 19 . At the time , the storm was roughly 245 mi ( 400 km ) south @-@ southwest of Puerto Escondido , Oaxaca . Upon reaching hurricane status , Dora began an episode of rapid intensification as its inner structure became more well @-@ defined and its eye more permanent . At the same time , <unk> within the eye — often indicators of intense tropical cyclones — were noted on satellite imagery . By 1800 UTC on July 20 , Dora had attained the threshold for major hurricane status . After acquiring some characteristics of an annular hurricane early on July 21 , Dora reached its peak intensity at 1200 UTC that day with a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 43 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) , making it a high @-@ end Category 4 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . 
 Dora held its peak strength for just six hours before it began to weaken due to cooler waters and the presence of wind shear . Although the hurricane 's initial weakening phase was gradual , the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm . The storm 's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12 hours after Dora 's peak intensity , By 1800 UTC on July 22 , the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity , undergoing an 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) decrease in winds in just 24 hours . Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200 UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula . Twelve hours later , the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity . The low persisted for a day as it tracked north @-@ northwestward , eventually dissipating 70 mi ( 110 km ) south @-@ southwest of Bahía Asunción on July 26 .

 On July 20 , the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for a portion of the southwestern Mexico coast from Lázaro Cárdenas , Michoacán to Cabo Corrientes ; this watch remained posted until the early hours of July 21 . Several hours later , another tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula from Agua Blanca to Buenavista , and was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning as Dora neared the coast . However , the warning was lifted after the hurricane weakened and moved away from land . In Guerrero , the threat of flooding prompted the state government to prepare 900 shelters , while boaters were ordered to exercise caution due to rough seas generated by the nearby tropical cyclone . 
 The outer rainbands of the tropical cyclone caused flooding in the states of Chiapas , Guerrero , and Chiapas , resulting in some damage . Several mudslides in southern Mexico and Guatemala were attributed to these rains . Off the Mexican coast , waves from Dora peaked at 13 ft ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) . These high waves toppled a lighthouse roughly 35 mi ( 56 km ) east of Acapulco and also damaged or swept away 60 thatch @-@ roofed restaurants around La <unk> and La <unk> . After passing southwestern Mexico , Dora was expected to track near the Baja California Peninsula , forcing port authorities in Los Cabos Municipality to suspend boat tours and other tourist services . Four elementary schools were converted into emergency shelters in preparation for potential flooding . Residual moisture from Dora enhanced the monsoonal flow over Arizona and New Mexico , producing showers across the region .

 " Out of Mind " is a pop song written by Tove Lo alongside <unk> Reuterskiöld and produced by The Struts with Reuterskiöld . It has a minimal instrumentation which incorporates " a mesh of fizzing synthesizers " . It was released as a single on 16 October 2013 , and was later featured on the singer 's debut extended play , Truth Serum ( 2014 ) . According to the artist , the songs on the EP talk about her " most intense " failed relationship . In an interview with Coup de Main Magazine , she said that " ' Out Of Mind ' for me is kind of the step after ' Habits ' ... Picked up the pieces again and now just trying to glue them back together , you know ? But it never really works " . In another interview , she told that : 
 In its entirety , [ Truth Serum tells ] a love story from beginning to end . The song ' Love Ballad ' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person , while ' Habits ' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and you just want to freak out . ' Out of Mind ' deals with the stage after that , when your broken heart has mended , but the scars are still there . 
 Some critics had similar opinions about the song 's meaning . Lauren Down of The Guardian expressed that " Wrapped up in the aftermath of a relationship , ' Out Of Mind ' [ ... ] allows the pain of an ending love affair to breath " . Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that " time will heal her broken heart " . According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard , the singer " tells off " a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship . Sam Lansky of Idolator felt that the artist shows " frustrated resignation " while she sings the line " I 'll forget you , seriously " . In the pre @-@ chorus , the music vanishes and she sings " Are you kidding me ? " . Lansky felt that the " emotion " on the pre @-@ chorus was " chill @-@ inducing " , while Savage wrote that " it 's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious . A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly " . In the chorus , the singer repeats the line " You 're out of your mind to think that I " and later finishes it with " could keep you out of mind " , representing the " heartbreaking resolution " of the relationship .

 The song was met with positive reaction by critics . Gaffa Norway critic <unk> <unk> considered it " the most positive song from Truth Serum with its strong chorus and subdued verses " . Additionally , he called it a " must @-@ hear track " alongside " Habits " and " Not On Drugs " . Richard S. Chang of <unk> ranked it at number 3 on his Top 5 Best Tove Lo songs list and wrote that " ' Out Of Mind ' provides the blueprint for Tove Lo 's hits : soft and spare verse , followed by an explosive chorus — all fitting in nicely at just over three minutes " . Under the Gun Review 's <unk> Law called it a " powerful shadow pop track " that " shows off [ Tove 's ] outstanding vocals and just how much promise she has " . Mark Savage of BBC wrote that the pre @-@ chorus of the song was " a moment on [ Truth Serum ] that will take your breath away " . Idolator critic Sam Lansky called it " a cinematic anthem , perfectly suited for some big heartbreak montage , with a big , gorgeous stampeding chorus that crashes in out of nowhere " . He also noted that , with the song , the singer positions as " the next great Swedish pop act " . " Out of Mind " entered the Official Finnish Airplay Chart at number 39 on the last week of 2013 . In doing so , it became the first charting song by Tove Lo on that chart . The following week , it fell to number 52 . It spent a total of six weeks on the chart .

 On 10 August 2013 , Lo announced that she had started filming the music video for her new single . The music video for " Out of Mind " was directed by Andreas <unk> , a member of Swedish production company Naive . It was filmed in the woods and in different deserted places in Stockholm . The imagery was based on Lo 's diary ; in an interview with Swedish website PSL , she explained that : 
 It started with the idea that all of my " demons and dark thoughts " would literally fly out of my head in the video . I 'm trying to get rid of them , but I can 't . I got help from a friend of mine to develop the idea , and when I said I was willing to lend the excerpts of my diary as inspiration for the illustrations he simply said , ' I have the perfect artist for this ' . Then , the artist , Anton <unk> , got a letter from me — which he later promised to burn — with excerpts I plucked out of my diary . It was incredibly scary and a little embarrassing at the same time . Then , Anton sent me some really cool graphics that he painted that set the whole tone for the video . The whole video gives me a lot of disclosure , both on the inside and on the outside but I like it . It gives me so much anxiety and pride at the same time ! . 
 On 11 October 2013 , Universal Music Sweden posted a 16 seconds teaser of the video on its YouTube channel . On 16 October 2013 , it was released on Lo 's VEVO channel on YouTube . The video begins with Lo lying in bed next to her boyfriend . When she starts to sing , she has an out @-@ of @-@ body experience . In the next scene , Lo appears in a room where she cuts her head open and releases her " demons and dark thoughts " . In an interview with Artistdirect , she explained that the demons represent " those thoughts about this other person [ that ] will always haunt you a bit " and " always stick with you " . Then , she is walking on the city streets when the demons start to follow her . She runs barefoot through the woods , where she stops and sings around the entities . At the end of the video , they flow back inside of her and Lo returns to her bedroom .

 Lo performed " Out of Mind " alongside the other songs from Truth Serum and " Run On Love " at Notting Hill Arts Club on 2 April 2014 . This was her first UK show . For the performance , she was accompanied by two drummers . A reviewer from Discopop stated that he was " blown away " and that it was " so refreshing to be at a pop show that engages the heart as well as the senses " . Also , Michael Cragg of The Guardian rated the show with 4 stars out of 5 and deemed it as " a punchy UK debut " . She performed the same set list at her Hoxton Square Bar & Kitchen show on 6 May 2014 . Two months later , she performed the song on US music TV show <unk> . On 1 October , the singer performed the song among others at Webster Hall in Manhattan , New York City . " Out of Mind " was included on the set list of Lo 's first tour , the Queen of the Clouds Tour ( 2015 ) .

 Inception is a 2010 science fiction heist thriller film written , co @-@ produced , and directed by Christopher Nolan , and co @-@ produced by Emma Thomas . The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious , and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for a task seemingly @-@ impossible : " inception " , the implantation of another person 's idea into a target 's subconscious . The ensemble cast additionally includes Ellen Page , Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt , Marion Cotillard , Ken Watanabe , Tom Hardy , Dileep Rao , Cillian Murphy , Tom Berenger , and Michael Caine . 
 After the 2002 completion of Insomnia , Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80 @-@ page treatment about a horror film envisioning " dream stealers " based on lucid dreaming . Emphasizing on professional @-@ scale experience , Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005 's Batman Begins , 2006 's The Prestige , and The Dark Knight in 2008 . The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009 . Inception was filmed in six countries , beginning in Tokyo in June 19 and ending in Canada in November 22 . Its official budget was US $ 160 million , split between Warner Bros and Legendary . Nolan 's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film 's $ 100 million in advertising expenditure . 
 Inception 's première was held in London on July 8 , 2010 ; its wide release to both conventional and IMAX theaters began on July 16 , 2010 . A box office success , Inception has grossed over $ 800 million worldwide . The home video market also had strong results , with $ 68 million in DVD and Blu @-@ ray sales . Inception opened to acclaim from critics , who praised its story , score , and ensemble cast . It won four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography , Best Sound Editing , Best Sound Mixing , and Best Visual Effects , and was nominated for four more : Best Picture , Best Original Score , Best Art Direction , and Best Original Screenplay . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dominick " Dom " Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and Arthur ( Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt ) are " extractors " , who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract valuable information through a shared dream world . Their latest target , Japanese businessman Saito ( Ken Watanabe ) , reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly @-@ impossible job : planting an idea in a person 's subconscious , or " inception " . 
 To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer ( Pete Postlethwaite ) , Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer 's son and heir , Robert ( Cillian Murphy ) , to dissolve his father 's company . In return , Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge , allowing Cobb to return home to his children . Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team : Eames ( Tom Hardy ) , a conman and identity forger ; Yusuf ( Dileep Rao ) , a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable " dream within a dream " strategy , Ariadne ( Ellen Page ) , an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes , recruited with the help of Cobb 's father @-@ in @-@ law , Professor Stephen Miles ( Michael Caine ) . While dream @-@ sharing with Cobb , Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal ( Marion Cotillard ) . 
 When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney , Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten @-@ hour flight back to Los Angeles , which the team ( including Saito , who wants to verify their success ) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream . At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a " kick " that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which proceeds much faster in each successive level . 
 The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been trained to defend against extraction . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi @-@ level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into " limbo " , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is difficult and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission . 
 Eames impersonates Fischer 's godfather , Peter Browning ( Tom Berenger ) , to suggest Fischer reconsider his father 's will . Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level . 
 In the second level , a hotel dreamed by Arthur , Cobb convinces Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector . Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning 's subconscious ( in reality , it is a ruse to enter Fischer 's ) . 
 The third level is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames . The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious . 
 Yusuf , under pursuit by Fischer 's projections in the first level , deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon . This removes the gravity of Arthur 's level , forcing him to improvise a new kick that will synchronize with the van hitting the water , and causes an avalanche in Eames ' level . Mal 's projection emerges and kills Fischer , Cobb kills Mal , and Saito succumbs to his wounds ; all three fall into Limbo . While Eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives , Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito . 
 Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream @-@ sharing technology . Sedated for a few hours of real time , they spent fifty years in dream time constructing a world from their shared memories . When Mal refused to return to reality , Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem ( an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality ) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real . However , when she woke up , Mal was still convinced that she was dreaming . In an attempt to " wake up " for real , Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same . Facing a murder charge , Cobb fled the U.S. , leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles . 
 Through his confession , Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal 's death . Ariadne kills Mal 's projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick . Revived at the mountain fortress , Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea : a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man . While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito , the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality . Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement . The dreamers all awaken on the plane and Saito makes a phone call . 
 Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport , Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home . Cobb tests reality using his totem , a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world , but ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb , a professional thief who specializes in conning secrets from his victims by infiltrating their dreams . DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film . Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times , but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until Inception . Both Brad Pitt and Will Smith were offered the role , according to The Hollywood Reporter . 
 Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt as Arthur , Cobb 's partner who manages and researches the missions . Gordon @-@ Levitt compared Arthur to the producer of Cobb 's art , " the one saying , ' Okay , you have your vision ; now I 'm going to figure out how to make all the nuts and bolts work so you can do your thing ' " . The actor did all of his stunts but one scene and said the preparation " was a challenge and it would have to be for it to look real " . James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur , but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts . 
 Ellen Page as Ariadne , a graduate student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes , which are described as mazes . The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth , daughter of King Minos , who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur . Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a " perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years " . Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience , as " she 's just learning about these ideas and , in essence , assists the audience in learning about dream sharing " . Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan 's first choice to play Ariadne , but she turned it down . Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role , Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt , Rachel McAdams , Taylor Swift , Emma Roberts , Jessy Schram , and Carey Mulligan . 
 Tom Hardy as Eames , a sharp @-@ tongued associate of Cobb . He is referred to as a fence but his specialty is forgery , more accurately identity theft . Eames uses his ability to impersonate others inside the dream world in order to manipulate Fischer . Hardy described his character as " an old , Graham Greene @-@ type diplomat ; sort of faded , shabby , grandeur – the old Shakespeare lovey mixed with somebody from Her Majesty 's Special Forces " , who wears " campy , old money " costumes . 
 Ken Watanabe as Mr. Saito , a Japanese businessman who employs Cobb for the team 's mission . Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind , as he wanted to work with him again after Batman Begins . Inception is Watanabe 's first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English . Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level : " First chapter in my castle , I pick up some hidden feelings of the cycle . It 's magical , powerful and then the first dream . And back to the second chapter , in the old hotel , I pick up [ being ] sharp and more calm and smart and it 's a little bit [ of a ] different process to make up the character of any movie " . 
 Dileep Rao as Yusuf . Rao describes Yusuf as " an avant @-@ garde pharmacologist , who is a resource for people , like Cobb , who want to do this work unsupervised , unregistered and unapproved of by anyone " . Co @-@ producer Jordan Goldberg said the role of the chemist was " particularly tough because you don 't want him to seem like some kind of drug dealer " , and that Rao was cast for being " funny , interesting and obviously smart " . 
 Cillian Murphy as Robert Michael Fischer , the heir to a business empire and the team 's target . Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as " a petulant child who 's in need of a lot of attention from his father , he has everything he could ever want materially , but he 's deeply lacking emotionally " . The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch , " to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful " . 
 Tom Berenger as Peter Browning , Robert Fischer 's godfather and fellow executive at the <unk> ' company . Berenger said Browning acts as a " surrogate father " to Robert , who calls the character " Uncle Peter " , and emphasized that " Browning has been with [ Robert ] his whole life and has probably spent more quality time with him than his own father " . 
 Marion Cotillard as Mal Cobb , Dom 's deceased wife . She is a manifestation of Dom 's guilt about the real cause of Mal 's suicide . He is unable to control these projections of her , challenging his abilities as an extractor . Nolan described Mal as " the essence of the femme fatale , " and DiCaprio praised Cotillard 's performance saying that " she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment , which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character " . 
 Pete Postlethwaite as Maurice Fischer , Robert Fischer 's father and the dying founder of a business empire . 
 Michael Caine as Professor Stephen Miles , Cobb 's mentor and father @-@ in @-@ law , and Ariadne 's college professor who recommends her to the team . 
 Lukas Haas as Nash , an architect in Cobb 's employment who betrays the team and is later replaced by Ariadne . 
 <unk> Riley as a woman whom Eames disguises himself as in a dream . Riley liked the role , despite it being minimal : " I get to wear a nice dress , pick up men in bars , and shove them in elevators . It was good to do something <unk> . Usually I play 15 @-@ year @-@ old English schoolgirls . "

 Initially , Nolan wrote an 80 @-@ page treatment about dream @-@ stealers . Originally , Nolan had envisioned Inception as a horror film , but eventually wrote it as a heist film even though he found that " traditionally [ they ] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms . " Upon revisiting his script , he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story " relies so heavily on the idea of the interior state , the idea of dream and memory . I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes . " Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years . When he first started thinking about making the film , Nolan was influenced by " that era of movies where you had The Matrix ( 1999 ) , you had Dark City ( 1998 ) , you had The Thirteenth Floor ( 1999 ) and , to a certain extent , you had Memento ( 2000 ) , too . They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real . " 
 Nolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. in 2001 , but then felt that he needed more experience making large @-@ scale films , and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight . He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because " as soon as you 're talking about dreams , the potential of the human mind is infinite . And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite . It has to feel like you could go anywhere by the end of the film . And it has to work on a massive scale . " After making The Dark Knight , Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script . Nolan states that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream . " Once you remove the privacy , you 've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact , with validity , with weight , with dramatic consequences . " 
 Leonardo DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film . Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times , but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until Inception . DiCaprio finally agreed because he was " intrigued by this concept — this dream @-@ heist notion and how this character 's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life . " He read the script and found it to be " very well written , comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person , to try to articulate some of the things that have been swirling around his head for the last eight years . " DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay . Nolan took a long time re @-@ writing the script in order " to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie . " On February 11 , 2009 , it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception , a spec script written by Nolan .

 Principal photography began in Tokyo on June 19 , 2009 , with the scene where Saito first hires Cobb during a helicopter flight over the city . 
 The production moved to the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington , Bedfordshire , north of London . There , the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built . A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas , the production designer , Chris Corbould , the special effects supervisor , and Wally Pfister , the director of photography ; it rotated a full 360 degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming , where dream @-@ sector physics become chaotic . The idea was inspired by a technique used in Stanley Kubrick 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) . Nolan said , " I was interested in taking those ideas , techniques , and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario " . The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40 ft ( 12 m ) long , but as the action sequence became more elaborate , the hallway 's length grew to 100 ft ( 30 m ) . The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors . Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt , who plays Arthur , spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like " a giant hamster wheel " . Nolan said of the device , " It was like some incredible torture device ; we thrashed Joseph for weeks , but in the end we looked at the footage , and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before . The rhythm of it is unique , and when you watch it , even if you know how it was done , it confuses your perceptions . It 's unsettling in a wonderful way " . Gordon @-@ Levitt remembered , " it was six @-@ day weeks of just , like , coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor , and you have to choose the right time to cross through them , and if you don 't , you 're going to fall . " On July 15 , 2009 , filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story , including the library , Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre . 
 Filming moved to France where they shot Cobb entering the college of architecture ( the place used for the entrance was the Musée <unk> ) and the pivotal scenes between Ariadne and Cobb , in a bistro ( a fictional one set up at the corner of Rue César Franck and Rue Bouchut ) and then on the Bir @-@ Hakeim bridge . For the explosion that takes place during the bistro scene , the local authorities would not allow the actual use of explosives . High @-@ pressure nitrogen was used to create the effect of a series of explosions . Pfister used six high @-@ speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot . The visual effects department then enhanced the sequence , adding more destruction and flying debris . For the " Paris folding " sequence and when Ariadne " creates " the bridges , green screen and CGI were used on location . 
 Tangier , Morocco , doubled as Mombasa , where Cobb hires Eames and Yusuf . A foot chase was shot in the streets and alleyways of the historic medina quarter . To capture this sequence , Pfister employed a mix of hand @-@ held camera and steadicam work . Tangier was also used to film an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito 's mind . 
 Filming moved to the Los Angeles area , where some sets were built on a Warner Brothers sound stage , including the interior rooms of Saito 's Japanese castle ( the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu beach ) . The dining room was inspired by the <unk> Castle built around 1603 . These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences . The production also staged a multi @-@ vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles , which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street . To do this , the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer . The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and then matched in terms of color and design . Also , the car chase was supposed to be set in the midst of a downpour but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny . The filmmakers were forced to set up elaborate effects ( e.g. , rooftop water cannons ) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy . L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van flies off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion . This sequence was filmed on and off for months with the van being shot out of a cannon , according to actor Dileep Rao . Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film . Once the van landed in the water , the challenge for the actors was not to panic . " And when they ask you to act , it 's a bit of an ask , " explained Cillian Murphy . The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks ; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence . Cobb 's house was in Pasadena . The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City . Limbo was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings . N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for Limbo , with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape . 
 The final phase of principal photography took place in Alberta in late November 2009 . The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort , Fortress Mountain . An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift , taking three months to build . The production had to wait for a huge snowstorm , which eventually arrived . The ski @-@ chase sequence was inspired by Nolan 's favorite James Bond film , On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ( 1969 ) : " What I liked about it that we 've tried to emulate in this film is there 's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion . " 
 = = = Cinematography = = = 
 The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format on 35 mm film , with key sequences filmed on 65 mm , and aerial sequences in VistaVision . Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight . " We didn 't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area , the nature of dreams and so forth , I wanted it to be as realistic as possible . Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras , even though I love the format dearly " . In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using <unk> and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film , but ultimately decided against either format . Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo @-@ Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second . Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera , but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches . " Out of six times that we shot on the digital format , we only had one useable piece and it didn 't end up in the film . Out of the six times we shot with the Photo @-@ Sonics camera and 35mm running through it , every single shot was in the movie . " Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses , which is not possible with 3D cameras . Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces , and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception , saying " I think it 's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D . The whole point of cinematic imagery is it 's three dimensional ... You know 95 % of our depth cues come from occlusion , resolution , color and so forth , so the idea of calling a 2D movie a ' 2D movie ' is a little misleading . " Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post @-@ production but decided that , while it was possible , he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with . In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu @-@ ray release . 
 Wally Pfister gave each location and dream level a distinctive look to aid the audience 's recognition of the narrative 's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film : the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool , the hotel hallways have warm hues , and the scenes in the van are more neutral . 
 Nolan has said that the film " deals with levels of reality , and perceptions of reality which is something I 'm very interested in . It 's an action film set in a contemporary world , but with a slight science @-@ fiction bent to it , " while also describing it as " very much an ensemble film structured somewhat as a heist movie . It 's an action adventure that spans the globe " . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 For dream sequences in Inception , Nolan used little computer @-@ generated imagery , preferring practical effects whenever possible . Nolan said , " It 's always very important to me to do as much as possible in @-@ camera , and then , if necessary , computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically . " To this end , visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film . For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity , he used CG @-@ based effects to " subtly bend elements like physics , space and time . " 
 The most challenging effect was the " limbo " city level at the end of the film because it continually developed during production . Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan gave his ideal vision : " Something glacial , with clear modernist architecture , but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs " . Franklin and his team ended up with " something that looked like an iceberg version of Gotham City with water running through it . " They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads , intersections and ravines until they had a complex , yet organic @-@ looking , cityscape . For the Paris @-@ folding sequence , Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion . Later during principal photography , Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation Franklin had created . Inception had close to 500 visual effects shots ( in comparison , Batman Begins had approximately 620 ) which is considered minor in comparison to contemporary visual effects epics that can have around 1 @,@ 500 or 2 @,@ 000 special effects images . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The score for Inception was written by Hans Zimmer , who described his work as " a very electronic , dense score " , filled with " nostalgia and sadness " to match Cobb 's feelings throughout the film . The music was written simultaneously to filming , and features a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone , played by Johnny Marr , former guitarist of The Smiths . Édith Piaf 's " Non , je ne regrette rien " ( " No , I Do Not Regret Anything " ) pointedly appears throughout the film , used to accurately time the dreams , and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score . A soundtrack album was released on July 11 , 2010 by Reprise Records . The majority of the score was also included in high resolution 5 @.@ 1 surround sound on the 2nd disc of the 2 disc Blu @-@ ray release Hans Zimmer 's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Score category in 2011 , losing to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of The Social Network .

 In Inception , Nolan wanted to explore " the idea of people sharing a dream space ... That gives you the ability to access somebody 's unconscious mind . What would that be used and abused for ? " The majority of the film 's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds . This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others . The dream is always in a state of production , and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it . By contrast , the world of The Matrix ( 1999 ) is an authoritarian , computer @-@ controlled one , alluding to theories of social control developed by Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard . Nolan 's world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari . 
 David Denby in The New Yorker compared Nolan 's cinematic treatment of dreams to Luis Buñuel 's in Belle de Jour ( 1967 ) and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie ( 1972 ) . He criticized Nolan 's " literal @-@ minded " action level sequencing compared to Buñuel , who " silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment , but Nolan is working on so many levels of representation at once that he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain what 's going on . " The latter captures " the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams . " 
 Deirdre Barrett , a dream researcher at Harvard University , said that Nolan did not get every detail accurate regarding dreams , but their illogical , rambling , disjointed plots would not make for a great thriller anyway . However , " he did get many aspects right , " she said , citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath , and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building , waking him up . " That 's very much how real stimuli get incorporated , and you very often wake up right after that intrusion " . 
 Nolan himself said , " I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a conscious dream being a skill that these people have . Really the script is based on those common , very basic experiences and concepts , and where can those take you ? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents , really , is the existence of a technology that allows you to enter and share the same dream as someone else . "

 Others have argued that the film is itself a metaphor for film @-@ making , and that the <unk> experience itself , images flashing before one 's eyes in a darkened room , is akin to a dream . Writing in Wired , Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film @-@ watching and sleeping . In both , the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex , which deals with logic , deliberate analysis , and self @-@ awareness , is quiet . Paul argued that the experience of going to a <unk> is itself an exercise in shared dreaming , particularly when viewing Inception : the film 's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together . This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images , on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself . As in the film 's story , in a cinema one enters into the space of another 's dream , in this case Nolan 's , as with any work of art , one 's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one 's own subjective desires and subconscious . At Bir @-@ Hakeim bridge in Paris , Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts , Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked " Is this not a strong , beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion ? "

 Nolan combined elements from several different film genres into the film , notably science fiction , heist film , and film noir . Marion Cotillard plays " Mal " Cobb , Dom Cobb 's projection of his guilt over his deceased wife 's suicide . As the film 's main antagonist , she is a frequent , malevolent presence in his dreams . Dom is unable to control these projections of her , challenging his abilities as an extractor . Nolan described Mal as " the essence of the femme fatale " , the key noir reference in the film . As a " classic femme fatale " her relationship with Cobb is in his mind , a manifestation of Cobb 's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves . DiCaprio praised Cotillard 's performance saying that " she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment , which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character " . 
 Nolan began with the structure of a heist movie , since exposition is an essential element of that genre , though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious . Or , as Denby surmised , " the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper " . Kristin Thompson argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film . While a traditional heist movie has a heavy dose of exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan , in Inception this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming . Three @-@ quarters of the film , until the van begins to fall from the bridge , are devoted to explaining its plot . In this way , exposition takes precedence over characterisation . Their relationships are created by their respective skills and roles . Ariadne , like her ancient namesake , creates the maze and guides the others through it , but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious , and as the sole student of dream sharing , helps the audience understand the concept of the plot . 
 Nolan drew inspiration from the works of Jorge Luis Borges , the anime film Paprika ( 2006 ) by the late Satoshi Kon as an influence on the character " Ariadne " , and Blade Runner ( 1982 ) by Ridley Scott .

 The film cuts to the closing credits from a shot of the top apparently starting to show an ever so faint wobble , inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream . Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate , saying , " I 've been asked the question more times than I 've ever been asked any other question about any other film I 've made ... What 's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it . " The film 's script concludes with " Behind him , on the table , the spinning top is STILL <unk> . And we – <unk> OUT " . Nolan said , " I put that cut there at the end , imposing an ambiguity from outside the film . That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate ' kick ' to me ... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn 't looking at the top . He 's looking at his kids . He 's left it behind . That 's the emotional significance of the thing . " Also , Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending , saying , " If I 'm there it 's real , because I 'm never in the dream . I 'm the guy who invented the dream . " 
 Some pundits have pointed out that the top was not in fact Cobb 's totem , rendering the discussion irrelevant . They point out that the top was Mal 's totem ; Cobb 's was his wedding ring , as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn 't . As he hands his passport to the immigration officer , his hand is shown with no ring ; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children . Furthermore , the children were portrayed by different actors , indicating they had aged . 
 Mark Fisher argued that " a century of cultural theory " cautions against accepting the author 's interpretation as anything more than a supplementary text , and this all the more so given the theme of the instability of any one master position in Nolan 's films . Therein the manipulator is often the one who ends up manipulated and Cobb 's " not caring " about whether or not his world is real may be the price of happiness and release .

 Warner Bros. spent $ 100 million marketing the film . Although Inception was not part of an existing franchise , Sue Kroll , president of Warner 's worldwide marketing , said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of " Christopher Nolan as a brand " . Kroll declared that " We don 't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening , but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies . If you can 't make those elements work , it 's a sad day . " The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy — as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing , Michael Tritter , " You have this movie which is going to have a pretty big built in fanbase ... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret . Chris [ Nolan ] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that — at least early on — is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans . " 
 A viral marketing campaign was employed for the film . After the revelation of the first teaser trailer , in August 2009 , the film 's official website featured only an animation of Cobb 's spinning top . In December , the top toppled over and the website opened the online game Mind Crime , which upon completion revealed Inception 's poster . The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April 2010 , where Warner gave away promotional T @-@ shirts featuring the <unk> briefcase used to create the dream space , and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device . Mind Crime also received a stage 2 with more resources , including a hidden trailer for the movie . More pieces of viral marketing began to surface before Inception 's release , such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine , and the online publication of posters , ads , phone applications , and strange websites all related to the film . Warner also released an online prequel comic , Inception : The <unk> Job . 
 The official trailer released on May 10 , 2010 through Mind Game was extremely well received . It featured an original piece of music , " Mind Heist " , by recording artist Zack <unk> , rather than music from the score . The trailer quickly went viral with numerous mashups copying its style , both by amateurs on sites like YouTube and by professionals on sites such as CollegeHumor . On June 7 , 2010 , a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes featurette on the film was released in HD on Yahoo ! Movies .

 Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 86 % based on reviews from 331 critics , with an average score of 8 @.@ 1 / 10 . The website offers the consensus : " Smart , innovative , and thrilling , Inception is that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually . " Metacritic , another review aggregator , assigned the film a weighted average score of 74 ( out of 100 ) based on 42 reviews from mainstream critics , considered to be " generally favorable reviews . " In polls conducted by CinemaScore during the opening weekend cinemagoers gave Inception an average score of " B + " . 
 While some critics have tended to view the film as perfectly straightforward , and even criticize its overarching themes as " the stuff of torpid platitudes , " online discussion has been much more positive . Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending , with many critics like Devin Faraci making the case that the film is self @-@ referential and tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek , both a film about film @-@ making and a dream about dreams . Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film 's use of religious and water symbolism . Yet other critics , such as Kristin Thompson , see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling , highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that revels in " continuous exposition " . 
 The film has had excellent reviews in general . Perhaps playing off the film 's game imagery , Rolling Stone magazine 's Peter Travers called Inception a " wildly ingenious chess game , " and concluded " the result is a knockout . " In Variety , Justin Chang praised the film as " a conceptual tour de force " and wrote , " applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the unconscious mind , the writer @-@ director has devised a heist thriller for surrealists , a Jungian 's Rififi , that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of ( un ) reality . " Jim Vejvoda of IGN rated the film as perfect , deeming it " a singular accomplishment from a filmmaker who has only gotten better with each film . " Relevant Magazine 's David Roark called it Nolan 's greatest accomplishment , saying , " Visually , intellectually and emotionally , Inception is a masterpiece . " 
 Empire magazine rated it five stars in the August 2010 issue and wrote , " it feels like Stanley Kubrick adapting the work of the great sci @-@ fi author William Gibson ... Nolan delivers another true original : welcome to an undiscovered country . " Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B + rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote , " It 's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M.C. Escher or a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ biz video game ; the backwards splicing of Nolan 's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison . " The New York Post gave the film a four @-@ star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote , " DiCaprio , who has never been better as the tortured hero , draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non @-@ sci @-@ fi fans . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times awarded the film a full four stars and said that Inception " is all about process , about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream , reality within dreams , dreams without reality . It 's a breathtaking juggling act . " Richard Roeper , also of the Sun @-@ Times , gave Inception a perfect score of " A + " and called it " one of the best movies of the [ 21st ] century . " 
 BBC Radio 5 Live 's Mark Kermode named Inception as the best film of 2010 , stating , " Inception is proof that people are not stupid , that cinema is not trash , and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing . " 
 In his review for the Chicago Tribune , Michael Phillips gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote , " I found myself wishing Inception were weirder , further out ... the film is Nolan 's labyrinth all the way , and it 's gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than ( as Shakespeare said ) a dream that hath no bottom . " Time magazine 's Richard Corliss wrote the film 's " noble intent is to implant one man 's vision in the mind of a vast audience ... The idea of moviegoing as communal dreaming is a century old . With Inception , viewers have a chance to see that notion get a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art update . " Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan felt that Nolan was able to blend " the best of traditional and modern filmmaking . If you 're searching for smart and nervy popular entertainment , this is what it looks like . " USA Today rated the film three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four and Claudia Puig felt that Nolan " regards his viewers as possibly smarter than they are — or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level . That 's a tall order . But it 's refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch , even occasionally struggle , to keep up . " 
 Not all reviewers gave the film positive reviews . New York magazine 's David Edelstein claimed in his review to " have no idea what so many people are raving about . It 's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and — hold on ... Whoa ! I think I get it . The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype — a metaphor for itself . " Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film 's development as " pretty much what we 've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... [ it ] doesn 't seem like much of an accomplishment to me . " A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented " there is a lot to see in Inception , there is nothing that counts as genuine vision . Mr. Nolan 's idea of the mind is too literal , too logical , and too rule @-@ bound to allow the full measure of madness . " David Denby , writing in The New Yorker , considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be , concluding , " Inception is a stunning @-@ looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies , a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else . " 
 Several sources have noted many plot similarities between the film and the 2002 Uncle Scrooge comic The Dream of a Lifetime by Don Rosa . 
 In April 2014 , The Daily Telegraph placed the title on its top ten list of the most overrated films . Telegraph 's Tim Robey stated , " It 's a criminal failing of the movie that it purports to be about people ’ s dreams being invaded , but demonstrates no instinct at all for what a dream has ever felt like , and no flair for making us feel like we 're in one , at any point . " The film won an informal poll by The Los Angeles Times as the most overrated movie of 2010 . 
 In March 2011 , the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their ninth favorite film of all time . In 2012 , Inception was ranked the 35th Best Edited Film of All Time by the Motion Picture Editors Guild . In the same year , Total Film named it the most <unk> movie of all time . In 2014 , Empire ranked Inception the tenth greatest film ever made on their list of " The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time " as voted by the magazine 's readers , while Rolling Stone magazine named it the second best science fiction film since the turn of the century . Inception was ranked 84th on Hollywood 's 100 Favorite Films , a list compiled by The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 , surveying " Studio chiefs , Oscar winners and TV royalty " .

 " Watch n ' Learn " was written by Priscilla Renea , Chauncey Hollis , Rihanna and <unk> Jackson . The production of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage @-@ name Hit @-@ Boy . Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne , The Throne , Eminem and Jennifer Lopez . " Watch n ' Learn " wasn 't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit @-@ Boy started to work on it . In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained : " I was at the studio with this amazing [ songwriter ] Priscilla Renea , and I was going to tell her to go home , but I was like , ' Stay here and see if you could come up with an idea for this [ the song ] ' " . Renea previously penned Rihanna 's 2011 single " California King Bed " ( Loud , 2010 ) . Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home , Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through <unk> . He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna , in which her team " went crazy " when they heard it . Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk ( 2011 ) . 
 In the same interview for the publication , Hollis explained the title of the song : " It 's called ' Watch n ' Learn , ' and people will understand what it 's about once it comes out . It 's a very sexy record , but it 's fun . It 's [ got ] great melodies ; it 's catchy ; the beat knocks . It 's so many different elements to it .

 " Watch n ' Learn " is a dancehall song with prominent reggae characteristics that runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds . It begins with a reggae drum fill that according to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly originates from Bob Marley 's 1983 single " Buffalo Soldier " ( Confrontation , 1983 ) . " Watch n ' Learn " uses finger @-@ snapping , percussions , background clicks , " swirling / swelling " synths and " island @-@ flavored " drum beat . 
 Jason Lipshutz of Billboard complimented the balance between the synths and percussion while calling it " taut and engaging " . Flavour Magazine 's Maz Halima thought that the beat sounds futuristic and reminds her of a new version of an old beat that was predominantly used in the songs performed by rapper Kanye West . Edward Keeble from Gigwise wrote that " Watch n ' Learn " cares influence from the works by American hip hop and R & B band TLC , as well as sounds like a " call back to the " synthpop group Art of Noise . 
 Lyrically , the song is about a woman who teaches her partner how to love her in the right way , throughout which she uses sexual references . MTV News ' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has " sassy " lyrics , but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that " the track is actually kind of dirty " . Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics , Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere . Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics : " I 'mma do it do it do it / On the bed on the floor on the couch / Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth / Just because I can 't kiss back / Doesn 't mean you can 't kiss that " , which were described as the " nastiest " on the song by Brad Wete of Complex . As the song continues further , Rihanna is " not @-@ so @-@ subtly " instructing her lover within the lines " It ’ s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I 'll stay " .

 Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound called " Watch n ' Learn " a " reggae jam " and further concluded that " low @-@ key Rihanna , without heaps of easily identifiable help or loads of over @-@ saturated gimmicks , is still a knockout " . Matthew Horton of Virgin Media called the song a " wonderfully sunny tribal disco " track with a thematics regarding oral sex . In a review of Talk That Talk , Mesfin Fekadu of The Boston Globe stated that Rihanna is " raunchy " on the new album and it works . Regarding the song he further commented that she 's [ Rihanna ] schooling her man in the bedroom on the fun " Watch N ' Learn . " . Giovanny <unk> of CultureBlues concluded that the track " strips away " from the techno and David Guetta influences which according to him the album is " drowning in " . He further thought that " sassy women will absolutely love to sing [ the song ] in their cars . " Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine positively reviewed " Watch n ' Learn " , considering her favorite song from the album together with " Cockiness ( Love It ) " and " You da One " . Hallima thought that the song has Rihanna 's signature sound and wrote she " really enjoyed the contrast between the light beat and her husky voice – pure catchiness . " 
 Glenn Gamboa of Newsweek considered " Watch n ' Learn " an " answer to Janet Jackson 's " Doesn 't Really Matter " for its similar production and " playful " nature . Los Angeles Times ’ Randal Roberts while reviewing the song stated : Rihanna " reels off her carnal intentions with an impressive though not entirely believable candor . " Julianne Shepherd of Spin called the track Rihanna 's game in which there is a very little chance for winning — " but she 'd love it if you tried " . Andy Kellman of Allmusic commended the melody of the song and noted that " Watch n ' Learn " is more unique than Hit @-@ Boy 's work on Kanye West and Jay @-@ Z 's 2011 single " Niggas in Paris " ( Watch the Throne , 2011 ) . Chelsea Lewis from The Celebrity Cafe concluded that Rihanna " is expressing her independence as a woman in the music industry , as she is making a statement with ' Watch n ’ Learn ' and Talk That Talk as a whole . " Herald Sun 's Cameron Adams while comparing the song with the other sexual themes on the album , stated that " Watch n ' Learn " is " at least instructional " . Jon Caramanica from The New York Times linked " Watch N ' Learn " to Beyoncé Knowles ' " Party " , however he concluded that even though it has " good mouth feel but no taste " .

 During 1997 , Fantasy World ( the area of Alton Towers in which Oblivion was eventually situated ) was closed off and all the old fantasy @-@ themed rides were removed except the Black Hole . Details about Oblivion were not revealed until March 1998 . 
 The " <unk> " codename stood for " Secret Weapon 4 " . <unk> was Nemesis , and SW 1 and 2 were unbuilt roller coasters originally intended for the Nemesis site . 
 Oblivion 's opening was accompanied by a massive publicity drive , including appearances on Blue Peter , The Gadget Show , news channels and cereal boxes . In 1997 , before Oblivion opened , some marketing memorabilia was released , including its own brand of deodorant .

 With the new roller coaster The Smiler opening in 2013 , Oblivion is no longer the only coaster in X Sector , as it had been since Black Hole 's closure in 2005 . In late January / early February 2013 , Alton Towers began a process of repainting Oblivion 's fading grey track , which had become very worn since opening in 1998 . 
 The repaint took over 6 weeks to complete , with some cosmetic upgrades also being made to the station building and queue line structures . The coaster is now the same dark grey colour as its neighbour The Smiler . 
 In June , Oblivion suffered downtime owing to a gearbox component failing . The ride remained closed for a few weeks while a replacement part was manufactured . The ride re @-@ opened on 25 June .

 While riders queue they are shown three briefing videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness , who explains at length the physical and psychological effects of riding on Oblivion . Although based on scientific facts , his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion . The man remains unnamed throughout the videos , although the character was originally referred to as the Lord of Darkness during production . The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white , who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience ; to which he is repeatedly ignored . The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe , before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter . 
 The queue line takes riders through a large , drawn out upwards helix , repeatedly passing under , through and over various buildings of abstract architecture , before traversing metal bridges into the elevated station building . Here they are <unk> into rows and board their ride cars , while various technical graphics are displayed on overhead screens . As the cars dispatch , the screens play an automated video featuring the Lord of Darkness in his final appearance as he recites the following monologue : 
 For some things , there is no rational explanation . There is no way out . There is no happy ending to the story . Welcome to the unknown ; welcome to eternal darkness ; welcome ... to Oblivion . 
 The roller coaster has a simple layout with a 150 ft drop at 89 @.@ 5 degrees , and is the world 's first vertical drop rollercoaster The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension , then levels out , slowly travelling around a curve on a unique chain system , seen only on Oblivion , as the cars approach the drop . As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds , giving the rider a clear view of the long drop , before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel . This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through . Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes , slowing down , and then pulls around back to the station . The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight . The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop . A pre @-@ recorded and disembodied voice saying ' don 't look down ' was played just before release . In 2004 , this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and the words " Don 't look down " have instead been painted on the floor of the guest observation area which is visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge .

U @-@ 10 was capable of up to 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) while surfaced and 5 @.@ 5 knots ( 10 @.@ 2 km / h ; 6 @.@ 3 mph ) while submerged at a diving depth of up to 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men . 
 U @-@ 10 was equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . German Type UB I submarines were additionally equipped with a 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun , but it is not clear from sources if U @-@ 10 , as a former German boat , was either equipped with one or , if so , retained it in Austro @-@ Hungarian service . In October 1916 , U @-@ 10 's armament was supplemented with a 37 @-@ mm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) gun . This gun was replaced by a 47 @-@ mm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) QF gun in November 1917 . 
 Construction of UB @-@ 1 was started on 1 November 1914 at Germaniawerft in Kiel . After her assembly was complete UB @-@ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 . 
 After extended negotiations between Austria @-@ Hungary and Germany , in March 1915 it was decided for Germany to supply five submarines of the UB I type . This model was familiar to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy since the Imperial German Navy had reassembled <unk> , UB 8 , and UB 9 at the Pola factory . The first boat was bought on April 4 , 1915 , a " sample " UB 1 boat . This submarine was shipped by rail in sections to Pola , where the sections were riveted together . Though there is no record of how long it took for UB @-@ 1 's parts to be assembled , a sister boat , UB @-@ 3 , shipped from Germany in mid @-@ April 1915 , was assembled in about two weeks .

 SM UB @-@ 1 was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Franz Wäger on 29 January . An Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy officer was assigned to the boat for piloting and training purposes . On 26 June 1915 , UB @-@ 1 sank an Italian torpedo boat <unk> 5 Pn in the Gulf of Venice . 
 On 4 June 1915 , after being disassembled into three sections and transported by rail to Pola for reassembling , UB @-@ 1 was handed over to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy and commissioned as U @-@ 10 under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Karl Edler von <unk> . 
 British submarine H4 had an encounter with U @-@ 10 on 11 May 1917 . While cruising off Pola , H4 came across U @-@ 10 and fired a spread of two torpedoes at the submarine . The torpedoes were aimed to be 5 ° apart at a distance of 365 metres ( 400 yd ) which was apparently too wide , because the captain of H4 observed the torpedoes miss just ahead and just astern of U @-@ 10 . 
 On 9 July 1918 , U @-@ 10 hit an Italian mine near <unk> in the northern Adriatic Sea at position 45 ° 30 ′ N 13 ° 00 ′ E , and was beached with heavy damage . Although she was looted by Austro @-@ Hungarian Army troops , she was later towed to Trieste for repairs , which remained unfinished at war 's end ; all of the 13 crew personnel were saved . U @-@ 10 was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped at Pola by 1920 . U @-@ 10 sank no ships in her Austro @-@ Hungarian service .

 = International Gendarmerie = 
 The International Gendarmerie was the first law enforcement agency of the Principality of Albania . It was established by the decision of the ambassadors of the six Great Powers that participated in the London Peace Conference . This decision was made on the basis of the London Treaty signed on May 30 , 1913 . Since most of the members were from the Netherlands , this force was also known as the Dutch Military Mission . 
 The first gendarmerie members arrived in Albania on November 10 , 1913 . They were soon faced with a peasant revolt . One International Gendarmerie officer was killed and many were imprisoned after the revolt erupted in June 1914 . Dutch officers were gradually replaced by officers from Austria @-@ Hungary and Germany , who arrived in Durrës on July 4 . Soon , World War I broke out and by August 4 , most of the Dutch officers had returned to the Netherlands . By September 19 , 1914 , the last two imprisoned officers were released . 
 = = Background = = 
 The ambassadors of the six Great Powers decided to constitute the Principality of Albania on July 29 , 1913 during the 54th meeting of the London Conference . The new country needed a sovereign , borders , government and military police force . To ensure the gendarmerie 's neutrality , the Powers decided that its members should come from a different country . Their first choice was Sweden , but that country was already busy with a similar mission in Persia , they chose the Netherlands for its neutrality , lack of direct interest in Albania and extensive colonial experience in the Dutch East Indies . On October 15 , 1913 they established the International Commission of Control to administer the country until its own political institutions were established . Wilhelm of Wied was selected as the first prince . 
 = = Leadership = = 
 The Netherlands ' War Minister initially chose Major Lodewijk Thomson to head the Gendarmerie , but after a Dutch unrelated political crisis and the formation of a new government , the new Minister appointed Colonel Willem De Veer instead , placing Thomson as his second @-@ in @-@ command on October 20 , 1913 . 
 De Veer and Thomson prepared a classified 150 @-@ page report on the setting up of the gendarmerie . There were discussions of 5 @,@ 000 gendarmes led by Dutch officers provided by the government of the Netherlands . On February 24 , 1914 , 13 Dutch officers arrived at Vlorë : Captain Fabius , Major Kroon , Major De Waal , Major Sluys , Captain Doorman , Major <unk> , Dr. De Groot , Captain Sar , Major Verhulst , Major Snellen van <unk> , First Lieutenant Mallinckrodt , Captains Reimers and Sonne . 
 = = Mission = = 
 The International Gendarmerie was only one of numerous armed groups in the principality during Wilhelm 's reign . Others included irregular bands of southerners led by local leaders ; native outlaws ; Bulgarian outlaw <unk> ; Greek rebels from the Northern Epirus ; peasant rebels in central Albania ; Essad Pasha 's gendarmerie ; volunteers from Kosovo led by Isa <unk> ; and Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern mountains under the command of <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 One of the first tasks of the new gendarmerie was to train Albanian recruits in order to take control of southern Albania after the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence of February 28 , 1914 . 
 Essad Pasha <unk> , as minister of war and interior , was against a peaceful solution of the problem . He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means . The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha 's proposals for a military solution . Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the ( predominantly Muslim ) population of central Albania . They believed that the new regime was a tool of the ( Christian ) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land . On the basis of those beliefs they revolted . 
 When thousands of rebels surrounded <unk> on May 17 , only 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) from Durrës , Essad Pasha was accused of fomenting the revolt against William of Wied . He was exiled to Italy on May 20 , without trial . 
 The revolt intensified after Essad 's exile . In order to gain support from the 1 @,@ 000 Mirdita Catholic paid volunteers from the northern mountains , Prince of Wied appointed their leader , <unk> <unk> <unk> , as foreign minister . Isa <unk> and his men , mostly from Kosovo , also joined the International Gendarmerie to fight the rebels . Dutch gendarmes together with the Mirdita attempted to capture <unk> , but when they engaged on May 23 , they were surrounded and captured , along with another expedition from Durrës which attempted to release the captured gendarmes . Captain Sar did not know that the northern Catholic tribes refused to fight the rebels because General <unk> was agreed when the Prince of Wied took over the throne . Rebels attacked Durrës , firing on it with light weapons . The people in Durrës panicked , and the Prince took his family to shelter in an Italian ship anchored in the bay . 
 During the early morning surprise attack , on June 15 , 1914 , Thomson was shot in the chest ( despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him ) and died within a few minutes . It is probable that an Italian sniper was responsible . 
 Captain Fabius established a volunteer artillery unit . According to the Austrian government , the volunteers who bombarded the rebels were recruited by the Albanian Committee in Vienna . Till the end of June 1914 Dutch officers were captured by rebels in most of the central Albania . They were gradually replaced with officers from Austria @-@ Hungary and Germany , who arrived in Durrës on July 4 . On July 27 , 1914 Colonel De Veer officially tendered the officers ' resignations . Soon the First World War broke out and by August 4 most of the officers had returned home . The rebels captured Berat on July 12 and Vlore , without fight , on August 21 . The last two captured officers ( Verhulst and Reimers ) were released on September 19 , 1914 . 
 = = End of the Mission = = 
 In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha accepted an invitation from the Senate of Central Albania ( established by the rebelling towns in mid and north Albania ) to return to Albania to take control . His first task was to provide financial backing for his government . Therefore , he travelled to Niš , Kingdom of Serbia , where he and Serbian prime minister Pašić signed a secret treaty of Serbian @-@ Albanian alliance on September 17 . In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania . With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in <unk> and captured the interior and Durrës at the beginning of October , without a fight . 
 = Italian cruiser Umbria = 
 Umbria was a protected cruiser of the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) built in the 1890s . She was the lead ship of the Regioni class , which included five other vessels . All of the ships were named for current or former regions of Italy . The ship was equipped with a main armament of four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and six 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns , and she could steam at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Umbria spent much of her career abroad , including several years in American waters . In service during a period of relative peace , Umbria never saw combat . In 1911 , she was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostrück , though she did not serve for very long under the Haitian flag . Her crew was too inexperienced to operate the ship , and she foundered shortly after being transferred to the Haitian Navy 
 = = Design = = 
 Umbria was 84 @.@ 8 meters ( 278 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 03 m ( 39 @.@ 5 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 35 m ( 17 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced up to 3 @,@ 110 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 060 long tons ; 3 @,@ 430 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion engines , with steam supplied by four cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . On her speed trials , she reached a maximum of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) at 7 @,@ 400 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 500 kW ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 2 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ; 2 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 213 @-@ 78 . 
 Umbria was armed with a main battery of four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns mounted singly , with two side by side forward and two side by side aft . Six 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns were placed between them , with three on each broadside . Light armament included one 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) gun , eight 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns , two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and a pair of machine guns . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . Umbria was protected by a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick deck , and her conning tower had 50 mm thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Umbria was built by the Odero @-@ Terni @-@ Orlando shipyard in Livorno . Her keel was laid down on 1 August 1888 . Shortages of funding slowed the completion of Umbria and her sister ships . Tight budgets forced the navy to reduce the pace of construction so that the funds could be used to keep the active fleet in service . As a result , her hull was not ready to be launched until 23 April 1891 , and fitting @-@ out work took another almost three years to complete . Umbria finally joined the fleet on 16 February 1894 . On 1 February 1897 , Umbria was assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main Italian fleet , along with her sister Liguria and the cruisers Marco Polo and Dogali . 
 In September 1904 , Umbria stopped in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to supervise the transfer of sailors who had been killed by a yellow fever outbreak on her sister Lombardia in 1896 . The men , 134 in all , had been buried in various cemeteries , but were re @-@ interred in a large mausoleum in São Francisco Xavier . On 29 December , Umbria stopped in Valparaiso , where she met the German cruiser SMS Falke and the United States ' cruisers USS New York and USS Marblehead and the gunboat USS Bennington . In June 1905 , Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland , Oregon . She was joined there by the United States ' cruisers USS Chicago and USS Boston . Umbria ran aground outside Kingston , Jamaica in July 1906 , while en route from Puerto Rico . The salvage ship SS Premier assisted in pulling the ship free . 
 By 1910 , the Regia Marina had decided to dispose of the obsolescent cruiser . Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser Dupuy de Lôme , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria . Instead , in December 1910 , the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy , but she did not arrive in Port @-@ de @-@ Paix , Haiti , until 13 June 1911 . After the sale , the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück . The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro , the deposed president of Venezuela , though they later proved to be false . A German captain , Willy Meyer , was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti , but due to the lengthy delays , he quit . The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship . Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam , the Netherlands , for disposal in 1913 . 
 = Threatening the President of the United States = 
 Threatening the President of the United States is a class E felony under United States Code Title 18 , Section 871 . It consists of knowingly and willfully mailing or otherwise making " any threat to take the life of , to kidnap , or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States " . The United States Secret Service investigates suspected violations of this law and monitors those who have a history of threatening the President . Threatening the President is considered a political offense . Immigrants who commit this crime can be deported . 
 Because the offense consists of pure speech , the courts have issued rulings attempting to balance the government 's interest in protecting the President with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States . According to the book Stalking , Threatening , and Attacking Public Figures , " Hundreds of celebrity howlers threaten the President of the United States every year , sometimes because they disagree with his policies , but more often just because he is the President . " 
 The prototype for Section 871 was the English Treason Act 1351 , which made it a crime to " compass or imagine " the death of the King . Convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 871 have been sustained for declaring that " President Wilson ought to be killed . It is a wonder some one has not done it already . If I had an opportunity , I would do it myself . " ; and for declaring that " Wilson is a wooden @-@ headed son of a bitch . I wish Wilson was in hell , and if I had the power I would put him there . " In a later era , a conviction was sustained for displaying posters urging passersby to " hang [ President ] Roosevelt " . 
 There has been some controversy among the federal appellate courts as to how the term " willfully " should be interpreted . Traditional legal interpretations of the term are reflected by Black 's Law Dictionary 's definition , which includes descriptions such as " malicious , done with evil intent , or with a bad motive or purpose , " but most courts have adopted a more easily proven standard . For instance , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him . It was willingly made , if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words , the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution . According to the U.S. Attorney 's Manual , " Of the individuals who come to the Secret Service 's attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees , approximately 75 percent are mentally ill . " 
 = = Frequency = = 
 The first prosecutions under the statute , enacted in 1917 , occurred during the highly charged , <unk> years of World War I , and the decisions handed down by the courts in these early cases reflected intolerance for any words demonstrating even a vague spirit of disloyalty . There was a relative moratorium on prosecutions under this statute until the World War II era . The number increased during the turbulent Vietnam War era . They have tended to fall when the country has not been directly embroiled in a national crisis situation . 
 The number of reported threats rose from 2 @,@ 400 in 1965 to 12 @,@ 800 in 1969 . According to some reports , President George W. Bush received about 3 @,@ 000 threats a year , while his successor Barack Obama received about four times that many . This figure has been disputed by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan , who says that Obama receives about as many threats as the previous two Presidents . 
 According to the U.S. Attorneys ' Manual , " Media attention given to certain kinds of criminal activity seems to generate further criminal activity ; this is especially true concerning Presidential threats which is well documented by data previously supplied by the United States Secret Service . For example , in the six @-@ month period following the March 30 , 1981 , attempt on the life of President Reagan , the average number of threats against protectees of the Secret Service increased by over 150 percent from a similar period during the prior year . " For this reason , the agency recommends considering the use of sealed affidavits to keep news of threats from leaking to the press .

 In September 2009 the Secret Service investigated Facebook polls that asked whether President Barack Obama should be assassinated .

 The prototype for Section 871 was the British Treason Act 1351 , which made it a crime to " compass or imagine " the death of the King . The statute prohibiting threats against the President was enacted by Congress in 1917 . The maximum fine it allowed was $ 1 @,@ 000 . The law was amended in 1994 to increase the maximum fine to $ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 Among the justifications that have been given for the statute include arguments that threats against the President have a tendency to stimulate opposition to national policies , however wise , even in the most critical times ; to incite the hostile and evil @-@ minded to take the President 's life ; to add to the expense of the President 's safeguarding ; to be an affront to all loyal and right @-@ thinking persons ; to inflame their minds ; to provoke resentment , disorder , and violence ; and to disrupt Presidential activity and movement . It has also been argued that such threats are akin to treason and can be rightly denounced as a crime against the people as the sovereign power . Congressman Edwin Y. Webb noted , " That is one reason why we want this statute – in order to decrease the possibility of actual assault by punishing threats to commit an assault ... A bad man can make a public threat , and put somebody else up to committing a crime against the Chief Executive , and that is where the harm comes . The man who makes the threat is not himself very dangerous , but he is liable to put devilment in the mind of some poor fellow who does try to harm him . " 
 Prisoners are sometimes charged for threatening the President though they lack the ability to personally carry out such a threat . The courts have upheld such convictions , reasoning that actual ability to carry out the threat is not an element of the offense ; prisoners are able to make true threats as they could carry out the threat by directing people on the outside to harm the President . Sometimes prisoners make such threats to manipulate the system ; e.g. , a case arose in which an inmate claiming to be " institutionalized " threatened the President in order to stay in prison ; there was a case in which a state prisoner threatened the President because he wanted to go to a federal institution . 
 = = Penalties = = 
 Threatening the President of the United States is a class E felony under United States Code Title 18 , Section 871 . The offense is punishable by up to 5 years in prison , a $ 250 @,@ 000 maximum fine , a $ 100 special assessment , and 3 years of supervised release . Internet restrictions such as a prohibition on access to email have been imposed on offenders who made their threats by computer . The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set a base offense level of 12 for sending threatening communication , but when a threat to the President is involved , a 6 @-@ level " official victim " enhancement applies . Moreover , " an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential disruption of the governmental function . " Further enhancements can apply if the offender evidenced an intent to carry out the threat ( 6 @-@ level enhancement ) ; made more than two threats ( 2 @-@ level enhancement ) ; caused substantial disruption of public , governmental , or business functions or services ( 4 @-@ level enhancement ) ; or created a substantial risk of inciting others to harm federal officials ( 2 @-@ level enhancement ) . Since each 6 @-@ level increase approximately doubles the Guidelines sentencing range , it is not particularly rare for an offender who threatens the President to receive a sentence at or near the maximum , especially if he has a criminal history and / or does not qualify for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility . There is a 4 @-@ level decrease available for a threat involving a " single instance evidencing little or no deliberation " , which would usually apply to spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment verbal threats . The maximum penalty for threatening a United States judge or a Federal law enforcement officer is 10 years imprisonment — double the maximum penalty for threatening the President .

 There has been some controversy among the federal appellate courts as to how the term " willfully " should be interpreted . Traditional legal interpretations of the term are reflected by Black 's Law Dictionary 's definition , which includes descriptions such as " malicious , done with evil intent , or with a bad motive or purpose . " In <unk> v. <unk> , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a threat to the President could lead to a verdict of guilty " only if made with the present intention to do injury to the President " . Specifically , the court opined that " The word [ willfully ] often denotes an act which is intentional , or knowing , or voluntary , as distinguished from accidental . But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose ... We believe that a ' bad purpose ' assumes even more than its usual importance in a criminal prosecution based upon the bare utterance of words . " 
 Most of the other circuits have held that it is not necessary that the threat be intended to be communicated to the President or that it have tendency to influence his action . The legislative history , which contains debate over a rejected amendment that would have eliminated the words " knowingly and willfully " from the statute , reflects that the word " willfully " was included in order to avoid criminalizing behavior carried out with innocent intent ( e.g. mailing to a friend , for informational purposes , a newspaper article containing a threat to the President ) . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a threat was knowingly made if the maker comprehended the meaning of the words uttered by him . It was willingly made , if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words , the maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution .

 In the case of Watts v. United States ( 1969 ) , the United States Supreme Court ruled that mere political hyperbole must be distinguished from true threats . At a DuBois Club public rally on the Washington Monument grounds , a member of the assembled group suggested that the young people present should get more education before expressing their views . The defendant , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old , replied : 
 They always holler at us to get an education . And now I have already received my draft classification as 1 @-@ A and I have got to report for my physical this Monday coming . I am not going . If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J. 
 According to court testimony , the defendant in speaking made a gesture of sighting down the barrel of a rifle . The audience responded with laughter and applause , which the Court of Appeals would later view as potentially ominous : 
 [ I ] t has not been unknown for laughter and applause to have sinister implications for the safety of others . History records that applause and laughter frequently greeted Hitler 's predictions of the future of the German Jews . Even earlier , the Roman holidays celebrated in the Colosseum often were punctuated by cheers and laughter when the Emperor gestured thumbs down on a fallen gladiator . 
 The boy was arrested and found to be in possession of cannabis , but a Court of General Sessions Judge suppressed the cannabis because he found that there had been no probable cause for the Secret Service agents to believe the defendant 's words constituted a threat to the President . This did not prevent a federal court from convicting him for threatening the President . The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed his conviction , but the Supreme Court reversed , stating , " We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was ' a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President . ' Taken in context , and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners , we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise . " In a concurring opinion , William O. Douglas noted , " The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters ; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old , old device , outlawed by our Constitution . " 
 = = = Other cases = = = 
 Courts have held that a person is guilty of the offense if certain criteria are met . Specifically , he must intentionally make a threat in a context , and under such circumstances , that a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by persons hearing or reading it as a serious expression of an intention to harm the President . The statement must also not be the result of mistake , duress or coercion . A true threat is a serious threat and not words uttered as a mere political argument , idle talk , or jest . The standard definition of a true threat does not require actual subjective intent to carry out the threat . 
 A defendant 's statement that if he got the chance he would harm the President is a threat ; merely because a threat has been conditional upon the ability of the defendant to carry it out does not render it any less of a threat . It has been ruled that taken together , envelopes containing ambiguous messages , white powder , and cigarette butts that were mailed to the President after the 9 / 11 anthrax outbreaks conveyed a threatening message . The sending of non @-@ toxic white powder alone to the President has been deemed to be a threat . A broad statement that the President must " see truth " and " uphold Constitution " or else the letter writer will put a bullet in his head count as not expressly conditional as it does not indicate what events or circumstances will prevent the threat from being carried out . However , the statement " if I got hold of President Wilson , I would shoot him " was not an indictable offense because the conditional threat was ambiguous as to whether it was an expression of present or past intent . 
 The posting of a paper in a public place with a statement that it would be an acceptable sacrifice to God to kill an unjust President was ruled not to be in violation of the statute . The statute does not penalize imagining , wishing , or hoping that the act of killing the President will be committed by someone else . Conversely , the mailing of letters containing the words " kill Reagan " and depicting the President 's bleeding head impaled on a stake was considered a serious threat . An oral threat against the President unheard by anyone does not constitute a threat denounced by statute . 
 Since other statutes make it a crime to assault or to attempt to kill the President , some question has arisen as to whether it is necessary to have a statute banning threats . As the Georgetown Law Journal notes , " It can be argued that the punishment of an attempt against the life of the President is not sufficient ; by the time all the elements of an attempt have come into existence the risk to the President becomes too great . On the other hand , the punishment of conduct short of an attempt runs the risk of violating the established principle that intent alone is not punishable ... While ordinarily mere preparation to commit an offense is not punishable , an exception may perhaps be justified by the seriousness of the consequences of an executed threat on the President 's life . " 
 = = Psychiatric matters = = 
 According to the U.S. Attorney 's Manual , " Of the individuals who come to the Secret Service 's attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees , approximately 75 percent are mentally ill . " The Secret Service notes , " These are probably Secret Service 's most serious cases because it must be determined whether the person making the threat really wants to hurt [ Secret Service protectees ] or whether they may have some medical problems of their own , for which they need help . " It is not uncommon for judges to order psychological evaluations of defendants charged under this statute in accordance with United States federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects . Psychiatrists divide people who threaten the President into three classes : Class 1 includes persons who have expressed overt threatening statements but have made no overt action , Class 2 comprises individuals who have a history of assaultive behaviors toward authority figures , and Class 3 includes person who are considered dangerous and typically have been prosecuted under Section 871 . 
 Dilemmas related to patient confidentiality sometimes arise when a mentally ill subject makes a threat against the President . The termination of nurse Linda Portnoy was upheld after she reported such a statement to the Secret Service . The court noted that the patient was restrained and unable to act on his threats , so he wasn 't an immediate safety risk . It also considered the patient 's psychiatrist , not Portnoy , the appropriate person to assess the gravity of his threats . In a study found that in those who threaten the President , the primary differentiating variable related to lethality was " opportunity and happenstance " . Conversely , a defendant 's writings in his anger management <unk> threatening to kill the President upon the defendant 's release from the penitentiary were ruled to have fallen within the dangerous patient exception to psychotherapist @-@ patient privilege . 
 Federal law provides that the director of the facility in which a person is hospitalized due to being found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty only by reason of insanity of a Section 871 violation shall prepare annual or semiannual reports concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations about the need for his continued hospitalization ; a copy of the reports shall be submitted to the Director of the United States Secret Service to assist it in carrying out its protective duties . The Ninth Circuit ruled that it is constitutional to hold a presidential <unk> beyond Section 871 's prescribed five @-@ year statutory maximum if he is found to be dangerous and mentally ill . It is possible under federal law to hold some presidential <unk> indefinitely .

 = United Kingdom national football team = 
 No United Kingdom national football team currently exists , as there currently are separate teams representing each of the nations of the United Kingdom ( England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland ) in international football . 
 These national teams compete in the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championships and other internationals . A United Kingdom team has played in friendly matches , though never in a full FIFA international and not since 1955 . However , the United Kingdom has competed in the association football tournament at the Olympic Games , where it is represented by the Great Britain Olympic football team . 
 = = Background = = 
 When the world 's first football association , The Football Association ( FA ) , was formed in 1863 , its geographical remit was not clear : there was no specification of whether it covered just England , all of the United Kingdom , the British Empire or even the entire world . The question was answered when the Scottish Football Association ( SFA ) was founded in 1873 . 
 The third national football association , the Football Association of Wales ( FAW ) was founded in 1876 and a fourth , the Irish Football Association ( IFA ) , was founded in 1880 . Football therefore developed with separate associations and national teams for each of the countries of the United Kingdom or " Home Nations " . 
 Representative international matches between England and Scotland were played as far back as 1872 , and the Home Nations formed the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) in 1886 to co @-@ ordinate matches between their teams . FIFA was formed by non @-@ British associations in 1904 , and by 1913 the Home Nations were in FIFA and FIFA was on the IFAB . In 1921 , around the time of the partition of Ireland , the Football Association of Ireland ( FAI ) split from the IFA and disputed its authority . 
 In 1923 , an agreement between the IFAB and FIFA meant the FAI would represent the Irish Free State and the IFA Northern Ireland ; also , FIFA agreed that relationships between the Home Nations would be outside its remit . England and Scotland separately played internationals against various European teams , but the Home Nations withdrew from FIFA in 1928 , in an dispute over amateurism , and did not rejoin till 1946 , missing the first three World Cups . 
 England have been the only Home Nation to have any major success internationally , winning the 1966 World Cup . Scotland have qualified for the final tournaments of eight World Cups and two European Championships , but have never progressed beyond the group stage of any international tournament . Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup finals tournament since 1986 , and Wales since 1958 . 
 This is sometimes raised as an argument in favour of a single United Kingdom national team : based on statistical analysis . In June 2006 , it was estimated that a United Kingdom national team would have had a one @-@ third greater chance of winning the 2006 World Cup , than England did at the tournament 's outset . Opponents of the plan argue that the existing footballing identities of the fans of the Home Nations should not be sacrificed simply to stand a better chance of success . 
 There has been limited support for the creation of a permanent British national team . Although often hypothetical in nature , such a proposal has been put forward by prominent government ministers , including Jack Straw and Tony Banks . In July 2014 , after England performed poorly in the 2014 World Cup , Conservative MP Laurence Robertson submitted an early day motion , calling for a United Kingdom Football Team . 
 = = Matches = = 
 Despite this , the Home Nations have previously united to play two friendly internationals against ' Rest of Europe ' representative sides . On both occasions , they included all four Home Nations : England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . Despite Northern Ireland 's participation , both matches were played under the name of ' Great Britain ' . 
 10 May 1947 ; Hampden Park , Glasgow : Great Britain 6 – 1 Rest of Europe 
 13 August 1955 ; Windsor Park , Belfast : Great Britain 1 – 4 Rest of Europe 
 = = = 1947 : the Match of the Century = = = 
 The 1947 game , dubbed the ' Match of the Century ' , was played to celebrate the return of the Home Nations to FIFA , which they had left in 1920 . For the match , played at Scotland 's Hampden Park in front of 135 @,@ 000 spectators , the Great Britain side wore a navy blue strip in honour of the host association . The gate receipts , totalling £ 35 @,@ 000 , helped boost the finances of FIFA , which had been damaged by the lack of competition during World War II . On that occasion , the Great Britain team consisted of : 
 Frank Swift ( England ) , George Hardwick ( England ) , Billy Hughes ( Wales ) , Archie Macaulay ( Scotland ) , Jackie Vernon ( Ireland ) , Ron Burgess ( Wales ) , Stanley Matthews ( England ) , Wilf Mannion ( England ) , Tommy Lawton ( England ) , Billy Steel ( Scotland ) , Billy Liddell ( Scotland ) .

 The 1955 game was played to celebrate the Irish Football Association 's seventy @-@ fifth anniversary . For this reason , the match was held at Belfast 's Windsor Park , and the British team took to the field wearing Northern Ireland 's green strip . The Great Britain team fielded comprised : 
 Jack Kelsey ( Wales ) , Peter Sillett ( England ) , Joe McDonald ( Scotland ) , Danny Blanchflower ( Northern Ireland ) , John Charles ( Wales ) , Bertie Peacock ( Northern Ireland ) , Stanley Matthews ( England ) , Bobby Johnstone ( Scotland ) , Roy Bentley ( England ) , Jimmy McIlroy ( Northern Ireland ) , Billy Liddell ( Scotland ) . 
 = = = Other matches = = = 
 Two other games were played between Wales and a team representing the rest of the United Kingdom , with players from England , Scotland , and Northern Ireland . The first match , in 1951 , commemorated the seventy @-@ fifth anniversary of the Football Association of Wales . The second match , in 1969 , commemorated the investiture of the Prince of Wales . In both cases , the England , Scotland and Northern Ireland select team played under the name of ' Rest of the United Kingdom ' . 
 3 December 1951 ; Ninian Park , Cardiff : Wales 3 – 2 Rest of the United Kingdom 
 21 July 1969 ; Ninian Park , Cardiff : Wales 0 – 1 Rest of the United Kingdom 
 There was also a match played at Wembley in 1973 to commemorate the entry of the United Kingdom , Ireland and Denmark into the European Economic Community . This match , called " The Three " v " The Six " , involved a select team from those three countries playing against a selection of players from the original six members of the EEC : West Germany , Belgium , Netherlands , Luxembourg , France and Italy . 
 Ten of the thirteen players used by " The Three " were from the United Kingdom , with only Johnny Giles and two Danish players representing the other two countries . Henning Jensen and Colin Stein scored as The Three won 2 – 0 . 
 A Great British team lined up against another Rest of Europe XI in 1965 for Stanley Matthews ' testimonial . Europe won 6 – 4 . A Scotland XI team played a Rest of Great Britain team in a testimonial match for Alan Mullery . Scotland were defeated 3 – 2 at Craven Cottage on 22 March 1976 .

 From the 1904 Summer Olympics to the 1972 Summer Olympics , and again for the 2012 Summer Olympics , the UK has competed in either the Olympic football tournament or its qualifying competition . During the first tournament , played as a demonstration sport at the 1900 Summer Olympics but retrospectively accredited by the IOC , Upton Park F.C. represented the UK and won gold . Following this Great Britain won gold medals at the 1908 and 1912 Games . 
 All ' Great Britain ' Olympic football teams were organised by The Football Association ( FA ) with the acquiescence of the other Home Nations ' football associations , and after the FA scrapped the distinction between professional and amateur players in 1974 , no more British Olympic teams were entered . 
 Although professional players were allowed into the Olympics from 1992 , no British teams were entered because the individual home nations , rather than a unified team , participated in the qualifying competition . 
 The 2012 Summer Olympics were hosted by London , which meant that Great Britain qualified as right of being host nation . After much discussion between the Home Nations and opposition from the Northern Irish , Scottish and Welsh associations , men 's and women 's teams organised by the ( English ) FA were entered to the 2012 Olympics .

 Lee Choon Seng ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Lǐ <unk> <unk> ; Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī : Lí <unk> @-@ <unk> ; 1888 — 5 June 1966 ) was a businessman and philanthropist in pre @-@ independence Singapore . He founded several companies , cultivated rubber plantations in Malaya and started Chinese banks in the region . Lee held leadership roles in several Chinese community organisations in Singapore , notably the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( SCCCI ) , and supported Sun Yat @-@ Sen 's revolutionary cause in China . In addition , he promoted the growth of Buddhism in Singapore by setting up several Buddhist institutions , including the Singapore Buddhist Lodge , Singapore Buddhist Federation and Poh Ern Shih Temple . In 2008 , his life and contributions to society were commemorated in a memorial hall at the Ee Hoe Hean Club . 
 = = Early years and personal life = = 
 In 1888 , Lee was born in <unk> County , Fujian , China ; he had an elder stepbrother and a younger sister . To seek better fortunes , his father , Lee Lip Chai , emigrated to Negri Sembilan , Malaysia , where he started a horse @-@ drawn transport service and a provision shop , then initiated a series of charitable projects , including setting up a clan association and schools . Lee later joined his father in Negri Sembilan to help him run the family business and participate in his charitable projects . Lee grew up as a Taoist , but converted to Buddhism in adulthood , with Venerable Hong Choon , the abbot of Kong Meng San Temple , acting as his spiritual mentor . He married twice and had at least fifteen children . 
 = = Business = = 
 Lee moved to Singapore to set up another branch of his family business , called Thye Hin Limited . In Singapore , he founded Eng Hin Company , the Thye Hong Biscuit Factory and Thye Ann Investment , a property firm . He also cultivated large rubber plantations across Malaya . Realising that many newly arrived businessmen had difficulty obtaining loans from established Western banks , Lee and his business associates started several local Chinese banks , including Ho Hong Bank . In 1931 , Lee became the managing director of Ho Hong Bank and after it merged with two other banks to form the Oversea @-@ Chinese Banking Corporation ( OCBC ) , he became a director of OCBC and eventually its chairman .

 = = = Support of Sun Yat Sen = = = 
 An ardent supporter of the Kuomintang , Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat @-@ Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan , a two @-@ storey villa at Tai Gin Road . He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China . In 1937 , Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it as a historical site ; it was later handed over to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( SCCCI ) , which renovated it and turned it into a national monument , the Sun Yat Sen Villa ( now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall ) . 
 = = = Chinese community organisations = = = 
 From 1927 , Lee was actively involved with the SCCCI , initially as General @-@ Secretary , then as President . Under his leadership , the SCCCI supported the establishment of Nanyang University and convinced the British to grant citizenship to Chinese immigrants who had lived in Singapore for eight years . Lee was Chairman of the Ee Hoe Hean Club from 1933 – 1935 and 1941 – 1945 . Lee was also one of six Hokkien representatives in the Overseas Chinese Association ( OCA ) , which acted as a bridge between the Chinese community and Japanese military administration during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore . During an OCA assignment to the Endau Settlement in Malaysia , his convoy was ambushed by the Malayan People 's Anti @-@ Japanese Army and everyone in the convoy was shot . Only Lee survived , as a bullet hit a Buddhist medallion on his chest ; this inspired him to spread Buddhism in Singapore .

 During World War II , many Japanese soldiers , British soldiers and civilians died in the crossfire and bombings of the Battle of Pasir Panjang at Chwee Chian Hill . On advice from Venerable Hong Choon , Lee purchased the hill from the British colonial government , with the aim of building a Buddhist temple dedicated to the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha , to liberate the spirits of the people who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion . In 1950 , Lee incorporated the 46 @,@ 938 square feet ( 4 @,@ 360 @.@ 7 m2 ) Poh Ern Shih Temple ( Hokkien for " temple of thanksgiving " ) as a limited company without shares , and in April 1954 , he officiated its opening .

 In 1943 , the Singapore Buddhist Lodge ( <unk> ) was set up with about 100 members , mostly from the Chinese social elite .

The Lodge grew to over 2000 members by 1946 , so Zhang <unk> and Zhong Tianshui decided to rent bigger premises at 17 Kim Yam Road .

 The rate of growth of Buddhist temples and Buddhists doubled after the war , but without an umbrella organisation , each temple , headed by a chief monk or management committee , had its own way of conducting its affairs and relied on itself for financial support . Lee invited representatives from all Chinese temples to the Singapore Buddhist Lodge to discuss the formation of an umbrella organisation , and on 30 October 1949 , the Singapore Buddhist Federation was registered , with Lee elected as its chairman and Venerable Hong Choon as its vice @-@ chairman . In its first decade , its notable achievements included having Vesak Day gazetted as a public holiday in 1955 , getting government approval to set up a Buddhist cemetery of about 110 acres ( 0 @.@ 45 km2 ) at Choa Chu Kang Road and managing two schools , Maha Bodhi School and Mee Toh School .

 In the early 1930s , Lee learned that Venerable Tao <unk> wanted to restore a dilapidated Chinese temple in Sarnath ( the deer park where the Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment ) that a Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty built in the 8th century AD . Venerable Tao <unk> died before he could accomplish this task ; however , his chief disciple , Venerable Teh Yue , continued the restoration project , which Lee personally funded . Lee went on a pilgrimage to India with Venerable Teh Yue and brought along an English engineer , A. H. King , to assess and assist the restoration works . This temple still stands today in Sarnath and is called simply The Chinese Temple in Sarnath .

 = Porcelain ( song ) = 
 " Porcelain " is a song by American electronica musician Moby . It was released as the sixth single from his fifth studio album Play on June 12 , 2000 . Its melancholy lyrics describe a break @-@ up and were written by Moby – who also performs lead vocals on the track – based on his experiences with an unidentified woman . An electronic song , it also incorporates reversed string samples ( from the song " Fight for Survival " from the Exodus soundtrack ) and piano rhythms into its instrumentation . While Moby initially expressed disdain over the song and its production , he was eventually talked into including it on Play . 
 The song was well received by music critics , who praised its arrangement and named it a standout track on Play . It became one of the most successful singles from the album upon release , becoming a top five hit in the United Kingdom and managing to chart highly in several other countries . Moby later licensed " Porcelain " , along with the remainder of Play , for use in several forms of media . Two different music videos were produced for the song , directed by Jonas Åkerlund and Nick Brandt . The song has received remixes by Rob Dougan , <unk> , Torsten <unk> & Force Mass Motion . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 " Porcelain " was written and produced by Moby for his fifth studio album Play ( 1999 ) and recorded in his Little Italy , Manhattan apartment . He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman ; speaking to Billboard , he explained : " I was involved with this really , really wonderful woman , and I loved her very much . But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved . So , it 's sort of about being in love with someone but knowing you shouldn 't be with them . " Moby initially disliked the track , criticizing his production as " mushy " and his vocals as " really weak " . He had dismissed " Porcelain " as " average " and later recalled that he " couldn 't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it " – however , he was eventually talked into including it on Play . 
 Featuring vocals performed by Moby , " Porcelain " is a mid @-@ tempo , downtempo and electronica song . The song 's introspective , wistful lyrics describe " loving someone , but having to break up with them anyway . " Composed in the key of E @-@ flat major and running at a tempo of 96 beats per minute , " Porcelain " follows a constant four @-@ chord progression ( Gm − B ♭ − Fm − A ♭ ) in the B ♭ mixolydian mode , with the exception of a bridge midway through the song . Its instrumentation incorporates reversed string samples and piano rhythms . " Porcelain " also makes use of the drum machine and includes several layered elements , including vocal samples , synthesizer chords and a cello line . Pilar Basso performs additional vocals on the song .

 " Porcelain " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Alexandra Marshall of MTV called the song a " lush little snippet which sounds like a basement tape from a Magnetic Fields EP . " A writer for the Birmingham Evening Mail wrote that its " sweeping melody and atmospheric vocals " create a " distinctive soundscape " . Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media remarked that the song " tenderly glides down throats like lithium . " While commenting that Play " need [ s ] of a bit of pruning " , David Browne of Entertainment Weekly cited " Porcelain " as an exception and praised it as " gorgeous " . In their " <unk> " feature , the Daily Record described the song as " ideal for chilling out to on a summer 's evening . " Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times characterized the Play songs " Honey " and " Porcelain " as " emotional and gripping " and wrote that if " [ they ] didn 't move you ( in every sense of the word ) , then you probably had no pulse . " Playlouder named " Porcelain " the twenty @-@ sixth best single of 2000 , calling it the album 's " most crushingly heavenly track " and praising its combination of piano melodies with Moby 's " hauntingly haunted " vocals .

 The song was released as the sixth single from Play on June 12 , 2000 . Like all other songs from its parent album , it was licensed for use in several commercials , television programs and films . English film director Danny Boyle featured " Porcelain " in his 2000 film The Beach , with Moby crediting its inclusion in the film for raising awareness of the record . Other notable uses include commercials for the Volkswagen Polo , Bosch and France <unk> . " Porcelain " became one of the most successful singles from Play upon release – Moby has since referred to it as the " most signature song " on the album . It debuted at number five on the UK Singles Chart and spent a total of six weeks on the chart . The single became a top thirty hit in Ireland and Poland , where it peaked at numbers 26 and 14 respectively . " Porcelain " also managed to chart in several other European countries , including France , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland . In North America , it peaked at number 50 on the Canadian RPM singles chart and charted on the United States Billboard Adult Pop Songs , Alternative Songs and Hot Dance Club Songs charts . Liana Jonas of AllMusic wrote that the song 's commercial success " helped bring electronica music into the limelight " , calling it a " groundbreaking recording " .

 Two separate music videos were produced for " Porcelain " . The first version , directed by Jonas Åkerlund , is primarily a simple close @-@ up of a human eye ; various images are reflected onto the eye throughout the course of the video , including Moby performing the song , people smiling and a piano being played . 
 The second video , directed by Nick Brandt , features Moby sitting in the back seat of a moving car without a driver as it drives through a city , on a highway where an oncoming car with a girl in the back , looking at Moby , had to go in the other lane when the DeVille drifted into their lane . The car then left turns into a field and drives through a forest , past cattle , and finally down the hills going into the distance .

 = Francis William Reitz = 
 Francis William Reitz , Jr . ( Swellendam , 5 October 1844 – Cape Town , 27 March 1934 ) was a South African lawyer , politician , statesman , publicist , and poet who was a member of parliament of the Cape Colony , Chief Justice and fifth State President of the Orange Free State , State Secretary of the South African Republic at the time of the Second Boer War , and the first president of the Senate of the Union of South Africa . 
 Reitz had an extremely varied political and judicial career that lasted for over forty @-@ five years and spanned four separate political entities : the Cape Colony , the Orange Free State , the South African Republic , and the Union of South Africa . Trained as a lawyer in Cape Town and London , Reitz started off in law practice and diamond prospecting before being appointed Chief Justice of the Orange Free State . In the Orange Free State Reitz played an important role in the modernisation of the legal system and the state 's administrative organisation . At the same time he was also prominent in public life , getting involved in the Afrikaner language and culture movement , and cultural life in general . 
 Reitz was a popular personality , both for his politics and his openness . When State President Brand suddenly died in 1888 , Reitz won the presidential elections unopposed . After being re @-@ elected in 1895 , subsequently making a trip to Europe , Reitz fell seriously ill , and had to retire . In 1898 , now recovered , he was appointed State Secretary of the South African Republic , and became a leading Afrikaner political figure during the Second Boer War . Reluctant to shift allegiance to the British , Reitz went into voluntary exile after the war ended . Several years later he returned to South Africa and set up a law practice again , in Pretoria . In the late 1900s he became involved in politics once more , and upon the declaration of the Union of South Africa in 1910 , Reitz was chosen the first president of the Senate . 
 Reitz was an important figure in Afrikaner cultural life during most of his life , especially through his poems and other publications . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Francis William Reitz , Jr . , was born in Swellendam on 5 October 1844 , as the son of Francis William Reitz , Sr. MLC , model farmer , agriculturalist and politician , and Cornelia Magdalena <unk> . He was the seventh child in a family of twelve . He grew up at <unk> , the model farm ( Afrikaans : <unk> ) of his father , situated on the borders of the <unk> ( Broad River ) in the Cape Colony . 
 Reitz married twice . His first marriage ( Cape Town 24 June 1874 ) was to Blanka Thesen ( Stavanger , Norway , 15 October 1854 – Bloemfontein , 5 October 1887 ) . She was the sister of Charles Wilhelm Thesen , and the daughter of Arnt Leonard Thesen , tradesman , and Anne Cathrine Margarethe Brandt . The Thesen family had settled in <unk> , Cape Colony , from Norway in 1869 . The couple had seven sons and one daughter . After the death of his first wife Reitz remarried ( Bloemfontein , 11 December 1889 ) with Cornelia Maria Theresia Mulder ( Delft , Netherlands , 25 December 1863 – Cape Town 2 January 1935 ) , daughter of Johannes Adrianus Mulder , typesetter , and <unk> Johanna van Hamme . At the time of her marriage Mulder was acting director of the Eunice Ladies ' Institute at Bloemfontein . With his second wife he had six sons and one daughter . 
 <unk> , his son , fought against the British in the Second Boer War , commanded the First Battalion , Royal Scots Fusiliers during World War I and served as a Member of the Union Parliament , Cabinet Minister , Deputy Prime Minister ( 1939 – 1943 ) , and South African High Commissioner ( 1944 ) to the Court of St. James 's . His book , Commando : A Boer Journal Of The Boer War , has for many years been regarded as one of the best narratives of war and adventure in the English language . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Reitz received his earliest schooling at home , from a governess , and at a neighbouring farm . When he was nine years old , he went to the <unk> Boarding School in Rondebosch ( Cape Town ) . Here he stood out for his academic achievements and was subsequently elected Queen 's Scholar by the Senate of the South African College in Cape Town . In the six years he spent at the College , after arriving in 1857 , he received a broad education in arts and sciences , and developed himself into a well @-@ balanced young man with obvious leadership qualities . He graduated from South African College in September 1863 with the equivalent of a modern bachelor 's degree in arts and sciences . 
 By then , Reitz had developed a keen interest in law , and he continued his studies at South African College , reading law with professor F.S. <unk> . The latter 's death only months after Reitz started working with him , made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London , at the Inner Temple . It was a decision that needed deliberation , as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time , and the financial situation of the family was not strong . However , Reitz did go to London , and finished his studies successfully . He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867 . During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics , and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons . Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe . Back in South Africa , Reitz established himself as a barrister in Cape Town , where he was called to the bar on 23 January 1868 . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 In the beginning Reitz found it hard to make a living , as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time . Nevertheless , he succeeded in making a name for himself , due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence . Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time . At the same time , Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper , for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor . In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State . The discovery of diamonds on the banks of the Vaal River , Reitz thought , would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice . This was not to be , however , and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West , where he bought a small claim near <unk> from the Berlin Missionary Society . This enterprise also proved unsuccessful , and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town . This time , his Cape Town law practice was successful , ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State <unk> ( 1871 ) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony . 
 In 1873 Reitz was asked to represent the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament . The day he took his seat , 30 May , his father , who was the representative for Swellendam , announced his retirement from the Assembly . As so many of Reitz 's activities up to that point , his parliamentary career was short @-@ lived . Only two months later , President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State , despite the fact that Reitz was not fully qualified ( inter alia too young ) . Reitz refused the offer for this reason , but when another candidate also refused , Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz , and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him . 
 = = = Judge and State official in the Orange Free State = = = 
 With his appointment to the judiciary of the Orange Free State , Reitz came into his own . His arrival – now almost thirty years old and just married – in Bloemfontein in August 1874 was the start of a residency of twenty @-@ one years , as well as the start of a glowing career , to be crowned with his election as State President . 
 Before the mid @-@ 1870s , the judicial system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character , particularly because most of the judges were legally unqualified . Most of the judicial procedures were in the hands of district magistrates , the so @-@ called <unk> , whose main task was administrative . Reitz 's first task was to ameliorate this situation , which he did with much vigour . Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance , in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being . Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State . Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter , opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion , tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood in the way of the modernisation of the judicial system , but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved . As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted . This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years , acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God @-@ fearing beliefs . It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony . Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters . 
 <unk> , Reitz did much for the codification and review of the laws of the Orange Free State . With his colleagues C.J. Vels , O.J. <unk> , and J.G. Fraser Reitz published the first <unk> <unk> van den Oranje Vrijstaat ( Ordinance Book of the Orange Free State ) in 1877 , making the acts and ordinances of the republic available to the larger public . He also played a role in the revision of the constitution of the Orange Free State , with regard to articles on citizenship and the right to vote , was chairman of the examination committee for aspirant practitioners , and contributed to the improvement of the prison system and the district administration . 
 = = = State President of the Orange Free State = = = 
 Already in 1878 , voices sounded for Reitz to run for the presidency , but President Brand 's position was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him . In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State . The annexation of the South African Republic ( Transvaal ) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo @-@ Boer War of 1880 – 1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State . On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British , on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a ( reawakened ) Afrikaner national consciousness . Reitz was part of the latter , and together with <unk> <unk> , editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper , he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond ( Afrikaner Union ) , a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony , like Rev S.J. du Toit and his <unk> van <unk> Afrikaners ( ' Society of True Afrikaners ' ) and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the <unk> <unk> <unk> Vereeniging ( ' South African Boer Protection Association ' ) . Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz 's successor , M.T. Steyn , then still a young lawyer . The constitution was presented in April 1881 , and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond . His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British . It is obvious , however , that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony , which was to change Anglo @-@ Boer relations drastically . 
 In the Orange Free State President Brand was one of the politicians who held on to a more cautious and consolidating policy towards the British government at the Cape , maintaining strict neutrality . In this position Brand followed the habit of a lifetime , and it earned him a British knighthood . Despite the changing political climate and the polarisation of political positions , Brand remained hugely popular with the burghers of the Orange Free State . The presidential elections of 1883 could on content have become a political battle between the pan @-@ Dutch Afrikaner Bond supporters and followers of the Brand @-@ line . However , Reitz , as the ideal pan @-@ Dutch candidate , again refused to stand against Brand . Only when Brand died in office five years later , the time was ripe for change . Reitz stood candidate and won a landslide victory on the ticket of Afrikaner nationalism . He was inaugurated as state president in the <unk> ( Two @-@ Towers Church ) in Bloemfontein on 10 January 1889 . 
 As president Reitz was one of the first Afrikaners to actively develop a so @-@ called Bantu policy , in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black . Under his government Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State ( 1890 ) . This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town , in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established . 
 In economic terms , the late 1880s were a period of growth in the Orange Free State . Agriculture picked up , and the railway system became an important source of income as well . Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming , propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues . Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him . 
 Under Reitz 's presidency the new meeting hall for the Volksraad , the so @-@ called <unk> <unk> ( Fourth Council Hall ) was opened ( 1893 ) , and the new Government Building received a second floor ( 1895 ) . Outside Bloemfontein the road network received attention . 
 As could be expected , immediately after he was inaugurated , Reitz contacted the government of the South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties . Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom . Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow . Even earlier , in January 1889 , the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic . On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former . The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein ( 1890 ) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg ( 1892 ) , directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy . For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal : the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa . 
 Reitz 's policies were appreciated by the Volksraad , reflecting the change in the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism . Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz 's candidature with a vote of forty @-@ three against eighteen . Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe . On 22 November 1893 he was re @-@ elected , again with a landslide majority . 
 The trip to Europe was far from just a family holiday . In Britain Reitz made some strong public statements , defending the republican system of government in South Africa and opposing British intervention in ' Bantu affairs ' . On the continent Reitz was received by several heads of state and political leaders . In October 1894 he returned in Bloemfontein . Soon after Reitz was diagnosed with hepatitis , which moreover affected his already strained nerves and led to sleeplessness . The situation was so serious that he eventually had to resign the presidency . The Volksraad accepted his resignation on 11 December 1895 . 
 In June 1896 Reitz travelled to Europe once more on a five @-@ month trip to recover from his debilitating illness . On his return to South Africa he established himself in Pretoria in the South African Republic in July 1897 , where he set up a new law practice . 
 = = = State Secretary of the South African Republic = = = 
 Reitz did not stay a private person for long . A conflict between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice . Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly became part of the inner circle of the Transvaal administration . At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position . One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds , who had the Dutch nationality , with a South African . Leyds was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad . Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898 , after Abraham Fischer had declined . 
 As State Secretary Reitz had a complicated and hefty job . After the State President he was the most important member of the Executive Council ( <unk> Raad ) . As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations , as well as for all the correspondence of the President , official government reports , etc . He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament , the First and Second Volksraad , and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State . Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus , by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments , appointing an archivist for his own , and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch . 
 The State President of the South African Republic , Paul Kruger , was not an easy man to work with , and in some circles it was predicted that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger . This was not the case , however . On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy , but Reitz remained true to his own convictions , gaining some influence over Kruger in the process . Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy , their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence . Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements , so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state , the British jumped on him . 
 In view of rapidly mounting British pressure and an ensuing armed conflict over the position of the <unk> and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields , foreign policy in the South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate : State President Kruger , State Secretary Reitz , and State Attorney General J.C. Smuts . During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward , despite the risks this entailed . Reitz sought and received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach . On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands . 
 The British government did not give in to the ultimatum , and two days later , on 11 October 1899 , the Second Anglo @-@ Boer War ( South African War ) broke out . When the British army marched on Pretoria in May 1900 , the government was forced to flee the capital . From that moment on , Reitz was responsible for the continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal , which occurred sixty @-@ two times until March 1902 . In May of that year , Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British , and he was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging , signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902 . 
 = = = Self @-@ chosen exile and return to politics = = = 
 Although instrumental in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging , Reitz personally did not want to swear allegiance to the British government , and he chose to go into exile . On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands . To alleviate his financial troubles , Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States . Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that the war was over , the tour failed , forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands . Here his health failed him again , leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing . During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid @-@ Afrikaansche Vereeniging ( Dutch South @-@ African Society ) . 
 In 1907 , after the old Boer republics received self @-@ government , and in the run @-@ up to the formation of the Union of South Africa , leading Afrikaner politicians J.C. Smuts and L. Botha asked Reitz to return to South Africa and play a role in politics again . Together with his wife , he established himself in Sea Point , Cape Town . In 1910 , already sixty @-@ six years old , he was appointed president of the Senate of the newly formed Union of South Africa . 
 These were no easy years , again , as former Afrikaner compatriots found each other on two sides of the political fence , in a rapidly changing world . As in his earlier life , Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions , which he aired freely . As such , he came into conflict with the Smuts government , and in 1920 he was not re @-@ appointed as president of the Senate . He did remain a member of that House until 1929 , however . 
 = = = Honours and death = = = 
 As an important public figure , Reitz was honoured and remembered in different ways . In 1923 Reitz the University of Stellenbosch bestowed on him an honorary doctorate in law for his public services . Already in 1889 , a village was named after him in the Orange Free State . In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife , Cornelia . A ship named after him , the President Reitz , sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947 . The Jubilee Diamond , found in the Free State village of <unk> in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond , but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897 . 
 When he finally retired from public life , Reitz moved to Gordon 's Bay , but returned to Cape Town several years later , where he had a house in <unk> and was taken care of by his daughter Bessie , a medical doctor . He remained active to the end with writing and translating . Reitz died at his house <unk> on 27 March 1934 , and received a state funeral three days later , with a funeral service at the Grote Kerk . He was buried at the <unk> cemetery at Maitland . 
 = = = Cultural figure = = = 
 Reitz was an important figure in Afrikaner cultural life . He was a poet , and published many poems in Afrikaans , making him a progenitor of the development of Afrikaans as a cultural language . As such he sympathised with the <unk> van <unk> Afrikaners ( Society of Real Afrikaners ) , established in the Cape Colony in 1875 . Although he never became a member himself , he was an active contributor to the society 's journal , Die Suid @-@ Afrikaansche Patriot . With his literary work , Reitz was solidly anchored in the so @-@ called First Afrikaans Language Movement , although he was less interested in the didactic drive of that movement than in writing in Afrikaans as a purely cultural activity . Much of his work was based on English texts , which he translated , edited , and adapted . In the process he produced completely new works of art . 
 For Reitz , Afrikaans was predominantly a language of culture , not of government , where he propagated the use of the official language of the Boer republics , Dutch . During his presidency of the Orange Free State , where the use of English was significant among the burghers , he strongly promoted the use of Dutch , against politicians like John G. Fraser and others who were in favour of English . 
 <unk> , Reitz promoted the foundation of the <unk> en <unk> Vereeniging ( Literary and Scientific Society ) of the Orange Free State , of which he was chairman for a while , the library at Bloemfontein , and the National Museum of the Orange Free State .
